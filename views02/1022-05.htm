<p>The Weather Channel has that "Weather on the Eights" feature, the local forecast 
that comes on at eight minutes past the hour and repeats at 10-minute intervals. 
<p> We had something similar in Beirut after 1975. It was something like "Sniper 
on the Eights," a regular radio report on Voice of Lebanon that gave us the latest 
on sniper activity in the city as if it were a weather or traffic report, which 
is actually what it was. We listened to the radio before going anywhere to know 
what streets were safe and what streets were "hot," as the usually female, usually 
sultry voice on the radio described it, meaning nothing sultry by "hot," obviously. 
<p> Snipers very quickly became the roving demons of the Lebanese Civil War. They 
were mercenaries with no conscience or convictions. They took up posts on rooftops 
and accepted paychecks from whichever side paid best. It was a job that promised 
plenty of work and no chance of unemployment. They had their favorite haunts -- 
bridges, major crossings, the so-called "Ring" highway that was Beirut's equivalent 
of a crosstown expressway, and which was the inaugural Highway of Death (by 1980 
even dirt roads and back alleys were highways of death in Lebanon). 
<p> They slouched in their sandbagged nests like the lethal dregs they were, alone 
or in teams of twos, drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes (preferably American), 
reading paperbacks, murdering civilians. A handful could paralyze the whole city. 
<p> Their kills were tallied in the morning paper in bullet form. It was an unintentional 
visual pun that sometimes took up two or three columns, because it also included 
the kidnappings and the throat-slashings of the day before. So Beirut's equivalent 
of a crime blotter was made up of the finds of young mothers or elderly men with 
bullets in the head, of children who'd bled to death where they'd been playing 
moments before, of the occasional victory bullet listing the kill of a sniper. 
<p> I read these accounts with more fascination than fear. I was 10. The smell 
of newsprint and the coolness of the sentences in their linear layout immunized 
me from the magnitude of what I was reading about. It made the accounts seem more 
like edgy adventure stories than tallies of atrocities a neighborhood away. Sickening 
to think of it now, but I looked forward to those accounts. Blame it on the immaturity 
of a 10-year-old who'd yet to realize the difference between the prurient thrill 
of war stories and the indiscriminate brutality of the real thing. I'd like to 
think that I know better today. 
<p> Watching the reaction to the Washington area sniper in the last couple of 
weeks, it's as if that immature 10-year-old was at the media's controls, playing 
up the story's prurience as if it were a multipart series with the promise of 
daily installments. The major newsmagazines are mythologizing the sniper ("I Am 
God," in red letters on U.S. News & World Report's cover) and playing into his 
Tarot-trap of death cards (Newsweek dubs him "The Tarot Card Killer"). The news 
networks have serialized him in the language of promos and logos. CNN's is "A 
trail of terror." CBS has a hurricane-like track-the-killer map. User-friendly, 
too. 
<p> To be fair, that's how most news reporting is done these days. Whether it's 
the assault on Tora Bora or the flooding of subdivisions in Louisiana, the stuff 
is packaged as a reality show no more or less momentous than the prime-time lineup 
that follows it. It's an interactive entertainment. Only this time, in a remarkable 
leap over the conventional image-makers, the scripts have been inspired less by 
Hollywood than the Web's many and furtive sniper sites. 
<p> Like other fringe elements the Internet has congealed into charter-certified 
hobbies -- weekend survivalists, Confederate hold-outs, warriors without a cause 
-- the sniper sites form a thriving subculture of arrested adolescence camouflaged 
as something "noble," "heroic," "an art and science" practiced by "heroes of unrecognized 
proportions, doing a hard, miserable job in the name of the people they have sworn 
to protect," to quote from a couple of home pages. From there newscasters have 
cribbed phrases like "one shot one kill," "precision ammo," "stalk and kill" and 
other catch phrases to dress up their teleprompters in knowingness. It's as if 
the news were wearing a pair of designer shades. The result is as divorced from 
reality as a dandy in a slum. 
<p> Maybe we should be thankful for the imbecility of the coverage. It is blameless 
in that there is no frame of reference for that kind of terrorism on American 
soil other than the Web. The language to explain it must come from somewhere while 
shock matures into understanding. The designer shades are a protective mechanism. 
That, anyway, is the optimistic view. 
<p> The less optimistic view is that the reaction to the sniper's murder spree 
points to an obstinate belief in inalienable safety. Mayhem as we know it can 
always be narrowed down to a target and excised like a tumor, a one-size-fits-all 
sort of "regime change" from tyrants to snipers. That kind of fantasy should have 
expired with Sept. 11. It seems instead to have hardened into a hazardous illusion 
of invulnerability. Look only for the distance between those adolescent Web sites 
and the White House's paint-ball mentality. There is none. That imbecility, which 
will outlast the sniper's terror, we can't afford.
