<p>Perhaps Henry Kissinger will escape final (on-this-earth) 
judgement. No trial for war crimes. No public shunning for his 
lying ways. No disinvitation from <I> Nightline</I>. Three judges 
in three different countries (Chile, France, Spain) have recently 
targeted him for questioning in cases involving human rights 
abuses in Chile in the 1970s, and Chilean human rights victims are 
suing him in the United States. (Kissinger directed the secret US 
program that aimed to overthrow the democratically-elected 
Salvador Allende in Chile and then supported the murderous 
regime of the military tyrants who mounted a coup against 
Allende.) But so far he has not had to enter the dock. He 
continues to pontificate freely about US foreign policy on op-ed 
pages and during media appearances. 
</p>
<p>
But his public career appears to be ending on an ugly note. On 
Friday, the former Secretary of State removed himself as head of 
the commission created to study the failures of 9/11. Three days 
later, Bush chose former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, a 
moderate, well-regarded Republican not known for possessing much 
insight or experience related to national security, as Kissinger's 
replacement. President 
George W. Bush had selected Kissinger the Wednesday before 
Thanksgiving in a give-them-the-finger move aimed at the Democrats 
and the 9/11 family members who had pushed, over White House 
objections, for the commission. Bush and Vice President Dick 
Cheney had agreed to the commission's formation, only after 
winning 
concessions granting the president the right to name the head of 
the commission and ensuring that subpoenas could only be issued 
with the approval of six of the commission's ten members. With the 
panel divided evenly between Republicans and Democrats, that meant 
the White House would not have to worry about Democrats on their 
own issuing demands for (possibly embarrassing) information from 
the White House concerning what Bush and his aides knew of the al 
Qaeda threat before 9/11 and how they had responded. To further 
protect the White House, Republicans have resisted the families' 
call for apppointing former Senator Warren Rudman, who previously 
co-chaired a national commission on terrorism, to the panel. 
Though a 
Republican, Rudman has a maverick streak and might sign on to 
subpoenas proposed by Democrats. Kean, by the way, is no Rudman.
</p>
<p>
Kissinger, an international consultant for transnational 
corporations, claimed he was forced to retreat to avoid a nasty 
fight over disclosing his clients. After Bush tapped Kissinger, 
much of the fuss over his appointment concerned his business 
ties--not his record as a prevaricator, his embrace of human 
rights-abusing regimes, or his experiences as a practitioner of 
secret warfare and a stonewaller. Kissinger maintained he has no 
clients--such as overseas governments or foreign firms--that would 
compromise his supposed independence. But that was not the point. 
Kissinger pockets millions of dollars advising US-based 
corporations looking to do business overseas, sometimes in 
countries where the government controls what firms receive what 
contracts. Consequently, Kissinger has a strong personal interest 
in maintaining friendly relations with foreign governments. If he 
is assisting US companies eager to do business in Saudi Arabia, 
could he be the independent-minded chair of a commission that 
might have to examine the role of the Saudi government in 
encouraging (or curtailing) terrorism? That is why it was 
important for the public to see his client list.
</p>
<p>
Kissinger tried to skirt the disclosure laws by telling the 9/11 
families he would reveal his clients to a third party chosen by 
the relatives, an intermediary who would keep the names secret. 
And the White House tried to rescue the appointment by declaring 
Kissinger an executive branch appointment not subject to 
legislative disclosure requirements. (At one point, Kissinger or 
administration officials indicated to the 9/11 families that he 
would only be working one day a week on the commission and, thus, 
as a part-timer would be exempt from disclosure requirements.) 
None of the ruses worked. After the Senate Ethics Committee 
rebuffed White House pressure and released a legal opinion stating 
that all members of the commission would have to disclose their 
business connections, Kissinger bailed. (Former Senator George 
Mitchell, chosen by the Democrats to be vice-chair of the panel, 
had already withdrawn, citing time constraints and an 
unwillingness to take a leave from his law firm. Former 
Representative Lee Hamilton, who went into think-tankery instead 
of 
bucks-chasing after leaving public office, took Mitchell's spot.)
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, Kissinger allowed private-sector enrichment 
to trump public service. His business was more important than 
answering the president's call. Of course, he was the wrong man 
for a job--a proven liar, a fan of government secrecy, a sycophant 
with no record of challenging presidents, a longtime coddler of 
state terrorists. All that aside, he was not willing to sacrifice 
for his country. Kissinger allies asserted he had signed 
confidentiality agreements with his clients and was not free to 
disclose the deals. But he could have asked these corporations for 
permission to name them, arguing that in these unusual 
circumstances such a step was necessary for the good of the 
nation. He also reportedly feared that, even if he made his 
clientele list public, his critics would have hounded him until he 
sold his firm. Administration officials told reporters Kissinger, 
in the words of <I> The New York Times</I>, "decided that severing 
his ties to his company was too big a price to pay for returning 
to public service."
</p>
<p>
Kissinger's greed is the nation's gain. His appointment was an 
insult both to citizens who deserve accountability from their 
government and to the 9/11 families who still yearn for answers. 
Yet this episode exposed Kissinger's true concerns. It may well 
be the last chapter in his public life; if so, it is a fitting end 
to a career of perverted values. And perhaps he has unwittingly 
served the public. His controversial selection and his 
less-than-noble departure brought much-needed public 
attention to the panel. Kissinger is gone, but, after all, the 
White House's desire for a controllable commission remains. </p>
