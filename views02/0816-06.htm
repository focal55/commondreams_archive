<p>Barbara Lee was right, and who confirmed it? Rush Limbaugh, of all people. 
<P>Limbaugh, in his role as constitutional scholar, wrote an op-ed piece in Tuesday's 
Wall Street Journal titled "Congress already OKd Iraq War." 
<P>He was referring to the Sept. 14 joint resolution of Congress, which authorized 
the president to "use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, 
organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided 
the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001." 
<P>Lee, the Democratic congresswoman from Oakland, was the only member of Congress 
to vote against that resolution, and for that she was called a traitor and received 
death threats from all over the country. The thoughtful UC Berkeley political 
scientist Nelson Polsby chided Lee, telling Newsweek that it was just "a feel-good 
vote, not an appropriation." 
<P>Now Lee appears to have been a seer, and the vote of Congress was the worst 
kind of appropriation -- a blank check. 
<P>"It was a blank check to the president to attack anyone involved in the Sept. 
11 events -- anywhere, in any country, without regard to our nation's long-term 
foreign policy, economic and national security interests, and without time limit," 
wrote Lee in The Chronicle on Sept. 23. "In granting these overly broad powers, 
the Congress has failed its responsibility to understand the dimensions of its 
declaration." 
<P>-- -- -- -- 
<P>ELEVEN MONTHS LATER, as we listen to the drumbeat for war against Iraq, many 
who called Lee a traitor want to put a hold on blank checks. According to a Washington 
Post-ABC News poll, three quarters of the American people think Bush should seek 
the approval of Congress before going to war with Iraq. 
<P>Where were they when Barbara Lee was voting "no" all alone? 
<P>One of Lee's heroes, the late Republican Sen. Wayne Morse of Oregon, was one 
of two senators to vote against the 1964 resolution that allowed the United States 
to go to war in Vietnam. Morse said, "I don't know why we think, just because 
we're mighty, we have the right to try to substitute might for right." 
<P>Morse wasn't a relative, but I'm proud to say I met him. 
<P>-- -- -- -- 
<P>BEFORE WE LAUNCH into an orgy of remembrance of Sept. 11, we should remember 
how angry we felt in the days thereafter and where that anger has taken us. A 
resolute Bush administration assuaged some of that anger by destroying the Taliban 
regime in Afghanistan, and good riddance. 
<P>Now we're on the brink of an invasion of Iraq, a country with fewer known connections 
to al Qaeda than Saudi Arabia. 
<P>As an angry nonpacifist, I would have been happy to turn the cheek of Osama 
bin Laden and put a bullet in his ear. I had my doubts about Lee, who once proposed 
a "Department of Peace." But the cries of "traitor" made me think we were living 
in dangerous times, even in the Bay Area, the only place in the country where 
Lee could be re-elected. 
<P>The White House invasion talk continues, despite the fact that the United States 
has no international coalition to wage war on Iraq, much less a way to get tanks 
there to engage Saddam Hussein's tanks. 
<P>Bush couldn't even get Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani to come to a meeting 
of Iraqi dissidents. The Kurds are doing fine, without being recruited once again 
as cannon fodder for American interests. As for the British, Gerald Kaufman of 
the Labor Party wrote in the Spectator that there is broad opposition in Parliament 
to an American strike in Iraq. 
<P>"Bush, himself the most intellectually backward American president of my political 
lifetime, is surrounded by advisers whose bellicosity is exceeded only by their 
political, military and diplomatic illiteracy," wrote Kaufman, with British understatement. 
<P>Hussein, on the other hand, has a coalition to forestall a U.S. invasion, and 
it even includes Iraq's traditional enemy, Iran. As for weapons of mass destruction, 
the Iraqi leader is most likely to use them if he is about to be overthrown. Let's 
hope Bush is engaging in a Texas-size bluff. 
<P>If anything, it's good old American domestic self-interest that will keep the 
Bush war machine from rolling. We don't like the prospect of gas lines and, 
<P>even though a majority of Americans support an invasion of Iraq, only a minority 
does if invasion means "significant" U.S. casualties. 
<P>We're a nation of chicken hawks, and never mind that canary in the mine shaft 
named Barbara Lee.</p>
