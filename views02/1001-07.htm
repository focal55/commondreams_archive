<p> Sunday night, way up in the nosebleed section of the digital dial on MSNBC, 
I was thrilled to land on a rerun of the news conference that Michael Moore (<i>Roger 
& Me</i>, <i>Stupid White Men</i>) gave at the Toronto International Film Festival 
to promote his newest documentary <i>Bowling For Columbine</i>, which borrows 
its title from the horrible high school massacre in Colorado in 1999.
<P></P>
(No, MSNBC wasn't actually running the news conference. Rogers, which had taped 
it during the fest for telecast on its "community" Channel 10, was merely subbing 
regular MSNBC programming with the newser in order to fulfill its CanCon commitments 
for carrying the channel in Canada. But that's another column.)
<P></P>
Moore, who seems to be more at home here than in his native U.S.A., was defending 
his polemical film about guns and the American psyche, a film that won a special 
jury prize at Cannes — here it also earned a sustained 13-minute ovation from 
the audience.
<P></P>
Moore complained that American critics had not given <i>Bowling For Columbine 
</i>the attention it deserves, that nobody had reported that the country's largest 
theatre chain, which is based in Colorado, has refused to exhibit the film when 
it opens later this month.
<P></P>
Big surprise. Moore's anti-corporate, left-liberal films, TV shows and books tend 
not to play well with the corporate, conservative media. For example, his <i>Stupid 
White Men</i>, which was almost shredded by the publisher last fall for being 
patriotically incorrect, has been on all the bestseller lists for nearly a year 
— but has yet to be reviewed by The New York Times and other major papers. His 
last TV series, <i>The Awful Truth</i>, was made in Canada, by the Halifax-based 
Salter Street Films, which also co-financed <i>Columbine</i>.
<P></P>
I can count on one hand the number of times I have seen him onscreen on U.S. TV 
since <i>Stupid White Men </i>became a hit. And yet, Ann Coulter, his polar opposite 
both physically and politically, is seen all over the dial screeching the same 
half-truths she wrote in her best-selling screed <i>Slander: Liberal Lies About 
The American Right</i>.
<P></P>
Is it just because she has better legs than Moore that she gets all this exposure, 
including a substitute hosting gig on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>? Or is it because, 
contrary to her contention and that of many readers who have e-complained about 
my "left-wing ravings" and The Star's "commie" slant, the liberal media ain't 
so liberal?
<P></P>
Sure, there are islands in the market-might-is-right media ocean. On the magazine 
racks, you'll find <i>Harper's</i> and <i>The Nation</i>, to name two of the few. 
The Internet is blessedly filled with alternative sites. In Canada, we can count 
on CBC and TVO not to always run everything through the is-this-good-for-the-market 
filter. But, in the U.S., aside from NPR (National Public Radio), there's not 
much, not even PBS.
<P></P>
That's right: Not even PBS.
<P></P>
Consider how, last month, even the much respected Jim Lehrer gave Defense Secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld a free pass, never challenging him when he repeatedly fudged the 
facts. For example, Rumsfeld reiterated the Bushist propaganda about how Saddam 
Hussein "threw the (U.N. weapons) inspectors out" — when, in fact, they were pulled 
out.
<P></P>
Last spring PBS ran a superb six-hour documentary titled <i>Commanding Heights: 
The Battle For The World Economy</i>, based on the book by Daniel Yergin and Joseph 
Stanislaw. It's an unabashed appreciation of the free market, a tribute to Margaret 
Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, Milton Friedman and their inspiration, Nobel Prize-winning 
economist Friedrich von Hayek. So one-sided is it that The Wall Street Journal 
headlined its review of it "PBS Likes Capitalism More Than the Commercial Networks 
Do," calling it a "paean to private enterprise." This series was not only originally 
co-funded by Enron, it ran just as the markets were imploding and CEOs were getting 
busted for being too free of regulation.
<P></P>
Meanwhile, I can list dozens of provocative and prize-winning films PBS will not 
run, including Danny Schechter's <i>Counting On Democracy</i>, about the scandalous 
2000 vote in Florida. Schechter, an Emmy-winning TV journalist, author and weblogger 
(<i><a href="http://www.mediachannel.org" target="_new">http://www.mediachannel.org</a></i>), 
says PBS rejected it because it is "biased." Instead, it will air <i>Who Counts? 
</i>— a political special starring <i>Saturday Night Live </i>alumnus Darrell 
Hammond doing his Al Gore impersonation. 
<P></P>
One PBS show that does get behind the news is <i>Now With Bill Moyers</i>. To 
watch it, I tape it Sundays at dawn — off KCTS in Seattle. That's because, like 
many other PBS stations, WNED in Buffalo doesn't air it. 
<P></P>
So much for the liberal media. Which is why I root for Michael Moore even when 
he goes over the top and/or edge.
<P></P>
Maybe his next film should take on CNN.
