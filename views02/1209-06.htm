<p>The really singular thing about the coming war with Iraq is the phrase just 
employed, the "coming war with Iraq."  If I've read it once, I've read it a 
thousand times.  Like Gulf War I, Gulf War II became a given the moment it 
left a Bush tongue and went to press.  There has since been abundant 
speculation on what will happen when (not if) we invade, and on what we will 
do after (not if) we fight the war.  There has not been so much as a 
speculative peep about what we will do when we refrain from invading Iraq, 
what we will do after we've poured our best energy, thought, diplomatic 
verve, and money into avoiding a war with Iraq, or similar notions of 
inconceivable heresy.

<p>The tone of the media and the tone out of Washington have remained 
unswervingly hopeful -- for an invasion that is.  If only those feckless and 
annoying UN inspectors will hurry up and either A) Find something, or B) Not 
find something, we can (C) Get on with the bombing.  While we're waiting, 
we've stepped up the bombing of Iraq’s southern no-fly zone and quietly 
overseen the movement of a quarter million troops to the Gulf and the 
establishment there of command centers and bases.  The world may not be 
entirely blamed for wondering whether America's energies are dedicated more 
to the prevention or to the invention of war.

<p>So what will happen when (not if) we invade Iraq?  In the first place, we 
will win.  There has been no speculation at all about what we will do 
if/when we hit a stalemate or lose.  In the second place, we will effect a 
regime change.  Saddam Hussein will be extinguished like a rogue cigar butt 
and all will be well.  If not, recent experience suggests we can simply wave 
a magic wand, change captions on CNN, take a big collective blink, issue a 
pronouncement that one man isn't all that important, and proceed to bomb 
Somalia.  Something else that will occur when (not if) we invade Iraq, is 
that people will die – a point some in the media have been acknowledging 
with something like excited anticipation.  How many deaths?  Between a 
thousand and ten thousand, according to the punditry.  Or put another way, 
an “acceptable figure”.  That’s Us.  What about Them?  If the kill ratio is 
as skewed as it was in Gulf War I, somewhere between a million and ten 
million of Them would be shorn of their lives.   That figure is probably 
extreme.  But in any case, if you consider it unacceptable it may help to 
consider that we have nothing against the people who will die when (not if) 
we invade Iraq, and that the blame for their deaths can be laid squarely on 
one anachronistic dictator.  And what will happen after (not if) we invade 
Iraq?  There have been hints of a protectorate or military occupation or...  
But we can afford to be vague, as it seems a safe bet there will be someone 
around to drape a green robe on who can run the place for us, and some kids 
available to fly kites for CNN.  Then off to North Korea or Iran or Canada, 
or whatever other threat to American democracy needs fixing.

<p>There are several things I would like to see happen in the "coming war with 
Iraq", since the possibility of its not coming at all is apparently not an 
option.  For starters, I would like to see us pick an appropriate name.  
Operation Just Cuz, as unbelievers in the State Department dubbed it, was 
used already back in Panama, so that's out.  Operation Nothing Against the 
Iraqi People seems too long.  Operation Finite Justice might serve as a 
relatively modest variant to last year's Infinite Justice, though Operation 
All-Too-Human has perhaps the homier feel.  I tend to like Operation 
Whatever.  It's just vague enough to suit our intentions, and flexible too – 
if we have to abruptly shift gears and bomb Iceland or Sierra Leone, at 
least we won’t be groping for a name.   To reflect the moral rectitude we 
claim to carry into Iraq when (not if) we invade it, I would like to further 
propose that our tanks be fitted with armored bumper stickers that read 
'What Would Jesus Drive?'  Appropriate stickers could be adapted to all 
branches of the invading force. 'What Would Jesus Drop?' might bring comfort 
to the pilots, for instance.

<p>Come to think of it, what would Jesus do?  It does not seem at all 
far-fetched to suppose that if a party of conspiring hawks was to approach 
and bait him with the question of what to do about Saddam Hussein, Jesus 
would respond by bending down and writing with his finger on the ground.  If 
he chose to speak, it might be to say, “Let him who is without sin among you 
launch the first strike.”  And the party of conspiring hawks would retreat 
murmuring and conspiring to their offices and board rooms to pray for a 
certain someone’s death by lethal injection, crucifixion being too 
unsophisticated for this civilized age.

<p>I guess it was unsophisticated of my parents to teach me that war is a 
mistake, and of me to take them seriously.  Yet I doubt I’m alone in 
thinking that war is less often an indication of rightness, righteousness, 
courage, or historical necessity than an indication of failure.  We might 
try, just for a second, to regard Gulf War I as a screw-up.  While it 
offered some Americans an unprecedented occasion to gloat, it also put the 
anti-American burr up Al Qaida’s backside, culminated in an abattoir of 
100,000 dead in 100 hours, and accomplished nothing so certain as the 
present sequel.   Of course, like all mistakes, wars happen.  If they happen 
as a last resort, at least there is that – you can say you tried.  If they 
happen as a first resort, it is a sign of foolishness, avarice, malice, or 
false pride.  The prospect of war casualties should prompt far more from us 
than eager speculation on an “acceptable figure”.  “Was it for this the clay 
grew tall?” asked Wilfred Owen, in reference to the youthful lives thrown 
away in World War I.  The media do not address that bitter question, 
suggesting instead that any lives lost when (not if) we invade Iraq are an 
inevitability.  To think of a human life, whether one of Ours or one of 
Theirs, wasted because the Bushes and Hussains couldn’t work things out is 
cause for something other than this anticipatory air of countdown.</p>
