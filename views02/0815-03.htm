<p>Opponents of an assault on Iraq assume that the US will not try to get endorsement 
from the UN security council. In fact, not only is the US likely to ask for security 
council support, but it will probably get it. To avoid being wrong-footed by such 
a move, opponents of the war need a much more comprehensive policy for containing 
American fundamentalism. Just saying "Stop the war" is not enough. 
<P>The Bush team has a long history of managing international opinion and getting 
its own way. Key officials including Dick Cheney, Colin Powell and Condoleeza 
Rice were in office when the Soviet Union collapsed, Germany was unified and the 
Gulf war was won. Nowadays they see their duty as being to eliminate the axis 
of evil. 
<P>Even under President Clinton's weak leadership in foreign policy, the US was 
able to bring its allies into line over bombing in Bosnia and Kosovo, and neither 
China nor Russia used their veto powers. This is how the US "playbook" for managing 
international opinion runs. At first, US policy appears lonely and extreme. The 
debate is constructed around the idea that the US does not want to be restricted 
by the UN, which is indeed true. When the US magnanimously decides that it will 
accept some form of UN blessing, there is a carefully orchestrated sigh of relief 
that America is returning to the multilateral fold. 
<P>Britain will be first in line to agree. Russia, which has no interest in a 
direct confrontation with the US and needs its economic support, including membership 
of the World Trade Organization, will quickly follow. Without Russian opposition, 
France will not want to use its veto. China has a consistent policy of abstention. 
<P> It is never quite this simple and events can upset the best laid plans, but 
on issue after issue the US has managed to strike deals and intimidate other states 
into supporting UN resolutions. Some of the non-permanent members of the security 
council will be keen to help the US. Bulgaria wants Nato membership; Colombia 
is reliant on Washington in its civil war; Norway has a conservative government 
and is anxious not to upset its guarantor against neighboring Russia; Mexico and 
Ireland have strong economic dependence on the US. 
<P>This leaves Syria, Cameroon, Guinea and Singapore. The US will therefore be 
able to find a majority of positive votes with a few abstentions. Indeed, of the 
total of 15 security council members (five permanent and 10 temporary) the US 
may even now be able to count on eight votes just by dragging the weak temporary 
members into line. 
<P>Further pretexts for action may be found. UN inspectors may go in, may have 
full access and may let everyone off the hook. However, it is likely that some 
real or exaggerated facts will be brought out, or enough of a provocation made 
to Iraq that it expels the inspectors. 
<P>Many commentators and politicians will be so grateful for some kind of UN resolution 
that they will pay little attention to what is in it. Some voices will point out 
that it will doubtless fall far short of the traditional UN language authorizing 
war. In this circumstance many people who oppose the attack on Iraq and are generally 
opposed to the havoc the Bush administration is wreaking with the international 
system will be left high and dry. MPs who have signed Alice Mahon's carefully 
moderate early day motion calling for UN support as a prerequisite to any attack 
will have found that they have trapped themselves into support for a UN-sponsored 
war. 
<P>I hope I am wrong. But at a minimum Labour supporters accustomed to the most 
arcane politics of resolutions and procedures should begin, as no doubt the Russians 
and Chinese are already, to calculate what price Washington must pay for its war. 
<P>A good start will be to insist that the UN resolution at the time of the 1991 
Gulf War ceasefire is adhered to in full. The ceasefire resolution stated the 
importance of "all available means" being used to achieve a wide-ranging list 
of objectives including a nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction free zone 
in the Middle East, control of armaments in the region, a stronger biological 
weapons convention, universal adherence to the chemical weapons convention and 
the obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. 
<P>In short, the ceasefire resolution of 1991 placed further action against Iraq 
in the context of a global system for the management and elimination of armaments. 
That objective has been discarded. It should remain the basis of a modern international 
security strategy. There are many in the US who oppose the fundamentalist policies 
of the present White House team. We need to forge stronger links with them to 
begin to craft a strategy of containment.
