<p>EVERYONE WHO has watched television or read the paper in the last few days 
has been told repeatedly how liberal and outspoken was the late Sen. Paul Wellstone. 
<P> We have been reminded of his controversial votes in 1996 on welfare reform 
and, more recently, his &quot;no&quot; vote on a congressional resolution authorizing 
an attack on Iraq. Stories have abounded of his combative and fiery rhetoric. 
We have witnessed political allies and foes praise his principled behavior as 
a U.S. senator. Even President Bush had a kind word. 
<P> But there has been little talk about what may be Paul Wellstone&#39;s most 
lasting legacy. 
<P> Long after the tributes are through and tomorrow&#39;s election is over and 
the pundits argue what effect Mr. Wellstone&#39;s death had on which party gained 
control of the Senate, there will still be scores of men and women like myself 
who will continue his work. We are Paul&#39;s Carleton College students, and we 
form a small army of progressive professionals throughout the United States. 
<P> I met Mr. Wellstone my freshman year, 31 years ago, during the Vietnam War, 
at Carleton, which is situated in Northfield, Minn. Mr. Wellstone was not much 
older than the students he taught. We were impressionable. He was a young radical 
professor. He had a following of students like myself. We were attracted to his 
antiwar stance. He was a professor whom we not only admired but with whom we could 
identify. 
<P> Mr. Wellstone knew how to use the privilege and resources of Carleton. To 
his classes came George Wiley, founder of the National Welfare Rights Organization, 
Frances Fox Piven, the welfare scholar, and Saul Alinsky, the famous Chicago organizer 
and founder of the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF), of which BUILD is an affiliate. 
<P> Even the assignments in Mr. Wellstone&#39;s classes were courses of study 
in the practice of organizing. In my freshman year, Mr. Wellstone assigned us 
to research the welfare system in rural Rice County, Minn. He took us to organizational 
meetings of welfare mothers, fighting to replace a food commodity program with 
food stamps. 
<P> In the early 1970s, movement organizing was the only variety of organizing 
on display on college campuses. Most students were exposed to organizing through 
mass protest demonstrations. Mr. Wellstone introduced us to old-fashioned community 
and labor organizing tactics. 
<P> We learned that 25 welfare mothers could research a policy and understand 
it. We learned that those same mothers with kids in tow could close down a county 
courthouse until someone would recognize them. We learned that compromise and 
negotiation are a part of organizing. In Mr. Wellstone&#39;s classes, we read 
the theory of organizing, and went on to practice the art. 
<P> Today, his students are everywhere. 
<P> In Washington state, Joe Crastil is organizing with the IAF. In Chicago, Tracy 
Abman is one of the bright young labor organizers in the country. Ben Gordon directs 
organizing for New York with the American Federation of State County and Municipal 
Employees. Matt Finucane is the assistant director of the Civil Rights Department 
of the AFL-CIO. Kari Moe played a key role in the election of Harold Washington 
as mayor of Chicago. There are more. 
<P> All of those Wellstone students have been calling each other in the past few 
days. I know because I have received calls from all over the country. We are now 
in our 40s and 50s. 
<P> But it&#39;s amazing how many of us still organize as a vocation. Mr. Wellstone&#39;s 
teaching took. He was a unique senator. I&#39;m sure most people will remember 
him that way. 
<P> But we now middle-aged Wellstone students know his true legacy as an inspiring 
teacher. Thanks, Mr. Wellstone.
<P><i> Jonathan Lange is the lead organizer of BUILD (Baltimoreans United in Leadership 
Development).</i>
