<p>In less than four months, we've managed in this country to go from the incredible 
to the bizarre. Four months ago, it was unbelievable to a good many Americans 
that in the midst of a war on terrorism -- with American troops in Afghanistan 
having their hands full trying to root out the last of the al-Qaida band there 
-- the White House should decide to make the invasion of Iraq a sudden national 
priority.</p>
<p>It was mind-boggling that President Bush could announce his intent to do so, 
no matter what the rest of the world thought, including nearly every one of our 
allies along with the entire Arab world, with everyone warning us that such a 
move could only further destabilize the Middle East and increase the likelihood 
of terrorist retaliation. And it was beyond imagination that the Bush administration 
would persist in pushing for an invasion against the advice of some prominent 
American generals, a cadre of respected former national security advisers and 
the CIA.</p>
<p>Now, four months later, the unbelievable has become the absurd. While American 
citizens in this city and across the country were pouring into the streets to 
protest the idea of war in Iraq, Congress -- mesmerized by Bush's ostensible popularity 
-- has given him a legislative blank check to "use the armed forces of the United 
States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate."</p>
<p>While the Pentagon ratchets up its preparations to go to war in Iraq, the Bush 
administration also announces a multimillion-dollar campaign to launch a public 
relations effort designed to improve the image of the United States in the Arab 
world. And although the White House has reluctantly pledged to consult the United 
Nations regarding any action it might contemplate taking, immediately after the 
vote an administration official blithely announced, "Right now we have accomplished 
what we had to do to take the action we need to take, and we don't need the (U.N.) 
Security Council."</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty thousand Britons turn out for a march against our proposed 
war, a national election in Germany becomes a referendum on U.S. war policy (and 
the United States loses), the Nobel Peace Prize committee goes out of its way 
to indicate that this year's award to former President Jimmy Carter can be considered 
"a criticism of the line that the current administration has taken" and the war-mongers 
in Washington act as though nary a word of dissent to their invasion passions 
has been uttered. As a British newspaper observes, only the nation's citizens 
now stand between Bush and war in Iraq.</p>
<p>"Once upon a time" -- and it will sound like a fairy tale to most people -- 
this country's leaders and citizens cared a great deal about what other nations 
thought of us. "A decent respect for the opinions of mankind" led an earlier American 
who later became president to set forth the reasons that drove the decision of 
the American colonies to declare their independence from England. That marvelous 
phrase is enshrined in our nation's Declaration of Independence; it is a matter 
of national embarrassment that it no longer has significance in the conduct of 
our country's business.</p>
<p>Robert Burns, the beloved Scottish poet, has a bit of wisdom that goes (with 
my apologies to those of Scottish extraction if I do not get the dialect correct):</p>
<p><i>"O that God the gift would gie us;</i></p>
<p><i>to see ourselves as others see us."</i></p>
<p>If we ask what it is that has our friends across the Atlantic and elsewhere 
around the world so upset, it is not that we plan to declare war on another country 
in violation of every international law ever written; it is that we act so arrogant 
and cavalier about it. In a period in which we should be witnessing a display 
of the best of prudent leadership, we are treated to a Texas swagger that boasts 
of getting our enemies "dead or alive," of an "axis of evil" that, so named, implies 
we can do whatever we choose to get rid of it, that describes Saddam Hussein as 
"stiffing the world" about his weapons arsenal and that generally uses language 
for public discourse more fitting for a barroom brawl scene in a cheap-budget 
Western movie than for discussions by a head of state.</p>
<p>Everywhere one turns these days everyone is discussing the possibility of war 
-- and doing so with unconcealed anxiety. It is a pity of incalculable proportions 
that in a period of such widespread uncertainty -- with the nation buffeted by 
a shattered economy, awash in revelations of corporate greed, with the stock market 
in disarray and a pervasive dread about the prospect of having to face more acts 
of terror on our own soil -- that we should find ourselves in the hands of and 
at the mercy of national leaders with such a frighteningly perverse set of national 
aims and objectives.</p>
