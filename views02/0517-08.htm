<p>East Timor today stands on the brink of independence, less than three years 
after it seemed to be on the edge of annihilation. But while the United 
Nation's formal transfer of power to an independent East Timorese 
government on May 20 is certainly cause for celebration, it should also be 
an occasion for reflection on the reasons for East Timor's recent horrors.

<p>Well over 200,000 East Timorese--about one-third of the pre-invasion 
population--lost their lives as a result of Indonesia's Dec. 7, 1975 
invasion and subsequent occupation. Indonesia's military could not have 
carried out its crimes without the assistance of numerous countries--most 
significantly that of the United States. Such complicity, along with 
Washington's debt to the people of East Timor and its obligations to the 
American public, highlights the need for Congress to establish an 
independent commission to fully investigate and publicize the U.S. role.

<p>President Gerald Ford and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger met with 
Indonesia's dictator, Suharto, on Dec. 6, 1975. Suharto was eager to gain 
American authorization for the planned annexation of East Timor given his 
country's heavy dependence on U.S. weaponry, which was limited by treaty to 
defensive use. According to formerly classified meeting transcripts, Ford 
and Kissinger gave the green light for the invasion. In doing so, they 
aided and abetted an international crime against peace and violated U.S. law.

<p>In early 1976, an unnamed State Department official explained why 
Washington condoned Jakarta's actions: "We regard Indonesia as a friendly, 
non-aligned nation--a nation we do a lot of business with." Similar logic 
governed the thinking of all subsequent administrations. Washington thus 
provided billions of dollars in weaponry, military training, and economic 
assistance--as well as diplomatic cover--to Jakarta during its almost 
24-year occupation.

<p>As a final act of state terrorism, the Indonesian military (TNI) and its 
"militia" proxies launched a systematic campaign of revenge in Sept. 1999 
following an overwhelming pro-independence vote in a United Nations-run 
referendum. In approximately three weeks, they destroyed 70 percent of the 
territory's buildings and infrastructure, forcibly deported about 250,000 
people to Indonesia, and raped untold numbers of women--in addition to 
massacring at least 2,000.

<p>It was not until Sept. 11, 1999--one week into the final rampage--that 
President Bill Clinton ended all U.S. support for the TNI. Washington's 
ambassador to Jakarta at the time, Stapleton Roy, explained why a president 
who had once called U.S. policy toward East Timor "unconscionable" was so 
resistant to ending American support for resource-rich Indonesia. "The 
dilemma is that Indonesia matters and East Timor doesn't," he stated.

<p>It was such thinking that allowed the slaughter in East Timor to go largely 
unreported in the United States through the early 1990s. But even as 
coverage picked up in the mid- and late 1990s, press reports and editorials 
almost never discussed U.S. complicity in the invasion and occupation. The 
same is true today.

<p>The failure to compel Washington to account for its own misdeeds is one 
reason why it often disregards international norms and mechanisms, and 
justifies such behavior in a self-righteous manner. Washington's ongoing 
refusal to provide Haiti unhindered access to files confiscated by the U.S. 
military during the 1994 invasion, its use of intimidating tactics to 
ensure the victory of its favored candidate during the November elections 
in Nicaragua, and its undermining of the International Criminal Court are 
just a few of the recent examples.

<p>"If done well a truth commission can change how a country understands and 
accepts its past, and through that, if it is lucky, helps to fundamentally 
shape its future," asserts Priscilla Hayner, author of Unspeakable Truths: 
Confronting State Terror and Atrocity. Truth-telling processes can lead to 
a more informed, vigilant, and active citizenry--an indispensable component 
of any democracy worthy of its name.

<p>In November 1999, Richard Holbrooke, at the time the Clinton 
administration's U.N. ambassador, traveled to Jakarta. "You cannot deal 
with the future unless you also come to terms with the past," he told 
Indonesian leaders in reference to the TNI's scorched-earth withdrawal from 
East Timor. "Accountability is one of the two or three keys to democracy."

<p>East Timor's independence marks an auspicious time to begin putting these 
lofty words into practice here at home. For reasons of the health of 
American democracy, the universality of international law, and the inherent 
worth of all human lives, East Timor--and the U.S. Role in the country's 
plight--must matter. Congress should ensure that Washington allows full 
disclosure of, and atones for its role in East Timor's suffering. Only in 
this manner can the United States begin redeeming itself for its complicity 
in one of recent history's most horrific chapters.
