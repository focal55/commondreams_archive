OF ALL the sins committed by the leaders of Enron, perhaps none is 
greater than the breach of trust between Enron's management personnel and its 
employees, who were encouraged to stay with the ship even as Ken Lay, Enron's 
CEO, was cutting loose the lifeboats.
<P>If we look at Enron's demise as a capitalistic fable, two truisms come to 
light. First, people in charge don't necessarily have a clue as to the long-
term consequences of their actions, which may inflict substantial injury on 
all persons involved.
<P>Second, the average citizen will be the last to know what is going on, and 
likely to suffer the greatest injury.
<P>"Trust us, we know what we are doing."
<P>How many times was that phrase told to regulators, congressman, the White 
House and to Enron employees? How silly that phrase sounds today in light of 
Enron's collapse. Surely, we won't fall for that one again. Or will we?
<P>One of the most disturbing aspects of the Enron debacle is the company's 
hand in the administration's energy policy. Vice President Dick Cheney has 
defended the secrecy of his meetings with Enron executives, citing a 
constitutional right to seek "good advice" in private. The message appears to 
be, "Don't worry about it, we know what we are doing. . . Trust us." Sound 
familiar?
<P>Certainly, one can wonder how our congressional leadership could hand our 
nation's energy strategy to a group that has failed so miserably with its own 
affairs. Shouldn't we be a little skeptical when the same persons who were 
selling stocks while encouraging their own employees to buy tell us that there 
will be no permanent environmental degradation of the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge, the California Coast and other "public" lands from expanded oil and 
gas drilling?
<P>The lack of public disclosure regarding the administration's energy policy 
is bad enough on the issue of development vs. preservation of pristine lands, 
but the stakes are actually much higher.
<P>Just as Enron executives ignored warnings that reckless bookkeeping would 
bring disaster, so too the Enron-Cheney energy plan ignores an overwhelming 
consensus of scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
warning of the dangerous effects of fossil fuels on world climate.
<P>This warning was recently joined by more than 60 Nobel laureates, who in 
December co-signed a statement that begins: "The most profound danger to world 
peace in the coming years will stem from the legitimate demands of the world's 
dispossessed. Of these poor and disenfranchised, the majority live a marginal 
existence in equatorial climates. Global warming, not of their making but 
originating with the wealthy few, will affect their fragile ecologies the most.
"
<P>The House of Representatives has voted its faith in the Enron-Cheney energy 
plan even though the policy emphasizes fossil fuels over the development of 
alternative energies and conservation. Scientists and Nobel laureates, it 
would seem, are less trustworthy than energy executives.
<P>Nor is this blind trust limited to Enron and energy policy. When a 500-page 
agreement giving the World Trade Organization the ability to overrule 
international conventions, acts, treaties and agreements in the name of "free 
trade" faced congressional approval, Ralph Nader offered $10,000 in the fall 
of 1994 to any charity chosen by a congressman who would sign an affidavit 
saying he had read the agreement and who could answer several questions about 
it.
<P>Only one, Hank Brown, who was then a Republican senator from Colorado, 
accepted Nader's offer. Brown voted against the agreement, which passed 
Congress.
<P>"In God We Trust" may be written on our money, but faith of late has been 
placed in the ideology that if we turn our government over to the highest 
bidder, our economy will flourish and so will we.
<P>"Today, American opinion leaders seem generally convinced that democracy 
and the free market are simply identical," Thomas Frank wrote in his book, 
"One Market Under God."
<P>Enron's fall may raise awareness of the limits of unregulated markets to 
provide for the general welfare. But don't count on it.
<P>A noteworthy aspect of the Enron affair is that it was even noticed by the 
media and the public. In contrast to Enron's spectacular collapse, the fallout 
from many unregulated market-driven decisions are often more subtle, with much 
longer time lines.
<P>As we increasingly place trust in private enterprise over government for 
leadership into the uncertain future, we can only hope that Enron does not 
become a metaphor for the demise of things far more important than a company 
built on smoke and mirrors.
