With all the intelligent economists we have in this country, you'd think they would know better than to use a calculator that can't subtract.
<p>
I'm not talking about just any calculator. I'm talking about the adding machine they use as the principal measure of economic growth - the Gross Domestic Product.
<p>
What makes the GDP an adding machine that can't subtract? Take crime, for <IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>example. Most people consider crime to be a bad thing and an even worse thing when it increases. Not the GDP data processors. When crime goes up, that's good news for the security and self-defense industries. And it adds to the GDP.
<p>
Divorce? I think there's general consensus that divorce, in most cases, is a bad thing - except for divorce lawyers and Realtors. Divorce brings in the bucks for the legal services and housing markets, which adds to the GDP. You get the picture.
<p>
Doctors have a word for unlimited malignant growth. It's called cancer.
<p>
Now, when politicians genuflect before the god of economic growth, they do so at the altar of the GDP. The thinking is: if you grow the economy, even the poor will be blessed.
<p>
"I am an economic conservative. I believe we should cut taxes to stimulate economic growth." That was a mantra of President Bush's campaign - the hidden assumption being that economic growth is good. Period.
<p>
This lumping of economic "bads" with economic "goods" has been recognized by economists as a problem for several decades now. In fact, some of the more ambitious among the practitioners of the "dismal science" have come up with alternative measuring sticks, which actually acknowledge that some economic activity is a sign of something bad in society.
<p>
An irony presents itself. While conservative politicians and pundits are lamenting the underachievement of American students in general, especially in areas like math, we have conservative economists who count social ills as good for the economy. But it's Generation X, Y and Z who are smeared as being "dumb-downed." Orwell would be impressed.
<p>
An economist I know once told me that if you took all the economists in the world and lined them up next to each other, one by one, you still couldn't reach a conclusion.
<p>
No doubt, economists have a tough job - made more difficult by journalists who don't know the difference between the Laffer Curve and the Bell Curve. But jokes and journalistic ignorance aside, we still need an official economic gauge that more accurately reflects our economic well-being (or lack thereof).
<p>
In the meantime, there's Domini Social Investments LLC (www.domini.com), manager of the Domini Social Equity Fund, the oldest and biggest socially responsible business index fund in the nation.
<p>
Two weeks ago, Domini announced it was selected by the City of New York to manage the "socially responsible account" of the city's Deferred Compensation Plan, which contains assets in excess of $190 million, according to Domini managing principal, Sigward Moser.
<p>
That means Domini will manage a separate investment account now available to 430,000 New York City employees via their 401k plan. The city's "socially responsible account" is designed to mirror the performance of the Domini 400 Social Index, a noted guidepost for socially responsible investors composed of the stocks of 400 large-capitalization domestic companies that pass a set of stringent social and environmental screens.
<p>
The Domini Index includes companies with a good track record in community involvement, the environment, diversity and employee relations. It excludes companies that make significant revenue from booze, tobacco, gambling, nuclear power and weapons contracting.
<p>
Over the past year, Domini has been added to other major retirement plans, including the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Deferred Compensation Plan, with over $2.8 billion in assets, the state of California's Savings Plus Plan, with over $4.7 billion in assets, and Ford Motor Co.'s 401k plan, with over $17 billion in assets.
<p>
But Domini managers do more than just handle investments in the retirement market. They also manage more than $1.8 billion in assets for individual and institutional investors, and have filed anti-sweatshop shareholder resolutions with corporations like McDonald's, Nordstrom, Sears and Wal-Mart.
<p>
Of course, Domini is no panacea - just a reminder that business ethics doesn't have to be an oxymoron; that, at bottom, investment decisions are moral choices affecting the lives of those who don't get to make investment decisions; and that not all legal economic activity is good.
<p>
Worshipping the god of economic growth at the GDP altar tends to obscure these truths.
