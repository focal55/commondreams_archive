<p>WASHINGTON -- Recently, I've had the chance to travel around the United States 
and do some call-in radio shows, during which the question of Iraq has come up 
often. And here's what I can report from a totally unscientific sample: Don't 
believe the polls that say a majority of Americans favor a military strike against 
Iraq. It's just not true. 
<p> It's also not true that the public is solidly against taking on Saddam Hussein. 
What is true is that most Americans are perplexed. The most oft-asked question 
I heard was some variation of: &quot;How come all of a sudden we have to launch 
a war against Saddam? What worries me are Osama and the terrorists still out there.&quot; 
<p> That's where I think most Americans are at. Deep down they believe that Saddam 
is &quot;deterrable.&quot; That is, he does not threaten the United States and 
he never has, because he has been deterred the way that Russia, China and North 
Korea have been. He knows that if he even hints at threatening us, we will destroy 
him. Saddam has always been homicidal, not suicidal. Indeed, he has spent a lifetime 
perfecting the art of survival - because he loves life more than he hates us. 
<p> No, what worries Americans are not the deterrables like Saddam. What worries 
them are the &quot;undeterrables&quot; - the kind of young Arab-Muslim men who 
hit America on Sept. 11, and are still lurking. Americans would pay virtually 
any price to eliminate the threat from the undeterrables - the terrorists who 
hate us more than they love their own lives, and therefore cannot be deterred. 
<p> I share this view, which is why I think the Iraq debate is upside down. Most 
strategists insist that the reason the United States must go into Iraq - and the 
only reason - is to get rid of its weapons of mass destruction, not regime change 
and democracy building. I disagree. 
<p>I think the chances of Saddam being willing, or able, to use a weapon of mass 
destruction against us are being exaggerated. What terrifies me is the prospect 
of another Sept. 11 - in my mall, in my airport or in my downtown - triggered 
by angry young Muslims, motivated by some pseudo-religious radicalism cooked up 
in a mosque in Saudi Arabia, Egypt or Pakistan. And I believe that the only way 
to begin defusing that threat is by changing the context in which these young 
men grow up - namely all the Arab-Muslim states that are failing at modernity 
and have become an engine for producing undeterrables.
<p>So I am for invading Iraq only if we think that doing so can bring about regime 
change and democratization. Because what the Arab world desperately needs is a 
model that works - a progressive Arab regime that by its sheer existence would 
create pressure and inspiration for gradual democratization and modernization 
around the region.
<p>I have no illusions about how difficult it would be to democratize a fractious 
Iraq. It would be a huge, long, costly task - if it is doable at all, and I am 
not embarrassed to say that I don't know if it is. All I know is that it's the 
most important task worth doing and worth debating. Because only by helping the 
Arabs gradually change their context - a context now dominated by anti-democratic 
regimes and anti-modernist religious leaders and educators - are we going to break 
the engine that is producing one generation after another of undeterrables. 
<p>These undeterrables are young men who are full of rage. They are raised with 
a view of Islam as the most perfect form of monotheism, but they look around their 
home countries and see widespread poverty, ignorance and repression. And they 
are humiliated by it, and it is this humiliation - this poverty of dignity - that 
drives them to suicidal revenge. The quest for dignity is a powerful force in 
human relations.If we don't find some way to help these countries reverse these 
deficits now - while access to smaller and smaller nuclear weapons is still limited 
- their young, angry undeterrables will blow us up long before Saddam ever does.
