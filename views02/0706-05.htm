<p>"So what is our mistake? We are also human beings. Treat us like human beings," 
says Gulalae, a 37 year-old Afghan mother living in the dust, hunger and fear 
of the Shamshatoo refugee camp in Pakistan. She calls Osama bin Laden an “outsider” 
and says that because of him, “Afghanistan is made into a hell for others.” (1) 
<p>Grim does not begin to describe the conditions Gulalae and her family endure. 
In one three-month period, in just one district of Shamshatoo, bacteria-related 
dehydration killed a child nearly every day. The misery in this refugee city is 
like a grain of sand on the beach of suffering that is Afghanistan. But Americans 
know little of it. 
<p>If you watch mainstream press accounts of “America’s New War” you’d never know 
that as of Christmas, 2001, civilian deaths from U.S. bombing in Afghanistan surpassed 
3,700—more than were killed in the attacks of September 11. The toll from unexploded 
cluster bombs, land mines, destroyed water and sewer systems and depleted uranium 
shells will no doubt reach into the hundreds of thousands. Add the additional 
innocents marked for retaliation as the international cycle of violence continues, 
and our war to end terrorism seems calculated to do just the opposite. 
<p>So why are we fighting? Of all the ways we could have responded to the attacks 
in New York and Washington, why war? 
<p>Numerous psychological, cultural and historical arguments can be mustered to 
answer that question, but the following does as well as any and better than most: 
“War is a racket. It always has been…A racket is best described as something that 
is not what it seems to the majority of people. Only a small ‘inside’ group knows 
what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense 
of the very many.” (2) 
<p>Words of a radical peacenik? Only if a Marine Corps Major General qualifies 
as such. In his twilight years General Smedley Butler unburdened his soul as did 
other career militarists, such as Admiral Hyman Rickover, who admitted that fathering 
the nuclear Navy was a mistake and Robert McNamara, who almost found the words 
to apologize for overseeing the Viet Nam war. Unlike Rickover and McNamara, Butler 
named names and exposed for whom the system works. 
<p>“I helped make Mexico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make 
Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues 
in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the 
benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking 
House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic 
for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for American 
fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil 
went its way unmolested.” Butler acknowledged that he’d spent most of his 33 years 
in the Marines as “a high class muscle man for Big Business, Wall Street and the 
bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.” 
<p>Thus did Butler simply and effectively expose a largely unknown truth—how the 
military serves the strategic interests of property in the corporate form. 
<p>Much more commonly known is the corrupt practice of war profiteering. 
<p>"...Only twenty-four at the (Civil) war's beginning, (J. Pierpont) Morgan perceived 
from the first that wars were for the shrewd to profit from and poor to die in…He 
received a tip that a store of government-owned rifles had been condemned as defective 
and with the simplicity of genius he bought them from the government for $17,500 
on one day and sold them back to the government on the next for $110,000...A Congressional 
committee investigating his little deal said of him and other hijacking profiteers, 
'Worse than traitors are the men who, pretending loyalty to the flag, feast and 
fatten on the misfortunes of the nation.'" (3) 
<p>Lest examples from yore lead one to believe such traditions are no longer observed, 
consider the case of Eagle-Picher Technologies Corp. The company produces sophisticated 
batteries to power the guidance systems of “smart” bombs. Workers claim they were 
ordered to cover up defects on millions of batteries—defects that would ultimately 
cause the guidance systems to fail. (4) How many Afghani civilians were killed 
by bombs “guided” by defective Eagle-Picher Corp. batteries? 
<p>In Afghanistan as in every war, corporations play a central role to protect 
their interests—whether those interests are the profits from waging war or the 
geostrategic spoils of war. (5) 
<p>Forget for a moment the indictable war profiteers like J.P. Morgan and consider 
just one instance of how war wealth, generated legally, empowers the few “inside 
the racket” to benefit economically and politically at the expense of the many. 
The du Pont Corporation will suffice. 
<p>Compared to some of its fellow racketeers, the du Pont Corporation’s profits 
during WWI look downright patriotic. The company whose gunpowder saved the world 
for democracy saw its average annual pre-war profit jump from $6,000,000 to nearly 
10 times that amount during the war. 
<p>By the mid-1920’s the du Pont family had bought nearly a quarter of all General 
Motors Corporation stock. Not only did this investment pay off handsomely during 
GM’s successful campaign to destroy urban mass transit systems, (6) but who better 
than a du Pont to run President Eisenhower’s Bureau of Public Roads and develop 
the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways along with Eisenhower Defense 
Secretary (and former GM President), Charles Wilson? 
<p>If war profits are invested this carefully, imagine how much planning goes 
into the geostrategic spoils of war? For a peek inside this game there are few 
better tour guides than President Carter’s National Security Advisor, Zbigniew 
Brzezinski. 
<p>Having also served on President Reagan’s Defense Department Commission on Integrated 
Long-Term Strategy, Brzezinski is well-qualified to write The Grand Chessboard: 
American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives. (7) It’s one of those books 
that begs the question, “why would anybody actually put this stuff in writing?” 
<p>Brzezinski describes the Europe-Asia landmass as the key to global dominance. 
He asserts that the fall of the Soviet Union cleared the way for the U.S. to become 
the first non-Eurasian power to dominate this critical area, "…and America's global 
primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance 
on the Eurasian continent is sustained...” (8) 
<p>In 1977 he named the Central Asian “stans” as the next center of conflict for 
world domination, and in light of expected Asian economic growth, he called this 
area around the Caspian Sea "…infinitely more important as a potential economic 
prize: an enormous concentration of natural gas and oil reserves…dwarf(ing) those 
of Kuwait, the Gulf of Mexico, or the North Sea…in addition to important minerals, 
including gold." (9) 
<p>The former member of Reagan’s National Security Council reasoned: "It follows 
that America's primary interest is to help ensure that no single power comes to 
control this geopolitical space and that the global community has unhindered financial 
and economic access to it." (10) 
<p>He further deduced: "That puts a premium on maneuver and manipulation in order 
to prevent the emergence of a hostile coalition that could eventually seek to 
challenge America's primacy." (12) Leaving nothing to doubt, he clarified "…To 
put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires, 
the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and 
maintain security dependence among the vassals, to keep (satellites) pliant and 
protected, and to keep the barbarians from coming together." (13) 
<p>For those foolish enough to imagine an Earth not ruled by the U.S., he warns 
that "America's withdrawal from the world—or because of the sudden emergence of 
a successful rival—would produce massive international instability. It would prompt 
global anarchy." 
<p>Brzezinski warns to “keep the barbarians from coming together,” and predicts 
“global anarchy” if U.S. dominance is threatened. The cold warrior’s language, 
while picturesque, is not as precise as that used by Thomas Friedman, foreign 
affairs columnist for the NY Times. "Markets function and flourish only when property 
rights are secure and can be enforced…And the hidden fist that keeps the world 
safe for Silicon Valley's technologies to flourish is called the US Army, Air 
Force, Navy and Marine Corps." (14) 
<p>With a Silicon Valley reference, Friedman updates General Butler’s “I helped 
make Mexico safe for American oil interests…” comment. But updates aside, oil 
retains its century-old rating as the imperial standard—with now Afghanistan at 
center stage. And UNOCAL Corp. for one does not hesitate to demand that Afghanistan 
be made safe for American oil interests. “From the outset, we have made it clear 
that construction of our proposed ($2.5 billion Afghanistan) pipeline cannot begin 
until a recognized government is in place that has the confidence of governments, 
lenders and our company. UNOCAL envisions the creation of a Central Asian Oil 
Pipeline Consortium…that will utilize and gather oil from existing pipeline infrastructure 
in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia.” (15) 
<p>Smedley Butler learned that in war “nations acquire additional territory if 
they are victorious. They just take it.” With today’s popularity of corporate 
leasing programs, getting the use of additional territory—call it property—can 
be more profitable than actually acquiring it. But the end result is the same. 
“This newly acquired territory is promptly exploited by the few—the self-same 
few—who wrung dollars out of blood in the war. The general public shoulders the 
bill.” 
<p>A modicum of historical perspective explains why America’s New and Improved 
War is not a surprise. It’s not just oil. It’s not just acquiring territory or 
the use of territory. It’s property and property rights consistently trumping 
human rights. The names change. The song has remained the same throughout our 
history. 
<p>For instance, check out a few lines of our Constitution: Article 4, Section 
2. Imbedded into the most fundamental law of our land is the duty to return property—in 
the form of slaves and indentured servants—to its owners. Or read Article 1, Section 
10, the Contracts Clause. According to Peter Kellman, “The meaning is clear: the 
obligation of the government, as stated in the Preamble to the Constitution, to 
promote the ‘general welfare’ is secondary to the private law, the law of contracts.” 
(16) Or ask yourself why First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and assembly 
do not apply when you’re at work? Or why corporations have more free speech rights 
than people? 
<p>Try this at home. Make your own list of how our world would look if America 
was a functioning democracy, actually governed by “we the people;” if human rights 
trumped property rights; if the vast decency, wisdom and compassion of the American 
people and not the interests of the propertied elite guided our foreign and domestic 
policies. 
<p>Here are a few things I’d put on my roster: 
<p>** We wouldn’t be bombing one of the poorest nations on earth, killing thousands 
of civilians who had absolutely nothing to do with the inexcusable attacks of 
September 11. 
<p> ** General Motors Corp. would not be allowed to replace mass transit systems 
with oil-addicted highways and automobiles. 
<p>** Representatives from UNOCAL and other corporations would not be able to 
buy their way into congressional offices and write legislation. 
<p>Not only could we generate a stunning agenda, we can actually begin making 
some fundamental improvements once we start finding ways to make the peace movement 
a democracy movement, and the environmental movement a democracy movement, and 
the labor movement a democracy movement, and… 
<p>You get the picture.</P>
