<p>On Tuesday, George W. Bush is scheduled to give a speech intended to put him 
in front of the growing national outrage over corporate malfeasance. He will sternly 
lecture Wall Street executives about ethics and will doubtless portray himself 
as a believer in old-fashioned business probity.</p>
<P> Yet this pose is surreal, given the way top officials like Secretary of the 
Army Thomas White, Dick Cheney and Mr. Bush himself acquired their wealth. As 
Joshua Green says in <i>The Washington Monthly</i>, in <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0207.green.html" target="_new">a 
must-read article</a> written just before the administration suddenly became such 
an exponent of corporate ethics: "The `new tone' that George W. Bush brought to 
Washington isn't one of integrity, but of permissiveness. . . . In this administration, 
enriching oneself while one's business goes bust isn't necessarily frowned upon."</p>
<P> Unfortunately, the administration has so far gotten the press to focus on 
the least important question about Mr. Bush's business dealings: his failure to 
obey the law by promptly reporting his insider stock sales. It's true that Mr. 
Bush's story about that failure has suddenly changed, from "the dog ate my homework" 
to "my lawyer ate my homework — four times." But the administration hopes that 
a narrow focus on the reporting lapses will divert attention from the larger point: 
Mr. Bush profited personally from aggressive accounting identical to the recent 
scams that have shocked the nation.</p>
<P> In 1986, one would have had to consider Mr. Bush a failed businessman. He 
had run through millions of dollars of other people's money, with nothing to show 
for it but a company losing money and heavily burdened with debt. But he was rescued 
from failure when Harken Energy bought his company at an astonishingly high price. 
There is no question that Harken was basically paying for Mr. Bush's connections.</p>
<P> Despite these connections, Harken did badly. But for a time it concealed its 
failure — sustaining its stock price, as it turned out, just long enough for Mr. 
Bush to sell most of his stake at a large profit — with an accounting trick identical 
to one of the main ploys used by Enron a decade later. (Yes, Arthur Andersen was 
the accountant.) As I explained in my previous column, the ploy works as follows: 
corporate insiders create a front organization that seems independent but is really 
under their control. This front buys some of the firm's assets at unrealistically 
high prices, creating a phantom profit that inflates the stock price, allowing 
the executives to cash in their stock.</p>
<P> That's exactly what happened at Harken. A group of insiders, using money borrowed 
from Harken itself, paid an exorbitant price for a Harken subsidiary, Aloha Petroleum. 
That created a $10 million phantom profit, which hid three-quarters of the company's 
losses in 1989. White House aides have played down the significance of this maneuver, 
saying $10 million isn't much, compared with recent scandals. Indeed, it's a small 
fraction of the apparent profits Halliburton created through a sudden change in 
accounting procedures during Dick Cheney's tenure as chief executive. But for 
Harken's stock price — and hence for Mr. Bush's personal wealth — this accounting 
trickery made all the difference.</p>
<P> Oh, and Harken's fake profits were several dozen times as large as the Whitewater 
land deal — though only about one-seventh the cost of the Whitewater investigation. 
</p>
<P> Mr. Bush was on the company's audit committee, as well as on a special restructuring 
committee; back in 1994, another member of both committees, E. Stuart Watson, 
assured reporters that he and Mr. Bush were constantly made aware of the company's 
finances. If Mr. Bush didn't know about the Aloha maneuver, he was a very negligent 
director. </p>
<P> In any case, Mr. Bush certainly found out what his company had been up to 
when the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered it to restate its earnings. 
So he can't really be shocked over recent corporate scams. His own company pulled 
exactly the same tricks, to his considerable benefit. Of course, what really made 
Mr. Bush a rich man was the investment of his proceeds from Harken in the Texas 
Rangers — a step that is another, equally strange story.</p>
<P> The point is the contrast between image and reality. Mr. Bush portrays himself 
as a regular guy, someone ordinary Americans can identify with. But his personal 
fortune was built on privilege and insider dealings — and after his Harken sale, 
on large-scale corporate welfare. Some people have it easy.</p>
