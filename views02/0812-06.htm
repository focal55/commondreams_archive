<p>I'm reminded of the 1950's...TV newscasts showing clouds of DDT sprayed on 
a clueless public, compromising their health and contaminating the environment 
for decades to come, as Rachel Carson writes "Silent Spring."&nbsp; But the time 
is now, other toxic pesticides have joined the ranks in our wayward war against 
mosquitoes, and the Rachels of today are drowned out by a media rushing to sound 
the alarm, rather than report the news.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the news is - pesticides pose a much greater health hazard than the West 
Nile virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>DEET, Anvil, and other toxic pesticides are aggressively promoted to protect 
the public from a mosquito bite that appears to be, statistically, less dangerous 
than a dog bite or bee sting.&nbsp;And the CDC seems to agree. On its website 
it says, "Human illness from West Nile virus is rare, even in areas where the 
virus has been reported. The chance that any one person is going to become ill 
from a mosquito bite is low."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 1999 only a handful of deaths per year have been associated with West 
Nile, even though the virus has been found in 33 states. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that this "health crisis" has been exaggerated, and that chemical 
spraying is usually the least effective yet most toxic way to control mosquitoes, 
has deterred some state officials, but not others. The New York State Health Department 
backed away from recommending wholesale spraying after finding that more people 
got sick from the pesticides than from the virus. However, Louisiana has just 
asked for $17 million in federal aid, and Mississippi is following suit. There's 
no word yet on how the money is to be allocated, but rest assured the pesticide 
companies stand to benefit.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some citizen groups are taking matters into their own hands. The 
No Spray Coalition is suing New York City to stop pesticide spraying in their 
neighborhoods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a good deal of information on government and other websites about the 
toxic effects of pesticides, but a comprehensive picture of the specific pesticides 
and issues involved in the West Nile campaign is well laid out in a report called 
"Overkill: Why Pesticide Spraying for West Nile Virus May Cause More Harm Than 
Good" by the Maine Environmental Policy Institute (MEPI) and the Toxics Action 
Center.</p>
<P>In short, they report that these pesticides offer a toxic legacy:&nbsp;short- 
and long-term respiratory problems, immune and nervous system disruption, cancer, 
and reproductive and learning disorders. That covers just about everything you'd 
never want to get.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "Overkill" report also emphasizes the association between outdoor pesticide 
sprays and neurological damage, stating, "A report of pesticides and childhood 
brain cancers published in Environmental Health Perspectives (a publication of 
the National Institutes of Health) revealed a strong relationship between brain 
cancers and pyrethroids used to kill fleas and ticks." Anvil, a pyrethroid, is 
a popular pesticide used by state agencies to control mosquitoes.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of DEET in mosquito repellents is extremely troubling. DEET has been 
associated with seizures and several cases of toxic encephalopathy (encephalitis) 
in children, including three deaths, according to the Extension Toxicology Network 
at Cornell University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battle against West Nile is supposed to prevent a virus that can cause 
encephalitis. It appears the cure can cause the disease. That would be ironic, 
if it weren't so tragic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Mohamed Abou-Donia, a research scientist at Duke University Medical Center, 
whose studies have established a link between DEET and neurological damage in 
animals, warns parents in a recent Environmental News Service article, "Never 
use insect repellents on infants, and be wary of using them on children in general. 
Never combine insecticides with each other or use them with other medications. 
Even so simple a drug as an antihistamine could interact with DEET to cause toxic 
side effects. Don't spray your yard for bugs and then take medications. Until 
we have more data on potential interactions in humans, safe is better than sorry."&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, state and federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are encouraging the public 
to use mosquito repellents containing DEET. Although the CDC warns parents to 
avoid applying repellent on children less than 2 years old, the EPA and other 
state agencies are not giving that caution. The EPA instead advises, "Do not allow 
children to handle the products, and do not apply to children's hands. When using 
on children, apply to your own hands and then put it on the child."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have these people ever met a child? Children touch everything and everybody, 
including themselves. And then they put their pudgy little fingers directly into 
their mouths.</p>
<p>While the battle plan's objective is to target the mosquitoes that carry West 
Nile, the strikes won't be 'precision' and the collateral damage could be vast. 
Pesticides and larvicides can impact fish, insects, animals, and humans. And although 
the public has been told to lather up with DEET, spray pesticides, and eliminate 
standing water, little has been said about using select plants, birds, bugs, fish, 
and amphibians - gifts of nature that help control mosquitoes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It seems we're traveling in a deadly circle. Spraying for West Nile, while 
we're gassing ourselves. Falling for a health scare, when the real scare is the 
alleged cure. And the real cure can be found in the natural world we're attacking.</p>
<P>Welcome to the 1950's. Rachel must be rolling in her grave.</p>
