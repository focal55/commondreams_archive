<p>INVADING Iraq is not a faith-based initiative. This is shocking, considering 
the self-proclaimed piety of President Bush.
<P>For months now, he has tried to rewrite the commandments so religious groups can get more federal manna to help the wayward and the downtrodden. Congress has been so slow to rubber-stamp the new testament that the president has resorted to divine intervention. He is going behind Capitol Hill's back, trying to tweak regulations and educating religious groups on how to fool government regulators by applying for funds under nonreligious names.</P>



<P>The first commandment, according to the president's own words, is, ''Government must expedite and stand on the side of faith-based programs.'' In a video speech to the Southern Baptist Convention, Bush quoted Martin Luther King Jr. as saying, ''The church is not the master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of the state.'' Bush told the throng: ''You have never believed in separating religious faith from political life. Baptists believe as America's founders did: that religious faith is the moral anchor of American life.''</P>



<P>As the president itches to rain bombs on Baghdad, never in his reign has the church been so separated from the state. Indiscernible is his moral anchor. Is it truly because he has irrefutable proof that Saddam Hussein is going to pump poisons into our subways, air ducts, and aquifers? Or is he driven by more primitive desires of revenge?</P>



<P>In 1993, Bush's father, on a victory tour of Kuwait after the Gulf War, was the alleged target of an assassination plot by the Iraqi intelligence service. The plot was broken up, and President Clinton punished Iraq by firing 23 Tomahawk missiles at its intelligence headquarters. Three missiles missed their targets, reportedly killing at least eight civilians.</P>



<P>The fact that his father was saved and that Iraq was already attacked with death penalty justice has obviously not been enough for the Bush family. Last month on CNN, Bush senior said: ''I hate Saddam Hussein. ... I have nothing but hatred in my heart for him.'' The junior Bush, while saying that other nations are at risk of attack from Hussein, said: ''But there's no doubt his hatred is mainly directed at us. After all, this is the guy who tried to kill my dad.''</P>



<P>Since hate can escalate into an all-consuming inferno, many church leaders have tried to dampen the fires of Bush. Bush has solid support for a unilateral first-strike invasion from the National Association of Evangelicals and the Southern Baptist Convention. But a vast universe of other churches say there is still time to avoid war. In the last three weeks, the World Council of Churches, the US National Council of Churches, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, and many state councils of churches have urged Bush not to wage war, at least for now. </P>



<P>They have urged the White House to exhaust all peaceful means of weapons inspections and getting Hussein to destroy the weapons.  While all the church groups acknowledged Hussein's blood lust, they said that does not yet justify going out of our way to shed new blood. ''We do not need to march down the path to Armageddon,'' said Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches. ''A preemptive strike by the US presents to the world a model of aggression that may encourage other nations to attack neighboring countries that threaten them.''</P>



<P>The World Council of Churches said: ''War as a method of settling disputes is incompatible with the teaching and example of our Lord Jesus Christ.... Under the sovereignty of God, no nation or group of nations is entitled to prosecute vengeance against another. Nor is any nation entitled to make unilateral judgments and take unilateral actions that lead to the devastation of another nation and the massive suffering of its people.''</P>



<P>The president of the US Conference of Bishops, Wilton Gregory, wrote to Bush, ''We respectfully urge you to step back from the brink of war and help lead the world to act together to fashion an effective global response to Iraq's threats that conforms with traditional moral limits on the use of military force.''</P>



<P>Bush was happy to use the churches when it suited his political purpose of replacing federal obligations to the poor with charity and noblesse oblige. Bush has said, ''Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an honored place in our plans.'' With daddy Bush still burning about Saddam Hussein and junior burning with desire and perhaps revenge, the church has no place in the plans. </P>



<P>The new commandment from Bush is: The government must expedite this war. Faith-based organizations -  you stand aside.</P>
