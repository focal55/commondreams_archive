<p>NEW YORK -- President George Bush wrapped himself in the American flag and 
won a major victory last week as U.S. voters gave control of both houses of Congress 
to the Republican party. In mid-term elections, the party in power almost always 
fares badly, but this year an electorate, gripped by fear of terrorism, and whipped 
into war fever by high-voltage propaganda, voted Republican. Thank you Osama and 
Saddam. 
<p>One poignant photo said it all: Georgia's defeated Democratic senator, Max 
Cleland, sitting in a wheelchair, missing both legs and an arm lost in combat 
in Vietnam. This highly decorated hero was defeated by a Vietnam war draft-dodger 
who had the audacity to accuse Cleland of being "unpatriotic" after the senator 
courageously voted against giving Bush unlimited war-related powers. I do not 
recall a more shameful moment in American politics. 
<p>Bush's victory is clearly a mandate to proceed with his crusade against Iraq. 
Preparations for war are in an advanced stage. The U.S. has been quietly moving 
heavy armour and mechanized units from Europe to the Mideast. Three division equivalents 
and a Marine heavy brigade are now in theatre. An armada of U.S. warplanes is 
assembling around Iraq, which is bombed almost daily. U.S. special forces are 
operating in northern Iraq, and, along with Israeli scout units, in Iraq's western 
desert near the important H2 airbase. The war could begin as early as mid-December 
if there is no coup against Saddam Hussein. 
<p>But for all the propaganda about wicked Saddam, Iraq is not the main objective 
for the small but powerful coterie of Pentagon hardliners driving the Bush administration's 
national security policy. Nor is it for their intellectual and emotional peers 
in Israel's right-wing Likud party. The real target of the coming war is Iran, 
which Israel views as its principal and most dangerous enemy. Iraq merely serves 
as a pretext to whip America into a war frenzy and to justify insertion of large 
numbers of U.S. troops into Mesopotamia. 
<p><b>A minor threat</b> 
<p>Israeli defence officials have long dismissed demolished Iraq as a minor threat, 
even though it likely has between six and 18 old Scud missiles hidden away. Saddam 
did not use chemical weapons in 1991 for fear of Israeli nuclear retaliation. 
Israel now has the world's most advanced anti-missile system, Arrow, with two 
batteries operational, and numerous batteries of the latest U.S. Patriot missiles 
in place. 
<p>The prevailing view in the Israeli military is that Iraq will be quickly defeated 
by U.S. forces, and then likely split into two or three cantons. Israel's North 
American supporters, however, are still being given the party line that Israel 
is in mortal danger from Iraq. 
<p>Iran is a different story. Iran is expected to produce a few nuclear weapons 
within five years to counter Israel's large nuclear arsenal, and is developing 
medium-range missiles, Shahab-3s and -4s, that can easily reach Tel Aviv. 
<p>With 68 million people and a growing industrial base, Iran is seen by Israel 
as a serious threat and major Mideast geopolitical rival. Both nations have their 
eye on Iraq's vast oil reserves. 
<p>Israel's newly appointed hardline defence minister, former air force chief 
Shaul Mofaz, who was born in Iran, has previously threatened to attack Iran's 
nuclear installations. Thanks to long-range F-15Is supplied by the U.S., plus 
cruise and ballistic missiles, Israel can strike targets all over Iran. This week, 
Israel's grand strategy was clearly revealed for the first time, though barely 
noticed by North American media, as Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called for an 
invasion of Iran "the day after" Iraq is crushed. 
<p>Elections in Israel at the end of January will probably return Sharon's Likud 
party and its extreme rightist allies to power, this time with a strengthened 
position. Ferocious competition for party leadership between the iron-fisted Sharon 
and the even more hardline Benjamin Netanyahu suggests a further move to the far 
right, zero chance for peace with Palestinians, and a more aggressive policy towards 
Israel's unloving neighbours. 
<p>In the U.S., Pentagon hardliners are drawing up plans to invade Iran once Iraq 
and its oil are "liberated." They hope civil war will erupt in Iran, which is 
riven by bitterly hostile factions, after which a pro-U.S. regime will take power. 
If this does not occur, then Iraq-based U.S. forces will be ideally positioned 
to attack Iran. Or, they could just as well move west and invade Syria, another 
of Israel's most bitter enemies. 
<p>Israel's Likudniks thirst for revenge against Syria - and also Iran - for supporting 
Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, which drove Israeli forces from Lebanon. 
<p>Pentagon superhawk Richard Perle, told the TVO program Diplomatic Immunity 
that the U.S. was prepared to attack Syria, Iran, and Lebanon. 
<p>By February or March, the U.S. media will likely be flooded with dire warnings 
about the threat to the world from Iran. Israel's American lobby will turn its 
guns from Iraq to Iran. "Links" will surely be "discovered" between Iran and al-Qaida. 
The cookie-cutter pattern that worked for whipping up war psychosis against Iraq 
should work just as well against Iran, Syria or Saudi Arabia - and win the next 
national election.
