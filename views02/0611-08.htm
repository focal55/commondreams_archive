<p>Two months ago, the Los Angeles Times exposed a U.S. plan for developing 
contingency plans to use nuclear weapons against Russia, China, Syria, 
Lybia, Iran, Iraq, and/or North Korea.  This enlightening, albeit dangerous 
and revealing, policy demonstrates our motives of paving the road for a 
fast and furious arms race unlike any other.  To make matters worse, the 
United States will unilaterally walk away from the Anti-Ballistic Missile 
Treaty this Thursday under the pretext that it is outdated and unneeded.

<p>The ruthless pursuit to defend our country's borders, like deputizing law 
enforcement agents for expanding the Immigration and Naturalization 
Services, restricting access to information about the success of missile 
defense tests from Vandenburg Air Force Base in Lompoc, CA, or backing out 
of treaties like the ABM or withdrawing our signature from the 
International Criminal Court treaty, ultimately weakens our country because 
we missappropriate funds for potential military responses rather than 
creating a strong national infrastructure that cares for the needs of all 
its' citizens.

<p>Leo Tolstoy, in his essay entitled "Patriotism or Peace" cites a passage by 
the Chinese philosopher Confucius:  "In reply to a prince's question how to 
increase his army, in order to conquer a southern tribe which did not 
submit to him, Confucius replied: 'Destroy all thy army, and use the money, 
which thou art wasting now on the army, on the enlightenment of thy people 
and on the improvement of agriculture, and the southern tribe will drive 
away its prince and will submit to thy rule without war.'"

<p>In response to our country's policies and to Confucius' advice, I have two 
questions: Is there more than one way to defend our country?  Is there more 
than one way to show we love our country?

<p>Seems like taking care of future generations is a good way both to defend 
our country and show we love it.  When one-fourth of children in America 
live in poverty, our country is less secure and less stable.  A healthy, 
well-educated and well-cared-for population will want to invest their time, 
energy and money in keeping America beautiful.  A deprived, sickly and 
ill-informed population is actually a danger to our nation.

<p>Future generations deserve a good education and foundation for making good 
decisions and getting good jobs.  When we build 200 new prison cells every 
day, we demonstrate our priorities and expectations for our youth.  Our 
President's educational plan claims it will "leave no child behind."  Makes 
me wonder about those 969 missing foster children in Florida.  We won't 
leave any kids behind - as long as we can find them!

<p>We can create a safe country by protecting our environment as well.  For 
example, in the proposed nuclear waste storage plan, radioactive material 
would be transported across most state lines.  I wonder why, if the 
material is not safe enough where it is currently at the reactors, it would 
be sent in transit to Yucca Mountain, past homes and schools, past 
neighborhoods and communities, to be stored at a site which itself is 
situated on a dangerous earthquake fault.  Ought we make safety for our 
land, water and air a priority, not to mention the fact that these moving 
nuclear transports could fall prey to terrorist attacks themselves!

<p>We can defend our country by establishing alliances with other countries, 
especially those on the "terrible seven" list.  Folks from the Peace 
Pilgrim Center, in a letter after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 
said that we still have the capacity to transform enemies into 
friends.  Dr. King challenged us to do the same thing in his essay entitled 
"Loving Your Enemies."  When we can transform an enemy into a friend, we 
have won a double victory.

<p>Can we show love for our country demonstrating discipline?  When a parent 
reprimands a child, hopefully we don't wonder if the parent hates the 
child.  On the contrary, guiding a straying child by calling them back in 
line shows care and concern.  Children with no boundaries often grow up to 
be unwieldy and difficult adults.  Those who question our current defense 
policies do not hate the United States.  We love it so much that we are 
willing to challenge its direction, make those in power justify why they 
feel that a military response is the best response.

<p>Similarly, it is only smart to question such serious matters abandoning 
treaties.  If someone hijacked our car, blindfolded us and told us to drive 
really fast, hopefully we would be concerned with our safety and mortality 
- and certainly wonder if the hijacker, acting alone, was sane.  Our policy 
toward the ABM treaty is the same.  We are unilaterally and dangerously 
blindfolding ourselves as we careen along a precarious path.

<p>Perhaps we should heed Confucius' words.  Or Dr. King's.  Or buckle up - 
we're in for a wild ride.
