<p>One recent piece of international maneuvering that has been 
overshadowed by issues of far more immediate and widespread import -- 
potential nuclear war in the Indian subcontinent, continued violence 
in the Holy Land, and the Bush administration's apparently successful 
campaign to redefine public inquiry into its gross pre-September 11 
oversight -- was the annual meeting of the International Whaling 
Commission, held from May 19 to 24 in Shimonseki, Japan.

<p>After World War II, the consumption of whale helped Japan avert 
famine, and nearly half of the meat eaten there came from whales.  As 
late as the early 1960's, whale accounted for nearly one-third of 
Japan's meat consumption.

<p>Since then, whale meat has occupied a progressively less prominent 
role in the national diet.  According to an April poll by the Asahi 
Shimbun newspaper, more than half of Japanese people aged 20 to 24 do 
not eat whale at all, and only four percent of all those polled eat 
whale even "sometimes." Today, whale accounts for a mere fraction of 
one percent of national meat consumption, and reached unprecedentedly 
low levels last year, when thirty percent of Japan's 725-ton harvest 
went unsold. 

<p>The shrinking of Japan's whaling industry, which despite its small 
size possesses considerable political clout and is a symbol of 
intense national pride, is mostly the result of strict international 
regulations on commercial whaling.  Japan's current whaling industry 
is a nominally scientific project, overseen by the Institute for 
Cetacean Research, in which the meat of whales killed for study is 
sold on the open market.  Unsurprisingly, their "research" reveals 
that restrictions on whaling are not needed. Since 1986, Japan has 
unsuccessfully sought to end the worldwide moratorium on commercial 
whaling, and have increasingly framed the issue in nationalist terms.

<p>"Some antiwhaling countries say eating whale is barbaric, but I 
consider such a stance 'cultural imperialism,'" said Shunichi Suzuki, 
a Liberal Democratic Party member and leader of pro-whaling 
Parliament group.  Outside the IWC meetings in Shimonseki, thousands 
of right-wing nationalists wearing paramilitary uniforms and waving 
flags arrived in buses with PA systems broadcasting World War II 
fight songs, demanding that Japan be allowed to hunt whales without 
foreign intervention.

<p>Inside the meetings, after their requests to lift the moratorium were 
again denied, Japan's delegates embarked on a course of shocking 
meanness.  With the aid of pro-whaling Caribbean nations whose 
support Japan is purported to have purchased, Japan successfully 
engineered a last-minute vote to forbid the aboriginal subsistence 
whaling of  Alaska's Inuit and Siberia's Chukchi peoples.

<p>The move was stunning, given the natives' near-total dependence on 
the miniscule number of whales taken in their hunts.  According to 
Inupiat mayor George Ahmaogak, "More than 10,000 people depend on 
those whales.  It's 80 percent of our diet.  We need the blubber to 
keep our blood thick in the winter.  Without it, we're in trouble."

<p>"It was the most unjust, unkind and unfair vote ever taken in the 56 
years of I.W.C. history," said Rolland A. Schmitten, the U.S. 
commissioner.

<p>Japan's response was as cold as an arctic wind. "America should feel 
the same pain that Japan has felt for fifteen years," said Masayuki 
Komatsu, spokesman for the Japanese delegation.  "They talk about 
Inuit needs.  What about the needs of our whaling communities?"

<p>Fortunately, recourse exists for the Inuit and Chukchi.  They will 
likely continue their harvests with or without international 
blessings, and pro-whaling nations could seek another vote through a 
special meeting or mail ballot prior to next year's conference. 
Japan's bizarre and vicious stance will have been reduced to posture; 
the Inuit and Chukchi will not starve, nor be reduced to dependence 
on government charity.  All will end reasonably well, and be only a 
footnote to the more pressing issues of the day.  But it is still 
worthwhile to pay attention to this particular example of 
international politics.

<p>While the debacle in Shimonseki does not cast much light into the 
arcane mechanisms of global governance, of which both supporters and 
opponents often possess little practical understanding, it 
illustrates the spirit that often prevails beneath globalism's gilded 
rhetoric.  We see disadvantaged peoples used as pawns by the world's 
great economies, compromised for the sake of political expediency, 
clawing each other down like drowning rats.  And at the I.W.C. 
meeting it was all the more poignant because the victims were a 
handful of the remnants of those societies doomed by imperialism both 
Eastern and Western, physical and cultural.

<p>In Shimonseki, America took the side of common decency.  They placed 
human well-being before short-term profits.  It is surely optimistic 
to believe this will serve as an example to other corporate and 
government leaders -- but we can hope. </p>
