Editor's note: Below is David Corn's article, posted on March 4, 
2002, that first broke news of the Bush-Enron oil deal. An update 
follows.
</i>
<p>
Did George W. Bush once have a financial relationship with Enron? 
In 1986, according to a publicly available record, the two drilled 
for oil together--at a time when Bush was a not-too-successful oil 
man in Texas and his oil venture was in dire need of help. Bush's 
business association with Enron, it seems, has not previously been 
reported. 
</p>
<p>
In 1986, Spectrum 7, a privately owned oil company chaired by Bush 
faced serious trouble. Two years earlier, Bush had merged his 
failing Bush Exploration Company (previously known as Arbusto--the 
Spanish word for shrub) with the profitable Spectrum 7, and he was 
named chief executive and director of the company. Bush was paid 
$75,000 a year and handed 1.1 million shares, according to "First 
Son," Bill Minutaglio's biography of Bush. Under this deal, Bush 
ended up owning about 15 percent of Spectrum 7. By the end of 
1985, Spectrum's fortunes had reversed. With oil prices falling, 
the company was losing money and on the verge of collapse. To save 
the firm, Bush began negotiations to sell Spectrum 7 to Harken 
Energy, a large Dallas-based energy firm owned mostly by 
billionaire George Soros, Saudi businessman Abdullah Taha Baksh 
and the Harvard Management Corporation. 
</p>
<p>
The deal took months to work out. In September of 1986, Spectrum 7 
and Harken announced they had reached an agreement. Spectrum 7 
shareholders, under the plan, would receive Harken stock. Bush 
publicly said that Spectrum 7 would continue to operate in 
Midland, Texas, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Harken and that he 
would become an active member of Harken's board of directors. As 
Minutaglio noted, the deal would give Bush about $600,000 in 
Harken shares and $50,000 to $120,000 a year in consultant's fees. 
It also would provide $2.25 million in Harken stock for a company 
with a net value close to $1.8 million.
</p>
<p>
As the details of the Spectrum-Harken acquisition--which Bush 
badly needed--were being finalized, Enron Oil and Gas Company, a 
subsidiary of Enron Corporation, announced on October 16, 1986, 
that it had completed a well producing both oil and natural gas in 
Martin County, Texas. An Enron Oil and Gas press release reported 
the well was producing 24,000 cubic feet of natural gas and 411 
barrels of oil per day in the Belspec Fusselman Field, 15 miles 
northeast of Midland. Enron held 52 percent interest in the well. 
According to the company's announcement, 10 percent belonged to 
Spectrum 7. At that point, Spectrum 7 was still Bush's company. 
Harken's completion of the Spectrum 7 acquisition was announced in 
early November. 
</p>
<p>
To spell it out: George W. Bush and Enron Oil and Gas were in 
business together in 1986--when Ken Lay was head of Enron. (Lay 
was named Enron chairman in February of that year.) How did this 
deal come about? Was this the only project in which Bush and Enron 
were partners? A call placed to the White House produced no 
response. Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, says "I can't 
tell you anything about" that project, explaining Enron "sold all 
its domestic exploration and production assets about two years 
ago to EOG Reources" and probably did not retain records regarding 
that well. As for the possibility Spectrum 7 invested in other 
Enron ventures, she notes, "You're referencing something that 
happened in 1986. I can check, but we're pretty short-staffed 
now." Elizabeth Ivers, a spokeswoman for EOG Resources (formerly 
Enron Oil and Gas), says, "If we did have any records on that 
well, it would be nothing that we would share with the public. We 
do not disclose the details or specifics of who we have well 
interests with."
</p>
<p>
After the Enron affair began generating front-page headlines, Bush 
attempted to distance himself from Enron and Lay. In early 
January, the President claimed he and Lay had not always been 
close pals. "He was a supporter of [Texas Governor] Ann Richards 
in my run [against her] in 1994," Bush asserted, noting he did not 
get "to know Ken" and work with him until after he won that 
election. But campaign records show Lay donated three times as 
much money to Bush in that race as he did to Richards. Moreover, 
contacts between Lay and the Bush family pre-dated that campaign. 
In 1992, Lay chaired the host committee for the 1992 Republican 
convention in Houston, where Bush's father won his second 
presidential nomination. And Lay was a sleepover guest at the 
White House of President George H.W. Bush.
</p>
<p>
The Enron-George W. Bush connection goes back further than the 
President has suggested. But does that mean the relationship 
between the younger Bush and Lay stretches to the mid-1980s? The 
deal could have happened without contact between Lay and Bush. But 
most company heads would be interested to know that the son of the 
sitting vice-president had invested in one of their enterprises. 
If Lay had been aware of the partnership, that would not prove the 
two were pals or that Bush and Spectrum 7 had received undue 
consideration from Enron. But given Enron's penchant to use 
political ties to win and protect business opportunities, it is 
tough not to wonder if this Bush-Enron venture involved special 
arrangements. This is certainly one more Enron partnership that 
deserves scrutiny--especially since George W. Bush has yet to 
acknowledge it. The Spectrum-Enron deal is either an odd 
historical coincidence or an indication there's more to learn 
about the Bush-Enron association.
</p>
<p>
NOW FOR AN UPDATE ON THE BUSH-ENRON OIL DEAL:
</p>
<p>
On March 6, two days after this story was first posted, "The New 
York Times" ran on the front page of its business section a story 
headlined, "Bush Joined Unit of Enron In '86 Venture To Seek Oil." 
The article, written by Jim Yardley, essentially reported the 
facts noted above. Halfway into the piece, it noted, "A columnist 
in The Nation, the liberal political journal,...wrote about the 
deal this week in its online edition." 
</p>
<p>
While the Bush White House did not respond to a request from "The 
Nation" for information, White House spokesman Dan Bartlett told 
the "Times" the President "has no recollection of this specific 
deal." Bartlett maintained that in 1986 Spectrum 7 was involved in 
more than 175 wells. Ted Collins Jr., who was president of Enron 
Oil and Gas at the time, told the newspaper that Bush did not have 
"a special relationship" with the company. Collins also asserted 
that Lay back then "wouldn't have known who Spectrum 7 was and 
that George W. Bush had anything to do with a company called 
Spectrum 7."
</p>
<p>
Since the story was originally posted, I have found records 
suggesting that Bush's Spectrum 7 had a second partnership with 
Enron. In May of 1985, a subsidiary of InterNorth, an Omaha-based 
energy company, announced the completion of a well in Martin 
County, Texas. According to "PR Newswire," the company said that 
Spectrum 7 owned an 18.75 percent interest in the well. (The rest 
was held by the InterNorth subsidiary.) The well, like the one 
mentioned above, was located at the Belspec Fusselman Field. That 
same month, InterNorth merged with Houston Natural Gas 
(HNG)--which gave birth to Enron. HNG/InterNorth changed its name 
to Enron in 1986, and the InterNorth subsidiary that had invested 
in the well with Spectrum 7 became part of Enron Oil and Gas. If 
Spectrum 7 and Enron Oil and Gas had retained their interests in 
the well, that would mean that Bush's oil company was in 
partnership with Enron before the deal reported above. Since Bush, 
according to his spokesperson, does not have a memory for such 
details and EOG Resources says it will not release any information 
about wells it has owned, it will be tough to confirm that the 
InterNorth-Spectrum 7 venture became an Enron-Spectrum 7 
enterprise. 
</p>
<p>
On another, more important, Enron-Bush point: Way back in 1994, I 
reported that Rodolfo Terragno, a former Argentine cabinet 
minister, had claimed that when he headed the Public Works and 
Services Department in 1988, George W. Bush, whom Terragno did not 
know, called him and pressured Terragno to award a pipeline 
contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Enron. (See 
<a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20020204&s=corn" target="_new">http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20020204&s=corn</a>.) Terragno, 
who said he resisted this and subsequent importuning, could not 
provide proof that the call had occurred. (How can you prove you 
were phoned by the son of the Vice-President?) Bush's aides denied 
Terragno's account. But it's worth taking a second look at those 
denials.
</p>
<p>
At the time I was pursuing the Terragno story, Bush was running 
for Texas governor, and I asked the campaign whether Bush had 
spoken to Terragno about the pipeline project and whether he had 
any business relationship with Enron. Bush aide Karen Hughes faxed 
me a terse statement: "The answer to your questions are no and 
none. Your questions are apparently addressed to the wrong 
person." An Enron spokesperson said, "Enron has not had any 
business dealings with George W. Bush, and we don't have any 
knowledge that he was involved in a pipeline project in 
Argentina." 
</p>
<p>
The recent news about the 1986 Enron-Bush venture in the Belspec 
Fusselman Field undermines (to be polite about it) those 1994 
statements from Bush and Enron denying any business relationship 
between the scion and the company. The existence of this oil 
partnership in 1986 (or one in 1985) has no bearing on the 
veracity of Terragno's tale. But it shows the credibility of the 
Bush gang and that of Enron deserve questioning when either one is 
talking about the other.
