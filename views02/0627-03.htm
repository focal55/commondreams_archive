<p>There is no alternative. Capitalism is the only future. Free markets are 
the essence of democracy.

<p>How do we know? Because we are told repeatedly by smart guys from 
corporations and government, and by the journalists and academics paid to 
explain why the smart guys are right.

<p>In the face of that "consensus," the folks at the Program on Corporations, 
Law and Democracy (POCLAD) have launched a direct attack on the nature of 
the corporation, the institution at the core of modern capitalism.

<p>So, are they crazy or just confused?

<p>Neither. The POCLAD members are refreshingly clear, and the book of their 
writings -- Defying Corporations, Defining Democracy -- makes a compelling 
case for their analysis and strategy.

<p>The key is that their critique is of the nature of the corporation. They 
are not simply saying that corporations do bad things or sometimes distort 
democracy (most liberals and even some conservatives admit that, especially 
post-Enron). Instead, they argue that the rise of the contemporary 
corporation has been the death of meaningful democracy. While I think their 
analysis needs to broaden (more on that later), the POCLAD collective has 
done an important service by framing the issue of economic justice in a 
language accessible to people not yet persuaded by a left/progressive analysis.

<p>Here's the story POCLAD tells:

<p>Our wealthy founding father devised a system that allowed them to maintain 
power -- by restricting citizenship to propertied white men, and through 
elite-controlled institutions such as the U.S. Senate and Supreme Court 
that could corral any wild ideas that regular people might pursue through 
the relatively more democratic House of Representatives, or state and local 
governments. Still, the democratic principles on which the country was 
founded were real, and popular movements over time expanded the franchise 
and agitated for more democracy.

<p>At the same time those battles have been going on, lawyers and lobbyists 
have waged a war to expand corporate power. Often relying on judges to do 
what even well-lobbied legislatures wouldn't, corporations went from being 
limited entities in the 18th and first half of the 19th centuries that 
could be controlled by the people and their representatives, to today's 
concentrations of wealth and power that have almost completely escaped 
popular control.

<p>In POCLAD language, corporations began as entities subordinate to the 
sovereign people but eventually became masters, eroding the core concept of 
democracy -- power resides in We the People. Key to this was the courts' 
granting to corporations the rights of persons, including 14th Amendment 
rights and eventually even free speech rights. POCLAD points out the 
obvious: Rights can be claimed only by persons, and corporations aren't 
real persons but only fictional ones, creations under law.

<p>According to POCLAD, we should move beyond fighting corporations on their 
terms -- battling to control the worst of their offenses through regulatory 
law or asking them to curb abuses through voluntary codes of conduct. 
Instead, citizen-activists should demand that corporations act responsibly 
in accord with their charters or face charter revocation, the death penalty 
for corporations.

<p>Along the way, POCLAD retells some American history, with two main effects. 
First, it denaturalizes the corporation -- and by implication capitalism -- 
showing that like any other system it is the product of human choices, not 
some unchangeable natural order. Second, POCLAD members remind us of past 
resistance to corporations -- from the first half of America's history when 
corporations were kept on a much shorter leash and such revocations 
occurred, to the Populists' activism in the late 19th century contesting 
the legitimacy of corporations, to the work of the early labor movement to 
articulate an alternative to capitalism. For progressive political change 
to be possible, people not only have to understand the nature of the 
systems and institutions that wield power, but also see that it is possible 
for systems to change.

<p>The book points out that corporations do not simply engage in business but 
govern much of our lives, in a system that disadvantages natural persons 
doing battle with these fictional persons. Defying Corporations, Defining 
Democracy makes this point particularly well in discussing labor law, which 
gives management huge advantages over workers trying to organize. The 
authors also argue cogently that whatever short-term victories citizens and 
environmental groups have won, or can win, in regulatory agencies, the 
ecological health of the planet has deteriorated, and will continue to 
deteriorate. So long as corporations can accumulate the wealth and power 
that contemporary law and politics allows, progressive activists start out 
in a hole.

<p>As these letters, essays, and speeches (all short and easy to digest) lay 
out this case, it becomes clear quickly the POCLAD folks have made the 
strategic choice to focus on corporations and avoid using the word 
"capitalism." That decision makes sense in a country where critiques of 
capitalism typically are associated with foreign ideologies (European or 
Third-World socialism and communism) and totalitarian systems (the Soviet 
Union and its satellites). While it is true that spirited critiques of 
capitalism are a homegrown part of American history (some are referenced in 
the book, such as the Knights of Labor's) and not foreign imports, at this 
moment in history a strategy that focuses on the corporation is likely to 
resonate more with Americans. No matter what people think about capitalism 
as a system (if they think about it at all), virtually everyone has some 
reason to dislike or distrust corporations; we've all been screwed by a 
corporation -- as a competitor, employee, consumer, or bystander -- in some 
fashion at some point.

<p>Given that corporations and modern capitalism can't be separated or 
separately defined, POCLAD's critique of the corporation goes to the heart 
of the system. It is possible to highlight the key problems inherent in 
capitalism -- its need for constant expansion, the exploitation of workers, 
the commodification of everything -- by focusing on corporations. Indeed, 
capitalism as we know it couldn't exist without the corporate form. Still, 
at some point in discussion about politics and economics, people 
understandably ask, "OK, you don't like what we've got -- what kind of 
system do you want?"

<p>Do left/progressive folks answer by saying we want capitalism without 
corporations? Or capitalism with corporations that just have less power? 
It's not clear what the first claim would mean, nor is it obvious the 
second would bring substantive improvements.

<p>Or do we articulate a vision that -- whether or not we use the term -- will 
sound a lot like what traditionally has been known as socialism: no private ownership 
of the means of production, worker control over production, collective/council 
structures throughout the economy, participatory planning, etc. Such a system 
can go by other names; for example, Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel call it "participatory 
economics" (see their book Looking Forward or the web site <a href="http://www.parecon.org" target="_new">www.parecon.org</a>). 
But in the end, it's not unreasonable for people to expect an answer to that question. 
<p>One might argue that the first step is to delegitimize the corporation, 
exposing not only the way it corrupts democracy in the political sphere but 
crushes people in the private. No argument there, but that first step 
quickly leads to questions about vision for an alternative system. This is 
not a demand for an alternative defined in great detail, which usually is a 
tactic to derail criticism of the existing system. Indeed, when any system 
is oppressive, it is in some sense enough to demand that the system end. 
But the effectiveness of that demand is much enhanced by a clear 
articulation of the underlying principles (which POCLAD offers) and some 
discussion of that vision, even if tentative and sketchy (which isn't 
included in this volume).

<p>Another necessary step forward is to include a more specific accounting of 
racism, sexism, and U.S. imperialism -- not as issues separate from 
corporate capitalism but intricately bound up with it. It is clear POCLAD 
wants to keep its eye on the prize of contesting corporate power, but 
expanding the analysis can aid in that task.

<p>In one sense, capitalism is not inherently racist or sexist -- corporations 
are happy to exploit anyone in the drive for profit. But owners and 
managers have used racism to divide workers and solidify control, and 
sexism has been important in keeping certain jobs associated with women or 
"women's work" (such as the expanding customer service sector) low paying. 
Those stories are also an integral part of the history of the corporation.

<p>It's also imperative, as the American empire seeks even greater domination 
of the world, to link the corporate system to U.S. foreign policy and 
militarism. At a time when expressions of patriotism run high, this may 
seem risky. But it's difficult to imagine making inroads against the 
corporate power at home without challenging the brutality and violence of 
U.S. policy as it secures resources and markets abroad for corporations.

<p>These are issues that left/progressive movements have to hash out. In a 
world of multiple systems of repression and oppression that are enmeshed, 
we have no choice but to deal with them analytically. One person or group 
can decide to focus on a particular issue, but the analysis that underlies 
that political action can't ignore this complexity.

<p>Whatever differences in strategy and emphasis I might have with POCLAD, 
Defying Corporations, Defining Democracy reminds us that this kind of 
political work can be done in a language that speaks to ordinary people. 
POCLAD avoids long, jargon-filled writing that will turn off most readers, 
and that's all to the good. But too many of these short, to-the-point 
pieces repeat the same themes, sometimes in pretty much the same language. 
The book could have been cut in half and conveyed as much information, 
making it more effective for outreach tool to the general public.

<p>Still, leftists and progressives should read Defying Corporations, Defining 
Democracy -- and keep up with the group's work through the website (<a href="http://www.poclad.org" target="_new">www.poclad.org</a>) 
and newsletter (By What Authority) -- not only for the history and analysis it 
offers but for rhetorical strategies for taking the message to the public. POCLAD 
reminds us the task is not to convince policymakers and elites of the problem 
of corporations but to reach the public and build a mass movement. 
<p>At a time when most people accept the big lie that there is no future 
outside of capitalism, it's time to move forward with political strategies 
grounded in the recognition that there is no way to think about a decent 
future except outside of capitalism.
