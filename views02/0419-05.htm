In the spirit of playoff profiles of hockey contenders, I'd like to assess the 
prospects of the United States as the world's sole superpower. A team in a league 
of its own. For the country CNN calls the mightiest force in history, it's been 
a bad week. 
<P><B>The Mideast: </B>Two weeks ago, George W. Bush told Israel to end its invasion 
of Palestinian territory &#34;without delay,&#34; then sent his Secretary of State 
to back it up. Israel ignored and defied him. In response, the U.S. did nothing 
and Colin Powell went home. This is not impressive superpower behaviour. Other 
governments took note. Egypt's president cancelled a meeting with Colin Powell 
and didn't even bother making up an excuse.</P>
<P>It was especially unimpressive since the Mideast is the most resoluble crisis 
in the world. Almost everyone knows the answer: a small but viable state for the 
Palestinians with security guarantees for Israel. It involves one sticky point: 
Israel's illegal settlements must be removed. I know the Israeli government denies 
this would solve the problem, which they claim is the &#34;real&#34; Palestinian 
motive: to destroy Israel. But the point is, the U.S. is among those who feel 
it <I>can</I> be solved this way, yet they failed to press. Just as striking is 
the fact that they could impose this solution without military threats, by sheer 
financial pressure, since Israel is massively dependent on U.S aid. But they didn't 
act.</P>
<P><B>Venezuela: </B>As they say in Latin America, there has never been a coup 
in the U.S. because there's no American embassy there. Last week, the coup happened 
in Venezuela, ousting elected president Hugo Chavez. In previous weeks, &#34;members 
of the country's diverse opposition&#34; had visited the U.S. embassy (The Washington 
Post) and met &#34;senior members of the Bush administration&#34; in Washington 
who sent &#34;informal, subtle signals that we don't like this guy&#34; (The New 
York Times). The Pentagon spokesperson said she was &#34;not aware&#34; if the 
U.S. gave military support to the coup, and Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer suggested 
the President was pleased. There are many reasons they wanted Hugo Chavez out 
-- his social reforms, his opposition to bombing Afghanistan (&#34;fighting terrorism 
with terrorism&#34;). But never mind that, it's all standard, like U.S.-backed 
coups in Guatemala (1954) or Chile (1973) -- down to the pot-banging street protests 
and U.S.-allied labour leaders. They all come from the same coup cookie-cutter. 
What was different is that this time the coup crumbled and Hugo Chavez is back. 
For the first time, the superpower failed in a back-yard coup.</P>
<P><B>Afghanistan: </B>It was a total success, right, except they're still there 
and still haven't accomplished their main objectives: catching Osama bin Laden 
and destroying his network. Overthrowing the government of Afghanistan was never 
more than a means to that end. This week, they said Osama bin Laden probably slipped 
through their fingers in December, and George Bush warned Americans that more 
terror attacks are likely, since &#34;cells&#34; are still out there. He might 
have added that the ranks of recruits to terror will enlarge considerably after 
his own failure to stem the Israeli assault -- among Palestinians and elsewhere. 
This is not a question of good or evil; it's an observable, predictable fact.</P>
<P>Are there signs of unease in the U.S. itself, despite the polls and the bland 
wall of superpatriotism shown on CNN and other public faces of the superpower? 
Well, there are a few straws in the wind. I don't know exactly what to make of 
them, but I'll pass them on. Michael Moore's book, <I>Stupid White Men</I>, is 
in its fifth week atop The New York Times's bestseller list, despite a relative 
media blackout of it, and its attack on everything George Bush's America is about. 
Veteran American critic of U.S. policy Noam Chomsky finds his appearances mobbed 
and applauded. British journalist Robert Fisk says he was shocked at the self-criticism 
and doubt he found during a recent U.S. tour. People in the Midwest told him the 
Bush presidency lacked legitimacy because he hadn't won the election. Of course, 
people go to see speakers they want to hear and dissidents always like to believe 
they're popular. The South African Communist Party had a well-known member called 
Comrade-The-Contradictions-Are-Sharpening, who explained at every meeting that 
the the revolution was about to occur. On the other hand, eventually it did, sort 
of. It seems to me something is happening in the U.S., but I don't know what it 
is.</P>
<P>As for Canada, it makes you think. Do we want our forces folded even further 
into theirs, under the new Northern Command they just announced? And those Canadian 
soldiers killed in Afghanistan -- proving again that the fighting there is far 
from over: Should our government have joined the U.S. contingent as it did, or 
should it have chosen instead to be part of the international peacekeeping force, 
helping to provide at least some counterbalance to the stumbly sole superpower?
