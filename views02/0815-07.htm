<p><i> "Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, 
pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. 
This our convention [U.S. Constitutional Convention] understood to be the most 
oppressive of all kingly oppressions, and they resolved to so frame the constitution 
that no man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us"</i>
<p><b> - Abraham Lincoln.</b>
<p> ARTICLE I, SECTION 8 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the sole authority 
to determine whether to send our young men and women into battle.
<p> While early presidents like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson respected 
this congressional prerogative, modern-day presidents have tended to latch onto 
the fact that the Constitution names the president "commander-in-chief" of the 
armed forces to initiate military action without congressional authorization.
<p> Unfortunately, the Bush administration is signaling its intention to do an 
end-run around the American people, their elected representatives and the U.S. 
Constitution by launching an invasion of Iraq without congressional approval.
<p> It is long-past time for Congress to reassert its constitutional authority 
over solemn issues of war and peace. I wrote to the president last December reminding 
him that Congress had only authorized a military campaign against those responsible 
for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Any other action engaging U.S. troops in hostility 
would require additional congressional approval.
<p> I drafted an amendment to the fiscal year 2003 Department of Defense Authorization 
Act, along with Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, to reinforce Congress' constitutional 
authority to initiate military action. Regrettably, the House leadership refused 
to allow the amendment to be debated on the floor.
<p> Most recently, I introduced a bipartisan resolution, House Resolution 109, 
which says the president cannot legally strike against Iraq without congressional 
approval and calls on Congress to debate the president's war plans for Iraq.
<p> Students of history will remember that Colin Powell stopped short of Baghdad 
during the 1991 Persian Gulf War because of concerns about destabilizing the entire 
Middle East if Saddam Hussein was removed from power. Many of his colleagues remaining 
in the military still share those concerns, as evidenced by leaks from the Pentagon 
that support a continued policy of containment and question the administration's 
war rhetoric.
<p> The administration has refused to answer a number of critical questions:
<p> What is the urgency of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein to the security 
of the United States?
<p> Would not a policy of enforcing no-fly zones, vigorous weapons inspections, 
and military sanctions be effective at containing the perceived threat as they 
have been for the past decade?
<p> How does the Iraqi threat compare with the threat posed by other nations with 
weapons of mass destruction, including Iran, Pakistan, China, North Korea and 
others? Is the administration considering preemptive strikes against these nations 
as well?
<p> Doesn't an invasion of Iraq make it more likely that Saddam Hussein will feel 
compelled to use weapons of mass destruction, or to give them to terrorist groups, 
in an effort to save his own hide?
<p> If Saddam Hussein is removed from power, then what? Does the administration 
plan on occupying Iraq indefinitely?
<p> Does war with Iraq increase the likelihood that nominally pro-Western regimes 
in Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia will be overthrown by Islamic radicals? 
What impact would such a result have on our democratic allies in the Middle East? 
<p> What potential disruptions to the U.S. economy could result from a war with 
Iraq? Would war lead to the disruption of oil supplies?
<p> What would war do to the confidence of consumers and investors?
<p> How much would the war and its aftermath cost U.S. taxpayers? How would this 
be paid for when the federal budget is hundreds of billions of dollars in deficit?
<p> These are just a few of the questions that have crossed my mind over the last 
several weeks as I've learned about the administration's apparently advanced planning 
for war. The American people, and their elected representatives in Congress, must 
demand straight answers to these questions.
<p> As Abraham Lincoln's quote alludes, President Bush has a legal, as well as 
moral, obligation to seek the support of Congress and the American public before 
launching a war with Iraq. Congress has a constitutional and moral obligation 
to ensure a debate about the wisdom of war with Iraq occurs.
