<p>It's like a scene from the latest first-class American TV import, Six Feet 
Under - a dark comedy set in a family-run undertaking business. Picture the coffin 
sealed and varnished, the final farewells uttered and the conveyer belt humming 
into motion, gliding the dear departed into the flames. Suddenly there is the 
sound of knocking and muffled cries. "Omigod!" the mourners collectively realize: 
the corpse is alive! 
<P>The reaction to the wave of financial scandals from the US has felt a little 
like that. Enron, WorldCom and Xerox's fudging of the numbers - "a billion here, 
a billion there", as President Bush so coolly put it - has had the left putting 
on its best black suit as it gets ready to bury American capitalism. They've been 
bidding goodbye to a system they reckon is in grave crisis and terminal decline. 
Cause of death: the exposure of some of America's starriest corporate names as 
hollow shams. And, they predict, if the US economy is on the skids then surely 
the big bogeyman - globalization - cannot be far behind. Today, WorldCom; tomorrow 
international capitalism itself will lie in ruins! 
<P>Not so fast, as Hollywood might say. First, the American system is not ready 
for the embalming table just yet. Enron and its copycat debacles obviously represent 
a serious blow to the reputation of US business - but not a fatal one. This wave 
of scandals will trigger reform, not revolution. What comes next is not the unraveling 
of the whole game, but some long-overdue changes - few of which are likely to 
excite the May Day protest crowd. 
<P>So the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, author of Globalization and its Discontents 
and an intellectual pin-up to many in the anti-globalization movement, foresees 
not some fiery meltdown but "increased sensitivity to conflicts of interest" around 
the US boardroom table. He predicts a separation of the accountancy and consultancy 
functions of single firms along with a demand for greater transparency: necessary 
moves, to be sure - but hardly likely to make the hearts of Seattle and Genoa 
veterans skip a beat. 
<P>Couldn't we set our sights a bit higher, and hope that the current spate of 
scandals might do for 21st-century US capitalism what the media's expos&#233; 
of collusion in the American oil industry did at the start of the 20th? Might 
we not see a shift as dramatic as the 1911 "anti-trust" court decision which broke 
up Standard Oil, and stood for decades as a bulwark against cartel capitalism? 
No, warn those who know the system inside out. Perhaps if there were 10 more WorldComs, 
then America might return to that progressive capitalist tradition which reached 
its zenith in FDR's New Deal. But short of an epidemic, radicals should brace 
themselves for changes which look a lot like tinkering. 
<P>And if those hotly anticipating the death of US capitalism should hose themselves 
down, those looking forward to the defeat of globalization ought to take an ice-cold 
bath. For one thing, the two are not the same. The Enron affair could have happened 
even if the American economy was entirely cut off from the rest of the world. 
Its origins lie in greed and the failings of US accountancy law rather than the 
contradictions of globalization
<P>In other words, this easy equation of America and global capitalism may be 
a tad too simplistic: they are hardly synonymous terms. The problem, says Philippe 
Legrain, a former top official at the WTO, is that "globalization has become a 
catch-all phrase for everything you don't like about modern life". That's why 
he has taken on what may seem a daunting task - writing the upcoming Open World, 
a take-no-prisoners, progressive's defense of globalization
<P>Legrain wants us to unbundle all our confused ideas about the g-word and decide 
what it is, and what it isn't. For him, that means a belief in free trade and 
in strong institutions to manage it - without endorsing every move every international 
company makes. 
<P>So rather than seeing systemic flaws inherent in the very idea of global capitalism, 
we should approve of, say, Nike opening a factory in Vietnam: those Hanoi workers 
may get less than their counterparts in South Carolina, but they're earning way 
more than they used to in Vietnam. Foreign investment and know-how comes in; managers 
get trained; a developing country is no longer solely dependent on its own means 
to build itself up - now it has outside money to give it a leg up. And, by opening 
up its markets to foreigners, it gets direct benefits: cheaper Coca-Cola, for 
sure, but also cheaper wheat. It is, he says, a win-win. 
<P>Think of that as good globalization: the only problem here, say Legrain and 
friends, is that there is not enough of it. Richer countries need to return the 
compliment and open up our own markets, letting developing countries sell us their 
food, textiles and steel. We need to make international trade a two-way street. 
<P>Which is not to say all globalization is good. Free trade in goods and services 
may bring benefits but, the defenders admit, short-term influxes of capital - 
cash coming in one day, flowing out the next - are bad news, destabilizing fragile 
economies. Poor countries need to protect themselves from that instability; capital 
controls may be the way. 
<P>The specifics are secondary. The key point is that the critics need to start 
making precisely these kinds of distinctions - and then argue each one on its 
separate merits. Stiglitz admirably distinguishes between globalization - which, 
he insists, can bring great benefits, spreading knowledge, improving life expectancy 
and quality of life - and the institutions which currently manage it. He is scathing 
about his former employer, the International Monetary Fund; but his remedy is 
reform of that specific body, rather than the abolition of international capitalism. 
<P>This seems a smart route for the anti-globalization movement to travel: to 
move beyond the sterile debate about whether globalization is good or bad, and 
decide what kind of globalization it wants. You can understand its reluctance: 
right now it enjoys the perfect unity of a cause which knows what it's against 
but not what it's for. As Charles Leadbeater points out in another optimistic 
defense of globalization, Up the Down Escalator: "The lack of an agreed program 
is a huge strength...they do not have to set priorities or fall out over the terms 
of messy compromises." 
<P>But it's time to grow up, to recognize that anti-globalization will not do 
even as a label. It's far too wide, embracing green ultras or anarchists on the 
left and Jean-Marie Le Pen on the right. And it is absurdly impossibilist. Globalization 
is now a fact of life: this article can be read, hours after it's been written, 
from Sheffield to Shanghai, thanks to that ultimate tool of globalization, the 
internet. To be against globalization is to want to turn the clock back, to wish 
that the earth can be flat. But it also fails to discriminate, to distinguish 
between the liberating globalization of, say, the net, and the menace of smash-and-grab 
capital flows. 
<P>So put away that black tie, quiet that funeral drum. The task for progressives 
is not to bury the modern world but - the same as it ever was - to change it. </i>
