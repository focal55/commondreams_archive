<p>Fast Track is back-- but not so fast, says the
US Senate. Re-named by its advocates as "Trade
Promotion Authority," this measure would strip the
Congress of its power to amend commercial
agreements with other countries. Our elected
representatives would have only an up or down vote
on the final product brought to them by the Bush Administration.</p>

<p>But the speed bumps are getting bigger in
the Senate, which has already fought back with an
amendment preserving the right of Congress to
separately consider certain changes in US trade law.</p>

<p>Why the fight? Nine years ago our corporate
and political leaders sold the American public a bill
of goods under the misleading title of "free trade,"
as in the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA). The same false advertising was used to
market the World Trade Organization (WTO) a
couple of years later. Now the truth about these
agreements is coming back to haunt them.</p>

<p>Fast Track is a power grab by the executive
branch to deprive Congress of its constitutional
authority to regulate foreign commerce. The
administration wants this power because the
commercial agreements it seeks are not primarily
about "free trade," and in fact have a number of
harmful objectives.</p>

<p>Take NAFTA's now infamous Chapter 11.
This set of rules gave corporations the right to sue governments directly for actions that reduce their profits. Californians awoke to discover that their environmental laws were now subject to a new form of legal challenge. When they banned the gasoline additive MTBE, which had already contaminated more than 10,000 groundwater sites in the state, California faced a lawsuit from a Canadian corporation under NAFTA's Chapter 11.</p>

<p>This case and others have aroused
opposition from not only the nation's largest
environmental groups, but also broad-based, non-
partisan organizations such as the National
Conference of State Legislatures, the National
Association of Counties, and the National League of
Cities.</p>

 <p> "We do not believe that it is necessary to
create different legal standards for foreign investors
to attract their investments in our communities,"
they wrote in a letter supporting Senator John
Kerry's amendment to the Fast Track legislation.
The Kerry amendment would direct trade
negotiators to protect the Constitutional authority of
our local, state, and national governments -- and not
to erode this authority with new rights for
corporations.</p>

<p>The use of "free trade" agreements and
organizations such as the WTO to increase patent
protection for pharmaceutical companies is also
being exposed. This is the most costly and -- in the
case of essential medicines for such diseases as
AIDS -- deadly form of protectionism in the world.
Yet it remains one of the top priorities for US trade negotiators.</p>

<p>Then there is the economic question of who
wins and loses from these agreements. The weight
of the evidence from economic research across the
political spectrum is clear: for at least 70 percent of
the US labor force, the liberalization of trade and
investment over the last 20 years has lowered
wages. This is the logical and predictable outcome
of throwing American workers into increasingly
harsh competition with people who earn as little as
25 cents an hour, and often do not even have the
right to organize unions.</p>

<p>Americans are fine with trade. But we are
deeply suspicious of agreements that subordinate
our Constitution, our environmental protection, and
our health and safety standards to international
agreements that are fast-tracked into law by
multinational corporate lawyers and lobbyists. And
if increased trade and international investment are
being used to lower living standards for the majority
of Americans, why should we support more of the
same?</p>
