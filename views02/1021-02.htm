<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> 
<p> Last Wednesday, while the American media focused on President Bush signing 
into law the Congressional resolution permitting him carte blanche to invade Iraq, 
a very different scene was playing out a couple hundred miles to the north. At 
the United Nations General Assembly, country after country -- virtually every 
member of the U.N. -- rose to condemn the idea that the United States should unilaterally 
invade Iraq. Many opposed any invasion at all. Even Kuwait -- not only a staunch 
ally, but the Bush poster country for the virtues of attacking Saddam Hussein 
-- rose and for the first time publicly announced it would not cooperate with 
a United States invasion.
<p> The following day, astonishingly, the U.S. backed down. The Bush Administration 
announced it was abandoning efforts to win a toughly worded resolution that would 
allow military forces to accompany U.N. weapons inspectors, and that would allow 
the U.S. to invade should any difficulty arise. While Colin Powell also intoned 
that the U.S. reserved the right to invade without any U.N. approval at all, it 
was unclear whether Powell's statements were more U.S. unilateralism or simply 
a face-saving sop to the hawks in D.C. And two days later, the same Colin Powell 
suggested that if Iraq disarmed, the Bush Administration would be willing to accept 
Saddam Hussein's continued rule of Iraq. (Why not? Leaving him in place sure worked 
for Poppy.) 
<p> Whatever the final outcome, it's clear that Bush's rhetorical climbdown last 
week delays, for the time being, any invasion -- and perhaps even forestalls one 
altogether. At minimum, it's almost inconceivable now that the U.S. would launch 
an invasion without some osrt of attempt first by the United Nations to search 
for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction -- a search Iraq has already repeatedly 
said it would unconditionally accept. And as another gesture to international 
opinion, over the weekend Iraq released a number of political prisoners. 
<p> Suddenly, the momentum for an unprovoked invasion is gone. Surely high among 
the many factors is the increasing public reluctance to see the U.S. go it alone, 
in Iraq or anywhere else, in a naked imperial adventure. But another, much less 
remarked-upon factor is also at play, one that has many Pentagon generals and 
military analysts terrified. 
<p> The empire might lose. 
<p> Wednesday's Kuwaiti announcement at the U.N., and the parade of hostile speeches 
by other countries surrounding Iraq, highlighted one of the biggest logistical 
impediments to a U.S. invasion: the lack of any land bases in nearby countries 
from which soldiers can mass and planes can launch. Kuwait wants nothing of such 
a role. Despite months of American enticements and begging, neither do Saudi Arabia, 
Egypt, Turkey, or any of the Gulf States. Israel has its own problems. 
<p> That leaves the United States vulnerable to a strategy highlighted by yet 
another news item last Wednesday. (Wednesday was a busy day.) The government of 
Yemen confirmed that the October 6 explosion that blew a hole and spilled 90,000 
barrels of oil from the French oil tanker Limburg was a terrorist attack. More 
importantly, it confirmed how the attack was carried out: by a small skiff, packed 
with explosives, that crashed kamikaze-style into the tanker. 
<p> A similar method was used in Yemen two years ago in the attack upon the USS 
Cole. But what ties this all together is the infamous war game exercises conducted 
several months ago by the U.S. Army. The war games were to recreate an invasion 
of an unnamed Middle East oil dictatorship -- obviously, a practice for an invasion 
of Iraq. 
<p> Blue -- the good guys -- got destroyed by the Red (unnamed dictatorship) team. 
The war was over almost before it began. The general leading the Red team was 
then told he must give away his troops' positions and movements. Same result. 
He then had radio communications cut off. The Americans still lost, badly. Finally, 
the Army just called the whole damn thing off and declared Blue the winner. 
<p> Red's commander, now retired, has been giving interviews in the European press 
in recent weeks describing his strategy. It's simplicity itself. The U.S. has 
no land bases to work with, so any invasion, at this point, will be completely 
reliant upon aircraft carriers in the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and especially 
the Persian Gulf. Red simply used small fishing vessels -- indistinguishable from 
the civilian boats that dot the region -- and had then repeatedly launch kamikaze 
attacks on the aircraft carriers. And sank most of them. 
<p> That's a particularly ominous exercise since -- as the recent attacks in Bali 
and Kuwait also suggest -- there are plenty of people outside Iraq, and beyond 
Al-Qaeda, that would come after Americans should they attack Baghdad. Most will 
not be part of any nation's recognizable armed forces, and American soldiers will 
be surrounded, for a thousand or more miles in every direction, by countries that 
don't want its military forces there. Running an empire can be a lonely thing. 
<p> Without land bases, and without a reliable way to defend its aircraft carriers 
from guerrilla attacks, the United States is at an enormous tactical disadvantage 
in any invasion of Iraq. That's why the generals have been against this invasion 
for the last year. And polls repeatedly suggest that domestic support for an invasion 
would evaporate quickly if there are significant American casualties. That may, 
more than anything else, be why the Bush Administration is suddenly sounding less 
bellicose. If the whole point of invading Iraq is to demonstrate to the world 
the American capacity for bullying, failure would be catastrophic. Even an empire 
has its limits.
