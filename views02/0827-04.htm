<p>''I'M A PATIENT man,'' President Bush said the other day. He was dressed in 
cowboy clothes. ''And when I say I'm a patient man,'' he added, somewhat impatiently, 
''I mean I'm a patient man.'' The president was responding to reporters' attempts 
to make sense of the administration's scorching but confusing rhetoric about Iraq. 
His declaration of patience amended his declarations of war, seeking to douse 
expectations of imminent attack while promising that hostile action will come 
eventually.
<P>The nation is beholding something that can only be called weird. Ever since 
Bush announced his new doctrine of preventive war last spring, his administration 
has been engaged in an unprecedented war of words aimed at Saddam Hussein.</P>
<P>In the beginning, the justification for ''regime change'' in Baghdad was entirely 
a matter of the threat Hussein represents but no more. Now the justification includes 
protecting the integrity of threat. We have to go to war now because we said we 
would. Language is no longer an expression of purpose but the shaper of purpose.</P>
<P>The United States, in fact, is in a crisis of language. This is what it means 
to have a president who, proudly inarticulate, has no real understanding of the 
relationship between words and acts, between rhetoric and intention.</P>
<P>Consider his heated boast about his own patience. I saw his declaration on 
the evening news, and it was clear that, as he began that second sentence, seeking 
to emphasize the first, he meant to find another way of displaying his determination. 
But he was, as usual, at a literal loss for words. And so he fell back on empty 
repetition. ''When I say I'm a patient man, I mean I'm a patient man.''</P>
<P>Bush mistakes tautology for explanation, a habit of mind marking his entire 
administration. Bush governs by assertion instead of persuasion. Whether the United 
States seeks to exercise power over the Taliban, or over Sharon and Arafat, or 
over Russia, or over its European allies, or even over its own citizens, the method 
is the same. Washington doesn't waste a moment trying to persuade the Taliban 
to side with us against bin Laden. Washington rejects Arafat as a dialogue partner 
and forgoes any effort to influence Sharon. Washington presents Moscow with ultimatums 
on arms control treaties.</P>
<P>Washington rejects the International Criminal Court instead of trying to help 
shape its development. On the home front, Washington claims emergency martial 
law exemptions from traditional court procedures. In every case, Washington is 
avoiding the need to explain its position with the clarity and logic necessary 
to change minds and win support. Instead of convincing, Washington coerces. And 
why? Obviously, because Washington apes the style of a president who has no capacity 
for the use of language as a mode of leadership.</P>
<P>The problem comes when, having sought to lead through the imperative voice 
instead of the exhortatory or the explanatory, nothing changes.</P>
<P>The world is beginning to act like America's sullen teenager, refusing to obey 
orders. Bin Laden at large. The Middle East in escalation. A nuclear arms race 
on the cusp of resumption. A global summit in Johannesburg enraged at US arrogance. 
Even Europe openly contemptuous. And at home, Antrax killer unidentified. Citizens 
at risk. Economy shaken.</P>
<P>In the face of such failure, there is nothing for the imperative voice to do 
but grow louder. ''The level of threats has increased dramatically,'' a Human 
Rights Watch official observed, concerning recent US attacks on the ICC. ''And 
threat inflation is a sign of a policy gone amok.''</P>
<P>The post-9/11 mantra is ''United we stand.'' But not so. The United States 
is a splintered, lost country where words have been emptied of meaning. That is 
a symptom of post-traumatic stress syndrome, our national malady. We have been 
unable to give expression to terrible experiences. Our worst fears remain subliminal, 
but we recognize them in each other's eyes.</P>
<P>In mirroring this unarticulated desperation, our tautological president has 
been the perfect emblem of the American condition. He is the maestro of disconnect 
between words and experience. Having emptied the word ''evil'' of meaning (Iran 
is evil, but perhaps also our ally), Bush is now - incredibly - emptying the word 
''war'' of meaning, too.</P>
<P>His vacuous reflection of our mute anguish can be consoling because familiar 
- hence the high poll numbers - but it is the last thing the country needs. Mawkish 
bluster in cowboy clothes does nothing to nurture a community of purpose. It does 
the opposite.</P>
<P>As a candidate, Bush openly displayed his willful illiteracy. At a loss for 
words, and proud of it. Many voters were charmed. Others were appalled. Few understood, 
however, that this abdication of leadership by the intelligent use of language 
would be dangerous to democracy at home, a grievous threat to peace abroad.</P>
