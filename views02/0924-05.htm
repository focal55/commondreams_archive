<p>Last week <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0917-03.htm">I reported</a> 
that, with White House approval, U.S. officials -- acting in our name -- continued 
to supply Saddam Hussein with biochemical warfare ingredients until after the 
Gulf War.</p>
<p>But digging deeper into my stacks of source material on the murky matter, and 
after further discussions with several scientific sources of mine, there's some 
confusion as to when we actually stopped sending this deadly commerce.</p>
<p>The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs report, more commonly 
known as the Reigle report, says we last shipped a pathogen to Iraq on Nov. 28, 
1989.</p>
<p>However, as BusinessWeek reported last week, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention director sent former Sen. Donald Reigle a list of "all biological 
materials, including viruses, retroviruses, bacteria and fungi, which CDC provided 
to the government of Iraq from October 1, 1984, through October 13, 1993." The 
letter also reveals that the original list sent to Reigle's office failed to identify 
at least one other additional shipment.</p>
<p>But whether or not we stopped sending Saddam this stuff just before or just 
after the Gulf War is really beside the point. The fact remains that even after 
Saddam gassed the Kurds in 1988, the Bush administration thought it proper to 
keep sending these materials until at least a year after what is now Saddam's 
most infamous atrocity (though not his most heinous act).</p>
<p>In 1982 President Reagan removed Iraq from the list of states that sponsor 
terrorism, despite U.S. intelligence reports that Iraq was pursuing a biochemical 
warfare program, making the rogue nation eligible for dual-use and military technology.</p>
<p>And even though Reagan's Secretary of State George Schultz admits in his book 
"Turmoil and Triumph" that reports of Iraq using chemical weapons against Iranian 
troops first began "drifting in" at the end of 1983, he still helped to convince 
the National Security Council to sell Iraq 10 Bell helicopters that same year.</p>
<p>The helicopters were supposedly for crop spraying though it's now known that 
Iraq used them in the 1988 chemical attacks against the Kurds at Halabja.</p>
<p>Last week, the American Gulf War Veterans Association reported "that on December 
19, 1983, the Middle Eastern envoy who carried a handwritten note from President 
Reagan to Saddam Hussein to 'resume our diplomatic relations with Iraq' was none 
other than our present Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld." (See <a href="http://www.gulfwarvets.com/">www.gulfwarvets.com/</a> 
news11.htm).</p>
<p>The AGWVA also points out: "Probably the most critical piece of information 
is that according to Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward, in a December 15, 
1986 article, the CIA began to secretly supply Iraq with intelligence in 1984 
that was used to 'calibrate' mustard gas attacks on Iranian troops" -- meaning 
that Rumsfeld and company not only knew about the chemical warfare attacks but 
helped Iraq target the victims!</p>
<p>According to House Committee on Government Operations report "Strengthening 
the Export License System," from July 18 right up until the day Iraq invaded Kuwait, 
the Bush administration approved of $4.8 million in advanced technology product 
sales to Iraq -- the end-user being Iraq's Ministry of Industry and Military Industrialization 
(MIMI), which was identified in 1988 as a facility for Iraq's chemical, biological 
and nuclear weapons programs.</p>
<p>When Saddam was at the pinnacle of his power Rumsfeld and other hard-liners 
had no problem sitting down at the discussion table with one of the world's axis 
of evil. </p>
<p>But now, with Saddam's diminished military, it's considered appeasement to 
pursue weapons inspections and diplomatic efforts? Where's the logic in that?</p>
<p>Edward Peck, former chief of mission to Iraq and deputy director of the White 
House Task Force on Terrorism under Reagan, has this to say: "Our government is 
constantly saying that there must be discussions between parties in disagreement, 
to avoid or at least reduce the risk of war: India and Pakistan; North and South 
Korea; the Israelis and the Palestinians; the Protestants and the Catholics in 
Northern Ireland. So why don't we talk to Iraq?"</p>
<p>"This (current Bush policy) is not merely dynamic hypocrisy, it is shatteringly 
unwise. At the height of the Cold War, we knew the Soviet Union could, with the 
push of a button, eliminate us from the face of the Earth. That was a known, not 
hypothetical threat -- a real one. But we had an embassy in Moscow, and they had 
one here, not because we loved and trusted each other, but because we didn't. 
You lose nothing when you talk, but the failure to do so in this case may cost 
us dear."</p>
<p>Despite Peck's sound advice, I wouldn't be surprised if the Ashcroft alliance 
attempted to smear him as being a Saddam apologist or a blame-America-first terrorist 
sympathizer.</p>
<p>The Bush administration has a lot of explaining to do.</p>
<p>I just hope Congress has the courage to ask the difficult questions before 
they vote on a war resolution.</p>
