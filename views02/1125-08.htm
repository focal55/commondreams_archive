<p>Once again, America is a nation divided. 
<p> I'm not talking about the irreparable, brother-against-brother split between 
those who think the Bachelor should have proposed to Brooke instead of Helene. 
I'm talking about a contentious clash that is just beginning to rage. Call it 
the SUV war. As you read this, the opposing camps are staking out their turf. 
<p> On one side sales of the gas-guzzling, pollution-spewing, downright dangerous 
behemoths continue to soar. And apparently, the more fuel-inefficient the better: 
Dealers are having a hard time keeping up with the demand for the Hummer H2, GM's 
new $50,000 barely domesticated spin-off of the Gulf War darling, which struggles 
to cover 10 miles for every gallon of gas it burns. The symbolism of these impractical 
machines' military roots is too delicious to ignore. We go to war to protect our 
supply of cheap oil in vehicles that would be prohibitively expensive to operate 
without it. 
<p> There seems to be no shortage of Americans who think that consuming 25 percent 
of the world's oil just isn't enough. Maybe the next model, the H3, will need 
to be connected to an intravenous gas-pump hose all the time. And there would 
still be people eager to buy it. 
<p> These are the same folks who don't give a whit (this being a family newspaper) 
that at an OPEC meeting last month, the oily group's secretary general announced 
that one of the few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy world was the U.S.'s seemingly 
unslakable thirst for its product. How nice it must feel for SUV owners, knowing 
that their swaggering imprudence is helping the world's anti-democratic oil sheiks 
sleep just a little better at night. Call this camp the Bigger Is Better crowd. 
Their motto: "Burn, baby, burn...30 percent more carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons 
and 75 percent more nitrogen oxides than passenger cars." How about this for a 
bumper sticker: "Honk if you hate the Ozone layer!" 
<p> Lining up on the other side of the SUV DMZ are a disparate collection of groups 
and individuals whose aim is to win the hearts and minds -- and change the driving 
habits -- of the American public. 
<p> These include the <a href="http://www.creationcare.org/" target="_new">Evangelical 
Environmental Network</a>, which is promoting greater fuel-efficiency through 
a provocative TV ad campaign that asks: "What would Jesus drive?" Hint: I don't 
think the answer is a Hummer. (Turning water into oil wasn't really his thing.) 
This comes at the same time that Americans for Fuel Efficient Cars, a group I 
co-founded with film producer Lawrence Bender, environmental activist Laurie David, 
and movie and TV agent Ari Emanuel, is producing ads parodying the drugs-equal-terror 
ads the administration is running. In this case, we're linking driving SUVs to 
our national security. When Hollywood progressives and the "WWJD?" crowd independently 
hit on the same idea, you know that something is up. 
<p> Even as SUVs continue to roll off the assembly line and out of car dealers' 
showrooms at a record pace, there is a growing sense that the tide of public opinion 
is turning against these metal monstrosities. A tipping point in the push to wean 
ourselves from foreign oil has finally been reached. The SUV makers have won a 
few battles, but they may be about to lose the war. 
<p> The new mood is very similar to the consciousness-raising that followed the 
efforts of Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the Designated Driver campaign. Before 
that, the prevailing attitude was "hey, what's the big deal?" The campaign hammered 
home a very compelling answer to that question, and the public's perception of 
drinking and driving was changed forever. Getting loaded and getting behind the 
wheel went from being cool to being anti-social. With luck, getting behind the 
wheel of a loaded gas-guzzler is about to undergo the same transformation. 
<p> To see how the SUV fight is going, take a look at the media, usually an excellent 
weather vane when it comes to these kinds of societal shifts. In the last week 
alone there has been an explosion in the amount of positive coverage given to 
the anti-SUV movement, including segments on all the networks' nightly news shows. 
This is no small thing when you consider the mega-millions in advertising dollars 
the auto industry represents. 
<p> And in Washington, after steadfastly opposing any raise in fuel efficiency 
standards, the Bush administration let it be known last week that it is considering 
a proposal to increase the standard for light trucks and SUVs by 1.5 miles per 
gallon by 2007. 
<p> While Team Bush hailed the proposed boost as a major victory in the battle 
for energy independence, Sen. John Kerry, who along with Sen. John McCain last 
spring proposed raising the SUV standard by 50 percent, called the 7 percent increase 
"window dressing." Others labeled it "political theater" and "almost an insult 
in its modesty." A thousand dittos. 
<p> It does seem woefully inadequate -- especially when you consider how many 
loopholes have already been driven through by light trucks and SUVs, which are 
currently allowed to average 7 miles per gallon less than regular cars. And the 
ultimate absurdity is that if an SUV is massive enough, it is entirely exempt 
from federal fuel economy standards. That's right, build one with a gross vehicle 
weight of over 8,500 pounds -- like the Ford Excursion or the new Hummer -- and 
the leviathan's lousy gas mileage doesn't even have to be reported to the government. 
<p> Chew on that one and see if it doesn't rev your engine: automakers are rewarded 
for being particularly inefficient. There's the Bush Free Market for you. 
<p> Even the muckety-mucks in Detroit are starting to get the message. Ford, for 
instance, whose executives met last week with representatives from the "What Would 
Jesus Drive?" campaign, has pledged to boost the overall fuel efficiency of its 
SUVs by 25 percent over the next three years, and plans to introduce a hybrid 
gas-electric model that will get around 40 mpg. 
<p> Of course, much of the industry's "we care" message is little more than a 
desperate attempt to forestall the inevitable and put a pretty PR bow on a very 
ugly reality. Their real message is: "We care about making money, and if doing 
that now means we have to make it seem like we care about the environment, then 
so be it." Take, for example, this "faux" socially-conscious reminder offered 
in the new Hummer brochure: "With the power to cross any terrain comes the responsibility 
to protect that terrain and its potentially fragile ecosystems." 
<p> The war's not going the SUV makers' way, and they know it. So now they want 
to make it look like we're all on the same side. At the moment, they're trying 
to figure out just how far they have to go to quell the uprising. It's in all 
of our interests to let them know that a 1.5 mpg improvement is not enough. The 
consequences of our addiction to foreign oil are no longer an abstraction. </i></p>
