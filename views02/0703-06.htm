<p>NEW YORK -- The FBI's bumbling before Sept. 11 is water under the bridge. But 
the bureau's lackadaisical ineptitude in pursuing the anthrax killer continues 
to threaten America's national security by permitting him to strike again or, 
more likely, to flee to Iran or North Korea.
<p>Almost everyone who has encountered the FBI anthrax investigation is aghast 
at the bureau's lethargy. Some in the biodefense community think they know a likely 
culprit, whom I'll call Mr. Z. Although the bureau has carried out lie-detector 
tests on Mr. Z, searched his home twice and interviewed him four times, it has 
not placed him under surveillance or asked its outside handwriting expert to compare 
his writing with that on the anthrax letters.
<p>This is part of a larger pattern. Astonishingly, the FBI allowed the destruction 
of anthrax stocks at Iowa State University, losing what might have been valuable 
genetic clues. Then it waited until December to open the intact anthrax envelope 
it found. The FBI didn't obtain anthrax strains from various labs for comparison 
until March, and the testing is still not complete. The bureau did not systematically 
polygraph scientists at two suspect labs, Fort Detrick, Maryland, and Dugway Proving 
Ground in Utah, until a month ago.
<p>Perhaps it's a cheap shot for an armchair detective to whine about the caution 
of dedicated and exceptionally hard-working investigators. Yet months pass and 
the bureau continues to act like, well, a bureaucracy, plodding along in slow 
motion. People in the biodefense field first gave Mr. Z's name to the bureau as 
a suspect in October.
<p>He denies any wrongdoing, and his friends are heartsick at suspicions directed 
against a man they regard as a patriot. Some of his lie-detector tests show evasion, 
I hear, although that may be because of his temperament.
<p>If Mr. Z were an Arab national, he would have been jailed long ago. But he 
is a true-blue American with close ties to the Defense Department, the CIA and 
the U.S. biodefense program. On the other hand, he was once caught with a girlfriend 
in a biohazard &quot;hot suite&quot; at Fort Detrick, surrounded only by blushing 
germs.
<p>With many experts buzzing about Mr. Z behind his back, it's time for the FBI 
to make a move: Either it should go after him more aggressively, sifting thoroughly 
through his past and picking up loose threads, or it should seek to exculpate 
him and remove this cloud of suspicion.
<p>Whoever sent the anthrax probably had no intention of killing people; the letters 
warned recipients to take antibiotics. My guess is that the goal was to raise 
preparedness against future biological attacks.
<p>So it seems fair to ask the FBI a few questions:
<p>Do you know how many identities and passports Mr. Z has and are you monitoring 
his international travel? I have found at least one alias for him, and he has 
continued to travel abroad on government assignments, even to Central Asia.
<p>Why was his top security clearance suspended in August, less than a month before 
the anthrax attacks began? This move left him infuriated. Are the CIA and military 
intelligence agencies cooperating fully with the investigation?
<p>Have you searched the isolated residence that he had access to last autumn? 
The FBI has known about this building, and knows that Mr. Z gave Cipro, an antibiotic 
used to treat anthrax, to people who visited it. This property and many others 
are legally registered in the name of a friend of Mr. Z, but may be safe houses 
operated by U.S. intelligence.
<p>Have you examined whether Mr. Z has connections to the biggest anthrax outbreak 
among humans ever recorded, which sickened more than 10,000 black farmers in Zimbabwe 
from 1978 to 1980? There is evidence that the anthrax was released by the white 
Rhodesian army fighting against black guerrillas. Mr. Z has said that he participated 
in the white army's much-feared Selous Scouts. Could rogue elements of the American 
military have backed the Rhodesian army in anthrax and cholera attacks against 
blacks?
<p>Mr. Z's résumé also claims involvement in the former South African Defense 
Force; all else aside, who knew that the Defense Department would pick an American 
who had served in the armed forces of two white racist regimes to work in the 
U.S. biodefense program with some of the world's deadliest germs?
<p>What now? When do you shift into high gear?
