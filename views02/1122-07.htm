<p>In a letter to both houses of Congress in early October, AFL-CIO president 
John Sweeney broke what had been Big Labor's public silence on a possible war 
with Iraq when he wrote, "We must assure them that war is the last option, not 
the first." Sweeney also questioned the timing of the Bush Administration's push 
for war, saying it "has as much to do with the political calendar as with the 
situation in Iraq." </p>
<p> The letter was hardly a call to stiff antiwar resistance. But with an American 
labor movement long accustomed to interpreting the subtle political nuances of 
its cautious leadership, Sweeney's message was nonetheless unmistakable. The federation 
was openly shifting away from its markedly prowar stance after September 11 and 
offering at least some cover for militant action by antiwar elements in its ranks. 
"It wasn't the strongest statement in the world," says Michael Letwin, co-convener 
of the grassroots New York City Labor Against the War (NYCLAW). "But it makes 
people in the labor movement feel they now have some room to oppose the war." 
</p>
<p> That same week, Gene Bruskin, the secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO's food 
and allied service trades department, sent a letter of his own to Sweeney urging 
organized labor to take the lead in opposing the Administration's war plans. Bruskin 
said labor has been "naive at best" in trying to oppose Bush's domestic policy 
without more forcefully opposing its foreign policy. War with Iraq, he argued, 
would only provide the Administration with increased leverage in pressing a conservative 
agenda that conflicts with the interests of working Americans. "To support the 
War," Bruskin said, "is to invite all the inevitable political and economic effects." 
</p>
<p> Bruskin's call for the national labor leadership to speak out more consistently 
and loudly on the issue has not yet been heeded. "All of our energy really went 
into the midterm elections," says one AFL official. "Maybe now with the Republicans 
controlling everything, we can better find our voice on the issue of war and peace." 
</p>
<p> In the meantime, a small but determined network of antiwar labor activists 
is coming together and making its voice and influence felt through organized lobbying 
inside the Central Labor Councils and state labor federations. Letwin's NYCLAW 
is among the largest of the groupings, with endorsements from about 1,400 union 
members and sixteen current and former union presidents. "We're trying to be both 
an antiwar pole in the labor movement and a labor pole within the peace movement," 
says Letwin. </p>
<p> But an objective evaluation would conclude that so far only the former is 
being achieved. Peace is still very much a minority position within the greater 
world of labor, and so labor is still a minor part of the peace movement. The 
bulk of NYCLAW's support comes from white-collar, mostly intellectual workers 
like Letwin's own local of legal-aid attorneys. The school principals' union, 
the National Writers Union, museum workers and university staff and professors 
are also among the major players in the New York antiwar network. </p>
<p> Yet, the small peace circle within labor continues to expand as the threat 
of war with Iraq persists. New York's powerful healthcare union, 1199SEIU, recently 
bought a full-page ad in the <i>New York Times</i> unequivocally condemning war 
with Iraq. Chicago-based Teamsters Local 705, the second largest in the country, 
also adopted an antiwar resolution. The 100,000-member California Teachers Union 
did the same. And on October 1 the executive committee of AFL-CIO's Pride at Work, 
representing gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender members, followed suit. In 
Northern California the SEIU's large and politically influential Local 250 has 
also condemned a unilateral attack on Iraq and urged cooperation with the UN. 
And there's open talk that the SEIU might become the first national union to take 
an antiwar stance. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, rank-and-file groups similar to NYCLAW have sprung up in Albany, 
Washington, Detroit, Portland and Seattle. And while the uniformly progressive 
San Francisco Labor Council went firmly on the record against Bush's overall war 
on terrorism in August, its activists also fuel the very involved San Francisco 
Labor Committee for Peace and Justice. </p>
<p> But the growth of antiwar activity is uneven and is leaving some gaping holes. 
In Los Angeles, where the county federation has earned a progressive reputation 
on local and domestic issues, there have been no antiwar initiatives coming from 
the leadership. "You can sense a real antiwar sentiment in the union halls," says 
a local SEIU organizer. "But apart from individuals trying to hook up with each 
other, there's been no real attempt at significant organized action." </p>
<p> Similar stories come from other urban labor councils. When George W. Bush 
came to Cincinnati in October to deliver a televised policy statement on Iraq, 
about 3,500 protesters rallied outside. But only about 150 of the demonstrators 
came from the ranks of organized labor. "A lot of our community coalition partners 
were at that demonstration," says Dan Radford, a member of SEIU Local 7 (Firefighters 
and Oilers) and executive secretary-treasurer of the Cincinnati Central Labor 
Council. "But it hasn't really come up as an issue at the council. It's sort of 
funny because even some of the more conservative unions have not shown much enthusiasm 
for Bush on this war with Iraq. But at the council level it's just not been discussed 
very much at all." Indeed, Radford says, the most dynamic local antiwar figure 
comes not from labor but from show business. Television ringmaster Jerry Springer, 
a former liberal mayor of Cincinnati, gave the most fiery antiwar speech at a 
recent Democratic get-out-the-vote rally. </p>
<p> In Seattle, the King County Labor Council, which played a high-profile role 
in the 1999 protests against the World Trade Organization, took the opposite tack 
and has actively endorsed antiwar activity. The council's executive secretary-treasurer 
Steve Williamson was a lead speaker at the October 26 Seattle peace rally, which 
brought out as many as 5,000 people. </p>
<p> "The national [AFL-CIO] didn't really want to deal with this issue, after 
pretty much supporting whole hog the war in Afghanistan," says Steve Hoffman, 
a member of the municipal employees' union who also holds a seat on the King County 
Labor Council and is a leader of Seattle's Organized Labor Against the War. "But 
now they see the way the war has been used to cut jobs, to call in the government 
on the ports strike, just the amount of money being spent on this. The AFL is 
finally coming under pressure from below, with more and more peace resolutions 
being passed at the level of county labor councils and those being proposed inside 
the international unions." </p>
<p> Hoffman helped to ratchet up that pressure by shepherding a successful antiwar 
resolution through to adoption in August by the 500 delegates and guests of the 
Washington State Labor Council, the first such statewide statement. </p>
<p> The limited appeal of antiwar activity within unions is not only the responsibility 
of labor's cautious leadership, but also of the peace movement in general and 
of some peace activists within labor, who have made a few strategic missteps. 
Many of the labor activists in the forefront of the Iraq peace movement are the 
same people who unsuccessfully tried to jump-start a similar movement in the immediate 
wake of the 9/11 attacks. Seriously misreading the sentiment of mainstream labor, 
which believed that at least some sort of limited US military response was in 
order, these mostly white-collar and ideologically left activists tried to drum 
up a movement to oppose intervention in Afghanistan. On September 27, 2001--just 
two weeks after the attacks and while the national and New York AFL-CIO were still 
actively mourning the death of hundreds of members in them--activists from NYCLAW, 
for example, had already issued their first public statement opposing any sort 
of US military action. </p>
<p> "This was really way off base," says a politically progressive AFL official 
close to John Sweeney. "No matter what one's personal political opinion, you really 
had to be out in left field to not understand the angry patriotism that was rippling 
through labor. We had just lost something like 500 guys, and no one was in the 
mood to go light candles at a peace vigil." </p>
<p> NYCLAW's Letwin concedes that the rushed September 27 peace statement by his 
group was looked on as "tainted" because of its timing. But, he argues, "I think 
that along with a lot of union leadership, a lot of the grassroots saw that as 
a good statement. They were saying to themselves, 'I'm not going to sign it, but 
I'm glad someone is out there saying these things.'" </p>
<p> Maybe, but in any case, many at the top of the federation agree that the Iraq 
situation is very different from Afghanistan, and they recognize that there is 
now a lot more visible and vocal discomfort with and opposition to the White House's 
overseas plans. "Also, the elections are now over," says the federation official. 
"And if the Democrats take a harder line against the war than they have so far, 
labor will be more willing to do the same. But that leaves open the question of 
just what peace movement we are comfortable being part of." </p>
<p> That's a reference to discomfort with those currently orchestrating some of 
the highest-profile antiwar protests. While demonstrations in Washington and San 
Francisco brought out scores of thousands with an eclectic range of politics, 
the protests were organized and the podium dominated by a small, sectarian Stalinist 
group, the Workers World Party. Consequently, while much of the demonstration 
rhetoric was against the war, it was also tinged with an anti-Americanism and 
loaded down with ancillary issues ranging from support for convicted murderers 
Mumia Abu-Jamal and H. Rap Brown to sometimes paranoid condemnations of Zionism 
that in no way resonate with the bulk of organized labor. No doubt the rally crowds 
were peppered with hundreds, if not thousands, of union members and activists, 
but there was no institutional representation of Big Labor, as there has been 
at numerous antiglobalization events of the past few years. </p>
<p> "John Sweeney is no George Meany," says the AFL official, referring to former 
federation president Meany's aggressive support for the Vietnam War. And he notes 
that significant participation by labor in the peace movement would, indeed, aid 
in broadening and mainstreaming the antiwar message, pushing some of the sectarians 
to the side. But, he added, that moment is not yet upon us. "It's not at all unthinkable 
that in the weeks to come we will see Sweeney speaking out more against the war. 
But you can be sure he isn't going to be speaking from the same stage as the Workers 
World Party."</p>
