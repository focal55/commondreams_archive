<p>''MY DEAR FELLOW citizens,'' Vaclav Havel said in his inaugural address as 
Czech president, ''for 40 years on this day you heard from my predecessors the 
same thing in a number of variations: how our country is flourishing, how many 
millions of tons of steel we produce, how happy we all are, how we trust our government, 
and what prospects lie ahead of us. I assume you did not propose me for this office 
so that I, too, should lie to you.''
<P>That was 1990. It seems a quaint time, back when public lying was defined as 
one of the key differences between the Soviet empire and America. Public lying 
is now revealed as endemic to what capitalism has become in the United States, 
with Havel's summary of the Stalinist deceptions reading like a standard CEO report 
to shareholders. This discovery of a basic dishonesty in the heart of ''free enterprise'' 
can shock us into moral maturity.</P>
<P>The worst effect of the Cold War on the American mind was the bipolar thinking 
it encouraged. We allowed ourselves to believe that the world could be divided 
between the essentially virtuous and the radically evil. We operated for a generation 
on the assumption that human beings behind the Iron Curtain were in the grip of 
Satan, while those of us in the West were entrusted ''here on earth,'' as John 
Kennedy put it in his inaugural, with God's own work. Thus, we defined Kremlin 
intentions as imperialist expansionism, while our own global reach aimed only 
at ''containment.'' That we spent the bulk of our treasure and the best of our 
intellectual effort preparing to blow up the world seemed, in the moral alchemy 
of deterrence, an act of high virtue. Not trusting Soviet signatures on treaties 
or imagining the mundane good will of Russian people, we were certain that the 
totalitarian enemy could be brought down only by eventual world violence. Simplistic 
moral thinking is always apocalyptic.</P>
<P>We knew, meanwhile, that we and our leaders were capable of lying, but in the 
American narrative, public deceptions - Watergate - have been counted as exceptions 
which proved the rule of American innocence. Jimmy Carter, in running for office 
on the slogan ''I will never lie to you,'' made explicit what we expect from presidents 
- and from everyone in authority. And was the self-anointed nation ever more itself 
than in feeling morally superior to the disgraced Bill Clinton?</P>
<P>But the main moral failure of CEOs - and US presidents - does not consist in 
the conscious venality of thinking one thing while saying another. The disorder 
is deeper than that, for it is far more likely that such leaders are convinced 
of the false justifications they offer. That the justifications are profoundly 
self-serving, of course, is part of why the leaders are convinced. When George 
W. Bush recently broke America's promise on the ABM treaty, that did not make 
us a nation of liars, he told us, but of realists. And, incidentally, his sole-power 
agenda was advanced.</P>
<P>The pattern is wide. Executives who want only to put the numbers ''in a better 
light'' end by cooking the books. Politicians who harmlessly aim to tell voters 
what they want to hear wind up having no core grasp of what is true. Religious 
leaders who maintain the appearance of virtue as an absolute value lose the capacity 
to recognize their own fallibility. But in all of this, such figures are behaving 
only like members of the human species, for the tendency toward grievous self-deception 
is universal.</P>
<P>Thus, lifetime partners can go years without realizing they have no intimacy. 
The overweight can fool themselves about their health problem. Drinkers can deny 
what their lives have become. Compulsive workers can enslave themselves to a false 
dream of success. Life-wrecking depression can pass itself off as selfless worry. 
Greed can seem like ambition. The pursuit of happiness is killing us. The most 
damaging lies are the ones we tell ourselves.</P>
<P>Today's nationwide rude awakening understandably prompts broad outrage at deceptive 
leaders, but that must not be our only response. During the Cold War we exempted 
ourselves from the kind of moral scrutiny that could have prevented the spreading 
of this poison cloud. The lies of business (Madison Avenue), of government (the 
Missile Gap), of culture (Forever Young), and of religion (God Bless America) 
were built into our system, but we could not see them as lies because of the split 
in our thinking. In this time of ethical reckoning, will we again smugly divide 
the world between the good and the evil?</P>
<P>Yes, we can insist on a purging of public lies - a true reform. But we repeat 
a major blunder if we conclude that the problem of self-serving deception belongs 
to someone else. ''When I talk about the contaminated moral atmosphere,'' Havel 
presumed to tell his fellow citizens, ''I mean all of us.''</P>
