<p>THE U S CONGRESS has now passed a resolution authorizing President Bush to 
use force against Iraq. The most frequently cited reason was the possibility that 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein may soon acquire a nuclear weapon. Since we ourselves 
own <i> thousands </i>of nuclear weapons, it seems odd to cite the <i> future 
</i>existence of a <i> single </i>nuclear weapon in another country as the basis 
for attacking that country.
<P>Our senators and representatives have described Saddam 's nuclear weapon (which 
does not yet exist) as ''terrible,'' ''monstrous,'' ''hideous.''</P>
<P>This vocabulary of moral indignation seems appropriate, but it is not one we 
often apply to our own nuclear weapons. Many other countries<i> do</i>, of course, 
describe America's nuclear arsenal in the vocabulary of moral alarm.</P>
<P>In 1995, 78 countries from the UN General Assembly asked the International 
Court of Justice to provide a judgment about the illegality and inhumanity of 
nuclear weapons. Did the United States urge the International Court of Justice 
to declare such weapons illegal or morally impermissible?</P>
<P>On the contrary. The United States filed a formal statement, coauthored by 
the Department of State and the Department of Defense, defending the legality 
of nuclear weapons. It argued that <i> owning </i>nuclear weapons was not illegal. 
It argued that <i> threatening </i>to use nuclear weapons was not illegal. It 
argued that <i> using </i>those nuclear weapons - even <i> using </i>them <i> 
first </i>- was not illegal.</P>
<P>Many countries addressing the International Court expressed their conviction 
that international covenants, treaties, and protocols are violated by the possession, 
threatened use, or use of nuclear weapons. Sweden, Iran, and Egypt each noted 
that weapons that inflict disproportionate suffering are prohibited by the 1868 
Declaration of St. Petersburg and the Geneva Protocols of 1925, 1949, and 1977. 
</P>
<P>The Republic of the Marshall Islands - reminding the court that atolls such 
as Bikini are still contaminated by the 66 atomic bombs the United States tested 
there - argued that nuclear weapons also violate the 1907 Hague Conventions prohibiting 
weapons whose effects trespass across the borders of neutral countries. India 
focused on the many ways in which nuclear weapons fail to follow ''rules of proportionality'' 
in international warfare and argued that nuclear weapons violate the United Nations 
Charter itself, whose fundamental purpose is to restrict force. Japan - describing 
itself as ''the only country to have suffered nuclear attack'' - argued that nuclear 
weapons contradict the philosophic foundations underlying international law. </P>
<P>The United States argued the opposite. It enumerated and rejected as inapplicable 
to nuclear weapons each and every international protocol, treaty, declaration, 
and human rights instrument intended to diminish suffering, as well as covenants 
intended to protect the earth, such as the 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection 
of the Ozone Layer, and the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment.</P>
<P>What about the UN Charter restricting force? The United States acknowledged 
that the UN General Assembly has passed many resolutions declaring nuclear weapons 
''contrary to the UN Charter.'' But it then dismissed these resolutions, telling 
the court that ''the General Assembly does not have the authority to `legislate' 
or create legally binding obligations on its members.'' </P>
<P>Finally, what about the 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment 
of the Crime of Genocide? In its written statement to the court, the United States 
argued that ''the deliberate killing of large numbers of people'' counts as genocide 
only if the aggressor sets out to destroy ''in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, 
racial, or religious group, as such.''</P>
<P>US nuclear weapons exist; Iraqi nuclear weapons don't. US nuclear weapons number 
in the thousands; Iraq's count is zero. US weapons are (in the official view of 
the country) compatible with all international laws; Iraq's not yet acquired weapon 
is monstrous.</P>
<P>During the past year, President Bush has repeatedly announced his readiness 
to carry out a ''preemptive'' or ''preventive'' strike but has not specified the 
means. Should we feel certain that he would <i> never </i>use a nuclear weapon? 
During his June 1 speech at West Point, he appeared to set his announcement of 
a ''preemptive strike'' in a nuclear context by invoking the country's former 
nuclear strategy of ''massive retaliation'' and rejecting it as too little too 
late.</P>
<P>If we believe nuclear weapons are hideous, we should urge the president and 
Congress to state explicitly their pledge that they will not use such weapons. 
In the long run, we need to work to eliminate these weapons rather than holding 
an implausible and increasingly dangerous double standard.</P>
