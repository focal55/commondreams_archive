<P>WILLIAMSTOWN, MASS. -- As Senate hearings get under way, Americans are beginning 
to work through their doubts about the prospect of war with Iraq.</P>
<P>Commentators from right to left, as well as senior US military officials, have 
expressed concerns: the risks of extended combat and significant loss of American 
soldiers; the possibility of Saddam Hussein using weapons of mass destruction; 
the costs of a large-scale campaign.</P>
<P>A possible "Baghdad first" attack strategy, as reported Monday in the New York 
Times, seems designed to minimize concerns about scale, but says little about 
the deeper political questions over war with Iraq.</P>
<P>War supporters respond to doubters with a seemingly irresistible argument: 
What is the alternative? Do you really want Mr. Hussein to get weapons of mass 
destruction and give them to terrorists or threaten his neighbors? This objection 
is far less overwhelming than it may appear. Most commentators seem too cowed 
by the array of politicians and pundits favoring war to make the obvious response: 
Do nothing.</P>
<P>Does Iraq really pose such an urgent threat? Its neighbors &#150; Turkey, Jordan, 
even Kuwait &#150; seem unconcerned, as they publicly decline a role in the war. 
While they would probably go along with a US war in the end, they fervently hope 
it does not come to that. In their eyes, the urgency comes from Washington, not 
Baghdad.</P>
<P>Weapons of mass destruction? The final report of the UN Special Commission 
(UNSCOM) in 1999 states that Iraq did try to acquire weapons of mass destruction, 
and worked hard to frustrate UNSCOM's disarmament mission. The report also makes 
clear that UNSCOM succeeded to a remarkable degree in finding and destroying Iraqi 
nuclear and chemical weapons programs. The one area of doubt is biological weapons. 
Perhaps Iraq has reconstituted its weapons programs, as the war partisans claim. 
But if the Bush administration had any evidence, beyond the shadowy defectors 
desperate to be useful to the US, it would have been leaked by now.</P>
<P>Is the war on terrorism a good reason to take on Iraq? The Bush administration 
has failed to find evidence connecting Hussein with Al Qaeda. Recent efforts to 
make the link, such as a PBS documentary, offered remarkably little evidence.</P>
<P>But, war partisans respond, the US has a mission, to rid the world of evil 
threats. If the US backs down, they argue, Hussein wins. Set aside the point that 
it is war proponents' rhetoric that has placed the US in such an unenviable position, 
where Hussein only has to survive to win.</P>
<P>Will the world lose respect for America if it does not fight this war? No. 
Most of the world desperately hopes the US comes to its senses. Even British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair has repeatedly declared in recent days that no decision for 
war has yet been made. Rather than talk ourselves into an unnecessary war, why 
not take the path of leadership?</P>
<P>Say what most of the world thinks: Iraq is beneath us. Ignore it. UN sanctions 
will keep Iraq from acquiring military items, and if implemented sincerely might 
ease the suffering of the Iraqi people. Such a gesture would remove one of the 
greatest complaints of the Arab and Islamic world, and would make the campaign 
against terrorism more winnable.</P>
<P>And Hussein? He knows perfectly well that one false move would be his last.</P>
<P><I>Marc Lynch, a professor of political science at Williams College, just spent 
six weeks in the Arab world. He is writing a book about Iraq.</I></P>
