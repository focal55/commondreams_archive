<p>What a relief the last few days to see the Democratic Party behaving like a 
virtual non-Republican organ. And just in time for the 4th of July! Who would 
have guessed? 
<p>What I'm referring to is the belated (about a decade or so) outrage of Democrats 
at George W. Bush's cherry picking of shareholders' cash back in '89. In case 
you hadn't heard (an understandable condition given the laziness and/or complicity 
of the mainstream press, the Democrats and the SEC) our nation's CEO, when he 
was still just a no-account son-of-a-Bush back in '85, was bailed out of a failing 
oil venture by his father's friends at Harken Energy. Despite his miserable performance 
as an oil exec, he was appointed to the board of Harken, and sat on their audit 
committee. That's how it works when your pop is VP. 
<p>Then, about 4 years later, two months before Harken's stock was about to tank 
because of undisclosed losses and sham accounting, Bush the Lesser dumped his 
holdings for about $850,000. Nice "work", if you can get it. Harken stock lost 
about 75% of its value within 8 months of Bush' windfall. And 8 months is how 
tardy his report of the deed to the SEC was. Charges? Zip. Justice? Nada. Sorry 
little people, Dubya had a baseball team to buy into and then a couple of government 
plums to pick...plus, his Dad's the President now. Better luck next time. 
<p>This story would make hamburger out of anybody who wanted to run for dogcatcher, 
let alone Governor of a Really Big State or de facto Ruler of the Earth, right? 
Especially since it has more substance than several Whitewaters, right? Well, 
it would...unless your opponents were New Democrats and unless the major media 
outlets were owned by people who would profit from your election. In that case, 
it would be just another moot point, a red herring, a political low road that 
decent candidates and reporters don't stoop to travel. So if you are a high-roller 
looking to scam the globe unimpeded, then it is best to be a Republican. If, on 
the other hand, you are a careerist enabler, then the "New" Democrats (not to 
be confused with "Old" Republicans...unless you actually listen to them) is your 
party, my friend. 
<p>Absurd? Think back to the vice-presidential debate in 2000 when Dick Cheney 
made the ludicrous assertion that his firm, Halliburton, was never the recipient 
of government largess. New Dem Joe Leiberman could have easily skewered him on 
any number of government-aided Halliburton deals, but he only chuckled like a 
rube who had been caught bluffing in a friendly poker game. Or how about Gore's 
refusal to highlight Bush's disappearance during his last year of "service" in 
the National Guard? Isn't Dereliction of Duty an appropriate topic in a Presidential 
campaign? 
<p>So it's with curiosity that we witness Terry McAuliffe, head New Democrat and 
DNC chair, highlighting the Harken scandal these many years later (after a tailor-made 
situation presented itself) to call the Thief in Chief to account. This is, after 
all, what real opposition parties do; they oppose. But no matter how encouraging 
it is to see the DNC chair doing his job, there's one big problem here: hypocrisy. 
<p>Yes, well all know that for George W. to stand up like a televangelist and 
piously rail against corporate corruption is the height of hypocrisy. But for 
Terry McAuliffe to piously rail against Bush for the same reason is hypocrisy's 
depth. The Chairman, you see, is no stranger to shady deals and dump trucks full 
of cash. After all, he's arguably the most successful raiser and distributor of 
soft-money, the gangrene of American politics. Moreover, his office helped convince 
the FEC to gut the new McCain/Feingold soft-money ban last month. (There have 
been mincing denials of this, but we don’t see the DNC joining in the suit against 
the FEC to restore the law, do we?) And then, there's Global Crossings. 
<p>Global Crossings is the fiber optic outfit that went from nothing, to multi-mega, 
to bankrupt in the span of four or five years. Gary Winnick, GC's CEO is (or was) 
a good friend and heavy contributor to the Clinton/McAuliffe political cartel, 
just as Enron's Ken Lay is (or was) to George W. Bush. The company was awarded 
a huge defense contract just as it was about to go bankrupt, but the contract 
was later called back because of allegations of irregular bidding processes. Terry 
McAuliffe channeled massive sums from Global Crossings to the Democratic coffers, 
and during the process made himself about $18 million --180 times his investment 
-- from Global Crossing's stock in about three years. He sold when the stock was 
worth around $60. It fell to less than a buck. Congress is "investigating" both 
Enron and Global Crossings. Heading up the Senate investigations is that fearsome 
debater and McAuliffe pal, Joe Leiberman. Meanwhile, Enron and GC employees and 
shareholders are suing for the loss of their pensions and life savings. Oh, and 
two more things: Global Crossings' accountant was Arthur Andersen, and sham transactions 
were involved. The little people were again left holding the bag. 
<p>And speaking of Enron, whatever happened to that monster scandal? Remember 
earlier this year, McAuliffe pumping it (like the Harken Energy scandal), saying, 
“The people out there who are hurt the most are the small people, and once again 
the wealthy special interests got to take their money off the table and that’s 
what we need to investigate.” (mid-January interview on CNN) About a week later, 
the Global Crossings story broke, and Enron fell off of the DNC radar screen...despite 
the indisputable smoking gun of the California energy manipulation scheme: a traceable 
$30 billion theft, abetted in public by George W. Bush and Dick Cheney! 
<p>So step down, Terry. No one can take you seriously when you preach against 
"the wealthy special interests." We have met the enemy and they are...just like 
you.</p>
