<p> OF ALL the absurdities I observed during the Republican presidential convention 
in 2000, the most ridiculous was a big button worn by many female delegates, which 
proclaimed: "W stands for women." 
<P>What a joke -- now a cruel one that will kill thousands of women and children 
in 142 countries. 
<P>Tuesday, after seven months of maybe-yes/maybe-no, the Bush administration 
announced that it has withdrawn the State Department's proposed contribution of 
$34 million to the United Nations Population Fund, or UNFPA. 
<P>Despite ultra-conservatives' allegations, the fund does not provide or support 
abortion as part of its global medical and family planning services. What it does 
do is give millions of poor women gynecological care and contraception and prevent 
teen pregnancies and the spread of HIV/AIDS. 
<P>According to UNFPA's executive director, Thoraya Obaid, our $34 million would 
have prevented 2 million unwanted pregnancies and more than 77,000 infant and 
child deaths. 
<P>Long a proponent of the fund, Secretary of State Colin Powell told Congress 
last year that the program's work is "invaluable" and "provides critical population 
assistance to developing countries." Which makes Powell's sudden flip-flop and 
tortured explanation for denying the fund nothing short of shameful. 
<P>In April and May, official government fact-finding teams from Great Britain 
and the United Sates travelled to China and found "no evidence that the (U.N. 
fund) has knowingly supported or participated in the management of a program of 
coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in the PRC." But Tuesday Powell 
said China was the reason he "must" deny aid to every country that is served by 
the fund. 
<P>Chinese law, said Powell, imposes severe penalties upon its citizens if they 
violate the country's one-child-per-couple statute. Such threatened punishment 
often forces Chinese women to choose abortion or sterilization -- a practice that 
has been roundly condemned and never, never supported by the UNFPA. 
<P>U.S. law, said Powell, in the form of the Kemp-Kasten amendment of 1985, prohibits 
the United States from funding any entity that "supports or participates in the 
management or a program of coercive abortion." 
<P>But if the UNFPA doesn't engage in such coercive activities in China or anywhere 
else -- as the State Department's own investigators have determined -- why deny 
it our $34 million? Because, said Powell, the fund works with the coercive Chinese 
government, and that is enough to "trigger" Kemp-Kasten. 
<P>Said Powell: "Regardless of the the size of UNFPA's budget in China or any 
benefits its programs provide, UNFPA's support of, and involvement in, China's 
population-planning activities allows the Chinese government to implement more 
effectively its program of coercive abortion." 
<P>It's funny how aiding and abetting the Chinese government's abortion policies 
-- or any of its human rights policies -- never comes up when the question is 
whether to grant the country most favored nation trading status. It only matters 
when money is earmarked for contraception and health care for poor women. 
<P>Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Senate Foreign Operations 
Committee, recognized Powell's flip-flop and twisted verbiage for just what it 
is: a sellout to the anti-abortion faction that donated and turned out big- time 
for Bush in 2000. 
<P>Calling the funding withdrawal "an embarrassment and a travesty," Leahy said 
it "flies in the face of the facts, of the law and of the intent of Congress." 
<P>And he added a sad-but-true observation that makes all those "W stands for 
Women" buttons seem even more absurd: 
<P>"In calculated pursuit of the politics of abortion, the White House has chosen 
a course that will mean more abortions."</p>
