<p><i>&quot;You must remember one thing. At the Constitutional level where we work, ninety percent of any decision is emotional. The rational part of us supplies the reason for supporting our predilections.&quot;<br>
</i>
Charles Evans Hughes, Chief Justice, US Supreme Court (1930-1941)
<P>In 2000, when the pampered son of a wealthy family needed a little election help, a majority of the US Supreme Court bent over backwards to answer the call. In a convoluted decision that clearly violated well-established precedents and practices the Court sidelined vaunted principles of judicial conservatism. The majority asserted that George W. Bush's constitutional rights trumped the republican prerogatives of the Florida Supreme Court and the constitutional rights of Floridians and other Americans to a full and accurate vote count in Florida. In response, the minority registered vigorous dissent.
 
<P>In 2002, when four elderly public housing tenants needed help stopping unjust, guilt-by-association evictions the Supreme Court turned its back. The case elicited not a peep of dissent from any "liberal" members of the Court let alone any "compassionate conservatives." The eight Court members--let's not call them "Justices"--who took part in the decision gave short shrift to legal concerns with the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) "One Strike and You're Out" policy.
 
<P>Rooted earlier in another of America's endless wars--the "War on Drugs"--the policy got its teeth and catchy name in 1996, when it was announced by that paragon of personal virtue and compassion, Bill Clinton. Since then, HUD has enforced the "One Strike" policy based on an interpretation that the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 permits public housing authorities to evict any tenant for: "Any drug-related criminal activity on or off" the tenant's public housing premises committed by "any member of the household, a guest, or another person under the tenant's control" regardless of whether the tenant was involved in or aware of the activity. A better name for this policy might be "One Strike and Everyone is Out."
 
<P>The "One Strike" policy prompted litigation across the country. The four cases that led to last week's Supreme Court decision in <i>HUD v. Rucker et al.</i> resulted from evictions undertaken by the Oakland Housing Authority (OHA). 64-year-old Pearlie Rucker's mentally impaired daughter was caught with cocaine three blocks from their apartment. The teenaged grandsons (who had no previous arrests) of Willie Lee, 72, and Barbara Hill, 64, were caught smoking marijuana in the parking lot of the complex they lived in with their grandmothers. Herman Walker, 76, is partially paralyzed and has breathing, walking, and hearing impairments. On three occasions, a live-in caregiver and/or guests were found in possession of cocaine or narcotics paraphernalia in Walker's apartment. The OHA never alleged that any of the tenants had participated in or had any knowledge of the "drug-related criminal activity" that occasioned the eviction proceedings against them.
 
<P>Before coming to the Supreme Court the cases were appealed to the full bench of Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld, by a vote of 7-to-4, a district court's order halting the evictions. The Appeals Court found: 1) The law HUD relied upon "is not a picture of clarity and may be subject to varying interpretations" but that Congress apparently did not intend that it "apply to the eviction of innocent tenants;" 2) The legislative history clearly demonstrated that "HUD's interpretation [was] contrary to the clearly expressed intent of Congress;" 3) HUD's interpretation would lead to an impermissible "absurd" or "unjust" result; and, 4) HUD's interpretation raised serious constitutional due process issues.
 
<P>The short Supreme Court opinion, written by the chief of the Court, William Rehnquist, stated there was plainly nothing ambiguous about the law in question. Having deftly swept away any ambiguity Rehnquist declined to consider the legislative history and Congressional intent. Next, he asserted, "It is not absurd that a local housing authority may sometimes evict a tenant who had no knowledge of the drug-related activity." Finally, accusing the Court of Appeals of "another effort to avoid the plain meaning of the statute," Rehnquist dismissed any constitutional concerns claiming they had "no application in the absence of statutory ambiguity."
 
<P>The US Constitution gives the Supreme Court "judicial Power [in] all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under . . . the Laws of the United States." <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> says that equity "denotes the spirit and habit of fairness, justness, and right dealing." If the Supreme Court couldn't conscientiously affirm the appeals court's decision on any strictly legal basis, then they should have invoked equitable principles to stop the evictions--the "One Strike" policy against innocent tenants is blatantly unfair and unjust.
 
<P>Instead, the Court affirmed the eviction of innocent public housing tenants as official federal policy. As noted in a friend of the court brief by the Lindesmith Center, the decision will undoubtedly result in increased homelessness for a significant number of the nation's most vulnerable people. In short, the Court's decision represents nothing less than an egregious failure of justice and humanity. That the Court was utterly unable to arrive at a just and humane result reveals much about the "emotional" makeup and "predilections" of its members.
