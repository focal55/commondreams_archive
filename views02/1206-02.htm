<p>Walking down a busy street in downtown Washington recently, I began 
to hear interesting words coming from an excitable conversation between 
two gentlemen briskly walking behind me.  "Do you have any idea what is 
emerging?," one said to the other.  "We're perfecting the robo-candidate 
from Washington, DC and making it seem like it's local."
    <p>It turned out the latest robo-candidate they were talking about was 
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Suzanne Haik Terrell who, at this 
writing, is in a runoff race with Louisiana Democrat, Senator Mary 
Landrieu."We now can select the candidate from any state to beat the 
Democrats, frame the issues, convey the slogans, raise the money, buy 
the tv ads and even provide the robo-rebuttals for the debates."  Hah, 
hah, hah, whopee, said the fast walking fellow who was the younger of 
the two.
    <p>The other fellow was no less exuberant.  He added: "And we bring in 
Bush and Air Force One for the finale with total media coverage totally 
unchallenged.  It's working again and again.  The Dems are in a panic, 
falling all over themselves to agree with the President.  Landrieu even 
has a television ad showing how many times she agrees with Bush."  As 
they turned the corner, they couldn't stop laughing.
    <p>The duo was actually understating what the Republicans are doing to 
the Democrats who years ago forgot who they were.  All kinds of national 
Republicans -- Vice President Cheney, Urban Development Secretary Mel R. 
Martinez, Senate Minority leader Trent Lott and others -- have gone into 
Louisiana to campaign for Terrell.  Landrieu doesn't want any national 
Democrats to do the same.  Only her fellow Democrat, conservative 
Senator John Breaux is doing the honors from campaign event to campaign 
event.
    <p>Robo-politics, Republican style, is also quite visible.  Terrell's 
campaign headquarters in the state capitol, Baton Rouge is tiny, reports 
the Washington Post.  She made only one appearance the weekend before 
Saturday's election day, while relying on huge television buys to get 
her robo-message (smaller government, less taxes, bigger military and, 
surprise, she's against terrorism).
    <p>Meanwhile, back in Washington, D.C., the Republican National 
Committee offices are "Terrell Central."  The RNC is running the show 
right down to the words used in the debates: "You're 100 percent wrong 
Mary and you are so negative."  Where have we heard those words before 
November 7th around the country?  Everywhere!
    <p>After losing more seats in the House and losing control of the 
Senate, the Democratic strategists seemed to have learned nothing.  
Enron is close to Louisiana; so is WorldCom.  Yet, corporate crime, 
fraud and abuse, looted pensions, laid off workers and depleted 401ks 
are not made into major issues where the corporate-indentured 
Republicans are at their weakest.  All kinds of corporate crime 
crackdowns and reforms of Big Business and health care-denying HMOs, 
could appeal to pollution-drenched Louisiana and its past populist 
traditions.  So could  the living wage issue.
    <p>Somehow, the Democrats believe that they can beat the opposing 
Republican Party by never criticizing its leader -- George W. Bush -- 
America's burgeoning Big Brother whose snooping, liberty-violating and 
anti-worker ways are getting a free ride on the backs of our crumbling 
democracy,  while giant corporations are laughing all the way to the 
bank on the backs of the small taxpayers who are forced to subsidize them.
    <p>And there is Suzie Terrell sticking to her RNC-inspired lines: "He 
will know when Suzie Terrell doesn't agree.  I'm going to stand firm and 
strong for Louisiana," she told a smiling George W. Bush at the rally on 
December3rd.  In Republican circles, this is called the "independence 
streak" line to counter charges that she and other such choreographed 
candidates by the RNC and the White House's Karl Rove are going to be 
rubber stamps for the President.
    <p>The RNC even knows when to let the robo-candidate twitch back on 
cue.  Will the Democrats ever free themselves of all that corporate 
money and wake up?</i></p>
