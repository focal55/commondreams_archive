<p> When the dust has settled and the blood and tears have dried, we will be able 
to say one thing with certainty about last week's terrorist attack in Kenya. Anyone 
who tells you the war against terrorism is being won is lying. 
<P>It is the great heresy of free societies, so speak it softly, but the accumulating 
evidence of the past four years is that terrorism can - and does - work. And it 
is working on a global scale. 
<P>It is a simple fact that is more terrifying than any of attacks themselves 
- 11 September included. That a tiny group of extremists, for the most part using 
the most basic of technologies, could effect such a startling paradigm shift that 
has transformed the world we live in. But to what end? The answer is more surprising 
than our political classes appear yet to have grasped. 
<P>Strip away the millenarian agenda and its language of apocalyptic struggle 
- the Great Satans, the enemies of God, references to the Crusaders. Strip away, 
just for a moment, its extreme religious aspects and what you are left with is 
a non-negotiable political agenda. That aim is to remove - or neutralize - American 
and Western influence from large areas of the globe, including states that are 
not exclusively Islamist. 
<P>It is a tension that was in part foreseen by Benjamin Barber in 1992 in his 
essay 'Jihad versus McWorld', which predicted that the greatest threat to democracy 
would be the clash between the spread of a homogenizing American culture - paradoxically 
indifferent to what was happening in the world it touched on - and a new kind 
of anti-political tribal politics which, he predicted, would see 'the breakdown 
of civility in the name of identity; of comity in the name of community'. 
<P>Barber thought that breakdown in civility would likely come from the kind of 
gang warfare then beginning to grip the Balkans. Instead, the real challenge to 
McWorld has been the unforeseen emergence of an extremist version of radical Islam 
literally at war with the West and all it stands for. For the time being at least, 
it seems it is the terrorists who are winning. 
<P>It is a pessimistic outlook, but an easy case to make. Let's start with the 
most obvious economic impact. The fear engendered by a spate of attacks by Jihad 
International - al-Qaeda and groups that share its agenda - is crippling the long-haul 
tourist industry, threatening the West's airline industry and has almost shut 
down tourism outside of the US. That cost is likely to amount to billions of pounds 
in the long run, its impact being felt as keenly in countries such as Indonesia 
and Kenya which are heavily dependant on tourist dollars. 
<P>What is less quantifiable is what John Stevenson, senior fellow in counter 
terrorism at the International Institute for Strategic Studies describes as al-Qaeda's 
aim of 'neutralizing' America and the West's influence in large areas of the world. 
Already the US and other countries have reduced embassies in vulnerable areas 
of the world, like other nations - Britain included - closing down missions at 
times of threat. But it is not just diplomats who carry our message into the world. 
Business too is supposed to fly the flag for our values. And as businesses become 
more wary of operating in threatened areas, they too will withdraw to safer areas 
of operation. 
<P>And in our withdrawal from exactly those places where the kind of Islamist 
extremism we fear most is at its most threatening, we give up the intellectual 
and psychological space to those who most threaten our values. Because the real 
war with al-Qaeda, as James Thomson, president of the Rand Corporation think-tank, 
pointed out in the organization's summer review, is not simply one of missiles, 
snatch squads and bullets. It is quintessentially one of ideas. 
<P>And it is in the war of ideas that we are most notably failing in the war on 
terrorism. As Thomson's overview points out, even a year after 9/11 America and 
its allies still have little idea of the roots of the discontent that has made 
Jihad International so attractive to so many young Islamist men, or the etiology 
of the hatred of America. 
<P>Not only is the message not getting across, but there seems to be a fundamental 
misunderstanding of where the real sophistication of Jihad International comes 
from. It is not in its ingenious and despicable skill in butchering innocent civilians, 
or even in its apparently formidable organizational skills, which in reality may 
be far less formidable than assumed, but in syndicating and marketing its brand 
of terror. This is not the old terrorism of the IRA or ETA, with structures, doctrines 
and pseudo-military organization.

 What Bush and Blair and all their allies do 
not understand is that it is the idea of al- Qaeda, not its physical reality, 
that is the key, an idea which has taken deep root in countries from Afghanistan 
to South East Asia and Africa. 
<P>At the center of that idea is an oppositional discourse that seeks to drive 
the west - particularly America - out of what Osama bin Laden has claimed as the 
wider Islamic nation. That misunderstanding is represented at its worst by George 
Bush who - it is said - keeps a list of 12 names of the top al-Qaeda terrorists 
in his desk and ticks them off as they are captured or killed. 
<P>But al-Qaeda is less a hierarchical organization

 out of James Bond led by 
a sinister mastermind, than a dynamic dialogue between like-minded radicals conducted 
via mosques, radical publications and the internet. A specific order is almost 
redundant as individual groups know exactly what must be done and when, adapting 
themselves to new security constraints and to new targets. 
<P>And what appears to have been 'understood' before the attack on Mombasa was 
that it was the right time to polarize the war on terrorism. Just at the moment 
Bush and his allies had constructed a grudging consent from the Arab world for 
its tough line on Iraq, Jihad International brought in Israel. In his belligerent 
threat to hunt down the perpetrators of the Mombasa attacks, Israel's right-wing 
prime minister Ariel Sharon has threatened to upset the delicate consensus between 
America and its allies on the issue of the war on terrorism, and on the Security 
Council over Iraq. 
<P>Few o Sharon's friends among the hawks that surround George Bush are unaware 
of his motto - 'Always escalate' - and his long history of ill-conceived military 
responses from the Gaza raid, the invasion of south Lebanon to his handling of 
the al-Aqsa intifada, that have delivered a quick political or military fix at 
the cost of long-term disaster. 
<P>By bringing Israel explosively into the mix a week before the deadline for 
Iraq's weapons declaration, Jihad International has shown a political and operational 
astuteness that is quite terrifying. 
<P>What is more terrifying still is the notion among the West's political classes 
that it is an organization

, not an idea, that they are fighting. With each new 
arrest, each new targeted killing, we congratulate ourselves that we are winning 
- until the next atrocity takes place. All the while, we fail to tackle the ideas 
that replace each arrested or dead terrorist with a new recruit. 
<P>As the tens of millions dead in the last century demonstrated, ideas - no matter 
that they are venal ones like Nazism or Stalinism - can be as hard to kill as 
they are lethally and stupidly persistent. 
<P>But in a war of ideas, to do nothing is the worst of all options.
