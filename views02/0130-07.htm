For the first time that anyone can remember, a Palestinian woman appears to 
have carried out a suicide attack, killing herself and an 81-year-old 
man and wounding 150 others in a crowded Jerusalem shopping street on Sunday. 
<p>
Unconfirmed accounts report that the woman's name was Shinaz Amuri, from the 
occupied West Bank town of Nablus. Amuri, if that was her name, was said to 
have been 20-years old, possibly a student. She was seen walking into a 
shoe store, carrying a heavy bag.   
<p>
"Do you need help?" A shop saleswoman is said to have asked her. "She 
signaled that she didn't need help," <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-012802izpals.story" target="_new">reports the Los Angeles Times</A>.
<p>
Maybe she didn't -- alone, twenty, that young girl, with what turns out to 
have been more than ten kilos of explosives. Maybe she didn't need help, but 
I do and maybe she gave me some. 
<p>
I've grown numb to this story of misguided martyr-murderers. Day after day, 
another bomber, more Israelis and more Palestinians dead. At last count, more 
than 30 Palestinian men have blown themselves up in the 16 months of this latest Intifada. They've killed dozens of Israelis, left countless more with wounds that may or may not heal.
<p>
We're used to mad, bad, ruthless, MALE terrorists.  They are subhuman, 
"cowards" or "evil ones" we're told, beneath contempt. The young male 
terrorist -- irrational brute, macho-maniac -- is easy to despise. His action 
defies our understanding, we're told. Indeed, we are led to believe that 
right-thinking people should not waste our time trying to understand.  
<p>
Traditional thinking associates women, on the other hand, with nurturing and 
caring. In taking up arms, women destroy traditional gender-roles. But could they also stir us to think? 
<p>
The news of a woman suicide bomber rattled my numbness. I thought of my 
own self, age 20. I can remember my own skin, stomach, hair, my own desire to 
change the world. Did she mean to explode herself? Why did she carry the 
explosives in a bag rather than strap them to her skin with tape? What did 
she tell her mother when she walked out of her door? 
<p>
All we know is that her body parts were found scattered in the street, along with those of the octogenarian Pinchus Toktaly, who worked as a tour guide at the 
Western Wall. 
<p>
As I heard the news, I tried to remember Nablus, a battered stone town with 
an ancient soap factory. I visited the place with my friends from MADRE, 
almost exactly ten years ago. The soap makers poured locally-produced olive 
oil into vast vats that stretched across the pungent factory floors. They 
stamped the massive sheet of soap with the maker's mark, then cut the soap 
into clumsy blocks, and wrapped each individually in rough papers colored 
blue and red and green. Soap-making was one of the few local industries on 
the West Bank, we were told. I don't know if they still make soap in Nablus 
now. 
<p>
I thought of a young Palestinian I met on another trip a few years later, a 
young woman who had been born, as had her mother, in a fifty-year old 
"temporary" shelter in Daheisha refugee camp in Bethlehem. My acquaintance 
worked in a sexually-integrated youth center that was struggling to survive 
against Islamist pressure. (As Yasser Arafat faltered, the strength of Hamas grew.)
<p> 
She was learning computer skills she hoped to use someday, if the Israelis 
would give her a permit to commute to a job a few miles away. She dreamt of 
getting a visa to come visit relatives in the US. In her black headscarf she 
shadowed me for a day, only wanting to talk about one thing: how she could 
become a journalist. 
<p>
The official U.S. response to the latest round of killing is clear: George W. 
Bush says he's "very disappointed" with Arafat and is threatening to 
stop talking with him. The Israeli National Security Council, desperate to 
protect innocent Israelis from further terrorist attacks, is discussing plans 
to "envelope Jerusalem"  by building an enormous wall. 
<p>
After Sunday's bombing, the <A HREF="http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=122482&contrassID=2&subContrassID=3&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y" target="_new">Israeli daily Haaretz editorialized</A> that, 
"Since September 11, the American attitude -- and the world's attitude -- to 
[terrorism] has changed. There is no longer any readiness to understand it as 
the weapon of the weak in a conflict, or as a weapon in the hands of a 
national liberation movement." 
<p>
There may be no readiness to try to understand why killers kill, but surely, 
there's a reason? No wall, no silence will stop these people. Seeing them as 
people might. Real people: not just brutish, stereotyped young men, but women, too.</p>
