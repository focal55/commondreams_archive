<p>PARIS -- </a> A good deal of printer's ink has been spent debating anti-Americanism 
during the last year, both in and out of the United States. The latest instance 
followed Germany's parliamentary election at the end of September, when Chancellor 
Gerhard Schröder's party coalition won a narrow victory, credited by analysts 
to his stand against German participation in any American attack on Iraq.
<p>The German chancellor's lèse-majesté provoked outrage in the Bush administration 
and warnings in American neoconservative circles that it will be 50 years before 
Germany will have recovered the trust of the United States, and thereby once again 
become an important state.
<p>In fact, from the European side of the Atlantic, it seemed that Schröder's 
stand added to Germany's international authority. Germany previously having tended 
to be seen as a satellite of Washington's rather than a nation with convictions 
of its own.
<p>Since a majority in German public opinion already opposed an attack on Iraq, 
and Schröder merely profited from supporting the majority, it is a surprise that 
the Germans have not been given the same propaganda treatment the French got a 
few months ago, attacked in U.S. neoconservative circles as an anti-Semitic society 
because of popular French pro-Palestinian sympathies. Official Washington has 
perhaps realized that the United States needs U.S. bases in Germany, but Germany 
does not. They are essential to the U.S. global strategic position.
<p>The subject of anti-Americanism can, however, be intelligently discussed, an 
example being a recent exchange between a French writer with a long record of 
sympathy for the United States, Jean-François Revel, and a younger colleague with 
family connections to the United States and a British education, Emmanuel Todd.
<p>Todd maintains that the United States today actually is displaying weakness. 
He says, &quot;I have always had a positive vision of the United States&quot; 
and &quot;taken for granted that it was a reasonable power&quot; but now &quot;I 
have the sense of a disquieting semi-bellicosity, an agitation, a feverishness.&quot;
<p>He puts this down to an unarticulated sense of vulnerability in the United 
States, caused by its budget dependence on European and Japanese investment and 
its lingering strategic anxiety about Russia and China.
<p>He argues that current American emphasis on military and diplomatic action 
against weak rogue states is a kind of unacknowledged compensation for this anxiety.
<p>Thus embargoes are imposed on countries incapable of defending themselves, 
and tribal armies and &quot;disarmed civil populations&quot; are subjected to 
high-tech bombardment. He presumably has Serbia in mind.
<p>Revel answers that blaming America has always been a reflex of European intellectuals. 
He says that American politicians are given to hyperbole that should not be taken 
too seriously, and that Europeans have only themselves to blame for today's American 
predominance, since Europe's own failures in the 20th century made a gift of global 
power to the United States.
<p>He also says that the French themselves would be obsessed with terrorism if 
suicide planes had simultaneously attacked the Opéra, the Arc de Triomphe, and 
other prominent Paris sites - although he himself mentions the series of attacks 
on crowded Paris stores and train and metro stations in 1995, which were met without 
panic.
<p>It strikes me that the two are actually discussing two separate kinds of anti-Americanism. 
The old kind, which Revel stoutly opposed, was influential some thirty years ago, 
when news of the Gulag was only belatedly being admitted by a French intelligentsia 
traditionally disposed to uncritical support for the left.
<p>Then, every American Cold War measure was attacked as if it were an unprovoked 
provocation to the Soviet Union.
<p>The new kind of anti-Americanism is the one Todd talks about, and is a reaction 
to the post-Sept. 11 policies of the Bush administration, which he takes as revealing 
deep-seated anxieties in American society which have economic and demographic 
structural causes - a fragile economy, and loss of the old sense of national identity.
<p>He also argues that Washington's preoccupation with the rogue states and China 
- actually a weak state - and its concern that they might become allies with Russia, 
avoids looking at the real strategic threat, which is that a nuclear Russia would 
ally itself with the two most important real power centers outside the United 
States, which are Europe and Japan.
<p>This analysis is not one that seems to concern Washington, which makes much 
of the symptoms of anti-Americanism in Europe while actually making the problem 
worse. Chancellor Schröder did not whip up anti-Americanism in Germany. It was 
there already. That is what should worry Washington.
