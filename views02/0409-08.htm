Long before George W. Bush became president, getting heard beyond the alternative media has been a hard row to hoe for progressives. But the times have changed. Our ever more dangerous present demands that we try harder to reach the mainstream with our messages. Trying harder doesn't mean just doing the same old thing, though. Right now it means looking at some new approaches to framing and stating our message about Iraq.

<p>The most important place to begin is with our assumption that we are not like mainstream America at all. True, most of us don't shop 'til we drop or cheer when the bombing raids start. But those negatives aren't all there is to the American story. In my work with the Metaphor Project, whose mission is to empower and train progressives to be more effective communicators, I've found that any roomful of progressive activists can very quickly come up with the core set of enduring American story elements, the ones that carry the most widely shared American value set—things like "making it better, making it new, doing what works, thinking about what to do next," and so on. It isn't hard after that to see that in our own zeal for a better and more effective nation we too are quintessentially American. (To see a list of these, look at the Cliché Clusters List on the website listed above.)

<p>Now that we have our feet firmly planted on common ground, it is safe to start thinking about how to convey what we want to say. If we focus on the question of what to do next, and what works, and find some extremely vivid language to express that, we might have a prayer of getting our message to someone in the mainstream world, and from there it might spread. In a recent column in the Progressive  Populist ( April 1, '02), Ted Glick advised us to do "away with all rhetoric." What that means is that you start your communication with a simple, concrete image like "tools," that is connected to commonly understood American values and experiences, like using the right tool for the job. Everyone knows that if you use the wrong tool, you botch the job and may make the problem impossible to fix later.

<p>What you dump as you begin your communication is long histories of the present situation, however true, or abstract analyses loaded with facts and statistics, expressed in multi-syllabic words. Maybe, if you get lucky, you'll get asked for more information later. Save it for then. Face the fact that ordinary Americans make their decisions based on values, not on facts or on history or even what caused what.

<p>To help you see how this process works, I've included below a piece I recently wrote to show progressives on my e-mail list how to expand on the "tools" metaphor re Iraq. I think you can easily see how much stronger the word "tool" is than Bush's word "options" for the choices we face now.

<p>As of early April, the currently escalating Palestinian- Israeli crisis has put President Bush in a strange "do as I say, not as I do" spot. In finally calling for a halt to the Israeli invasion and the immediate resumption of negotiations, Bush has shown that he understands that meeting specific acts of terrorist violence with full scale war is not the only tool he or our government can imagine using to stop terrorism.

<p>This new cognitive dissonance in our government's
position is a priceless opening for us to foster the growth of greater wisdom in Washington and in the country at large on the subject of dealing with terrorism in general and Iraq in particular.  For example, as E.J. Dionne, Jr. recently pointed out (San Francisco Chronicle, 4/02/02), we can start out by noting that terrorism is only a method, (a tool, I'd say) not an ideology like communism or fascism. It may be employed by anyone from extremely desperate people with legitimate grievances to crazed megalomaniacs with no agenda except their own private myth.

<p>So now more than ever, it is absolutely vital for the safety, security, and prosperity of our own country and the world community that the United States keep and expand its new flexibility to choose from a range of tools for dealing with specific cases of terrorism. And as our response to the Palestinian/Israeli conflict shows, making clear distinctions about each case is essential for choosing the right problem solving tool.

<p>In the case of Iraq as a terrorist promoting state, that may require some response, true. The question is, again, what is the right tool for the job? The Iraqi people are already said to loathe their leader, they suffer inordinately on a daily basis as it is, and Hussein, unlike the Taliban and al Qaeda, will certainly not change sides if the going gets a bit tough, beat an unexpectedly hasty strategic retreat if attacked on his home turf, go underground, play dead, or melt quietly into some other country.

<p>Given these realities, all out war against Iraq seems the
least wise, safe, and effective tool available. Since of necessity the Palestinian/Israeli conflict will delay the onset of Bush's proposed war on Iraq, the intervening time should be devoted instead to intensive efforts to help develop a nonviolent revolution against Hussein's regime within Iraq, with the goal of its repeating the success of the people of Serbia in removing their own repulsive leader. Information about how to foster successful nonviolent revolutions is available in a number of articles about the work of Gene Sharp, Michael Nagler and David Hartsough, among others, on the web; more can be found at <a href="http://www.pendlehill.org" target="_new">www.pendlehill.org</a>, and in the recently shown PBS film (March 31), A Force More Powerful, about the tools the Serbian people used to overthrow Milosevic nonviolently.
