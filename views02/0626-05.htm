<p>That was a fantastic speech. Quite literally, fantastic. George Bush's address 
on the Middle East, delivered outside the White House on Monday evening, consisted, 
from beginning to end, of fantasy. 
<P>It bore so little relation to reality that diplomats around the world spent 
yesterday shaking their heads in disbelief, before sinking into gloom and despair. 
Our own Foreign Office tried gamely to spot the odd nugget of sense in the Bush 
text - but, they admitted, it was an uphill struggle. Israelis committed to a 
political resolution of the conflict were heartbroken. Even Shimon Peres, foreign 
minister in Ariel Sharon's coalition, reportedly called the speech "a fatal mistake", 
warning: "A bloodbath can be expected." 
<P>The core of the president's message was that the Palestinians must embark on 
a sweeping process of internal reform before they can even think about getting 
back to the negotiating table. They must transform themselves into a democratic 
market economy, free of corruption and with a separate judiciary and legislature 
if they are to be considered eligible for statehood - which, when it comes, will 
be merely provisional. 
<P>Shall we count the ways in which this is completely absurd? George Bush is 
demanding that Palestine become Sweden before it can become Palestine: it must 
be stable, prosperous and boast constitutional arrangements which still elude 
Britain - our judiciary and legislature are not separate - let alone the Arab 
world before it can become even a state-in-waiting. 
<P>This would be laughable if Palestine were in tranquil Scandinavia. Even there 
it would count as putting the cart before the horse, asking a nation to create 
the institutions of a highly developed country before it becomes a state. But 
this, remember, is being demanded of the Palestinians - statebuilders with every 
possible obstacle in their way. 
<P>Like the fact that they are under military occupation. As the New York Times 
noted yesterday: "How the Palestinians can be expected to carry out elections 
or reform themselves while in a total lockdown by the Israeli military remains 
something of a mystery." Palestinian ministers complain they cannot visit a village 
10 minutes away; they can pass laws but not implement them. They are Potemkin 
ministers, existing on paper only. Yet now they are to build the Switzerland of 
the Levant, where the streets are clean and government functions like clockwork. 
This is George in Wonderland stuff. 
<P>Monday's speech even had a touch of black comedy. The president said the new 
Palestine should be taught good governance, nominating the Arab states for the 
role. Imagine it: democracy lessons from Saudi Arabia, a masterclass in liberty 
from Kuwait. 
<P>But that is not the president's greatest fantasy. Yasser Arafat must go, he 
says, though without naming him. It may be refreshing to hear a US president come 
clean in his conviction that he has the right to pick other nations' leaders, 
but this demand exposes fully the vacuousness of Bush's thinking. 
<P>For who does he imagine might replace Arafat? Does he not realize that Palestinians 
are angry with their leader not because he has been insufficiently pro-American 
but because they see him as too moderate, too willing to do Israel's bidding. 
The Palestinian street is not clamoring for a man who will crack down harder on 
Islamist militants or sing a western song about free trade and local elections. 
<P>So if elections go ahead, here's what will happen. Either Palestinians will 
deliberately defy Washington and re-elect Arafat or they will choose someone more 
hardline. Any leader who has the Israeli or US stamp of approval will immediately 
be discredited as a puppet and promptly rejected. 
<P>Also, for all his flaws, Arafat has an asset none of his rivals can match. 
He is still, thanks to his long history, Mr Palestine: his signature on a compromise 
deal is the only one that could persuade his people to accept it. By rushing his 
exit now, Bush is depriving any future peace agreement of the only Palestinian 
who could deliver it. 
<P> S o the president's speech shows a man unconnected to Middle Eastern reality. 
But it is worse than unhinged; it is dangerous. First, Bush has given a green 
light to Sharon to continue his policy of military force coupled with a refusal 
to freeze settlement building on the West Bank. Monday's wording implied that 
Sharon is only obliged to pull back from Palestinian cities or freeze settlements 
once the Palestinians have worked their way through the US wishlist. So long as 
violence goes on, or Arafat remains in place, the Israeli PM can do what he likes. 
<P>Given that the president refused to specify what the final settlement might 
look like - delaying that and other questions to later talks - he has supplied 
Sharon with an incentive to get busy now, building settlements, putting up fences 
and carving new borders. If Bush had declared that the eventual Palestinian state 
would be on the other side of Israel's 1967 borders, there would be no point in 
Israel trying to redraw the map. But now Sharon has every motive to create his 
notorious "facts on the ground". 
<P>There is danger on the Palestinian side too. The only people celebrating yesterday 
were the Islamist extremists of Hamas and Jihad, chiding moderate Palestinians 
for ever believing that politics, rather than violence, might bring results. Bush 
has not dangled any serious carrot before the Palestinians: no promises on Jerusalem 
or refugees or final borders. Even Colin Powell's planned international conference 
seems to have vanished. All Palestinians will get if they comply with Washington's 
demands is a provisional state on 42% of the West Bank. Maybe. Few will consider 
that a prize worth the sacrifice of their own leader and a national transformation. 
<P>So this new plan of Bush's is a flight of errant, irresponsible fancy that 
can only fail, bringing more bloodshed and ruin to the peoples of the Middle East 
who are desperate for something better. 
<P>But it will reverberate far beyond. It will damage the international standing 
of the US president and America along with it. Muslim and Arab nations will be 
antagonized by this plan of inaction, while chancelleries from London to Moscow 
will realize they are dealing with a leader who pays no lip-service to them - 
or to basic reality. 
<P>This is a foreign policy failure for George Bush. If he were a Democrat, both 
the Washington press corps and Congress would already be racking it up alongside 
the unextinguished threat from al-Qaida and the continued freedom from captivity 
of Osama bin Laden. Those failures, and now the guarantee of further slaughter 
in the Middle East, should be prompting hard questions about Bush and his war 
on terror. America needs to snap out of its post-9/11 torpor of consensus and 
realize there is a leadership problem in the US - and his name is George Bush.
