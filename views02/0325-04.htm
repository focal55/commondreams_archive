Singer Michelle Shocked strapped on her guitar and took the stage 
for the performance that would finish the first stop on the 
<a href="http://www.rollingthundertour.org" target="_new">Rolling Thunder Down-Home Democracy Tour</a>. Looking out at the faces 
of several thousand cheering Texans, the woman who has penned hits 
such as "Anchorage" broke into a huge grin and told the crowd,  
"We just didn't know what we were going to find when we showed up 
this morning. We didn't know if you all were going to show up. But 
I think it's been an unqualified success."
<p>
Shocked got no argument from the crowd, or from organizers of what 
may well be the most unlikely scheme to stir the nation's populist 
sentiment since someone suggested pulling together a protest 
outside the World Trade Organization summit in Seattle.
</p>
<p>
Texas populist Jim Hightower's plan to "put the party back into 
politics" with a rollicking national tour of speechifying, 
entertaining, organizing and coalition-building along the lines of 
the 19th-century Chautauqua gatherings had always been greeted 
with a measure of skepticism. Hightower's friends and allies 
mumbled that the Lollapalooza of the Left idea might be a hair too 
ambitious. Would it really be possible, at a time when 
conservative President George W. Bush is supposed to be enjoying 
80 percent approval ratings, to pack a fairgrounds east of Austin 
for a day of Bush-bashing, corporation-crunching, plutocrat-poking 
politics with a punch? Hightower admitted that he worried about 
whether he would prove right one of the best lines of Oklahoma 
populist Fred Harris: "You can't have a mass movement without the 
masses."
</p>
<p>
But the organizers needed have worried. The masses were ready for 
this movement.
</p>
<p>
"This is just what a lot of us have been waiting for -- the call 
to action," said Cate Read, an airline industry analyst who 
watched from her Houston office as employees from the nearby Enron 
building carried their belongings out of the collapsed 
corporation's headquarters. "People are ready to start making some 
noise about what's been going on in this country. The media makes 
it sound like everyone's for everything George W. Bush does and 
that is just not the case -- not even in Texas."
</p>
<p>
By the time filmmaker and author Michael Moore arrived at mid-day, 
to the foot-stomping, fist-pumping and cheers of close to 7,000 
rebels against the consensus, this corner of Texas was definitely 
not Bush country.
</p>
<p>
"Where are we? In a barn?" Moore yelled over the roar of the crowd 
that had packed into what was, indeed, the Travis County 
Exposition Center's horse and hog showbarn. Clearly delighted, the 
most populist of popular entertainers let rip with an assault on 
the suggestion that dissent is no longer appropriate in 
post-September 11 America.
</p>
<p>
"Let me tell you something about the (president's) 80 percent 
approval rating..." bellowed the author of the nation's No. 1 
best-seller, "Stupid White Men." "It's bullshit" came the yell 
from a fellow in a cowboy hat. "That's right," responded Moore, 
"it's bullshit."
</p>
<p>
Echoing the slogan emblazoned on stickers many at the event wore, 
Moore declared, "We are the majority in this country." For the 
last six months, he argued, we've been told 'watch what you say,' 
'don't dissent,' 'don't question the leader.' Let me tell you 
something: There is nothing more American than asking these 
questions."
</p>
<p>
If there was a theme for the day, it may well have been that 
dissent is back in fashion. Hip-hop, Tejano, rhythm & blues and 
folk performers including MC Overlord, Ruben Ramos, Marcia Ball 
and Shocked flavored their shows with rebel yells, performance 
artists played the Enron scandal for laughs, game booths allowed 
kids to toss a ball and knock down a nuclear missile. Workshops 
took on everything from radioactive waste to
</p>
<p>
genetically-modified food, from militarism to racial profiling, 
from corporate excess to the   "selected-not-elected" presidency 
of a former Austin resident named Bush. Columnist Molly Ivins got 
people all worked up. 
</p>
<p>
Everyone got into the act, even Doris "Granny D" Haddock, who 
walked across the country at age 90 to raise the issue of campaign 
finance reform and who, at 92, is madder than ever about 
special-interest influence on government. "I have 16 
great-grandchildren," she said, to chants of "Go Granny D." "I 
want them brought up in a democracy, not a fascist state -- which 
this country is fast becoming."
</p>
<p>
Between Granny D and Marcia Ball's rhythm and blues show, US Rep. 
Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill, delivered the day's most passionate 
address. "We come to this Chautauqua because Dr. King was right: 
America has issued a promisory note and it has come back marked 
insufficient funds," boomed Jackson, recalling the sudden shift in 
attitudes about federal spending last fall. "On September 10, we 
were told there was not enough money for Social Security. But on 
September 12 or thereabouts, there was $40 billion to find
a cave man in Afghanistan -- and we haven't found him yet."
</p>
<p>
To rising applause from an audience that stayed into the 
fast-cooling Texas night to hear him, Jackson recounted the $95 
billion in new military and corporate-welfare spending that has 
been authorized since the September 11 attacks.
</p>
<p>
"We come to this Chautuaqua because 53 million children trapped in 
separate and not equal schools, and 45 million Americans without 
health insurance, deserve the same (level of) national response 
that bin Laden got," boomed Jackson, as he called for a 
restructuring of national priorities that recognizes a need not 
just for security against attack from abroad but also for security 
from hunger, illness and neglect at home.
</p>
<p>
"My friends, I don't know how to make the Democratic party better 
and I don't know how to make the Republican party better," Jackson 
concluded, as tour organizers were already preparing for 
Chautauqua events in Atlanta, Chicago, Pittsburgh and other 
cities. "So let us move forward from this Chautauqua not to make 
the parties better but to make the union better and more perfect 
for all."</p>
