<p> People are sitting in foreign ministries all around the pro-American world 
trying to work out what being an ally of the United States means these days. There 
are other people sitting around in foreign ministries in the anti-American world 
working out the costs and benefits of being an enemy of America, and more people 
sitting around in foreign ministries in the &#34;are we a friend or foe of America?&#34; 
world doing the same calculations on friend-om or foe-dom or in-between-dom.</P>
<P>The latter two, perhaps, have the hardest thinking to do, especially on the 
cost side. But Canadians and Europeans, who think they're solid buddies of the 
U.S., have to think through what that means. And what it will mean down the road.</P>
<P>In Washington recently, seeing a swath of policymakers and analysts in and 
around the Bush administration, it came home to me that here was a hegemon fully 
entering into a realization, and enjoyment, of its own power. No more Mr. Modest. 
Time to admit it: We're the strongest, the smartest, the richest. No boasting 
involved; these are just the facts. Admit it (you others out there), and have 
a nice day.</P>
<P>&#34;The United States,&#34; write Dartmouth College professors Stephen Brooks 
and William Wohlforth in the current issue of Foreign Affairs, &#34;has no rival 
in any critical dimension of power. There has never been a system of sovereign 
states that contained one state with this degree of dominance.&#34; The U.S. Defense 
Department, writes peace studies scholar Michael Klare in The Nation, will, in 
the next few years, &#34;acquire a capacity to defeat any conceivable type of 
attack mounted by any imaginable adversary at any point in time. . . . This is 
a mandate for the pursuit of permanent military supremacy.&#34;</P>
<P>The statement of American power that's had the most effect is an essay by policy 
analyst Robert Kagan in the Hudson Institute's Policy Review. The essay says to 
the Europeans: Look, you're militarily weak. Your European Union hasn't done much 
about this weakness, despite all the talk of rapid reaction forces. You aren't 
spending any more on Defense You aren't making your military into one fighting 
force. You haven't got much of a strategic view of the world.</P>
<P>I called Mr. Kagan -- he lives in Brussels, which is as good a place as any 
to observe the weakness of Europe -- and asked him what he thought about the hot 
issue of the day with the Europeans: Will they go with the U.S. on Iraq?</P>
<P>&#34;We probably know what will happen with Iraq,&#34; he said. &#34;We'll 
probably do it and some Europeans will participate. The French and the Brits certainly 
will. Germany can't, but will support. But that doesn't solve the problem of weakness. 
The Europeans won't be central to it, whatever happens. If they're part of it, 
it will be minor. They can't stand the prospect of being irrelevant if they don't 
come in.&#34;</P>
<P>To say you're the greatest is a liberating, even exhilarating, feeling. It's 
something of a compensation for the horror of Sept. 11, and the ever-present sense, 
especially among those who live in Washington and New York, that some other, maybe 
worse, horror is being prepared. It is also largely true. Defense spending increases 
have made America stronger than the next nine states combined. Economic and productivity 
growth have made America the richest country on Earth.</P>
<P>Technological innovation has given U.S. corporations the decisive lead over 
those of any other, with the partial exception of the Japanese. The cultural projection 
of the U.S. through film, TV and cable news dominates, or is a major presence 
in, almost every culture. The pre-eminence of U.S. universities means that everything 
from nuclear physics to medical research to political science is often first or 
best done there.</P>
<P>The Washington elite thus has the increasingly confident sense of being at 
the hub of a great wheel. Down the spokes radiating out from the hubs are areas 
of a world that the U.S. dominates.</P>
<P>Some are challenging but full of promise: George W. Bush's foreign policy people 
see Russia in that way, believing it now to be on a course for inclusion in the 
West. Some are deeply uncertain -- as are the calculations on what place China 
will make for itself as it continues to grow in strength and wealth.</P>
<P>Some are alarming, as economic crises and political turbulence in Latin America 
conjoin to pull down many of the states. One is critical: The Middle East throws 
up constant choices as to the use, or withholding, of American power and pressure.</P>
<P>The spokes at the end of which Europeans and Canadians live are really not 
much of a problem. We may whine at times, and get a bit more condescension (or 
not) for our pains; but no U.S. president or secretary of state has to wake up 
in the morning thinking that America is going to be pulled into a European war, 
or that American corporations will be nationalized.</P>
<P>But both sides -- the U.S. and its buddies -- have some hard thinking to do 
and hard choices at the end of it. The Europeans, who actually say they want to 
become a superpower, have to determine this. Will we, after all, remain comfortably 
under the American shield? Or will our so far faltering efforts to create a common 
Defense and foreign policy and the military capability to match come to something? 
Will we remain subalterns to the U.S. general? Or aspire to general's rank ourselves, 
and share the burdens of world leadership?</P>
<P>It is the choice we are now being pressed to make. But it is a confusing one, 
subject to conflicting signals. Washington has not made up its mind between an 
updated version of an old strategy and accommodating itself to a new situation. 
The old strategy is assuring the security of its good friends, because it made 
the world safer for the U.S. and because it removed any need for any of its good 
friends to rival its power and cause it headaches. Updating it would mean finding 
new roles for its good friends -- as it has for the Canadians and Europeans in 
Afghanistan -- but setting the strategic priorities for them in a world it commands.</P>
<P>The new situation would be to begin to accommodate U.S. power to the expectation 
of Euro power, and to welcome, even encourage, the latter's growth. It would be 
a novel situation, reminiscent of British diplomacy's constant concern to build 
up weak European states to preserve a balance of power to neutralize a threat 
to its security -- but on a much vaster scale with a different intent.</P>
<P>The intent would be, as ever, a stable globe. For the moment, the U.S. sees 
no better route to stability than through its own power. It glories in that power 
but is willing to use it, too. It will take serious convincing that there is a 
better way to get along. If we think there is a better way -- for us, for them, 
for all -- then we have to be serious, too. Or get used to friendly irrelevance, 
revolving quietly around the busy hub.
