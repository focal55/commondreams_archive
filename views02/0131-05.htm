NEW YORK -- People here still call Sept. 11 the day that changed the world, but 
it's not true. The events of Sept. 11 changed the United States, not the world 
- and go on doing so. 
<p>They changed America's modern history and the American consciousness. The rest 
of the world has had to live with terrorism, accommodating its shocks and demands. 
No other country has ever believed itself invulnerable. Only the United States 
possessed a conviction of invulnerability, which it lost on Sept. 11. At the same 
time, an American sense of impunity was reinforced, which lies behind its unilateralist 
policies today.
<p>The international controversy over the prisoners at Guantánamo Bay has posed 
important legal and human rights issues, but it also is contributing to the definition 
- or redefinition - of the moral identity of America, not only in the eyes of 
the world, but for Americans themselves.
<p>Common sense would say that if there is indeed a war against terrorism, then 
the prisoners are prisoners of that war, unless Washington is prepared to assert 
that its war against terrorism is in some way not a war.
<p>The administration's position is that the combatants of Al Qaeda are outside 
the law because they carry out, or defend, terrorism. However, the combatant who 
places himself outside the law nonetheless falls under the jurisdiction of law 
when he is captured and held by a nation of law.
<p>This would seem to be true even if the prisoners fall into one (or both) of 
the categories of combatants excluded from the Geneva conventions: forces that 
do not themselves observe the laws of war, such as terrorists and death squads, 
and civilians who engage in hostilities.
<p>The United States has claimed that because its prisoners were not uniformed 
members of the forces of a generally recognized government, they have no rights 
in international law; and as they are not U.S. citizens and are not on American 
territory, they have no rights in American law.
<p>The Geneva conventions provide that if &quot;any doubt&quot; exists as to the 
status of prisoners, they must be treated as prisoners of war until a &quot;competent 
tribunal&quot; decides. U.S. Army regulations contain a similar requirement. Secretary 
of State Colin Powell and the State Department want the United States to observe 
the Geneva conventions.
<p>President George W. Bush has said that his government will never &quot;call 
them prisoners of war,&quot; but that he will &quot;listen to all the legalisms.&quot;
<p>Law, however, is one thing. Something else is involved here. Vice President 
Dick Cheney said Sunday that these prisoners deserve extraordinary treatment because 
&quot;these are the worst of a very bad lot. They are devoted to killing millions 
of Americans - innocent Americans.&quot;
<p>Mr. Bush said Monday the prisoners &quot;are killers, these are terrorists, 
they know no countries.&quot;
<p>From the beginning, the rhetoric of this administration has identified the 
enemy in terms of absolute evil, the war as expression of a metaphysical combat 
between good and evil, and Al Qaeda fighters and their Taliban allies as people 
not to be defeated, but destroyed.
<p>The shackled, hooded prisoners photographed at Guantánamo Bay seemed a fulfillment 
of this rhetoric of demonization and dehumanization. That is why the photograph 
was such a shock to international opinion. The administration's unwillingness 
to concede the prisoners a legitimate status in international law has reinforced 
the notion that the United States considers them less than human.
<p>Dehumanization of the enemy nearly always occurs in war and is responsible 
for its worst atrocities. The Nazis identified Jews as an enemy to be exterminated, 
and told their soldiers that Poles and Russians were subhumans to be treated as 
slaves.
<p>In democratic countries it is the responsibility of leaders to govern their 
language. National policy must respect the humane values defended in the constitution, 
and treat even enemies with the dispassion required in a nation that has willingly 
submitted itself to the regime of law. Otherwise the democracy betrays itself.
