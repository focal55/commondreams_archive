<p>I'm still trying to figure out who had a more wretched Election Night 2002, 
the Democratic Party or America's pollsters. While Democrats lost control of the 
Senate, they will live to fight another election day. Pollsters, on the other 
hand, in losing what scraps of credibility they had, may -- with a little help 
from the public -- find their entire profession obsolete, gone the way of chimney 
sweeps, organ pumpers, and those guys who used to make buggy whips. 
<p> For years now, the accuracy of political polls has been -- in the parlance 
of the trade -- "trending downward." Last week it hit bottom. The Voter News Service 
admitted on Election Night that due to "technical difficulties" its exit polls 
weren't to be trusted, forcing the networks to rely on actual votes. And in race 
after race, pre-election polls proved as reliable as the iceberg spotter on the 
Titanic. 
<p> In Georgia, pollsters had predicted Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes would beat 
challenger Sonny Perdue handily -- a Mason-Dixon poll had Barnes leading by 9 
points, while one conducted by the Atlanta Constitution had him up by 11. Once 
the votes were counted, however, it was Perdue beating Barnes by 5 points -- a 
humiliating 16-point airball for the pollsters. 
<p> They were just as prescient in Colorado where an MSNBC/Zogby poll had Democratic 
challenger Tom Strickland trouncing incumbent Sen. Wayne Allard 53 percent to 
44 percent. In reality, Allard strolled to a relatively stress-free 5-point win 
-- a 14-point blunder. 
<p> And in Illinois, another Zogby poll had the governor's race pitting Republican 
Jim Ryan against Democrat Rod Blagojevich as a statistical dead heat -- a finding 
that was, statistically, dead wrong. Blagojevich won and Ryan and Zogby lost by 
7 percentage points. 
<p> The pollsters' numbers were so off the mark that even they were forced to 
admit the obvious. "There was a lot of bad polling this year," acknowledged Mark 
Mellman, a Democratic pollster. "We blew it," said John Zogby. 
<p> As a rule, pollsters come equipped with more excuses than a married man with 
lipstick on his collar -- and this year was no different. And whom did they point 
the finger of blame at most frequently? Why you and me, naturally. It seems we 
just didn't turn out at the polls in exactly the configurations the pollsters 
thought we would -- what Mr. Zogby delicately referred to as "poor turnout models." 
In other words, the problems aren't polls, it's those damn voters who say one 
thing then do another. Like show up on Election Day. 
<p> In truth, the problem isn't with us, dear voters -- or even with you, dear 
nonvoters. The problem is with the pollsters' inability to account for an increasingly 
uncooperative public. Thanks to cell phones, answering machines, caller ID, a 
surfeit of polls, and a growing distaste for telephonic intrusions into our homes, 
it's getting harder and harder for pollsters to find Americans willing to answers 
their questions. Twenty years ago, polling response rates were over 60 percent; 
now they are closer to 30 percent -- and in some cases even lower. It's pretty 
tough to get an accurate reading of the public's opinion when the most frequent 
response you receive is a “click” followed by a dial tone. 
<p> So here we are in the middle of a vicious vortex. Pollsters conduct their 
increasingly inaccurate polls; the media then report the results as if Moses has 
just brought them down from the mountaintop; and our politicians tailor their 
messages to suit phantom voters. All the players involved in this charade understand 
they are acting on the flimsiest of pretenses -- it's just that relying on polls 
is so much easier than actually reporting or leading. 
<p> Even President Bush, who charged into office trumpeting his disdain for polls 
-- don't they all? -- has proven to be a chronic poll watcher and poll taker. 
In fact, this schizophrenic stance has actually become something of an in-joke 
at the White House: Bush brags about not looking at polls and everyone laughs, 
knowing the president doesn't have to look because Karl Rove has already whispered 
the results in his ear. 
<p> But allowing polling data to become a substitute for thinking has become a 
very wobbly crutch indeed. Just ask the Democrats who, after consulting their 
pollsters' tea leaves, decided not to take on the president on tax cuts or on 
invading Iraq. They were forced to pay for their slavish devotion to the numbers 
with their political lives. Pollsters, on the other hand, are allowed to tiptoe 
away from the carnage their handiwork has wrought and still keep their jobs. 
<p> As long as you can sagely and entertainingly spin your numbers on the tube, 
there is no penalty for being wrong. As Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise 
Institute wryly puts it, "It's the sin of broadcasting in the modern age. No matter 
how wrong you are, the punishment is you get your own show on cable television." 
<p> I think it's time to change that equation -- to attach some downside to the 
political prognosticators' game. Perhaps we should fine pollsters $100,000 for 
every percentage point they are off (and create a retirement fund for pollsters 
who agree to leave their discredited profession). Or attach a large letter "I" 
(for "Inaccurate") to the lapels of those who are wrong more than they are right. 
Or perhaps we can follow the lead of English soccer leagues, which regularly consign 
teams with losing records to second tier divisions. And, if all else fails, there 
is always the option of a little reverse Pavlovian training -- let's say, by attaching 
electrodes to pollsters' sensitive areas on Election Night and sending a charge 
through them anytime a poll-based prediction proves erroneous. It would give a 
whole new meaning to the term "political buzz." 
<p> If you, like me, are one of the many millions who hang up on callers wanting 
to know what kind of toothpaste I prefer, what TV shows I watch, or what candidates 
I'm going to vote for, you'll be proud to know that you are part of a rapidly 
expanding segment of the population known as the "margin of error." And if you're 
not, now is the perfect time to join us and make anti-Democratic polling a thing 
of the past. </i></p>
