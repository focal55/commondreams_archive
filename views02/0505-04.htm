<p>Just how big is the pedophile priest scandal that has jolted the Catholic Church? </P>
<p>Big. Really big, if you've been paying even the slightest attention to the news media. </P>
<P>	Newsweek magazine, for one, devotes practically the entire current issue to the topic, with a stark cover headline that asks, plaintively, "What would Jesus do?" as if coping with the crisis were beyond mere mortals. </P>
<P>	For months, television, radio, magazines, newspapers and the next-door neighbors have been obsessed with the revelations. </P>
<P>	OK, I admit it. I have been following the story as closely as anyone else, marveling at how the supposedly wise shepherds of the world's biggest and most powerful church have been exposed as fools by repeating the mistake that has ruined many a political career in Washington. </P>
<P>	It's not the crime that got them; it's the cover-up. </P>
<P>	People have known for a long time that there are homosexuals in the priesthood. Why wouldn't there be? Homosexuality does not respect artificial boundaries, such as what profession a person pursues, anymore than heterosexuality does. </P>
<P>	The fact that some priests engage in sinful sex is also not new. </P>
<P>	There have been reports of it for as long as newspapers have been published, or for at least as long as gossipy parishioners have whispered their suspicions. </P>
<P>	What is new is the extent to which the church hierarchy has gone to cover up the sins of the fathers. It is the protection racket run by the cardinals and bishops that has outraged Catholics and prompted scare headlines along the order of "Can the Church survive?" </P>
<P>	In today's media hothouse, this is the kind of story that grows and grows like Jack's beanstalk, at least until another juicy scandal comes along. But is it really the crisis to end all crises, as it has been portrayed? </P>
<P>	I was tempted to think so until recently when I came across a news story tucked away on page 18 of the Washington Post, far from the typical headlines on the front page that declare the end is at hand for St. Peter's church. This story was headlined, "South African Catholics Ambivalent About U.S. Scandal." </P>
<P>	Correspondent Jon Jeter visited the "impoverished, hard-edged township" of Guguletu, South Africa, near the port city of Cape Town. </P>
<P>	At St. Gabriel's Catholic Church, he interviewed a parishioner named Robert Kona, who put the crisis in perspective. </P>
<P>	"For a man to have sex with a child is the worst sin, the worst crime," Kona told the reporter. "We have our own problems here with sexual abuse and so we understand the outrage that Americans must feel." </P>
<P>	But here is where Kona, just an ordinary citizen a half a world away, held a mirror up to the face of America and asked us to consider where this scandal falls in the continuum that we call the human condition. </P>
<P>	"I think sometimes that America has so few worries, they must manufacture problems," he said. "Here, the people have no jobs, no food, no housing. Our family members are suffering from HIV. There is too much crime in our streets, and alcohol and drugs and guns. We can only spend so much time thinking about problems in America that seem as if they could easily be resolved when we have so many that cannot." </P>
<P>	Easily resolved? Yes, it could be if the church leaders did what they expect of their followers who have sinned: Make a full confession and accept an appropriate penance. </P>
<P>	Just as politicians from Richard Nixon to Gary Condit paid with their careers for covering up dark deeds, the church leaders who hid sex crimes and silenced victims with cash from the collection plates must pay with theirs. </P>
<P>	From the pope down, church officials must take responsibility, promise "never again," and mean it. This will not by itself put an end to aberrant sexual behavior by the clergy, but it will cleanse an ugly stain from the soul of the church. </P>
<P>	The Rev. Harry Wilkinson of Christ the King Catholic Church in Johannesburg eloquently summed up what must be done and why in a sermon quoted in the same Washington Post story. </P>
<P>	"We have become a global village, and we regret the terrible damage done to the victims, no matter where it happens in the world," he said. "Justice must be done and justice must be seen to be done. </P>
<P>	"But yes, we hope Americans see things in perspective. For every child that was abused by a pedophile priest in America, we have one million African children who will go to bed hungry this evening. Which crisis poses a greater threat to the church?" </P>
<P>	Millions of children go to bed hungry each night in this country, too, while the church's pampered potentates parade in their finery, protest their innocence and cling to the very power that they have abused. </P>
<P>	Now that is a scandal.
