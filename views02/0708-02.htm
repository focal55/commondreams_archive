<p>His name was Michael. He had round cheeks, large brown eyes and dimples that, to strangers, concealed his chronic unhappiness. He was 9 in 1999 when I taught him in fourth grade.</p>
    <p> Michael came to me in October, after his mother had been expelled from the homeless shelter where they were living and an aunt had agreed to take him in temporarily. Unable to write even his name, Michael had academic difficulties and a suspicion of anyone who tried to work with him that spoke of a history of shuttling between schools and shelters and short-term living arrangements.</p>
    <p> I worked all fall to be someone Michael trusted, but it was slow going. Then in January Michael's aunt made the agonizing decision to send him back to his mother, who was living in a hotel room in a nearby town and who had told Michael repeatedly that she didn't want him.</p>
    <p> I was sad to see him go and feared what this change would do to a boy already unable to trust or love adults for fear of losing them. But eventually my memory of him faded amid the noise and bustle of my classroom.</p>
    <p> Faded, that is, until April, when Michael's new school called to tell us that Michael had just registered there, and that they would need his records. What this meant was that between January and April, Michael had been missing, perhaps sitting in his mother's freezing hotel room, where he often would be left for hours, or perhaps wandering through the city by himself.</p>
    <p> Now Michael would start at a new school, stay for two short months and then disappear into the streets of summer. Nobody knew where he would resurface in September, if he resurfaced at all.</p>
    <p> Who, of those who claimed ties with Michael, would use a voucher to choose a school for him? Who would spend hours visiting schools and reviewing their promotional materials? Who would find the necessary forms, fill them out, make sure that transportation to school was taken care of and monitor Michael's progress to ensure that this was a good place for him?</p>
    <p> The voucher system promises choice to parents who often are the victims of American neglect and failure. But for many children, that choice is an illusion.</p>
    <p> Yes, you have a choice, if your parents can read. Yes, you have a choice, if your parents have time to make such decisions -- if they have time off from their jobs, or are working only one job instead of two, or work during the day as opposed to working at night and needing to sleep during the day.</p>
    <p> Yes, you have a choice if your parents have the desire to take advantage of it. Yes, you have a choice if your parents have the money to pay any tuition or other costs that the voucher does not cover. Yes, you have a choice if you are bright and well-behaved and likely to be admitted to private school. Yes, you have a choice if it is feasible for you to go to a school with no free breakfast and no free lunch and no after-care program and possibly no special education.</p>
    <p> But otherwise, you have no choice. You are stuck in your local public school no matter how dismal it may be, and you must suffer there while the false promise of vouchers tricks the people who could help you into looking the other way.</p>
    <p> On June 27 Michael and the thousands of children like him in every corner of our land were cruelly betrayed by a Supreme Court decision, backed by the administration of President Bush, which allows public school funds to be used in the form of vouchers for private school tuition. This is a decision that will widen the gap between the lucky and unlucky children of America. The lucky ones will flourish in private schools made richer with public dollars, while the unlucky will be abandoned in our doomed public schools.</p>
    <p> I know where Michael will be, wandering like a ghost down the joyless and deserted hallways.</p>
