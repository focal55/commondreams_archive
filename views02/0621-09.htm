<p>The remarks made by the Prime Minister's wife, Cherie Booth QC., relating to 
the despair which drives young Palestinians to become suicide bombers, for which 
she later apologized were incisively apt. Perhaps the only mistake she made was 
the apology. 
<p>Speaking at the launch of a £500,000 appeal at the charity <a href="http://www.map-uk.org/" target="_new">Medical 
Aid for Palestine</a> (MAP) with Queen Rania of Jordan, Ms Booth commented: "As 
long as you have young people who feel they have no hope but to blow themselves 
up, you are never going to make progress." Earlier she had commented on the understandable 
desperation of a young who felt they had no present and "no future". 
<p>Ms Booth had watched a graphic slide presentation filmed by a MAP delegation
just returned from Palestine. The group included Sir Andrew Green, former
British Ambassador to Saudi Arabia and Chairman of MAP; Chief Executive, Mrs
Sa'ida Nuseibeh, General Surgeon, Dr Anthony Peel and Dr Swee Chai Ang who
worked in Lebanon in the Sabra and Shatila camps during the time of the
massacre there for which Israel's Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has been held
accountable.

<p>The situation in Palestine is: "shocking", said Sir Andrew. "Towns are surrounded 
by ditches and barbed wire." A permit is needed from the Israelis for Palestinians 
to leave; " .. they are kept waiting then for hours at one of the one hundred 
and twenty checkpoints (which has) a serious effect on medical services ... some 
Israelis themselves are now saying this amounts to a systematic oppression and 
humiliation of a people", leading to "anger,frustration and revenge - if the Israelis 
think they are rooting out terrorism, they are sadly mistaken, they are engendering 
it." Additionally, sixty percent of the Palestinian population live on less than 
two $US a day - sixty percent of men are now unemployed.
<p>"The first thing I do in the morning is count my staff", a hospital director
commented - often they simply do not make it past the check points. In
Nablus, a slide showed the local dentist - behind him was his "surgery" -
bombed by F-16's, demolition completed by Caterpillar bulldozers.

<p>Mrs Sabri, a seventy year old widow with cancer, gazed bleakly out from
another frame. Her family had four times been turned back at check points
trying to take her to hospital. Finally, they put her on a donkey,
transporting her through a circuitous, secret route, rendering her utterly
exhausted. Another patient needing dialysis three times a week has to walk
twelve miles through the mountains to evade the checkpoints, said Sir
Andrew.

<p>But understanding of the depths of desperation which can lead to the decimation 
of humanity by suicide bombers came with the two youngest cases. When Maysoon, 
aged twenty one, went into labor during the night, her husband set off to drive 
her to the hospital. At a checkpoint, he was shot dead, Maysoon was shot twice 
in the back, stripped naked and left in the road for two hours, until an ambulance 
finally arrived, her screams having been heard by locals. Her baby was born in 
the hospital elevator. Her survivor guilt and trauma are so severe that her family 
fear she will commit suicide or become a suicide bomber. 
<p>Ahmed is twelve: "calm, together and determined to kill Israelis." His best 
friend was shot dead in front of him by an Israeli soldier. Fifty three percent 
of Palestinian children suffer from trauma symptoms. MAP aims to build a network 
of councilors and reach the affected within twenty four hours. In Gaza, almost 
certainly the next place to be massively targeted, they aim to establish one hundred 
first aid posts so the injured no longer bleed to death where they lie. 
<p>"The needs are enormous, but no less important is the knowledge that people
in Britain care", says Sir Andrew. Understanding is a start, but it is a
world short of enough.
