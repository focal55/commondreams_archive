<p>All the headlines about corporate disclosures and the need for
transparency are sending shivers through the banking industry and its
regulators who have always lived in a protected and largely secret
world.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of dollars are expended on examinations of
depository institutions, but most of the key findings are treated as
inside information between the bankers and the regulators who see a
mutual advantage in keeping the depositors and investors-and even
Members of Congress-in the dark about the gritty details of their
performance. Only when an institution actually fails and taxpayer-backed
deposit insurance funds are lost do the hard facts of mismanagement and
regulatory miscues become public knowledge.</p>
<p>The lack of timely disclosures about bank conditions arose a few weeks 
ago when a recess appointee to the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
Cynthia Glassman, suggested that the so-called "Camel ratings" of banks 
be made available to the public. Camel ratings compiled by the
regulators are evaluations based on examiners' and supervisors'
assessment of six factors: capital, asset quality, management, earnings,
liquidity, and sensitivity to risk. Performance is based on numerical 
ratings of 1 to 5-with five designated as the worst.</p>
<p>Ms. Glassman's suggestion produced an immediate uproar among regulators 
and the bank lobbyists. Comptroller of the Currency John Hawke, who 
spent most of his career as a big-time bank lawyer and lobbyist,
immediately sent his spokesman out to denounce the idea of public
disclosure, contending that the Camel ratings were an "internal tool of
the regulators."</p>
<p>Other opponents suggested that disclosure of the ratings might cause a 
"run" on a bank by scared depositors. This brings back memories of the
savings and loan collapse in the 1980s when the Chairman of the Federal
Home Loan Bank-Danny Wall--continued to paint rosy pictures and withhold
bad news from the public while behind the scenes the savings 
institutions rotted and edged toward failure. At one point, Wall barged 
into the offices of the General Accounting Office in an attempt to block 
the release of a critical report citing mounting losses and increasing 
drains on the deposit insurance runs. And the friends of the savings and 
loans in key positions on Capitol Hill were all too happy to gloss over 
the worsening conditions until it was too late.</p>
<p>The costs to the taxpayers and the savings and loan industry
increased greatly under this blanket of secrecy. The public release of
the Camel ratings would make it impossible for regulators and banks to
hide conditions and let problems mushroom into disasters ala the savings
and loan collapse. And as the SEC's Ms. Glassman asks "why shouldn't
investors [as well as depositors] have this information."</p>
<p>Richard Carnell, a professor of law at Fordham University and former
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, wholeheartedly endorses the idea of
public disclosure of the Camel ratings, arguing that the disclosure 
would "facilitate constructive criticism of how bank regulators measure 
risk." Carnell was one the key staffers on the Senate Banking Committee 
who urged action on the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s and crafted
many of the reforms after the collapse.</p>
<p>Rather than facing the market discipline which full disclosure would
help instill, the banks and other depository institutions prefer to 
utilize a costly deposit insurance system as a tranquilizer for the 
public. As thespeculation by the savings and loans revealed in the 
1980s, the taxpayer-backed insurance creates a moral hazard that 
encourages excessive risk taking.</p>
<p>Throughout this Congress, much of the banking industry has been on
Capitol Hill in an intensive lobbying campaign to have taxpayer-backed 
deposit insurance increased from its present limit of $100,000 per 
depositor to as much as $150,000 plus indexing for future inflation. The 
present $100,000 limit was pulled out of thin air in 1980 by a handful 
of House-Senate conferees seeking a means of helping the ailing savings 
and loans attract deposits in competition with big money center banks. 
Actually, under loopholes, a family of four could keep as much as two 
million dollars in insured accounts in a single institution.</p>
<p>The secrecy maintained by federal regulators combined with the
tranquilizer of the massive deposit insurance program effectively takes
the public out of the debate about banking policy. As a result, it is 
difficult to build public opinion about legislative and regulatory 
actions which impact on the safety and soundness-not to mention the 
efficiency--of banking corporations, and ultimately on the health of the 
deposit insurance funds.</p>
<p>That was certainly the case in 1999 when the combined lobbying forces
of banks, securities firms and insurance companies pushed through a near 
total rewrite of the nation's financial laws which authorized the 
formation of huge nationwide financial conglomerates-with little or no 
protections for consumers or the taxpayers who stand behind the deposit 
insurance funds.</p>
<p>So, the idea advanced by a lone member of the Securities and Exchange
Commission for disclosure of the regulators' ratings of banks is a 
welcome development in this desolate desert of secrecy which surrounds 
the banking industry. But, don't expect the banks or their regulators to 
agree voluntarily to come out in the sunshine. It is too convenient to 
leave bank regulation asan inside-game. The same is true for the 
Congress-particularly the House and Senate Banking Committees-which 
prefer to legislate favors for the industry without being bothered with 
messy facts in the hands of their voters back home.</p>
<p>But the Enrons, the Worldcoms and the Global Crossings-among others-are 
placing a new premium on open disclosure. Perhaps, the sunshine may 
ultimately reach the musty dark corners of the secret world of banks and 
bank regulation.</p>
