<p>There is a simple rule in politics. The more politicians talk of an institution 
as being "relevant" and "reborn", the more you know it's on its last legs. Yesterday 
the air in Prague was positively tropical with the hot breath of 40 world leaders 
attending a summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization all saying how important 
this venerable alliance was. What they actually meant when you listened carefully 
was that they all had their individual reasons for finding the Organization useful 
at this particular moment.</p>
<p>The Americans, having ignored and, indeed, deliberately marginalized the institution 
over the year since 11 September, now see it as a way of establishing the grand 
alliance to invade Iraq. The Europeans, having bravely talked of being a countervailing 
force to US "unilateralism", are now becoming distinctly nervous that America 
might go its own way and they want Nato to keep the great power locked in. The 
new entrants look upon Nato as a means of consolidating their freedom from Soviet 
power.</p>
<p>All these are valid short-term uses. What they do not add up to is a long-term 
purpose. And that, as any student of military history knows, is the only thing 
that can keep an alliance alive. Nato's great strength has always been that it 
has had a common enemy and an effective system of military command. Now it has 
neither. The enemy has disappeared. Most of the equipment in heavy tanks, ground 
forces and attack aircraft are redundant. And the command structure, as so painfully 
shown in Kosovo, has been undermined by differing interests in more localized 
situations.</p>
<p>That doesn't matter, argues George Robertson, the Secretary General of the 
Organization, because Nato now has a political purpose in reshaping the post-Cold 
War map of Europe to include the former Soviet republics. But if you want a political 
alliance, why not make a new one, or develop it around the existing institutions 
of the European Union? All you do by politicizing the Organization is to confuse 
and undermine the tight central command system that has given it its success so 
far.</p>
<p>President Bush &#150; to the deep relief of Nato staff &#150; has instead come 
up this week with a new "military" purpose for the alliance, or at any rate a 
new enemy. That enemy is "global terrorists who hate freedom, and together we 
can work to defeat that enemy in the name of freedom".</p>
<p>It is balderdash, of course. Anyone who seriously believes that the United 
States is pursuing a crusade for freedom and democracy need only look to the support 
it has given to Uzbekistan and Pakistan since 11 September, never mind its longer-standing 
alliances with Saudi Arabia, China and Kuwait. What it is looking for is national 
security against any forces, and any countries, it perceives as threatening that 
security.</p>
<p>And why not? Alliances are made and held by self-interest not idealism, military 
alliances most of all. For half a century, Nato worked as one of the most successful 
multi-national organizations in history because the security interests of Europe 
and America were felt to be the same &#150; the containment of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The trouble is that those interests have been revealed as profoundly at odds 
over the issue of Iraq. Washington &#150; at least under the present Republican 
administration &#150; sees its primary enemy as coming from states who are not 
friendly to America and have the power to launch weapons of mass destruction against 
it. That includes not just Iraq but Iran, North Korea and, to a lesser degree 
of capability, Syria and Libya. It does not, for the moment, include Pakistan, 
India, China, Ukraine or Israel, all of whom have access to weapons of mass destruction 
and threaten to destabilize their regions.</p>
<p>It would take a considerable exercise in casuistry to claim that this policy 
has anything to do with the war on terrorism as set off by 11 September. For if 
it did, the US has obviously much more to fear from Saudi Arabia, where terrorist 
cells exist throughout the country, or Yemen.</p>
<p>Europe, on the other hand, sees its threats as coming from precisely the other 
way round. On the whole it thinks that the menace from the "rogue states" is less 
pressing and best contained through the traditional diplomatic means of inclusion 
rather than isolation. The real threat is from the terrorism thrown up by poverty, 
instability and religious extremism in the Third World. You only have to consider 
the cases of Iran, Libya or North Korea to realize the huge gap that exists between 
the two approaches.</p>
<p>The particular <i>casus belli</i> of Iraq can be smoothed over between the 
allies &#150; as it has been &#150; through a resort to the United Nations, although 
it still leaves open the question of what happens if the inspectors approve the 
Iraqi response and Bush still decides to go to war. But the divide cannot be bridged 
overall. The two sides, with the presence in between of Tony Blair, are just too 
far apart. And you cannot sustain a military alliance on that basis.</p>
<p>Still less can you regroup that alliance, as Donald Rumsfeld, the US Defense 
Secretary, is insisting, around a combination of vastly increased European military 
expenditures and the creation of a new super rapid reaction force for what is 
referred to as "out-of-theatre operations".</p>
<p>But this only makes the basic dilemma worse. The whole debate set by US politicians 
about comparative Defense expenditures between the US and its allies is a facile 
one. It is perfectly true that US military spending amounts to double that of 
all its Nato allies put together. But that is because the US wishes to be a global 
superpower keeping foreign bases in over 40 countries, maintaining permanent fleets 
in every ocean and a bomber capacity to reach anywhere in the world. Europe has 
not seen its interest in doing that since it gave up its empires.</p>
<p>It is true that Europe badly needs to upgrade its equipment and invest in more 
high-tech and carrying capacity. But it needs this quite aside from its membership 
of Nato. The problem of that Organization is that any decision on out-of-theatre 
action will only exacerbate internal tensions, not ease them.</p>
<p>The chief reason for opposing this desperate attempt to keep Nato on life-support, 
however, is that its continuation diverts attention from &#150; actually obstructs, 
indeed &#150; the development of its successors. In the end, the pattern of world 
Defense, like the patterns of world politics, is likely to be regional. Europe, 
Asia and even perhaps the Arab Middle East will develop mutual support because 
they have to. Whether America acts as a nanny to these infants or as a brooding 
alternative presence has yet to be seen. But the present unipolar world leaves 
too great a vacuum for it not to be filled.</p>
<p>Behind the smiling public faces in Prague, there are few politicians and virtually 
no generals who will not tell you in private that they know the patient is dying. 
It's just that they don't quite dare to kill him off &#150; yet.</p> </p>
