<p><i>“As a nation born in revolution, we know the price of freedom. We will not 
give that up now.”</i> <br>
Dick Cheney, ABC<i>’s “This Week,” September 8, 2002 </i>
<p><i>“As followers of the Prince of Peace, Christians should strive to lessen 
circumstances that could lead to violent conflicts by reducing our consumption 
of oil.” </i>“<br>
What Would Jesus Drive” <a href="http://whatwouldjesusdrive.org/" target="_new">website</a>, 
Nov. 20, 2002 
<p>Our freedoms have a hidden price far steeper than most of us realize. What 
is the cost, for instance, of the freedom North Americans enjoy to drive their 
cars wherever they want, whenever they want? And who pays that price? 
<p>The truth about the cost of the “American Way of Life” can be found in “Strategic 
Energy Policy Challenges for the 21st Century,” a report submitted to Vice President 
Cheney by the Baker Institute for Public Policy in April 2001. The “central dilemma” 
for the United States administration, the report says, is that “the American people 
continue to demand plentiful and cheap energy without sacrifice or inconvenience.” 
The American people’s belief in cheap oil as a birthright is what drives the Bush 
administration’s war plans in Iraq. 
<p>This report stresses Iraq’s potential to help provide a more stable oil fix. 
The U.S. media seems to have passed over the “Strategic Energy Policy” report 
in silence. Only after the European press published excerpts in early November 
2002 did some discussion of the report began appearing in alternative American 
media. But to date, the oil-driven rationale for a “regime change” in Iraq has 
been almost entirely absent from mainstream American media. 
<p>Iraq has the world’s second largest proven reserves of oil. Under Saddam Hussein, 
most of the contracts signed to develop these reserves have been with TotalFinaElf 
of France and Russia’s Lukoil. But Ahmed Chalabi, leader of the U.S.-backed Iraqui 
National Congress, has told the Bush Administration that a post-Saddam, INC-led 
government would not honor those contracts. “American companies will have a big 
shot at Iraqui oil,” Chalabi has made clear. The true aim of the Bush Administration, 
as Peter Beaumont and Faisal Islam reported in The Observer, seems to be the destruction 
of OPEC, which is viewed as incompatible with American interests—that is, the 
right to consume “cheap energy without sacrifice.” 
<p>The United States is an “imperial democracy” which “does not know how to listen 
or reply,” Octavio Paz once wrote. But we can no longer ignore our interdependence 
with the rest of the world. It is imperative that we listen to other voices which 
challenge our definition of freedom. Most people who are angry at America do not 
hate our freedom per se, or our culture. “They hate that you are monopolizing 
all the nonrenewable resources,” a Muslim community leader told Thomas Friedman. 
“As a consequence, you support feudal elements who are trying to stave off the 
march of democracy.” 
<p>What many are saying outside the U.S., few North Americans want to hear. As 
Jeremy Rifkin wrote: “While most Americans think that we are planning an attack 
on Iraq to save the world from a madman, most Europeans think that Bush is the 
madman, with the evil intention of grabbing a foothold in the oil-rich Middle 
East to extend the American empire’.” 
<p>George Bush Sr. once declared that “the American way of life is not up for 
negotiation.” Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld claimed that the War Against Terror 
aimed to persuade the world that Americans must be allowed to continue their way 
of life. But the truth is that “the American way of life is simply not sustainable,” 
as Indian novelist Arundhati Roy has said. 
<p>Our actions speak much louder than our words. Our leaders give us what we demand, 
and everyone who drives is a de facto supporter of an Iraqui invasion. Since even 
most anti-war protesters use and expect cheap oil, opposition to an invasion of 
Iraq is a meaningless gesture, if it is not also tied to a serious effort to come 
to grips with our monstruous oil addiction. 
<p>Such a reckoning has been initiated at a propitious moment from an unlikely 
source: evangelical Christians. The “What Would Jesus Drive?” ad campaign begun 
November 20 will amuse or offend many. Yet the Christian Environmental Network, 
who organized the campaign, have enlisted academic research and government policy 
as well as a Biblical foundation. 
<p>Some of the WWJD campaign’s recommendations are more revolutionary than merely 
purchasing a fuel-efficient ride: “When they move to a new location, Christians 
should choose a place that makes it is easier and more desirable to walk, bike, 
or take public transportation.” And they should “advocate for and support policies 
of governments and practices of businesses” that help citizens develop a sustainable 
lifestyle. 
<p>Conservative Christians have often shown a tendency to treat environmentalists 
as an anti-Christ. But they are surely the only group with the numbers and organization 
to hold the Bush Administration’s “axis of oil” responsible. It will not be the 
secular left who can inspire the American people to ask questions such as: Are 
strip malls and superhighways really the model we want to export to the rest of 
the world? Does the God of the unrestricted free market really bless our headlong 
rush to pave the planet? As Herbert Gunther Chao of the Public Media Center in 
San Francisco points out, if we replicate the American way of life on a global 
scale, and 1.2 billion Chinese are driving cars, that would literally mean the 
death of the planet. And as Christian activists insist, we cannot honor God, yet 
destroy his Creation. 
<p>Yet this is precisely the script of the Bush Administration’s “Pre- Eminence 
Doctrine,” which advocates unchallenged military supremacy, so that competitors 
will be discouraged from “seeking to overturn the established political and economic 
order.” At the heart of that order is our sense of entitlement to cheap petroleum, 
“without inconvenience of sacrifice.” 
<p>We ourselves, the American people, are the cornerstone of the regime of oil, 
which in the final analysis, is only doing our bidding. The costs of the illusory 
freedoms provided by this regime have become too great to bear, both at home and 
abroad. True security requires us to recognize that there will be no freedom from 
terror until we come to terms with our oil addiction.
