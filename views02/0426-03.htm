Among the many responses I’ve received for my columns on the Middle East
two stand out. A number of non-Jews, in person and by e-mail, have told
me, “You write what I believe, but I’m afraid to speak out. I’m afraid to
criticize Israel because people will think that I’m anti-Semitic.” <p>
A second response, spoken by an acquaintance whom I respect for his
decent, liberal values, was more unsettling. “I’m starting to feel
anti-Semitic,” he said without any suggestion of irony. “It is disgusting
what Israel is doing to the Palestinians.” <p>
“Anti-Semitism is not the issue,” I replied. “It’s not Jews attacking
Palestinians, it’s Israelis. Many Jewish people, myself included, share
your disgust.”
<p>
But maybe anti-Semitism is an issue, a subtext of the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict that no one wants to talk openly about. In the cauldron of the
times, anti-Semitism has become an accusation, a weapon, a way of
silencing critics of Israel without having to listen to their arguments.
And when used against Palestinians, it’s a way of denying their
aspirations and ignoring their grievances.
<p> 
Anti-Semitism exists, but to extract its meaning it has to be put into
perspective. Under Hitler, the German people murdered millions of
European Jews. But today most Germans are friends and allies of Jews and
of Israel. As a Jew, I still feel a gut wariness whenever I meet a
German. But I also feel elated. That we two, German and Jew, can interact
empathetically fills me with hope. The history of modern Germany is proof
that people can change, that ancient feuds and tribal bloodbaths need not
dictate humanity’s future. Blacks-whites, Hutus-Tutsis, Bosnians-Serbs,
even Arabs and Jews: we shall overcome. 
<p>
Anti-Semitism exists in the Arab world. Increasingly, Arabs couch their
opposition to Israel in the anti-Semitic rhetoric that originated in
Europe. But is anti-Semitism driving the Palestinian resistance? Or is
the Middle East conflict simply a battle over land, two peoples with a
historic claim over the same territory? For centuries Jews lived amongst
the Arabs of the Middle East. Coexistence was never easy and during World
War II many Arab leaders gave verbal support to the Nazis. But Zionism,
the movement for a Jewish state in Palestine, was a European phenomenon;
Middle Eastern Jews did not look to the biblical holy land for security
and life’s meaning. After the holocaust the logic of Zionism could not be
denied. European guilt assured Israeli statehood. But it was the
Palestinians who bore the brunt. And they were not consulted.<p>
Supporters of Israeli policy in Israel and America, rarely acknowledge
this. They speak of the conflict with the Palestinians in terms of Arab
anti-Semitism, and in the context of the holocaust and Jewish survival.
Rarely mentioned is the historic record of Israeli provocations: the
occupation of the West Bank, the military checkpoints, the continuous
expansion of Jewish settlements in Palestinian territory.<p>
Anti-Semitism in America, except on the margins of society, rarely
includes overt acts of violence and discrimination. It is usually more
subtle, expressed politically in the belief that the United States is a
Christian nation or, among evangelical and some other fundamentalist
Christians, that Jews cannot find salvation unless they accept Christian
dogma. People have an absolute right to religious belief, but once it
enters the political arena, it opens itself to critical comment.<p>
On April 15, an Israeli Solidarity Rally brought speakers from all across
the political spectrum. One speaker was Janet Parshall, a national talk
show host who is a director of the evangelical Christian National
Religious Broadcasters and the spokesperson for the Family Research
Council, an anti-choice, homophobic front-group for right-wing
Republicans whose web site
&lt;<a href="http://www.fcr.org/">www.fcr.org</a>&gt;
promotes tax cuts, bashes liberals, and says nothing about Israel. But at
the Solidarity Rally, Ms. Parshall enthusiastically identified herself
with what she considered the cause of the Jews and drew cheers attacking
the idea of “land for peace.” “We will never give up the Golan,” she
announced. “We will never divide Jerusalem,” she declared.
<p>
Jewish organizations that uncritically support Ariel Sharon in the name
of security for Israel are avidly courting the Christian right. A
headline speaker at a recent meeting of AIPAC (the influential
American-Israeli Political Action Committee) was Republican House Whip
Tom DeLay who drew applause for calling the West Bank by its biblical
name, “Judea and Samaria,” and for stating that Israel should not give
any land back to the Palestinians. Delay’s politics are anathema to most
American Jews, but all that can be overlooked, or so it seems, for his
support of Israel. On his web site
&lt;<a href="http://www.tomdelay.house.gov/">www.tomdelay.house.gov</a>&gt;,
Delay boasts of his 100% support for the positions of <i>New American
Magazine</i>, the house organ of the John Birch Society. He has also
publicly said, according to <i>USA Today</i>, that Christianity offers
the “only viable, reasonable, definitive answer” to the questions of
life. Note the word “only.” No other religions are in the game.
<p>
What then is one to conclude about this new Jewish compact with the most
reactionary elements of American society? It seems to me that right-wing
Christians are happy to support a new crusade to drive Arabs from the
Holy Land, and that they’ll cheer the killing of Palestinians down to the
last Jew. But don’t expect Jewish warriors to be granted salvation. As
the fundamentalist Christians describe it, heaven is off-limits to Jews;
unless, of course, we Jews convert to their right-wing theology and
denounce the religious legitimacy of our own Jewish faith. <p>
In the context of American politics and religious culture, the Jewish
organizations that demand uncritical support of Ariel Sharon have
embraced organizations most closely reflective of anti-Semitism itself.
For the sake of solidarity with Israel they’ve allied themselves with
religious organizations most problematic for Jews. Supporting Sharon is
bad enough. An alliance with the religious right is a second mistake.
