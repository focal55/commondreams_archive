There's been an earthquake in Afghanistan. Thousands of people homeless, 
maybe 200 dead, villages flattened. These were people killed, injured, made 
homeless by a force completely beyond their control, basically an act of 
God, to use a loaded expression. The international community pours in aid, 
American newspapers print the story on the front page. This is an 
appropriate reaction to a horrifying tragedy.

<p>American bombs fall on Afghanistan. Some 6000 civilians have been killed and 
who knows how many injured, made homeless, orphaned. These people have had 
their lives destroyed by a force completely beyond their control. Where's 
the aid? The bombing has prevented the International Red Cross from doing 
its work. Where's the front page coverage? Most American newspapers haven't 
printed body counts except when Americans have died.

<p>So who gets that earthquake aid? Are you somehow more worthy because the 
force that knocked your house down was natural instead of manmade? What if 
you broke your leg in the earthquake and your neighbor broke his leg 
stepping on a land mine? Who deserves help, and why?

<p>It gets weirder. The San Francisco Chronicle printed a story about the 
earthquake and the international relief effort on the front page. They also 
printed two more revealing stories the same day.

<p>On page 12: "Bush extends benefits for WTC jobless." W., in a rare instance 
of doing something that I support, signed legislation extending unemployment 
benefits to people put out of work by the tragedies of September 11. These 
people lost their jobs because of circumstances completely beyond their 
control, and they clearly deserve public support.

<p>And for some real irony, on the front page, right below the earthquake 
story: "High court upholds evictions for drugs." The Supreme Court ruled 
that federal housing authorities can evict people from public housing for 
the crime of being related to someone who has been arrested. So if someone 
in your household is arrested (and the story did say arrested, not 
convicted) on a drug charge, you can be tossed out on the street. If your 
child, father, wife, brother, or even houseguest is arrested, you can lose 
your home for something that was completely beyond your control. I wonder 
what would happen if an earthquake hit a public housing project.

<p>We make these decisions every day. Here in San Francisco, we agree that 
people whose expensive Marina district homes were damaged in the 1989 
earthquake deserved our help. At the same time, we walk past hungry people 
on the street every day. We allow the police to confiscate shopping carts 
that contain all of someone's worldly possessions. Those rich white folks 
from the Marina, if they were on the street for three days, would we let the 
police take their belongings? What if they were homeless for three months? 
Three years? When does someone stop being the victim of a tragedy and start 
being a problem to be dealt with? We'll be stuck with these questions until 
we decide that everyone who is hungry, for whatever reason, deserves to eat.
<p><i>Malaika Finkelstein lives in San Francisco, where she regularly annoys 
everyone at the neighborhood coffee shop by yelling at the newspaper.
