<p>Thirty-one courageous members of Congress, led by Rep. Dennis Kucinich 
(D-OH), are challenging the president's unilateral withdrawal from the 
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. These representatives deserve our 
appreciation for taking action to prevent Mr. Bush from trampling on the 
Constitution in his continuing effort to undermine international law and 
expand US military domination.
<p>This is a critical challenge to the abuse of presidential authority. A lot 
is riding on it. If the president can unilaterally void our laws, which ones will 
be the next to go? Perhaps the first and fourth amendments? If your congressional 
representative is not one of the 31 parties to this lawsuit, he or she should 
be asked why not and urged to join the lawsuit and support it in the Congress. 
<p>Not a single US Senator has had the courage to join this 
lawsuit.  Sen. Russell Feingold (D-WI) initially indicated his intention to 
join the lawsuit, but then backed off when his request to receive pro bono 
legal services was not approved by the Senate Ethics Committee.  All US 
Senators should also be urged to join in this challenge.
<p>The ABM Treaty required a two-thirds vote of the Senate in 1972 
for ratification to enter into force and to become US law.  Now the 100 
members of the Senate appear content to sit on the sidelines as the 
president unilaterally nullifies the law they made.
<p>Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-CA), a plaintiff in the lawsuit, recently 
wrote: "The ABM Treaty is the cornerstone of international arms 
control.  Now that more countries have nuclear weapons, international 
treaties are even more important.  International cooperation is the way to 
peace and international security; not increased military build-up.  Over 
the past 30 years, the ABM Treaty has been a vital link to working with the 
international community and it is more important than ever that we not turn 
our back on it."
<p>Meanwhile, at Fort Greely, Alaska, the Bush administration has 
broken ground on six underground missile interceptor silos, is spending 
more than $7 billion on missile defense this year, and continues to move 
ahead with its plans to weaponize outer space in order to protect US 
interests and investments throughout the world.
<p>Meanwhile, the Russians have withdrawn their ratification of the 
START II Treaty in response to the US withdrawal from the ABM Treaty.  This 
opens the door for the Russians to use multiple independently targeted 
warheads (MIRVs) on their missiles.
<p>Meanwhile, the leaders of India and Pakistan, following the 
example of US leaders, act as though nuclear deterrence will prevent a 
nuclear war between them as they confront each other over Kashmir.
<p>Thank you, Representatives Kucinich and Woolsey and your 
colleagues in this lawsuit for demonstrating unusual courage at a difficult 
time.

<p>COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

<p>PRELIMINARY STATEMENT


<p>1.  In this action 31 Members of Congress seek a declaratory judgment that 
the President's proposed termination of the Treaty on the Limitation of 
Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems ("the ABM Treaty") is unconstitutional and 
of no effect because of the President's failure to seek and obtain the 
assent of Congress.
<p>2. On May 26, 1972, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet 
Socialist Republics signed the ABM Treaty. On August 3, 1972, the United 
States Senate approved the treaty. The treaty entered into force on October 
3, 1972.
<p>3.      The issue of the President's authority to terminate treaties 
without the assent of a majority of both Houses of Congress or two thirds 
of the Senate has never been decided by the courts. It is one of supreme 
importance to the constitutional framework of this nation as well as the 
treaty-based system of international law.

<p>JURISDICTION AND VENUE

<p>4.   Jurisdiction lies under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1651, 2201-2202 in that 
Plaintiffs' claims arise under the Constitution of the United States, 
Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, Article II, Section 3 and Article VI, 
Clause 2.
<p>5.   Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 139(e) because the 
Defendants are officers of the United States sued in their official 
capacities with offices in Washington, District of Columbia.

<p>PARTIES

         <p>6.   Plaintiffs are the 31 Members of the United States House of 
Representatives whose names appear in the caption of this Complaint. 
Plaintiffs file this suit in their official capacities as members of the 
United States Congress.
         <p>7.   George W. Bush is President of the United States. He is sued 
in his official capacity as President.
         <p>8.   Colin Powell is Secretary of State of the United States. He 
is sued in his official capacity as Secretary of State.
         <p>9.    Donald H. Rumsfeld is Secretary of Defense of the United 
States. He is sued in his official capacity as Secretary of Defense.

<p>CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

         <p>10.   Under Article VI, Clause 2 of the Constitution, treaties 
have the status of  "supreme law of the land," equally with federal laws. 
Article II, Section 3 requires the President to "take care that the laws be 
faithfully executed."
         <p>11.   Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution requires 
the concurrence of "two thirds of the Senators present" for the making of a 
treaty by the President, evidencing the Framers' intent that the making, 
modifying and terminating of treaties be the joint prerogative of the 
executive and legislative branches.
         <p>12.   The Constitution is silent on the role of Congress in treaty 
termination. However, under long-standing and well established practice 
since the founding of the Republic, and arising from the fundamental 
separation of powers and system of checks and balances imbued in the 
Constitution from its very origin, the President has a duty to seek and 
obtain the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate or a majority of both 
Houses for the termination of a treaty. It is particularly incumbent upon 
the President to discharge this duty with respect to treaties of great 
importance, such as the ABM Treaty. The President has not done so in this case.

<p>STANDING

         <p>13.   Plaintiffs have sustained a grievous institutional injury by 
being deprived of their constitutional right and duty to participate in 
treaty termination.
         <p>14.    Given the President's mistaken view of his authority to 
engage in treaty termination on his own, Plaintiffs are completely without 
any legislative remedy to rectify the President's proposed unlawful 
termination of the ABM Treaty. There is no legislative action Congress 
could take that would compel the President to submit the matter of treaty 
termination to Congress for its consideration, or to nullify the notice of 
withdrawal the President has given.
         <p>15.   Nevertheless, Plaintiffs are confident that the President, 
when faced with a judicial declaration of the unconstitutionality of his 
act, will move swiftly to seek the Congressional approval required.

  <p>ABM TREATY BACKGROUND

         <p>16.   The ABM Treaty prohibits, with certain minor exceptions, the 
deployment of missile defenses to protect each party's national territory, 
as well as the development, testing, or deployment of sea-, air-, space-, 
or mobile land-based anti-ballistic missile systems or components.
         <p>17.   The treaty's purpose is to prevent a nuclear arms race which 
would vastly increase the likelihood of intentional or accidental nuclear 
war, with such war's catastrophic consequences, and to create more 
favorable conditions for limiting and reducing strategic nuclear arms.
         <p>18.   By prohibiting space-based systems or components, the ABM 
Treaty also acts as a barrier to development and deployment of space-based 
weapons usable against satellites and air or ground targets, as well as 
missiles.
         <p>19.   The ABM Treaty is part of an interlocking framework of arms 
control agreements. It was linked at its inception with the first Strategic 
Arms Limitation Agreement (SALT), and served as a foundation for SALT II, 
which was largely observed but never entered into force, as well as the 
Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty removing US and Soviet missiles from 
Europe, and the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START).
         <p>20.    The Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference for the 
Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, adopted without objection by all 
participating states, including the United States, calls for "preserving 
and strengthening the ABM Treaty as a cornerstone of strategic stability 
and as a basis of further reductions of strategic offensive weapons."
         <p>21.   Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia, Belarus, 
Kazakhstan and Ukraine, as successor states to the Soviet Union, became 
parties to the ABM Treaty and have been so recognized by the United States.
         <p>22.   President Bush, in the context of a new foreign policy 
designed to release the United States from treaty obligations restricting 
its freedom of action, decided to terminate the ABM Treaty. On December 13, 
2001, he sent identical diplomatic notes to Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and 
Ukraine, giving notice of the intended withdrawal of the United States from 
the treaty pursuant to its Article XV, paragraph 2.
        <p> 23.   The ABM Treaty is "of unlimited duration," but Article XV, 
paragraph 2 gives each party the right to withdraw from the treaty on six 
months notice "if it decides that extraordinary events related to the 
subject matter of this Treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests."
         <p>24.   Several Members of Congress have strongly criticized the 
wisdom of terminating the ABM Treaty. Some have questioned whether the 
criterion for withdrawal contained in Article XV, paragraph 2, has been 
met. However, neither a majority of both Houses of Congress nor two thirds 
of the Senate have assented to the termination of the ABM Treaty, nor have 
they been requested to do so by the President.
         <p>25.   On June 6, 2002, lead Plaintiff, Representative Dennis 
Kucinich, offered a resolution "concerning the Privileges of the House," 
which stated, inter alia, "Whereas, the President does not have the 
authority to repeal laws," and concluded, "Therefore, be it resolved, That 
the President should respect the Constitutional role of Congress and seek 
the approval of Congress for the withdrawal of the United States of America 
from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty." After debate, the Chair sustained 
a point of order that the resolution does not constitute a point of 
privilege. Representative Kucinich appealed the ruling, and a motion to 
table the appeal was agreed to by a recorded vote of 254 yeas and 169 nays. 
The resolution therefore was not considered on the merits contrary to the 
wishes of 169 Members of the House.
         <p>26.   On June 10, 2002, on the floor of the Senate, Senator 
Russell Feingold sought unanimous consent to offer a resolution regarding 
the termination of the ABM Treaty.  The resolution stated, inter alia, that 
"it is the sense of the Senate that approval of the United States Senate is 
required to terminate any treaty between the United States and another 
nation" and that "the Senate does not approve the withdrawal of the United 
States from the 1972 Treaty Between the United States of America and the 
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic 
Missile Systems."  An objection was made, and the resolution was not 
considered by the Senate.

<p>TREATY TERMINATION BACKGROUND

         <p>27.   The first instance of treaty termination by the United 
States was the Act of July 7, 1798, signed by President John Adams, by 
which Congress declared "the treaties heretofore concluded with France no 
longer obligatory on the United States." Since then, the vast majority of 
treaties, and virtually all those of serious enduring significance, have 
been terminated by some form of mutual cooperation between the President 
and Congress.
         <p>28.   The one salient exception was the termination of the Taiwan 
Mutual Defense Treaty by President Carter acting alone in 1978. In that 
instance, a sharply divided Supreme Court, lacking a clear majority 
position, let stand the President's termination on a variety of 
non-substantive grounds without reaching the fundamental issue of the 
President's authority to terminate treaties without the assent of one or 
both Houses of Congress. The President's position on the merits was that 
the termination was a consequence of his decision to transfer recognition 
from Taiwan to the People's Republic of China pursuant to the well 
established and exclusive Presidential power of recognition under the 
Constitution. That position was accepted by the only Supreme Court Justice 
to reach the merits. No such power of the President is involved in the 
termination of the ABM Treaty.
         <p>29.   There is ample evidence that the Framers intended Congress 
to have a role in the termination as well as the making of treaties.

<p>FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

         <p>30.   The President's proposed termination of the ABM Treaty 
without the assent of Congress violates Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of 
the Constitution and is inconsistent with two centuries of practice and 
with the overall design of separation of powers and checks and balances of 
the Constitution.

<p>SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

         <p>31.   Since treaties have the status of laws, the President's 
proposed termination of the ABM Treaty without the assent of Congress 
violates Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, which obliges the 
President to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.

<p>RELIEF

<p>WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court enter an Order as follows:
<p>(a)   Declaring that the President's withdrawal from the ABM Treaty is 
without force and effect until such time as the President has requested and 
received the assent of a majority of both Houses of Congress or two thirds 
of the Senate;
<p>(b)   Ordering that the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense and 
their subordinate officers are enjoined from taking any action in violation 
of the ABM Treaty until its termination has received the assent of a 
majority of both Houses of Congress or two thirds of the Senate;
<p>(c)   Awarding Plaintiffs their costs and reasonable attorneys' fees 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(a) and (d); and
<p>(d)   Granting such other and further relief as may be just and proper.
