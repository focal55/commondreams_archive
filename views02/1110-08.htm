<p>In the White House or Camp David &#150; wherever President Bush and his entourage 
have gathered today &#150; there must be much rejoicing, mingled with great relief. 
At the beginning of the week, the American mid-term elections really did seem 
capable of going either way, and who of us would have been surprised had the Democrats 
retained control of the Senate and picked up a few seats in the House? Again, 
who was confident a week ago that the Security Council would actually reach a 
compromise that would produce a unanimous vote in favor of a tough resolution 
over Iraq?</p>
<p>Now, the fogs have lifted and the landscape ahead looks a lot clearer. On Bush's 
domestic front, the obstacles of a Democratic-dominated Senate are no more; committee 
agendas fall back into Republican hands, as the new chairmen take over, and the 
Democrats lie around in confusion. Will this shift in the Congressional power 
balances make for a super-activist conservative agenda at home, as the Right desires? 
One doubts it, for two reasons.</p>
<p>The President is honing himself to be a national and historic figure, not a 
mere, divisive politician. The Homeland Security Bill will be a shoe-in now, not 
just because of presidential popularity but mainly because of the sharply increased 
fears of the American people &#150; fears which the Director of Homeland Security, 
Tom Ridge, and Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, cannot help but increase 
every time they testify before Congress and warn of future deadly attacks upon 
America. But the tax-cut idea may not go so easily, or actually be pushed all 
that hard. The Federal Reserve will not like it, nor will Wall Street bankers, 
nor much of the American public, battered as it is by the revelations of corporate 
greed.</p>
<p>But the greater reason why we may not see much new domestic legislation, which 
would be strongly ideological and partisan, is that the President's gaze is upon 
the outside world &#150; towards Iraq and terrorism, in that order. It is there 
he will be found, clothed in the mantle of a national and world leader, a Lincoln, 
a Clemenceau, a Churchill, a Ben-Gurion.</p>
<p>The mid-term election results &#150; miserably low though the voter turnout 
was, and miserably weak though the Democratic leadership was &#150; have given 
him the go-ahead to devise policies for nailing Saddam Hussein. Perhaps those 
electoral victories helped to push wavering Security Council members to support 
the Anglo-American resolution, or perhaps they would have fallen in line in any 
case.</p>
<p>What is clear is that Friday's Security Council vote came as a relief to Washington. 
If any public-opinion poll finding has been consistent this past year, it is that 
the majority of Americans do not want to fight abroad without allies and without 
United Nations approval. The hawks may not have liked that fact but, heck, it 
doesn't matter now. These two large hurdles, as they appeared at the beginning 
of the week, have been cleared &#150; and pretty easily.</p>
<p>There must be, one supposes, a million-to-one chance that Saddam Hussein will 
elect to go into quiet retirement now that he has received the unanimous approval 
of a grateful people in his elections. And pigs might fly. The odds must be almost 
as large that he will hand over his entire weapons-production empire to an entirely 
open inspection by the UN team, and that there will be a clean bill of health, 
without obstruction. Frankly, it seems hard to believe that the US will not find 
a cause for the stiffer consequences implicit in the new Security Council resolution. 
So the prospect of American-led military action is high &#150; quite a bit higher, 
perhaps, than it was last week, despite the White House threats.</p>
<p>And the military campaign itself? Well, most of the pundits got it wrong before 
both the Gulf War and the Taliban War. All the talk of fanatical defense, of house-to-house 
fighting, of impossible mountain terrains, ignored the fact that the Pentagon 
was planning to use a truly awesome amount of air power and missile power to blast 
the enemies' troops into surrender or oblivion. Week after week, reports come 
in of more and more US units being sent to Oman, of bomber squadrons flying east, 
of gigantic vessels for carrying tanks gathering north of Diego Garcia. These 
people take no chances. Why spend nearly half of the world's entire defense expenditure 
if you can't guarantee victory?</p>
<p>So there is a strong chance that President Bush will do what his father decided 
not to do: that is, he will cross his Rubicon and enter Baghdad. Should victory 
happen like that, all his presidential reputation will then rest upon a successful 
rebuilding of that unhappy land, not just in the arenas of its economy and infrastructure 
but, even more, in its social fabric, democracy and rule of law. That is what 
the US did a half-century ago in Japan and West Germany, although in recent decades 
it has shown an aversion to "state building", preferring to leave that to the 
UN or helpful Scandinavians. One suspects that this time, however, there will 
be very few Norwegians, Canadians and Germans who volunteer for civic duty in 
Iraq. The country may well become the new mandate of Mesopotamia, but the mandatory 
power will be the US, not Britain. American right-wing strategists are now talking 
about this with complacency.</p>
<p>But this complacency &#150; about the outcome of the war and the making of 
the peace &#150; strikes me as extraordinarily risky. The military aspects may 
be tempting, but as a grand strategy it lacks serious consideration of the political, 
diplomatic and economic elements. The US balance-of-payments deficit is unprecedented, 
and really not sustainable. The federal budget deficit is ballooning, just as 
a "double dip" recession threatens. A Middle East war will send more American 
airlines scuttling into bankruptcy courts. Lord knows where oil prices will be. 
And all this is happening at a time when Japan trembles on the brink, most of 
Latin America is in desperate trouble, a laggard Germany slows any European recovery, 
Sharon is looking to punch his way out of his own induced crisis, North Korea 
wobbles between collapse and a mad-dog action, and India and Pakistan &#150; well, 
never mind.</p>
<p>Then there are the other trade-offs, almost all negative. In gratitude for 
their endorsement of the Security Council resolution, Russia and China can do 
what they like with their own regional problems. A dreadful state such as the 
Sudan will have a blind eye turned to genocide in the south because its regime 
has promised to root out al-Qa'ida cells. Another million or two people may soon 
be slaughtered in central Africa, but the CNN cameras will be in Baghdad, so we 
won't notice. Palestine will again go on the back burner. The world's human rights 
organizations must be bracing themselves to deal with the impossible demands upon 
them that lie ahead. Latin America, even Mexico, will find it hard to get Washington's 
attention. Egypt and Saudi Arabia may totter. Central Asia may have to fend for 
itself. What will be the next case before the Security Council, and who will want 
to push for it?</p>
<p>It is hard not to worry about the risks that might follow from a decision by 
Bush to march upon Baghdad. If it goes peacefully, or a campaign is brief and 
without great reverberations, we should all be grateful. But the odds, I think, 
are against. Crossing the Rubicon to gain control of Rome, and all that Rome possessed, 
was one thing and involved great risks. But entry into Baghdad would have wider 
consequences. Many of them are as yet unforeseen. Who of us knows where our world 
might be even by next summer?</p>
