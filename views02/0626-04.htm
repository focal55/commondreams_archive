<p>NORMAN MINETA, the transportation secretary whose plan for Amtrak is to starve 
it into a cadaver, sang the glories of privatization last week before the US Chamber 
of Commerce. ''We firmly believe that marketplace discipline could deliver higher-quality 
service at competitive prices,'' Mineta said. ''We believe that clear-eyed, comprehensive, 
financially responsible transportation planning'' is ''crucial to the future of 
new forms of passenger rail.''
<P>Most people know that since the Bush administration has given no thought to 
rail as it bails out the bungling airlines, Mineta's proclamations are peaking 
on the same snicker meter as Christine Todd Whitman's over at the Environmental 
Prostration Agency. It does not matter, for instance, that ridership for the Acela 
Express has shot up from 96,000 prior to the terrorist attacks to 205,000 riders 
in February, 220,000 in March, and 243,000 in April.</P>
<P>Rather than expand upon what Acela is doing right - like, duh, it moves faster, 
because, duh, the government invested in equipment - Bush and Mineta have declared 
Amtrak an unmitigated disaster. Bush is offering Amtrak only $512 million in federal 
funds in 2003, less than half of what Amtrak asked for and less than a quarter 
of what the General Accounting Office says is needed for American passenger rail 
to join the 21st century. This week, Amtrak is feverishly asking for $200 million 
in emergency loan guarantees to avoid a shutdown.</P>
<P>In his 1,600-word speech to the chamber, Mineta did not once mention the Acela, 
let alone praise it. He came to bury Amtrak altogether under the mantra of ''The 
country can ill afford to throw billions of federal dollars at Amtrak and just 
hope its problems disappear.... Merely hoping for better performance is a doomed 
approach.''</P>
<P>Mineta looks ridiculous in his trust of the marketplace when there is a dubious 
example that privatization can be a doomed approach. In Britain, privatizating 
the rails was the express to yet another train wreck.</P>
<P>In the mid-1990s, the much-maligned British Rail was broken up into many pieces. 
After years of complaining about bloated bureaucracies, British passengers hailed 
the new system, overseen by Railtrack, with increased ridership. What quickly 
unfolded was the flipside of waste, the tragedy of being cheap.</P>
<P>In the drive for profit, the rail lines were fragmented to the point where 
Railtrack had 2,000 subcontractors. Engineers who understood systems and track 
inspectors who intimately knew specific portions of rail down to their bolts were 
dispersed into separate companies or given pink slips. Institutional memory, by 
many accounts in the British press, resembled a bowl dropped from so high a cabinet 
shelf that the fragments were beyond the hope of any glue. Christian Wolmar, author 
of ''Broken Rails: How Privatization Wrecked Britain's Railways,'' recently wrote 
that privatization of the industry ''resulted in the loss of its culture.... Everything 
is contracted out to casual labor.''</P>
<P>How fragmented and casual the system had become was betrayed in several fatal 
train crashes since 1997 that have claimed a total of 59 lives. In the five years 
before privatization, Wolmar wrote, there had been only eight train fatalities. 
The crashes caused massive enforced slowdowns of trains because rail operators 
had little or no clue where other sections of broken rail lay. The disgraced CEO 
of Railtrack, Gerald Corbett, was forced to say that the breakup of British Rail 
was not designed ''to optimize safety, optimize investment, or cope with the huge 
increase in passengers.'' By December 2000, Prime Minister Tony Blair called a 
ride on public rail as ''absolute hell.''</P>
<P>For practical purposes, the British government is for now overseeing the rails 
again with a not-for-profit company called Network Rail. The government is holding 
out hope for continued private investment and has left many of the operating and 
maintenance contractors in place. But the fires fanned in the Hades of privatization 
remain hot. If you think Amtrak's need of $200 million in emergency loans sounds 
like a lot, the British rails may face between $15 billion to $20 billion in shortfalls 
to maintain its 10-year transportation plan.</P>
<P>Last month, Tim James, one of the researchers in an independent review by the 
University of Sheffield and Oxford Economic Research Associates, said, ''The train 
companies are basically bust.''</P>
<P>The bust of Britain has been so spectacular that Germany has slowed the brakes 
on its own plans for privatization. On the other side of the globe, Bush and Mineta 
have yet to see the broken rail that lies in their path.</P>
