WHEN U.S. Navy planes resumed the dropping of nonexplosive bombs last 
week on the firing range in Vieques, I felt compelled for the first time to 
protest on behalf of my Puerto Rican hermanos y hermanas.
<P>Having written for Latino-focused media in the past, I wasn't completely 
ignorant of the struggles between the people of Vieques and the U.S. Navy. But 
I never cared.
<P>Even when two Marine jet bombs were dropped off target, killing a Puerto 
Rican guard working on the range in April 1999, I was unmoved from my cozy 
sofa in California, eating rice and beans and watching Ricky Martin prance 
around on TV. It may as well have been Afghanistan or Israel or some other 
faraway place. Why should I care about something that was going on more than 3,
000 miles away? My Puerto Rican surname wasn't a good enough reason.
<P>Such was my attitude when I hopped on a plane a month after the Sept. 11 
terrorist attacks. I chanced flying the emptier, but friendlier, skies between 
San Francisco and Puerto Rico because I refused to let a bunch of terrorists 
bust up my vacation plans.
<P>Initially, my ambition was selfish, but the trip taught me the true 
multilayered complexity of terrorism, and changed my ambivalent feelings about 
the island of my cultural roots.
<P>My father and mother were born in Puerto Rico, in Guayanilla and San 
Sebastian, respectively. Each town is small compared to the Big Apple, where 
they moved with their families when they were kids. I was born in New York, 
which is why I consider myself a Nuyorican.
<P>Like many Nuyoricans, I never felt particularly connected to Puerto Rico. 
Every summer, I would visit my grandparents' farm in Fajardo, a small town 
that overlooks the rain forest, El Yunque. But those visits never moved me to 
love the island of my parents and grandparents, or to write poetry about my 
long-lost "isla del encanto," like the tragic poet and playwright Miguel 
Pinero, who felt he had been robbed of his tropical birthright when his 
parents moved him to New York for "una vida mejor," a better life.
<P>"Better than what?" I used to ask.
<P>In between lounging on beaches and sipping from coconuts during my two-week 
excursion in October, I happened to take a ferry to Vieques. That's when I 
understood why so many Puerto Ricans leave the island for New York. They get 
no respect.
<P>Since 1941, the Navy has used two thirds of Vieques as its personal 
training range. Planes drop bombs, ships hurl shells at the shore and Marines 
practice amphibious landings. According to those who want the Navy out, the 
rate of cancer in Vieques is much higher than the rest of Puerto Rico. The 
drinking water is contaminated. There is a higher incidence of lupus, asthma, 
scleroderma, telarquia, kidney and heart disease and child mortality. 
Unemployment runs high and educated kids take off for college and rarely 
return.
<P>Until an alternative location becomes available, the Navy's claim to 
national security may prevent President Bush from keeping his promise to move 
the Navy out by May 2003. Earlier this year, other locations were used for 
live-bomb exercises, including Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and Pinecastle 
range in Florida.
<P>I heard various opinions about the Navy from the people of Vieques during 
my visit.
<P>"Most Viequenses are not anti-Navy," said Richard Fitz, a retired New 
Yorker who runs a hostel on the island. "The Navy just offered to staff our 
hospital, and our idiot mayor refused."
<P>Meanwhile, he added, "the boat to Fajardo is filled with the elderly and 
children having to go for X-rays because our hospital does not have the 
equipment or the personnel to run it. That is a typical political injustice 
that we endure here. I believe that the forces behind getting rid of the Navy 
are big developers who can't wait to rape our island."
<P>But many others -- including a taxi driver who stopped at his daughter's 
school to give her lunch money before taking me to the beach -- said that the 
Navy is not only contaminating their children's futures, but also preventing 
many of the island's 10,000 people from earning the living they need to raise 
their families. Military control of much of the best land slows the 
development of agriculture or tourism, they say. Fishermen claim Navy 
exercises have damaged marine environments.
<P>"Vieques Libre" signs were everywhere on the island, but I didn't see any 
protesters picketing along Navy boundaries. The protest movement, which had 
gained worldwide attention in 1999, has lost vigor and support since Sept. 11, 
probably because the Navy ceased training and refocused its immediate 
attention on New York and Washington, D.C. I happened to visit during the 
break in the bombing. Picturing it now as a bombing zone disturbs me as much 
as the images of the planes crashing into the World Trade Center towers.
<P>I saw an island that seemed too pristine for the kind of terror people said 
it was experiencing. The water was a fresh, turquoise blue. The sand slipped 
like powdered sugar through my fingers. But it is not pristine or untouched. 
Just because I couldn't see the poisons, doesn't mean they weren't there. Just 
because I couldn't see the bombs falling on April 1, doesn't mean it didn't 
happen.
<P>And just because I'm 3,000 miles away, doesn't mean I no longer care.
