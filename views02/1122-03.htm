<p>UNICEF just released statistics showing a significant improvement in the nutritional status of children in Iraq. According to the figures, over the last two years chronic malnutrition has declined by 23%, and acute malnutrition has declined by almost 50%. 

<p>The improvement is visible. At the hospitals I’ve visited, particularly in 
Central and Northern Iraq, wasting diseases such as kwashiorkor and marasmus are 
no longer pandemic. And while doctors throughout Iraq continue to report shortages 
in essential medicines and equipment, pediatric cancers have replaced malnutrition 
as their chief complaint. Despite these improvements - UNICEF figures show that 
over 1 in 5 Iraqi children remain malnourished. Our work isn’t over yet. 
<p>There are several reasons why malnutrition has
declined - almost all due to busting sanctions. One
reason is, fairly obviously, because more food is
available. In December 1999, the UN lifted the limit
it had placed on Iraqi oil sales through the
Oil-for-Food program, and in early 2000 exempted food
from the security review process. This allowed Iraq to
import more food, more quickly, and distribute it to
families in need. Of the $24.2 billion in supplies
Iraq has been allowed to import under the Oil-for-Food
program to date, almost $10 billion has arrived in
just the last year - allowing the Iraqi government to
increase the food ration they provide to everyone in
Iraq. 

<p>The last two years have also brought good rainfall,
ending the previous drought in Iraq, and providing
bumper crops. This not only increased the supply of
food available in local markets, but brought down
prices as well, allowing some families to supplement
their ration at local markets. However, the ration
still represents the only source of food for a
majority of families, and, for many, their sole source
of income as well. Sanctions still prevent the Iraqi
government from spending its own money within the
country. As a result, only dry goods, imported from
outside the country, can be included in the food
ration. The increased ration still does not contain
any fresh fruits or vegetables, or animal protein. 

<p>Recent, illegal trade agreements between Iraq and its neighbors, and increased smuggling, have also impacted nutrition by bringing more goods and hard currency into the country. According to a September 2002 overview of the nutritional status of Iraqi children, UNICEF reports that “[m]ajor shifts in Security Council Resolutions and government of Iraq regional trade policies are among the basic factors that have improved child malnutrition in the South/Centre [of Iraq].”

<p>Additionally, the Iraqi government, in conjunction
with UNICEF, has built 2,800 Community Child Care
Units (CCCUs), staffed by almost 13,000 Iraqi
volunteers, in order to provide nutritional
assessment, counseling, and therapy to children in
need. These units now screen an average of 1.1 million
children every year. 

<p>Without safe drinking water, children contract chronic
diarrhea and are unable to absorb nutrients, so
improvements in essential civilian infrastructures
have also had an effect on malnutrition. Electricity
is necessary to run water and sanitation plants, and
Iraq has reduced its electrical deficit from 3000
megawatts in 1996 to 900 megawatts today. Iraq has
also been able to increase the availability of potable
water in urban areas to almost 2/3 of what it was in
1990. This has led to a reduction in diarrhea cases
among children under the age of 5. But it’s not all
good news. According to the “Profile of Women and
Children in Iraq (UNICEF, April 2002), “Diarrhea
leading to death from dehydration and acute
respiratory infections together account for 70% of
child mortality in Iraq. An Iraqi child suffers an
average of 14.4 diarrhea spells a year, an almost 4
fold increase from the 1990 average of 3.8 episodes.
During the same period, typhoid fever increased from
2,240 to over 27,000 cases.”

<p>Despite repeated denials by every UN agency and NGO
working in Iraq, the U.S. continues to claim that the
only reason people are suffering under sanctions is
because of their government. However repressive that
government may be, the programs Iraq has put in place
to deal with malnutrition, and the improvements that
have resulted, should finally put to rest U.S.
allegations about Iraqi “interference” in the
functioning of the Oil-for-Food program. 

<p>Unfortunately, recent improvements are likely to be short-lived. There is currently a multi-billion dollar shortfall in the money available for the Oil-for-Food program. In order to stem the “crumbling” of sanctions, the U.S. has begun enforcing a policy on oil sales called “retroactive pricing.” Under this policy, purchasers of Iraqi oil are not allowed to know the price of the oil they have bought for up to a month after they’ve received it. Given the volatility of the oil market, this uncertainty has led to steep declines in sales. According to the UN Development Program’s June 2002 brief for Iraq, “the Oil-for-Food Programme is increasingly facing a financial crisis due to the substantial drop in revenues received from Iraqi oil exports and to uncertainties regarding the pricing mechanism.” If this crisis isn’t quickly reversed, the program will falter, and malnutrition rates will again begin to rise.

<p>The other major problem on the horizon is the war
George Bush keeps promising to deliver. If the U.S.
bombs electrical plants, and water and sewage
treatment centers in Iraq, as was done during “Desert
Storm,” the result is going to be even greater
epidemics than Iraq is currently suffering from. If
civil war breaks out, or if the U.S. bombs roads,
rail, and all the bridges, as was done during “Desert
Storm,” the result will be country-wide famine. 

<p>Iraq began food rationing prior to the Gulf War, when
sanctions were first imposed. The Iraqi government
only accepted the restrictions on its sovereignty
imposed by the Oil-for-Food program when it became
clear in 1995 that internal stores were no longer able
to meet the crisis caused by sanctions. This
distribution of food, to 24 million people on a
monthly basis for over 12 years, is one of the most
massive, logistical operations in world history. How
well this program could work, during the middle of a
war and invasion, is not something we should want to
discover. 

<p>If we care about the children of Iraq, then we need to
stop this war from happening. But, in the end, the
only thing that will truly end Iraq’s humanitarian
crisis, and put an end to malnutrition once and for
all, is if we stop the war that is already going on.
Economic sanctions are intended to damage economies
and increase poverty. Increased poverty means
increased malnutrition. And - no matter how hard
UNICEF, or the Iraqi government, or anti-sanctions
activists try - there's no way around that.
