<p>As the United States edges towards a possible war against Iraq, a sudden torrent 
of concern has begun to flow - a revolt by the intelligentsia spreading beyond 
the expected opposition political circles and penetrating the heart of the media 
and foreign policy establishment. 
<P>From New York to the plains of Kansas, local and provincial papers, glossy 
magazines, serious periodicals and heavyweight national dailies have carried a 
range of articles and essays that challenge not only the proposed war, but the 
notion and conduct of unilateral American power in the world. 
<P>But the most dramatic intervention comes from President George Bush's own United 
Methodist church which launched a scathing attack on his plans for war. 
<P>Jim Winkler, responsible for the application of the church's teachings to social 
policy, said war against Iraq was 'without any justification according to the 
teachings of Christ'. 
<P>After careful study of Christian doctrinal writings on Just War, Winkler said 
he was 'told flatly' by the church's scholars, 'that they simply did not apply 
to this situation'. 
<P>Winkler said 'we keep the lines of communication open' to the White House, 
but added: 'I regret that the lines have been one way. I hope and pray that the 
President has considered the church's teachings.' 
<P>Winkler's sentiments have an impact beyond the usual circles of dissent in 
a church-going society that, for the most part, supports Bush. 
<P>From the Bush heartland, from Kansas, where they teach the creation instead 
of evolution in schools, come surprising voices of objection. The Kansas City 
Star ran a long account of 'voices of opposition from people of faith', quoting 
Winkler at length, saying: 'United Methodists have a particular duty to speak 
out against an unprovoked attack. It is inconceivable that Jesus Christ would 
support this proposed attack.' 
<P>The latest salvo came on Friday from the unimpeachable New York Review of Books 
in an article by one of the country's leading commentators, Anthony Lewis, arguing 
that a regime change in Iraq could be 'the first step towards a new American imperium'. 
Meanwhile, wrote Lewis, 'the fear of looking unpatriotic inhibits dissent'. 
<P>The uprising of the intelligentsia has burst its banks. The essayist Susan 
Sontag sounded the first alarm across the opinion page of the New York Times on 
the poignant date of 10 September (the article was intended for the eleventh, 
but was shifted to make way for one signed by the President). 
<P>In it Sontag wrote: 'Real wars are not metaphors _ they have a beginning and 
an end_ But the war that has been declared by the Bush administration will never 
end. That is one sign that it is not a war, but, rather, a mandate for expanding 
the use of American power.' 
<P>Then the theme spread. Most unexpectedly, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution 
- published in the capital of the conservative South - broadened the language 
of the debate with an article by its leading commentator headlined 'Invasion would 
mark the next step towards an American empire'. 
<P>The author rejected claimed links between Iraq and al-Qaeda. His article goes 
on to say that 'among the architects of this would-be American empire are a group 
of people who now hold key positions in the Bush administration: they envision 
the creation and enforcement of a Pax Americana'. 
<P>One of America's most illustrious historians of the Vietnam and Reagan eras, 
Frances Fitzgerald, then took the stage in the New York Review of Books to demand 
that Bush 'tell us about the risks' involved in entwining a war against Iraq around 
that against terror. 'The Bush administration has clearly broken with internationalist 
premises accepted by every other administration since World War II.' 
<P>Fareed Zakaria is a pillar of the American foreign policy establishment, an 
instinctive conservative, former confidante of the National Security Adviser Condoleezza 
Rice and previously editor of the journal Foreign Affairs . 
<P>In the current New Yorker, Zakaria warns of the perils of a unipolar world 
in which America is the sole power. He urges the US to 'gain the legitimacy that 
comes through an international consensus. Without this cloak of respectability 
America will face a growing hostility around the world.' 
<P>In the non-political Atlantic Monthly , James Fallows meticulously dissects 
the various stages of an invasion of Iraq, foreseeing dire consequences: 'If we 
can judge from past wars, the effects we can't imagine when the fighting begins 
will prove to be the ones that matter most.' 
<P>The editorial sages at the American Prospect magazine, Paul Starr, Robert Kuttner 
and Harold Meyerson, write what many others are thinking, that 'the suspicion 
will not die that the administration turned to Iraq for relief from a sharp decline 
in its domestic political prospects, corporate scandals, and the fall of the stock 
market'. 
<P>Looking forward, the authors add: 'If the fighting turns ugly and there are 
large numbers of civilian casualties - if we have to level the very cities we 
say we are liberating - American legitimacy in the eyes of the world and of the 
Iraqis will be shot. International law seems to count for nothing in this administration's 
view of the world.' 
<P>As well as the glossy magazines, last week some of America's weightiest newspaper 
columnists - conservatives and liberals alike - aligned themselves firmly against 
the upcoming war. 
<P>'Texas on the Tigris' mocked the New York Times ' Maureen Dowd, jibing at the 
oil interest that flows through every vein of the Bush administration. 
<P>Thomas Friedman of the New York Times , seen by many as one of the conservative 
apologists for any strategy that backs Israel, also joined the opposition fray. 
'Iraq cannot prevent an American victory. But it might be able to extend a war 
over weeks and months, imposing significant costs and putting on a bloody show 
for the rest of the world.'</I></p>
