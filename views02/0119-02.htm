As our government works to build democracy abroad and restore the economy at 
home, we must not ignore the recently approved changes to American education. 
The passage of the “No Child Left Behind” education reform bill signifies both 
the largest-ever overhaul of the federal role in education, and the largest 
increase in federal school funding. Most significantly, this bill’s acceptance 
represents our society’s changing view of the purpose of education. 
Policy-makers have come to an agreement in this bill: we go to school so that 
we can get a job. Public education is now largely evaluated by its utility to 
the private sector. This new legislation seems to codify corporate-education; 
what we really need to do is challenge it.
<p>The core belief behind this bill is that all American children, even those in 
poor, under-funded schools, can succeed academically if government money on 
schools is spent efficiently. The belief that all children can succeed 
academically is a recent addition to American social thought. At the country’s 
founding, education was perceived as a privilege reserved for the upper 
classes. The idea of providing education to the poor was an unpopular one. But 
education’s power was never underestimated or undervalued by have-nots. 
Ex-slaves and immigrants struggled to create educational opportunities for 
their children, seeing schooling as central to climbing society’s ladder. 
After the Civil War and in the early twentieth century Americans’ views of the 
purpose of schooling changed. Schools became a means of social control and 
assimilation, where immigrant children were turned into true patriots. 
Scholars of the time, such as Horace Mann, sought to modify this idea. They 
saw education not only as an assimilator, but as an equalizer of economic and 
social opportunity. It was hoped that publicly funded “common schools” would 
be places where all Americans, even the poor, could succeed and create a happy 
existence.
<p>Since the time of Mann, however, our vision of the purpose of education has 
changed to a view with strictly economic ends. With an economy increasingly 
reliant on technological advancement, “basic skills” are required of every 
would-be worker in the country. This view is in dire need of re-examination. 
Schools already are responsible for the teaching of everything from cooking to 
automobile operation, not to mention academics. Nevertheless, more than any 
reform law before it, the newest changes to schools will require that they 
ensure and maintain a labor supply with at least minimum competency in reading 
and mathematics, as evidenced by tests. This change came not at the request of 
parents or teachers, who already feel over-tested in many cases, but largely 
from corporate lobbyists promoting the use of standardized tests as a way to 
ensure future labor. Testing and text book companies have agreed, adding their 
support to the testing lobby. New tests require new curricula, and new 
curricula require new books. Never mind promises of local control, President 
Bush’s mandate of “scientifically based teaching methods” might end up 
translating to “use this book from this company.” Let the profits roll in.
<p>Many educators and activists have fought for improved access to education, 
desegregation, better teachers and resources, and funding increases for years. 
Few individuals would have thought that the most significant federal changes 
to public schooling would come in this form. It is sad that calls for renewed 
attention to public education by teachers, parents and academics could not 
awaken a response in our public officials the way the financial muscle of the 
corporate voice did. Beware: the education of America’s children is not safe 
from the American corporate-political machine.
<p>Most troubling of all is the façade of equity accompanying the new education 
laws. The philosophy is this: if you introduce evaluation and accountability 
into the system, everyone who has been too lazy thus far to care will be 
forced to. This free-market principle is a bad rule to use when making 
education policy. But our newest education laws are informed more by 
businessmen than by sociologists, economists, or even cognitive psychologists. 
As a result, these laws are flawed in their understanding of schools, the 
needs of teachers, and the way children learn. Worst of all, nothing in the 
new legislation, or in other recent federal policies, addresses larger social 
problems. Child poverty has long been held the greatest determinant of school 
success and failure, yet policy-makers continually ignore its violence on 
youth. Changing the operations of schools is important, but what about Head 
Start, free day care for all, and universal child health care and nutrition?
<p>Our understanding of education’s purpose is missing the point, leading us 
into bad policymaking. Schools can fight social inequality, but as long as 
larger social problems are unaddressed, the status quo of school success and 
failure will remain. A new approach to education is needed. We should value 
the beauty of youth and creativity of children, and learn to see children as 
talented and creative individuals, not pawns of the corporate world. In a 
democratic society, education should serve the needs of the individual, 
helping her to maximize her potential and develop her creative, artistic, and 
aesthetic capabilities. Education ought not simply prepare the student to 
become a worker. It must help the student train himself to think, to be 
resourceful, and to love learning. We ought to teach students how to live in a 
changing world, how to adapt to it, and most importantly, how to change it. 
The focus of all education ought to be critical thought and civic 
participation.
<p>Ending the economically-driven vision of education reform ought to be a 
priority among progressives. We must realize that we cannot have excellence in 
our schools until we have equity. As long as some schools are completely 
under-funded and under-resourced while others schools are wealthy, the 
condition of all public education is unacceptable. If we hope to create school 
success, we must empower the marginalized by improving their lives, not by 
giving them a test.
