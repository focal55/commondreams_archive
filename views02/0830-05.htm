<p>Ever since the first public transit -- a ferryboat near Boston in 
1630 -- got underway, a Broad variety of carriers have emerged -- buses, 
trolleybuses, vanpools, jitneys, heavy and light rail, cable cars, 
monorails, tramways and automated guideway transit.  Rarely did these 
transports ever attract private investment -- that was reserved for The 
Car on publicly funded and maintained highways.
    <p>In the year 2000 Americans took 9.4 billion trips on public 
transportation, an increase of 3.5% from 1999.  But in 1946 Americans 
recorded 23.4 billion trips which is still unsurpassed even though the 
population was only half of what it is today.  What happened to account 
for the decline of public transit, which is safer, more efficient, less 
polluting, and reduces highway congestion, while stimulating nearby 
economic development?
    <p>The major answer to this question is the long-standing opposition of 
The Highway Lobby -- the auto, oil, tire and cement industries.  You 
don't hear much these days about "The Highway Lobby" as such.  The 
reason is that it has done its destructive job which is to make America 
an occasion for ribbons of crowded highways carrying millions of motor 
vehicles as the only "practical and direct" way to get around on the ground.
    <p>At times the lobby has to resort to crime to achieve its assaults on 
public transit, while at other periods, it just used its money, muscle 
and propaganda with state and Washington lawmakers.  Twenty eight crimes 
were committed by General Motors and its oil and tire company 
co-conspirators in the Thirties and Forties leading to their convictions 
in federal district court in Chicago during the late Forties.  The U.S. 
Justice Department's charge, upheld in court, was that these large 
companies, inorder to eliminate their  major rivals -- the trolley 
industry -- bought up these firms, tore up the tracks in and around 28 
major cities in the U.S., including the biggest one in Los Angeles, and 
lobbied legislators to build more and more highways to sell more and 
more vehicles, gasoline and tires.  Earlier, GM tried to pressure banks 
to reduce credit to these trolley companies and when that did not 
succeed sufficiently, the conspiracy to buy out their competitors and 
shut them down was hatched.
    <p>This is more than corporate crime history.  Everyday, today, 
tomorrow and the next day, millions of Americans find themselves on 
clogged, bumper to bumper commutes because there is no convenient mass 
transit or no mass transit at all where they live and work.
    <p>Lots of people have little or no idea of all the flexible and 
super-modern modes of public transit that reach all the way toward 
something called "personal public transit" which would allow you and 
fellow passengers to call up a monorail car to take you to your 
destination in some future resurgence of public transit technology.
   <p> First, change must replace the dominant highway lobby imagery with 
sleek public transit imagery.  For example, have you ever seen a 
television advertisement for a new car stuck in congested traffic?  By 
contrast, have you ever seen an ad for public transit showing people 
zooming to work in a modern transit train, while they were snoozing, 
chatting or reading the newspaper, and racing ahead of a parallel 
highway clogged with trucks, vans and cars moving in slow motion?  Fifty 
years of this bias and it is not surprising how low are the public's 
expectations.
    <p>Second, the bias has translated into the reality of residential, 
shopping and other developments geared to the car and inimical to public 
transit in a vicious circle of reinforcement for the highway lobby's 
designs for America.
    <p>Still, there are the public transit optimists.  Every other month 
Ireceive and read a magazine called Transit California, published by the 
California Transit Association.
    <p>The current issue is full of news regarding innovative advances and 
expansions in public transit from Santa Monica to Santa Clarity Valley 
to Contra Costa County and all the stages before various kinds of public 
transportation delivered to residents.
      <p>The Association will be having its 37th annual fall conference in Ontario, 
        California (<a href="mailto:info@caltransit.org">info@caltransit.org</a>) 
        and would be pleased to hear from interested communities writing to the 
        CTA, 1414 K Street, Suite 320, Sacramento, CA 95814 </i></p>
