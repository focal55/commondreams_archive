<p>It's 10 p.m. -- do you know what your government is up to? It seems that Iraq is
not the only &quot;regime change&quot; that the Bush Administration is working
on. The US government has apparently decided that President Chavez of Venezuela
must go, one way or another.</p>
<p>
True, Saddam Hussein is a brutal tyrant who has invaded and threatened
neighboring countries -- whereas Hugo Chavez was democratically elected, has
shown no ill will toward any of his neighbors, and tolerates a steady barrage of
virulent, hate-filled propaganda against his presidency from the major
Venezuelan media.</p>
<p>
But these distinctions can be blurred, because both have offended the US
government, and both are sitting on a lot of oil. So most Americans can be
forgiven for having similar impressions of the two leaders, given what they hear
from the US media. A recent op-ed in the <i>Washington Post</i> referred to the
Chavez government as a &quot;dictatorship.&quot;</p>
<p>
This week the country's main business federation, supported by some union
leaders, called once again for a general strike against the Chavez government.
They are apparently following the same scenario that led to the military coup on
April 11.</p>
<p>
In our amnesiac political culture, half a year can be an eternity, more than
enough time for history to be rewritten and slates wiped clean. But it was
barely more than six months ago, on April 11, that opposition forces overthrew
the democratically elected government of Venezuela. They installed the head of
the business federation as president and dissolved the legislature and the
Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The Bush administration at first welcomed the coup, retreating the next day
after it became clear that other countries in the Americas were not going to
recognize the illegal government. And of course administration officials denied
having anything to do with the coup.</p>
<p>
There is a pile of evidence to the contrary, indicating that they had a lot to
do with it. There were numerous meetings between Bush administration officials
and coup leaders in the months preceding the coup. We also know that the
opposition received money from the United States government.</p>
<p>
But even more important is the political support and encouragement that
Washington provides. Those who are trying to overthrow the government of
Venezuela at this very moment know that the United States will do its best to
recognize and support any resulting dictatorship. They know this because neither
the White House nor the State Department has indicated that a coup would result
in any diplomatic or commercial sanctions against an illegal government.</p>
<p>It would be a simple matter for the Bush Administration to make such a
statement. But even in the recent mobilizations of October 21 and December 2,
with rumors of coup attempts flying everywhere, our top officials have
maintained a telling silence, and carefully avoided saying anything that would
discourage the violent opposition.</p>
<p>The US also supports the opposition's call for early elections. Although the
Venezuelan constitution provides for a recall election halfway through the
President's term, the opposition does not want to wait until August.</p>
<p>
There are two reasons for their impatience: first, the economy is in a deep
recession right now, and it could very well recover by August. Venezuela's
economy would get a tremendous boost from an increase in oil prices that would
likely result from a war with Iraq. Second, the recession is prolonged and
deepened because investors are essentially on strike against the government,
taking money out of the country and withholding investment in hope of getting a
new President. Like any strike, it cannot continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>
Of course it does not make any more sense for Chavez to hold early elections
than it would have for President Reagan to have done so in 1983, when -- due to
a recession and high unemployment -- his approval rating bottomed at 35 percent.</p>
<p>But the US press -- together with the Bush administration -- pretends that this
is a perfectly reasonable demand.</p>
<p>
A little noticed retraction published in the Chicago Tribune on April 20 summed
up the extreme prejudice of our major news organizations against the president
of Venezuela: &quot;An editorial on Sunday mistakenly said that Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez had praised Osama bin Laden. The Tribune regrets the
error.&quot;</p>
