<p>WASHINGTON - Why is Enron Corp. still eligible to receive U.S. taxpayer money? 
<P> Instead of wallowing in bankruptcy, Enron continues to do business internationally. 
And the scandal-ridden and discredited corporation continues to pursue public 
funding for its global operations. 
<P> Reports about Enron&#39;s collapse have led people to believe that the corporation 
is defunct. Not true. 
<P> Enron&#39;s decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection forced the 
company to forfeit its energy trading operations in the United States and to sell 
some of its assets. 
<P> But a large number of its overseas ventures remain intact. Even as it faces 
shareholder lawsuits and congressional inquiries, Enron plans to emerge from bankruptcy 
by carrying on with its global energy services. 
<P> Through numerous consortia and subsidiaries, Enron continues to be involved 
in energy markets in countries throughout the world. Its present assets in Latin 
America alone include stakes in gas and electricity companies in Brazil and Venezuela, 
pipelines in Colombia and Bolivia and power plants in Panama, Guatemala and Puerto 
Rico. In many of these countries, assurances have been given that the problems 
Enron has in the United States will not affect its local operations. 
<P> U.S. taxpayer money has helped build Enron&#39;s global empire. A new report 
by the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington shows that since 1992, Enron-related 
projects have received more than $4 billion in U.S. government financing. Other 
public sources such as the World Bank and the European Investment Bank contributed 
an additional $3 billion. 
<P> By any standard, $7 billion is a lot of money. But now Enron wants more. The 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), an agency operating with U.S. government 
money, is considering a $125 million loan for a Bolivian gas pipeline expansion 
that Enron is pursuing through a group called Transredes. Along with Shell Bolivia, 
the other key stakeholder in this consortium, Enron stands to profit in Bolivia 
by using public funds. 
<P> At the same time, the Bolivian government recently began investigating irregularities 
in the process by which Enron initially gained entry into the country&#39;s energy 
markets. Environmental and human rights organizations such as the Organization 
of Ethnic Communities of Santa Cruz (Bolivia) decry the fact that the proposed 
enlargement of the Transredes pipeline would cut through ever-larger sections 
of ecologically sensitive areas and the protected lands of Bolivia&#39;s indigenous 
peoples. 
<P> They point to a previous disaster in which the company&#39;s Sica Sica-Arica 
oil pipeline ruptured in January 2000, spewing thousands of barrels of refined 
crude into the Desaguadero River before officials got around to making repairs. 
<P> Why would the United States help bankroll such deals? 
<P> In the name of &quot;free trade,&quot; the IDB and the World Bank, government-funded 
organizations, have spent more than two decades promoting privatization of energy 
and power sectors. They have forced countries that want development assistance 
to implement harsh &quot;structural adjustment&quot; measures and deregulate industries. 
At the same time, multinational corporations reap tremendous profits as poor governments 
vie with one another for much-needed foreign investment. 
<P> As a result, public utilities have increasingly fallen into private hands, 
and corporations such as Enron conduct their business with little or no public 
accountability. Ordinary people suffer as companies limit supplies and raise prices, 
spreading misery among those who can&#39;t afford to pay more for once-public 
services like electricity, water and health care. This also produces social unrest. 
For example, Enron&#39;s imposition of price hikes has resulted in blackouts that 
eventually led to riots in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic, among other countries. 
<P> Members of Congress will have an opportunity to stop the flow of government 
money to Enron when the IDB and other public financiers come up for reauthorization. 
Before approving more money for the banks, legislators can insist on prohibiting 
future loans for Enron-related projects. This would halt potentially destructive 
deals like the Bolivian pipeline expansion. 
<P> But more is needed to stop abuses. The rules governing global trade and investment 
need to be altered to protect the public interest. Congress needs to reject the 
drive by international financial institutions such as the IDB and the World Bank 
to privatize utilities and promote deregulation - policies that invite corruption 
and fuel injustice.
