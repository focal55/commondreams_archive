<p> The threat of military action against Iraq raises profound moral questions, 
for people of any religious conviction or none. The government's failure to set 
out a convincing case for military action has created a vacuum in which public 
opinion, left to its own devices, has already concluded that such action would 
be both illegal and immoral. Churches are rightly at the forefront of an emerging 
coalition, comprising key elements of civil society such as trade unions, NGOs 
and parliamentarians, which is urging caution and restraint. Significantly, a 
number of eminent and highly experienced military leaders have also expressed 
their deep reservations about the wisdom, as well as the morality, of attacking 
Iraq. 
<P>Unless the government takes steps to present a coherent case for military action, 
it will find it increasingly hard to rally public opinion in the UK, let alone 
in those countries in the Middle East whose support would be vital to the success 
of any such operation. The failure to present such a case would appear to substantiate 
King Abdullah's comments that the prime minister has similar concerns about how 
this could all unravel. So what, then, are these concerns and how should the government 
address them? 
<P>Earlier this year the government promised to publish a dossier of evidence 
incriminating Iraq. No such dossier has been released and no publication date 
has been given. Instead the government has drawn attention to the chemical and 
biological material unaccounted for by UNSCOM inspectors in 1998. Why is such 
prominence being given to information which is now four years old? 
<P>Until more up-to-date information is published, it will be difficult to fathom 
both the speed and depth by which Iraq has restructured its weapons of mass destruction 
program. This would allow more accurate conclusions to be drawn as to the threat 
posed by Iraq. But even if Saddam Hussein does have weapons of mass destruction 
he is not alone in that, so there needs to be strong and compelling evidence that 
he is prepared to or about to use them before we are at the point of making any 
kind of intervention. 
<P>The government's failure to publish such documentation will provide an obstacle 
to securing the widest possible support both in and outside parliament. This is 
especially important for those Muslim communities here in the UK, who would perceive 
a UK attack on Iraq as evidence of an in-built hostility to the Islamic world. 
There can be no question that British involvement in military action against Iraq 
would multiply the problems faced by Muslim communities here, and could severely 
destabilize inter-faith relations. For all the official insistence that the war 
on terrorism, and in particular the war in Afghanistan, is not an attack on Islam, 
considerable numbers of Muslims still see it precisely as that. 
<P>Without the incriminating dossier, the public will find it hard to accept the 
argument that the government's preferred policy of containment hasn't worked. 
In the past the government has consistently argued that sanctions have kept a 
brutal dictator contained for 10 years and have denied him access to equipment 
necessary to rebuild his weapons arsenal. To now argue that the policy of containment 
has not worked is an admission that the last 11 years of sanctions amount to an 
impressive policy failure. The government needs to explain this u-turn, especially 
since any military action is fraught with uncertainty and when any post-conflict 
settlement remains clouded in ambiguity. 
<P>The perception exists that the government's thinking on Iraq has been unduly 
influenced by considerations across the Atlantic. Yet in reality the US and UK 
positions are contradictory rather than complementary. The UK has always insisted 
that its objective is to get the UN weapons inspectors back into Iraq, and if 
necessary to force Saddam Hussein to comply with relevant UN security council 
resolutions. Contrast this nuanced position with the stated US objective of regime 
change, an objective which is, by definition, ill-disposed to any conciliatory 
moves by Baghdad. While it remains important to show solidarity with the US post-September 
11, this solidarity should not be at the expense of sacrificing our own policy 
objectives in favor of saving the US the embarrassment of unilateral action. 
<P>While Saddam Hussein is a brutal and nasty dictator and one the world could 
well do without, talk of regime change places unnecessary obstacles in the path 
of finding a diplomatic solution to the current crisis. Would it really be such 
a waste of time to invite the Iraqi foreign minister, Naji Sabri, to visit London 
and Washington? Have we really passed the point of no return for the kind of diplomatic 
initiative that might possibly lead to a peaceful compromise? After all, what 
incentive exists for the Iraqi government to cooperate with the UN when the US 
has repeatedly stated that allowing weapons inspectors back into the country will 
be insufficient to stave off military action? Instead, the talk of regime change 
merely serves to weaken the existing consensus in favor of containment. 
<P>Any war of this kind needs proper justification, and it needs to be conducted 
within the framework of international law. However, competing US and UK policy 
objectives only serve to undermine public confidence as to the legality of any 
military action. The government has given assurances that any military action 
the UK undertakes will be carried out in accordance with international law. 
<P>In reality, it seems more than likely the government will justify an attack 
by arguing that Iraq is in contravention of the 1991 ceasefire resolution. While 
this might provide the basis for such force as is necessary to restore the ceasefire 
agreement, it would be not be sufficient to justify the US policy ambition of 
regime change. The government must guarantee that if it were to participate in 
any US-led military enterprise, explicit as well as implicit UN security council 
authorization would be sought. 
<P>The threat of a prolonged war in the Middle East, possibly entailing the use 
of chemical and biological warfare, with the risk of substantial civilian and 
military casualties, must be avoided at all costs. The collateral damage is likely 
to be huge. Some 90% of the victims would be civilians and half of those would 
be children. To justify that kind of slaughter the evidence for Saddam's capacity 
to deploy weapons of mass destruction against his neighbors, to say nothing of 
the UK and the US, would need to be compelling. Until the government shows greater 
clarity of thought and purpose as to why a military solution is necessary and 
feasible, it would be wiser to persist with the tried and tested policy of containment. 
<P>Talk of containment could imply a continuation of the existing sanctions policy, 
but that simply will not do. UN figures reveal that over half a million children 
have probably died as a direct result of the last decade of sanctions, many more 
than are likely to die in open warfare. Smart sanctions, the targeting of fissionable 
materials, toxic chemicals and malign biological agents, have never really been 
seriously tried by the international community. Surely their time is now.
