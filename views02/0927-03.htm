<p>One of the delights of being in London this past Fourth of July was the opportunity 
to read the commentary in the British press about the United States on the occasion 
of our national independence holiday. The comments, by the way, were not those 
of America-bashers (in spite of what is still considered our impertinence in revolting 
against His Majesty's government several centuries ago!) so they can hardly be 
dismissed as the ranting of our enemies. Instead, they were reflections of people 
who looked with admiration at 200-plus years of the American democratic experiment, 
with sympathy at our present travails and with genuine concern about our future.</p>
<p>One observer of the American scene was especially insightful. He describes, 
after a number of recent visits to the states, our nation as "split so deeply 
and irreconcilably over almost every key issue of politics, lifestyle and culture 
that it is sometimes better to think of (the United States) as two, distinct nations, 
rather than one."</p>
<p>One half of America -- the one "that is feared, distrusted and increasingly 
disliked in the rest of the world, and especially in Europe," this commentator 
writes, "is the conservative country that constitutes George W. Bush's political 
heartland in Texas and the South -- the America of self-righteous Christian fundamentalists, 
of military machismo, of gun shops, lethal injections, anti-abortion zealots and 
gas-guzzling pickup trucks spewing out greenhouse gases." It's the America of 
the pastor who delivered a fiery invocation (just before Bush spoke at a West 
Virginia Fourth of July celebration) in which he decried multiculturalism, along 
with the nation's being "forced to honor sexual deviance in the name of freedom 
of expression" and killing "our unborn children in the name of choice."</p>
<p>Bracketing this smug, self-satisfied, insular America is the other half of 
the nation -- on both coasts -- the one "that Europeans find fascinating and beguiling, 
albeit a bit frightening because of its shifting moral compass." It's the America 
of Hollywood, Manhattan and Silicon Valley -- the America of grandeur, glitz and 
glamour but also the America that is forced to look outward toward the rest of 
the world and recognize that, superpower though we may be, we cannot behave like 
a global bully without courting disaster for ourselves and the rest of the planet.</p>
<p>Our friends in Europe find it incredible, for example, that we cannot muster 
an apology for massacring 40 people -- including one entire family -- at a wedding 
party in Afghanistan. They find our reasons for wishing to withdraw U.S. soldiers 
from the police-keeping mission in Bosnia to be arrogant and deceitful. And they 
are very worried, as another commentator writes, that "the meltdown in U.S. corporate 
ethics is not just a blip on Wall Street's radar screen but one of the deepest 
threats to the orderly function of America's capital markets since the 1930s." 
Or as yet another observer, viewing the shambles of the U.S. economy, asked, "Will 
America drag Britain down?"</p>
<p>Friends are such because occasionally they have to tell us what we need to 
hear about ourselves, rather than what we might like to hear. </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court, however, has installed a government in Washington that 
has announced to the rest of the world our national intent -- since we consider 
ourselves the only nation of might left in the international arena -- to do whatever 
we please to advance our national interests and to compel those who might have 
other ideas to accept our way of thinking.</p>
<p>The signs are abundant everywhere that this national arrogance simply will 
not wash with nations that have been our closest and strongest allies over much 
of the past century. We are being warned almost daily that the course on which 
the White House seems fanatically set will bring immeasurable chaos to the Middle 
East, more damage to our already shattered economy and put us and the nation at 
the mercy of terrorists to an even greater degree than we already are.</p>
<p>Such prospects are as chilling as they are unnecessary. They hang over us because 
we are saddled -- thanks to the Supreme Court -- with a government that does not 
seem to grasp the fact that imperialism is as loathsome an idea in the 21st century 
as it was in the 19th and 20th, and especially so when it is brandished by the 
only alleged superpower left on the planet. </p>
<p>The ancient admonition that "pride goes before a fall" can be as true of nations 
as it is of individuals. We have to hope it does not become the epitaph for a 
once proud, free and responsible people. (More on this next month.)</p>
