<p>Progressives rightly question the president’s claim that Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden are in cahoots to kill Americans.  The reason for this is clear: Saddam is a secular Arab leader and bin Laden’s main goal is to replace such leaders with Islamic fundamentalist regimes similar to the Taliban.  

 

<p>So most on the Left have tried hard to debunk this scenario arguing that the ensuing war Bush is about to wage is unneeded because his premise is untenable.  This is an important job that Progressives must continue.  

 

<p>But let’s assume for a moment that the president is right.  After all, such a notion is far from unthinkable.  Bin Laden may indeed see the US as the most immediate obstacle to his goals in the Arab world, and this could indeed lead a man who has made the leap of logic to target all Americans for the wrong-headed foreign policy of their elite-dominated government into thinking Saddam is a necessary (if temporary) ally.  Is it so unthinkable that Osama might declare a détente with Saddam in order to further his campaign against America?  Didn’t the Reagan administration do the same thing to help us get into this mess in the first place?  Let us concede to the president, that no matter how unlikely, the matter is far from impossible.  Indeed, Osama may have just as flawed logic as Bush’s own father, but I digress…

 

<p>The real question is does it matter?  If the Left is incorrect about the Saddam-Osama connection would war still be wrong?  

 

<p>The risk is as the president says, that al Qaeda might be able to use the resources of the state of Iraq to deploy even more death and destruction on the US.  Doesn’t this mean that the United States would have no choice but to attack Saddam and take out the threat as fast as possible?  Isn’t the failure to do so not only wrong but irresponsible?

 

<p>Progressives should not be afraid to answer these questions.  

 

<p>After all, this is the debate that the political establishment is having.  As much as we would like them to be debating on terms that seem more reasonable, the Senate, the House, the UN, the President are all debating this issue with little reflection on the skepticism progressives have tried to throw on the Osama-Saddam connection.  What has been missing by and large are progressive voices in this debate.  It is too easy to dismiss progressives with the charge that we refuse to address “real issues.”

 

<p>So lets get into it.  War is still the worst possible option of those available to world leaders even if the connection between the two is real.  

 

<p>First, we know that the immediate goal of disarming Iraq would be better served by the UN arms inspectors who are now being given unfettered access to Iraqi sites than it would by a massive bombing campaign.  This was the case even under the obstructed inspections of the 90s compared to the tons of destruction laid down upon the Iraqi nation in the Gulf War.  Nothing will disarm Iraq as effectively as systematic, comprehensive inspections aimed at doing so.

 

<p>Second, War is, at best, a short term solution that will create even greater problems in the long term.  A war in the Middle East will destabilize the region and create even more resentment towards the United States, making it more likely that future young men and women in the region will sign up for terrorist campaigns against the US and the West.  This means war is worse than ineffective, it is counter-productive.

 

<p>Third, the cost in human life is too high even were the plan to work, let alone an ineffective policy like the Presidents.  In the Gulf War tens of thousands of Iraqis were killed, most of them civilians.  In this war even more would be killed as the war to replace Saddam would have to be waged inside the most populated areas of the country and the death toll on American troops would markedly increase over the few suffered in the first Gulf War.  

 

<p>Fourth, the occupation of Iraq would be long and costly and create a whole new region for terrorists to target Americans in.  Imagine what sitting ducks our service people would be in downtown Baghdad.  The whole thing is a logistical nightmare.

 

<p>Fifth, even Bush’s own CIA has admitted that the only way Saddam is likely to use weapons of mass destruction (a move that would guarantee his own massive destruction from the face of this Earth) is if his very life and rule are openly threatened to the point that he feels he has nothing left to lose.  So, I guess if the president is all hell-bent on getting a war in Iraq he SHOULD keep the saber-rattling up!  

 

<p>War might be good for American oil companies, but it is not good for American people.  

 

<p>Instead, the UN should be allowed to continue to be at the forefront of this effort and its weapons inspectors granted unfettered access as has happened so far, with the complementary threat of military enforcement of such access should the Iraqis falter on their end of the deal.  

 

<p>But we should also offer the carrot of an end to the most egregious parts of the sanctions that have killed so many innocent Iraqi civilians and done nothing to weaken Saddam, with an eye towards fully lifting them in the near future.  America would find its war on terror more effective if it was waged through medicines, school books, food and sanitary drinking water in nations like Iraq than through bombs and missiles.  

 

<p>Our message should remain: Mr. President if you tear down the conditions that create terrorism in the first place you will tear down terrorism itself.  That is the only way we can win a “war” on terrorism in Iraq, Afghanistan or anywhere—whether or not Saddam and Osama have joined forces.

 

<p>Progressives should not be afraid to address the political establishment on its own terms.  True, effective progressive leadership demands, in fact, that we do so.  And why not, when the solutions the establishment offers are so ineffective and dangerous to so many people?  Indeed the welfare of the globe may depend on our doing so.
