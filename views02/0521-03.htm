<p>There was, until last fall, no greater bath in democracy than wading into the halls of the Capitol and drifting along with gawking tourists, waddling lobbyists, harried staffers and, every so often, a genuine senator or two. Whenever I had occasion to enter the building, I never asked directions; instead, I savored the chance to blunder into some previously unexplored magnificence.</p>
    <p> It was our building; even the most directionally impaired tourist could claim proud ownership of the halls.</p>
    <p> Now -- even as so many other buildings slowly return to some former definition of normalcy -- it is the terrorists' building. The Capitol is technically open again, but, thanks to the Sept. 11 attacks and the anthrax crisis, it is quite closed, and apparently permanently. It is a shame, a loss, a terrible signal.</p>
    <p> This is high season for Washington tourism, and the crowds did come back to gaze at the cherry blossoms and the hotels are hiring once more, but the Capitol remains largely deserted. You can't wander in anymore. To enter, visitors must be on a guided tour, and only the official Capitol Tour Guide Service is operating. All those wonderful private guides who led citizens around behind raised umbrellas are out.</p>
    <p> All of this is in the name of security, as if the stepped-up screening measures we now see at airports and other federal buildings aren't good enough for the Capitol.</p>
    <p> In years past, up to 18,000 people a day visited the Capitol; these days, it's fewer than 2,000, and the official tours -- after which anyone could roam the building, gaze up at the Rotunda, linger in Statuary Hall, hang out in the Senate or House galleries, stumble into a committee meeting -- are now restricted to a quick zip through the Crypt, Statuary Hall and the Rotunda and back outside. Not even the ceremonial old Senate or Supreme Court chambers make the new hurry-up-and-leave tour.</p>
    <p> And forget about heading off on your own.</p>
    <p> "They'll never allow that again, because they realize they'd never be able to get people out fast enough if they had to," says Ron Sarasin, a former congressman from Connecticut who now serves as president of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society. "Those days are gone, which is a real shame, because it is the people's house. The hustle and bustle is gone. It feels sad."</p>
    <p> In 1983, after a bomb exploded just outside then-Minority Leader Robert Byrd's office in the Senate, the building reopened immediately. "The restriction of citizens' access to their elected representatives is intolerable in a democracy," Byrd said then. Of course, the Capitol Police properly added metal detectors, X-ray machines and hand searches at the entrances.</p>
    <p> The underground Capitol Visitor Center being constructed on the east side of the building is designed to allow 1,500 tourists an hour to enter the Capitol. But now it's not clear whether that volume of visitors will ever be permitted.</p>
    <p> The historical society, which has had to lay off workers who used to staff its gift kiosk inside the Capitol, has resorted to leading tours of the exterior. They are fascinating, but it's not remotely the same as getting inside to soak in how democracy works.</p>
    <p> I watched as 54 high school students from every state, the District, Europe and Latin America -- winners of a Veterans of Foreign Wars essay contest -- toured the perimeter. They had to walk past huge, unsightly sewer pipes that ring the building because the government hasn't yet installed secure bollards to protect the Capitol without making it look like a defeated war victim.</p>
    <p> "It's a shame that these students -- some of the most dedicated and patriotic Americans you'll come across -- can't get into their own Capitol," said Gordon Thorson, national director of the student program.</p>
    <p> Ken Yancey, one of the historical society's 135 volunteer guides, led a tour, and though he told compelling tales, the students wanted to go inside. They need to go inside.</p>
    <p> "No matter where you are in the world," Yancey told them, "people recognize this dome as a symbol of democracy."</p>
    <p> It's time we acted as if we believe in that. Screen the heck out of visitors, but open the building. Show the world what we really stand for.</p>
