<p>Until 1998 Sherri Bufkin happily worked as a manager for Smithfield Foods in 
Tar Heel, N.C. But in 1997, when workers in the giant meatpacking plant there 
began to organize a union, her superiors - she has testified - forced her to join 
their campaign to "do whatever was necessary to keep &#91;the union&#93; out."
<p> Bufkin also said she had to tell workers that they would suffer violence and 
lose jobs if they formed a union, and that she had to discriminate in assignments 
against pro-union workers. Worse yet, her bosses insisted that she fire some workers 
simply because they openly supported a union. Then they demanded that she sign 
false affidavits about management's tactics - many of which clearly violated laws 
protecting workers' right to organize.
<p> Shortly after she refused to lie for the company at a National Labor Relations 
Board hearing, Smithfield fired her, plunging her into prolonged unemployment 
and bankruptcy. "I don't regret standing up for the truth," she told a June 20 
Senate committee hearing on obstacles to forming unions, "because now I can look 
my daughter square in the eye."
<p> Senators also heard from workers - like nurse Nancy Schweikhard, ship captain 
Eric J. Vizier and hotel worker Mario Vidales - who told of being the direct victims 
of management harassment, threats to close their workplaces, a beating by anti-union 
thugs, and arrests or surveillance by police cooperating with anti-union employers.
<p> But few other Americans heard these stories, because the hearing went nearly 
unreported. That's a shame. At a time when the country is preoccupied with terrorism 
from abroad and Enron-style corporate abuses at home, it is important to remember 
that millions of American workers who would like to have a voice on the job have 
been denied their internationally recognized human rights by corporations who 
"in too many cases act like real domestic terrorists," in the words of AFL-CIO 
organizer Stewart Acuff.
<p> According to Senate testimony from Kenneth Roth, whose Human Rights Watch 
group two years ago documented "widespread labor rights violations" in the United 
States, in the 1950s a few hundred workers a year were fired - illegally - for 
trying to organize unions. But in 1998 - despite a much lower level of union organizing 
activity - 24,000 workers lost their jobs just because they were trying to exercise 
their internationally guaranteed freedom to associate with other workers on the 
job.
<p> Now, less than 14 percent of the U.S. workforce belong to unions, but surveys 
suggest that 44 percent wish they did. Employer threats, firings and systematic 
intimidation stifle many bids to unionize. In 92 percent of all organizing efforts, 
employers force workers to attend anti-union meetings. In half of all campaigns 
- and more than 70 percent of organizing at manufacturing businesses - employers 
threaten to close the business and, often, to move overseas, if workers unionize.
<p> This month, workers at Quadrtech, a small manufacturing plant in Southern 
California, reached a financial settlement with management that also marked the 
end of their attempt to unionize. Nearly two years ago, a federal court issued 
an injunction to stop the owner from moving to Mexico in order to avoid unionization. 
But the company reportedly kept trying to move.
<p> Even when workers overcome employer obstacles and vote - or otherwise show 
support - for a union, managers often refuse to negotiate a contract. For example, 
much-abused farm workers have voted in 428 elections for the United Farm Workers 
since 1975, but growers have only signed 185 contracts (although a bill awaiting 
California Gov. Gray Davis's signature would require binding arbitration in deadlocked 
negotiations). Employers suffer minuscule penalties that don't deter lawbreaking.
<p> Early this month, the AFL-CIO launched a new campaign to protect worker rights 
at work, especially the right to join unions without interference from employers. 
A stronger worker voice would increase economic security and equality, restrain 
abuse of corporate power, and enhance democracy.
<p> As Kenneth Roth told the senators, "if the rights of workers are not respected 
and protected, then the strength of American democracy and freedom is diminished."
<p> Democracy and freedom need protection from physical threats of terrorists 
- and from overzealous antiterrorists, like the Bush administration, which wants 
to deny workers in a new Department of Homeland Security both civil service protections 
and the right to organize into unions.
<p> But democracy and freedom also must be safeguarded against the corporate economic 
terrorism that hurts us all, not just working people directly denied their rights 
to join together in a union.</P>
