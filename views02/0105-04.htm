Maybe it was the diner waitress who called me "sweetie" as she poured that 
second cup. As a US citizen living abroad, there are certain comforting 
familiarities I miss.

<p>But this year, being home for the holidays was different. The first step off 
the airplane, I was confronted with CNN's "War on Terror" blasting from a 
massive TV screen, right next to a telecom's patriotic "United We Stand" 
poster.  "Freedom" beer mugs and "America 1st" shot glasses on sale at the 
airport gift shop. Little flags everywhere.

<p>This year was different alright. What do you say to friends who have been 
laid off? Is it possible to have faith in a system that provides billions in 
corporate welfare for companies like Enron and IBM, even as they turn 
thousands of workers out on the streets? How do you get that patriotic 
feeling when your president was appointed in a rigged election, and the new 
mayor of embattled New York, media mogul Michael Bloomberg, basically bought 
the office at $92.60 per vote? When your government carpet bombs a far-off 
country yet misses the point entirely?

<p>It was summed up best by Bob, a man sitting next to me on the flight. He was 
certain that bin Laden had turned to crime because "they lose all sense of 
reality in those caves." Bob reckoned the best way to fight terrorism and 
achieve world peace was to bomb the hell out of every cave in Afghanistan.

<p>And what about our own caves? Plato's allegory (of prisoners trapped in 
caves and trained to see shadows on the wall as reality) oddly fit my 
feelings upon coming home. When the Pentagon can suppress satellite images 
of the war, CNN staffers can be warned not to discuss Afghan war casualties, 
and supposedly unbiased news broadcasters, such as CBS's Dan Rather, say 
things like "Wherever (Bush) wants me to line up, just tell me where," it 
seems clear that we are being fed shadows and not the truth.

<p>Which goes a long way in explaining why media experts from around the world 
recently converged in Bonn, Germany to discuss setting up a new global news 
network. Sponsored by Germany's Friedrich Ebert Foundation (FES), the 
seminar explored a way to give CNN and the rest a run for their corporate 
money. According to the seminar's concluding paper,  "Under the guise of 
combating terrorism, autocratic regimes are strangling whatever little 
exists of those freedoms in order to seal themselves off from scrutiny by 
independent media." There was a call for multiculturalism and a more 
balanced approach to news reporting with this warning: "For journalists in 
the South, journalism in the North is increasingly losing its credibility 
and thus its role as a standard for their own practice."

<p>No doubt (Vice President Dick Cheney's wife) Lynne Cheney, Senator Joe 
Lieberman and other leaders of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni 
(ACTA) would disagree. Their new "Defending Civilization" initiative would 
have studies in "Western civilization as well as American history" replace 
multiculturalism courses in US universities. While the ACTA sees itself as 
dedicated to "academic freedom, quality and accountability," it expresses 
outrage that "expressions of moral relativism are a staple of academic life 
in this country" and that some professors may even invoke "tolerance and 
diversity as antidotes to evil."

<p>So where does all of this leave us? Straight back to the caves it seems. 
Plato's allegory predicted that those who had escaped and come to learn the 
difference between shadows and reality would be ridiculed and attacked by 
other prisoners if they reentered the cave to free them. Such was the fate 
of Plato's teacher Socrates, who chose death rather than giving in to a 
corrupt political system. Such is also the fate of normal Americans with the 
guts to say that this war and its accompanying rollback of civil liberties 
is just plain wrong.

<p>Somewhere between the caves, beer mugs and flags lies my country. Its 
reality is in the painful aftermath of a horrific attack on its soil. But 
its echoes are in the Pentagon Papers showing up on page one and citizen 
protests stopping a senseless war. Its promise is in throwing off shackles 
of lies and repression, and in naming shadows for what they are.
