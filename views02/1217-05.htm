<p>As a low, dishonest year nears its end, the online magazine Slate is running 
a daily Saddameter, complete with witty commentary, assessing the chances of a 
war with Iraq. In the past week it has shot up from just over 50% to 67%. Yet 
I don't know anyone in Washington who hasn't felt for some time that the odds 
were more like 80-90%. 
<P>The energy behind this enterprise has such power that it has long been difficult 
to imagine the circumstances in which it wouldn't happen. Behind the Bushies' 
enthusiasm for war, the political timetable is creating the same sense of inevitability 
as the railway timetable in 1914. If the US lost the winter window of climatic 
opportunity and waited another year, it would allow a new post-Gore Democratic 
frontrunner (irrelevant whether it's a hawk like Lieberman or a dove like Kerry) 
to paint Bush as indecisive. Round here, that is the unthinkable. 
<P>The government's relish for war suffuses the whole city, yet I have caught 
no sign of it anywhere outside Washington. Other observers, like Tim Garton Ash, 
report the same phenomenon. Living here, one begins to feel, after a while, the 
way hostages do: the Stockholm syndrome sets in. Deep down, one may know the cause 
is ludicrous, but it so dominates the whole of one's life that after a while the 
victim gets sucked in and starts thinking these people have a point (I speak as 
someone who caught himself using the word "gotten" in conversation the other day, 
which suggests total brainwashing). 
<P>Somehow, you have to remember where this started. Fifteen months ago, the US 
was brutally attacked by terrorists. With international support, it went after 
the perpetrators, initially with brilliant success that confounded anyone who 
believed Afghanistan would break even the US army. With the job half done, somewhere 
around the caves of Tora Bora, it got - what? - bored or distracted or simply 
confused. Should you ever be charged by a rhino, which has overwhelming force 
but a tiny brain, your life may be spared in similar circumstances: halfway through, 
it forgets what it was angry about. 
<P>The US chose instead to concentrate on an elective confrontation. It had no 
credible evidence of a prior connection between its attackers and the Iraqis - 
though its own policies may have been created such a connection, on the ancient 
Arab principle that my enemy's enemy is my friend. It had no credible evidence 
of an imminent threat from the Iraqis (threat = capability + intent). It could 
make no intellectual case that such a confrontation would lessen the danger from 
terrorism. Indeed, most analysts were and are convinced it can only increase it. 
<P> In pursuit of its policy, the US has invested vast quantities of its political 
capital, military capability and money even before actually doing anything to 
dislodge Saddam Hussein. The unintended consequences of that decision are all 
around us. Indeed, at least three were reported in yesterday's New York Times 
alone. 
<P>1. The Pentagon "is considering issuing a secret directive to the American 
military to conduct covert operations aimed at influencing public opinion and 
policy makers in friendly and neutral countries." In other words, the US is losing 
the argument. 
<P>2. Behzad Nabavi, the deputy speaker of the Iranian parliament and a prominent 
reformer, said pressure from Washington, especially aimed at gaining support for 
invading Iraq, "has only hurt the cause of Iran's moderates". 
<P>3. There was also further evidence of the way the focus on Iraq has inhibited 
an effective response to the revelations surrounding the nuclear ambitions of 
both Iran and North Korea. White House officials, when promised anonymity, depart 
from the published script, the Times reported, and say "there is much more concern 
that terrorist groups could obtain nuclear technology or know-how from Iran than 
from Iraq". 
<P>That's just one paper on one day. The signs that al-Qaida and its allies across 
the world - in places as obvious as the Middle East, as remote as Australia and 
eastern Paraguay - are regrouping, and preparing for new attacks is overwhelming. 
So are the indications that they are assisted by the way the US diverted so many 
resources into an entirely different conflict and tossed away global goodwill 
in the process. 
<P>There is no obvious explanation for the US allowing its own agenda to be hijacked 
in this fashion by a notion that a year ago had minimal support from anyone without 
a government job or a column in the Washington Post. Oil is one factor, for sure, 
though I do not accept the theory that is at the heart of some American masterplan. 
Rather, it is true that an administration run by oilmen undoubtedly has different 
perceptions from any other. I certainly don't believe that's the whole story. 
<P>In general, people have two perceptions of the Bushies: that they are strong, 
patriotic and fearless defenders of freedom, or that they are dangerous warmongers. 
There is a third possibility, which has been under-considered: that they are, 
quite simply, blunderers.</p>
