<p>A year ago at the Siege of Genoa, a quarter of a million protesters surrounded 
the annual meeting of G8 political leaders and many fought running battles with 
the Italian police. It was the peak of the anti-globalization movement. Anti-globalization 
seemed unstoppable, as the defining agenda of the new century and 'the most sweeping 
rebellion since the Sixties'. Where is it now? What changed after 11 September? 
Now the movement has all but vanished from the bulletins and the headlines, has 
it been dumped in the dustbin of history along with other failed slogans such 
as Solidarity with the Striking Miners or All Power to the Soviets? Was its brief 
stretch in the spotlight - two years from surfacing in Seattle to its apotheosis 
at Genoa - simply a passing fad, and its youthful, mainly middle-class army of 
protesters yesterday's children? 
<P>Or is it all the fault of the media? Have we turned our backs on a still-vibrant 
radical movement and a key issue in the modern world - distracted by the World 
Trade Center attacks and wars on terror? Globalization is still with us, after 
all. From the state of Africa to world food supplies, trade disputes to asylum-seekers, 
privatization to the environment, Globalization roars ahead. But what's happened 
to the anti-globalizers? 
<P>In his tiny Oxford terraced house, writer-activist George Monbiot, a vigorous, 
eager man, speaks with the fluency of the university lecturer he used to be. He 
was surprisingly cheerful about the state of the movement: 'To the extent we had 
an effective dynamic before 11 September, we've had one since. That hasn't changed. 
What's changed is that we're less visible in the media and we've been caused to 
think about both our tactics and strategy. The big set-piece protests were very 
effective at drawing attention to the issues but they're not a good way to precipitate 
change.' 
<P>'Look,' Monbiot went on. 'It's like the Peasants' Revolt. The peasants revolt, 
they meet the king, the king promises them the earth and they all go home. Whereupon 
their leaders are hanged and nothing happens. If we follow that model, we're doomed, 
so you could say that 11 September, by putting a roadblock in the way of that 
model, did us a favor.'
<P>There was a moment in our conversation when both of us fumbled for words and 
fell into a brief, awkward silence. The same moment recurred with everyone I interviewed 
and it was over what name to use in talking about anti-globalizers Anti-globalization 
Movement' turns out to be a name invented by journalists that has stuck. All the 
activists reject it, not least because it offers ammunition to opponents ('How 
can you be against Globalization? Are you against air travel? The internet? Cheap 
international phone calls?'). But no one can agree on a replacement. Suggestions 
include the 'Civil Society Movement', the 'Global Justice Movement', the 'Anti-Capitalist 
Movement', the 'Citizens Movement for World Democracy' or simply 'the Alternative 
Movement'. 
<P>Mirroring the confusion over the name is the confusion many feel about the 
nature of the protest itself. What is the central core linking its assortment 
of fashionable causes? Amsterdam-based activist Susan George calls the Global 
Justice Movement (I'm going to take the plunge and choose a better name than anti-globalization) 
'a movement of popular education directed towards action'. Education about what? 
Well, Globalization for a start. Globalization in its classic sense means the 
historical process by which the world moves ever closer together. That process 
began in the sixteenth century with the voyages of discovery and has gone on accelerating 
ever since. Some scholars argue that in its most recent phase, say since the early 
Seventies, Globalization has moved so fast and on such a scale that its quantitative 
leap has produced a qualitatively different world, one world at last, be it a 
global village or a global empire. Whether or not you agree with their analysis, 
it is meaningless to oppose Globalization in this sense, as it would be meaningless 
to oppose such great historical trends as the development of the nation state 
or the rise of science. 
<P>The activists do not reject the underlying process: they attack the current 
form that process takes. As the American Center for Economic and Policy Research 
puts it, these forms 'are not an inevitable outcome of technological change in 
communications, transportation and other industries'; but due to 'deliberate decisions 
by policymakers', which have 'shaped the process of Globalization in a certain 
way'. 
<P>The way is economic Globalization led by multinational corporations chanting 
their mantra of free trade, freedom of investment and free movement of capital. 
All those 'frees' should make you suspicious, say the protesters. Someone has 
to pay. While the corporations present themselves as heralds of a gleaming global 
future for all, with a Nike sweatshirt on every back, a Starbucks mocha frappuccino 
in every hand and a Nissan Sentra in every garage, to the movement they are a 
modern Mongol horde, Genghis Khans in Armani suits, ravaging the world in general, 
and the Third World in particular, in pursuit of power and profit. 
<P>'I think the great majority of people who have joined this movement started 
off with a vague sense that something was wrong and not necessarily being able 
to put their finger on what it was,' Monbiot said. 'Having a sense that power 
was being removed from their hands, then gradually becoming more informed, often 
in very specific areas because what you find in our community of activism is some 
people who are very concerned about farming, those who are very interested in 
the environment, or labor standards, or privatization of public services, or Third 
World debt. These interests tie together and the place they all meet is this issue 
of corporate power.' 
<P>To Susan George, the aim of contemporary capitalism is 'all power to big business', 
a 'pure nineteenth-century agenda, an attempt to turn the clock back a hundred 
years'. 'When I'm asked why people join our group,' she told a recent forum at 
the London School of Economics, 'I say it's because of a feeling that, "the bastards 
have gone too far".' 
<P>The statistics involved in Globalization are staggering. World trade rose 50 
per cent over the past six years and is now worth over $17 billion a day. The 
volume of air freight flown out of the UK doubled over the past 10 years and is 
forecast to double again by 2010. 
<P>One third of world trade is goods moved between different parts of the same 
corporations. Of the 100 largest economic entities in the world 51 are corporations. 
<P>In 1979, 90 per cent of international transactions were trade and 10 per cent 
were in capital flow: today the position is the opposite, with $1.5 trillion traded 
every day in the foreign exchange markets. 
<P>Meanwhile, non-oil primary commodity prices (the basic foods and raw materials 
produced by the Third World) fell 50 per cent in real terms over the past 20 years. 
<P>The total external debt of developing countries rose from $90bn in 1970 to 
almost $2,000bn in 1998; 2.8bn of the world's 6bn people live on less than $2 
a day; 1.2 bn on less than $1 a day. 
<P>Between 30-35,000 children under five die every day of preventable diseases. 
The gap between the richest 20 per cent and the poorest 20 per cent of the world's 
population has doubled over the past 40 years, with the assets of the world's 
top three billionaires exceeding the GNP of all the 48 least developed countries 
(population: 600 million). 
<P>The interaction of corporate Globalization with the majority of the world's 
people (those in the Third World) is mediated by three international institutions: 
the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization. 
The IMF and the World Bank are dominated by the US; the WTO by the US and the 
rest of the G8 countries, mainly Europe plus Japan. In the Eighties, these organizations 
began to pursue the three 'freedoms' - of trade, investment and capital flow, 
though not the fourth freedom that goes with them, namely the free movement of 
labor, or migration. This program is known as the 'Washington consensus' or neo-liberalism 
in its international form. As a result, say the critics, when the disadvantages 
of Globalization started to become visible in the Nineties, the first place they 
appeared was in the poor countries in the Third World, forced to follow the policies 
of the IMF, the Bank and the WTO. 
<P>In 1994, the WTO massively expanded its influence with the Uruguay round of 
trade negotiations, transforming the Organization., in Naomi Klein's phrase, 'from 
an international chamber of commerce into a quasi-world government'. In 1999, 
Trade Ministers met in Seattle intending to launch a new negotiating round. Instead, 
they were met by the mass protest that launched the Global Justice Movement on 
the world stage. The coalition includes a strong element from the Third World 
or 'the South' as it is now known (since the Second World consisting of middle-income 
countries, mainly the old Socialist bloc, has all but disappeared, slid back down 
the poverty ladder). The plight of the South is the movement's moral heart and 
the focus of much of its campaigning energy. 
<P>Tony Juniper is director-designate of Friends of the Earth UK. Before the Global 
Justice Movement came into being, the environmentalists were the best-known and 
most broadly popular among its elements. Juniper explains the evolution in their 
thinking. 'For the past 10 years we've been locating ourselves more in the bigger 
economic debate and less in the "save the whales" type debate. Talking about rainforests 
led us into talking about Third World debt. Talking about climate change led us 
to talk about transnational corporations. The more you talk about these things, 
the more you realize the subject isn't the environment any more, it's the economy 
and the pressures on countries to do things that undercut any efforts they make 
to deal with environmental issues. By the time we got to Seattle, we were all 
campaigning on the same basic trend that was undermining everybody's efforts to 
achieve any progressive goals. That trend is the free market and privileges for 
big corporations and rich people at the expense of everything else.' 
<P>The presence of the big environmental groups and other mainstream NGOs (non-governmental 
organizations), such as Oxfam or Christian Aid, in the ranks of the activists 
is what makes it impossible for Western governments and business leaders to dismiss 
the movement as a bunch of disaffected youth and window-smashing anarchists. Witness 
Tony Blair's put-down of the anti-globalizers as a 'traveling circus' of anarchists 
and a recent EU attempt to equate the protesters with terrorists. To the Western 
elite, Globalization is good for you. To the anti-globalizers, it's the villain 
of the piece, a sort of collective Dr No. Is there any way to judge between these 
two positions? One way is to look at a slightly different question - is global 
inequality increasing? Or has Globalization's advance over the past 20 years decreased 
global inequality as its supporters suggest? 
<P>Small armies of economists study these questions. In pursuit of the answers, 
I attended a lecture by Professor Robert Wade at the London School of Economics. 
He began with the usual depressing figures: 80 per cent of world income goes to 
the top 20 per cent of people while 60 per cent of the world's population have 
to make do with 6 per cent of the income. Then he moved on to 'the thunder and 
lightning of current debate': whether the situation has been getting better or 
worse over the past 20 years. His answer was twofold: we don't know for sure; 
but the balance of the evidence is, it's getting worse and inequality is increasing. 
<P>It turns out the statistics relied on by the pro-globalizers, led by the World 
Bank, are suspect. There are different methods for determining global poverty 
and inequality and the answers you get depend on the techniques you use. The World 
Bank, Wade implied, may have chosen the one that supports its own neo-liberal 
agenda. 'The Bank is a very political institution,' he said. 
<P>Wade dealt equally briskly with the other part of the problem, moving on from 
poverty and inequality to whether economic Globalization is the best way to address 
them. The issue here is when, and on what terms, poor countries should open their 
markets. The World Bank's current poster boys are India and China, supposed to 
prove that globalizing countries, i.e. those with liberal trade regimes, have 
grown richer while the non-globalizers have fallen behind. But 'the causal sequence 
in India and China was the opposite &#91;of the one the Bank claims&#93;,' Wade 
said. 'These countries started growing fast before they liberalized. And they 
still have highly protective trade regimes, just as Taiwan and South Korea did 
before them. Trade liberalization is not the motor of growth.' 
<P>Most activists would go further than Wade. They claim 'free trade' and Third 
World debt are scams. Advertised as being the outcome of natural and benign economic 
laws that will eventually lift everyone out of poverty, they're actually tools 
of a system devised by the North to keep the southern countries in their place, 
as honeypots from which the rich countries buy raw materials and assembly-line 
labor on the cheap and to which they can sell manufactured goods, subsidized agricultural 
products and high-interest loans and privatizing packages for huge profits. Trade 
agreements force the South to open its markets, dismantling tariffs and eliminating 
domestic subsidies. But the rich countries massively subsidize their own agriculture 
and maintain tariff barriers to things such as textiles. Any country threatening 
to resist gets a tug on its leash. The leash is Third World debt and the refusal 
by the North to 'forgive' it. Debt is the device to keep the poor in line. 
<P>One developing country after another has toppled under the impact of rampant 
speculation and/or the IMF's 'structural adjustment policies' (slash public spending, 
cut and privatize services, service your debt): Mexico in 1994-95; South-East 
Asia in 1997-98; Russia in 1998-99. Argentina, the recipient of no less than nine 
IMF 'stabilizations', is the latest, and Brazil teeters on the brink. As the gap 
between rich and poor widens, so the space between crises shortens. Far from being 
a permanent model of economic efficiency, guided by Adam Smith's invisible hand, 
the world economic order is seen by activists as a form of political blackmail. 
<P>Listening to Wade, I was listening to a moderate, mainstream voice, far from 
the wilder shores of anti-globalization The IMF itself has confessed that 'in 
recent decades nearly one-fifth of the world population has regressed - arguably 
one of the greatest economic failures of the twentieth century'. World Bank economist 
Branco Milanovic recently pondered 'how long such inequalities &#91;of income&#93; 
may persist in the face of ever closer contacts... ultimately the rich may have 
to live in gated enclaves while the poor roam the world outside those few enclaves'. 
<P>This theme was part of the liberal response to 11 September - the connection 
between poverty and terrorism and the need to address the two together. But there 
was also a conservative response, led by the US, whose Trade Representative Robert 
Zoellick spoke of 'wiping out the stain of Seattle' and of free trade as 'promoting 
the values that lie at the heart of this protracted struggle', meaning the war 
on terror. The conservative agenda was: more neo-liberalism, more corporate Globalization, 
more 'structural adjustment'. This was the approach that prevailed with the Financial 
Times commenting 'no one has done more recently to favor.' the cause of trade 
liberalization than Osama bin Laden'. The Global Justice Movement came under attack 
from both sides, condemned as (in the words of James Harding, a sympathetic FT 
reporter) 'the last gasp of the Old Left, a bunch of protectionists, a Wizard 
of Oz type movement with no substance, nothing behind the curtain'. 
<P>In fact, the Global Justice Movement has too many policies, often worked out 
by the various pressure groups and NGOs. What everyone I spoke to in the movement 
did agree on was that the era of big street protests was over. Until an estimated 
250,000-plus protesters turned up in Barcelona in March for the EU summit. As 
many as rallied at Genoa last year, only this time the (peaceful) protest was 
almost totally ignored by the media. Within the movement, last year's debate about 
demos - what should be done about the violence associated with them? - has moved 
on to a debate about what 'positive alternatives' to the status quo should be 
put forward. Many realize that a lot of individual policies don't make up for 
the lack of one overriding idea. 
<P>Naomi Klein, author of the bestseller No Logo , is a movement star (it's been 
said the movement does not have leaders; it has celebrities instead, most of them 
women). In a recent article on her website, she writes of how for more than a 
year before 11 September, 'the largely symbolic activism outside summits and against 
individual corporations &#91;had already been&#93; challenged within movement 
circles... a new mood of impatience was already taking hold, an insistence on 
putting forward social and economic alternatives that address the roots of injustice 
as well as its symptoms ... our task, never more pressing, is to point out that 
there are more than two worlds available, to expose all the invisible worlds between 
the economic fundamentalism of "McWorld" and the religious fundamentalism of "Jihad".' 
<P>If the dark side of Globalization first showed itself in the condition of the 
South, by the late Nineties there were splinters of discontent in the rich North. 
GM crops; private jails; political favors for campaign contributors; planning 
laws eviscerated by big developers; privatizations of public services; economic 
migrants qua asylum-seekers; multinational corporations opening and closing factories, 
creating and destroying thousands of jobs. The global protesters had chanted 'The 
World Is Not For Sale'. Now it was the turn of people in Europe and America to 
feel as if their home towns, and everyone in them, was For Sale. 
<P>While no one argues that economic Globalization is the direct cause of all 
these phenomena, Globalization provides a way to understand them, a structure 
that links them one to another and to the plight of the Third World, and traces 
their roots in overweening corporate power. Seen in this context, the sudden eruption 
of the Global Justice Movement in 1999, becomes explicable. After all, the same 
thing has happened before, in the Sixties (and also in the early Nineties). 
<P>But the Global Justice Movement differs from the Sixties in two crucial respects. 
One is that it is a genuinely global affair, involving the South as well as the 
North. The other is that it is 're-inventing the Sixties' the other way around. 
The Sixties began with the hippies, a social movement seeking an alternative lifestyle, 
then fell apart when it turned political after 1968 into Women's Lib, Gay Lib, 
and a thousand mutually hostile factions. The Global Justice Movement started 
as a political movement, with people from a great diversity of political backgrounds. 
'Some are anarchists, some are Greens, some Christian, some old-fashioned liberals 
and some, like myself, don't know what we are and are still trying to find out,' 
says Monbiot. The challenge they face is to stay united while elaborating their 
own alternative. 
<P>If the movement resembles the Sixties, is the war on terrorism their Vietnam? 
Some would say so. One result of 11 September has been for groups among the activists 
to form an anti-war movement. The leaders in this endeavor are the radicals. So 
far I have described the Global Justice Movement from its more moderate end, but 
it has a radical end too, as anyone who followed Seattle and Genoa well knows 
(though it is worth noting, as the Green Party's Chris Keen told me, 'the irony 
is that the only way we can get any media coverage is by being violent, which 
is sickening but true'). The movement takes its place in the broader history of 
the Left. Ever since the rise of conservative governments in the Seventies and 
Eighties, followed by the collapse of communism, the Left has been in disarray. 
Endless discussions went on about how, and on what basis, it could be revived. 
Suddenly, along came anti-globalization, performing the impossible trick of uniting 
everybody. So is 'Global Justice' the socialism that dare not speak its name? 
<P>Globalize Resistance, the British-based, formidably efficient organizers of 
conferences and demonstrations, was created by members of the Socialist Workers 
Party. In Europe, Susan George's ATTAC, which campaigns for the Tobin Tax, a small 
levy on international financial transactions, can sound like the Old Left or pragmatic 
policy wonks, depending on the day. Veteran rebels such as Tony Benn and Noam 
Chomsky have given their blessings to the protesters. 
<P>The central tension in the movement reproduces the traditional tension in left 
politics between reformists and revolutionaries - are we looking to reform and 
regulate capitalism or to overthrow and replace it? Nevertheless, supporters are 
right to claim the movement is something new. The absence of leaders or hierarchical 
Organization.; the emphasis on networks, modeled on the internet; the interest 
in participatory democracy rather than state socialism; even the willingness to 
experiment may not be new ideas per se but together, they make a genuinely new 
package. 
<P>Guy Taylor is a member of Globalize Resistance and therefore on the more radical 
wing of the movement. 'Many in the movement aren't consciously anti-capitalist,' 
he admits, 'but I take the view this movement is making demands on the system 
that the system can't deliver. Therefore they'll de facto become anti-capitalist 
in the end.' Taylor sees what he prefers to call the 'Anti-Capitalist Movement's 
future as allied with the trade unions, since 'if you plug our movement and the 
labor movement together, you've got political dynamite.' 
<P>My own informant among the real radicals requested anonymity, so we communicated 
by exchanging emails, in which he declined to answer questions but forwarded me 
selected texts that represented his position. The texts dismiss all attempts 'to 
give a "human face" to capitalism by regulating it at the global level... although 
&#91;such attempts&#93; present themselves as "pragmatic" or "result-oriented" 
they have not made any difference at all in the destructive nature of policies 
that are designed to satisfy the needs of global capital'. Instead, the texts 
recommend building autonomous and decentralized anti-capitalist networks' to create 
'spaces' that are not capitalist. Stripped of jargon, this is a recipe for turning 
the movement itself, with its rolling mobilizations and communal values, into 
the basis of a new society. Tony Blair's 'traveling circus' will come to town, 
put down roots and put up the Big Top on the bypass next to Tesco's and B&amp;Q. 
<P>If that seems an unlikely scenario, it's no more unlikely than what is actually 
happening on the other side - among the globalists, the capitalists, or more simply, 
the Americans. Following the Clinton formula of 'trade, not aid' abroad (it was 
the Clinton regime that first slashed US foreign aid budgets to the bone) and 
the Republican program of tax cuts and welfare reduction at home, America seems 
to have developed a system in which governments exist principally to promote and 
reward business. 
<P>People show their moral worth by working hard and getting rich and countries 
show it via their economic growth. Those who fail, do so because they are lazy 
or immoral. Rather than being a problem, economic inequality is the essential 
motor of the whole system. Welfare/aid, let alone redistribution of wealth, are 
wrong because they interfere with this ethical and quasi-natural order, rewarding 
defective individuals or, on the international scale, defective societies, as 
in sub-Saharan Africa. Meanwhile, the success stories form the global elite among 
individuals and the global superpower among countries (i.e. the US), having proved 
their right to rule. 
<P>This New American Order erects economic neo-liberalism and into a moral and 
political philosophy via a kind of revived Social Darwinism. It's the market as 
God-image, which claims to bring about the end of history and of politics, thus 
establishing itself as the final framework for human affairs. Between the 'no 
politics' espoused by people such as Frances Fukuyama ( The End of History ) and 
Thomas L. Friedman, the New York Times columnist and Globalization cheerleader, 
who argues that economic growth will abolish the need for political disputes, 
and my informant's 'total politics', lie two fundamentally opposed visions of 
the future. 
<P>As one activist said, 'we're constantly winning the argument and losing the 
battle'. Over the past 12 months, the movement has lost most of its public profile. 
Barry Coates of the World Development Movement says: 'Obviously, it's much harder 
to attack the US and they deserve to be attacked on a lot of their positions. 
And it's harder to get people out on the streets when there's a perceived solidarity 
with government on a larger aim.' Harding of the Financial Times questions whether 
the movement can continue as a global force without the American radicals, now 
silenced by 11 September. Meanwhile, Western political and business leaders move 
their meetings to ever-more remote and heavily fortified places, out of reach 
of protesters. The latest WTO talks took place in Qatar, an impregnable oil statelet, 
with a US warship sitting in the harbor and the Qatar government restricting visas. 
While last year's G8 meeting was in Genoa, last month's was in Kananaskis, a dot 
in the Canadian wilderness. 
<P>According to Monbiot, none of this matters because the struggle over corporate-led 
Globalization has come home. People can see it in their own towns. They can feel 
its effects for themselves. The state of public services such as the Tube, the 
NHS, the railways; privatization; companies ending 'final salary' pension schemes 
while pensions for directors and chief executives soar; the crisis in farming, 
with small farmers being forced off the land; manufacturers such as Raleigh, Dyson 
and Royal Doulton (which makes those quintessentially British china figurines), 
shutting factories in the UK and moving production to the Third World. All these 
developments are related to economic Globalization - or, to call the same thing 
by a different name, to triumphant laissez-faire capitalism on the march. 
<P>Then there's the General Agreement on Trade in Services, now being negotiated 
in Geneva, which will open up public services to the multinationals to run; any 
attempt to keep them out could count as 'unnecessary barriers' to trade and be 
illegal. As David Hartridge, ex-director of the Services Division at the WTO, 
has said, 'GATS will speed up the process of &#91;economic&#93; liberalization 
and make it irreversible'. 
<P>To the Global Justice Movement, GATS shows how calls for free trade and investment, 
economic growth and universal consumption hide a different agenda: to advance 
corporate power while rolling back the state and democracy. President Bush, playing 
fast and loose with his 'free trade' policy, slapping import duties on steel and 
hugely increasing subsidies to US agribusiness, while offering the Third World 
the sop of limited, conditional increases in the derisory US aid budget, only 
reveals the bankruptcy of Globalization as usual'. 
<P>Instead of pushing ahead with GATS and its sibling acronyms, say the activists, 
capitalism needs to reform itself, as it has done before, for example with the 
US New Deal and the creation of European welfare states. Many of those reforms 
were as pragmatic as the movement's ideas are today. Big business fought them 
as bitterly then as now. Others in the movement argue capitalism is beyond reform. 
The radicals have a strong voice and a good argument. Historically, change has 
happened only in the aftermath of a major crisis. Is economic Globalization destined 
to end in global crisis? Argentina has gone. Japan is looking very rocky, as are 
Brazil and the rest of Latin America. Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole has been written 
off. The stock markets are sinking. Islamic fundamentalism won't vanish any time 
soon. There are fears of a wider war. Hold on to your hats, it's going to be a 
bumpy ride.
