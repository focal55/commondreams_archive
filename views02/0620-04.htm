<p>Six distinct calls for Palestinian reform and elections are being pressed now: 
five of them are, for Palestinian purposes, both useless and irrelevant. Sharon 
wants reform as a way of further disabling Palestinian national life. The United 
States wants reform principally as a way of combating"terrorism", a panacea of 
a word that takes no account of history, context, or anything else.</p>
<p>Third is the Arab leaders' demand which, as far as I can tell, is a combination 
of several different elements, none of them directly helpful to the Palestinians 
themselves. Fourth in the chorus of reform are the Europeans. But they only scurry 
around sending emissaries to Sharon and Arafat, make ringing declarations in Brussels, 
fund a few projects &#150; and more or less leave it at that.</p>
<p>Then there is Yasser Arafat and his circle of associates, who have suddenly 
discovered the virtues (theoretically at least) of democracy and reform. I know 
that I speak at a great distance from the field of struggle, and I also know all 
the arguments about the besieged Arafat as a potent symbol of Palestinian resistance 
against Israeli aggression, but I have come to a point where I think none of that 
has any meaning any more.</p>
<p>Arafat is simply interested in saving himself. He has had almost 10 years of 
freedom to run a petty kingdom, and has succeeded essentially in bringing opprobrium 
and scorn on himself and most of his team. Why anyone for a moment believes that 
at this stage he is capable of anything different, or that his new streamlined 
cabinet (dominated by the same old faces of defeat and incompetence) is going 
to produce actual reform, simply defies reason.</p>
<p>Finally there is the Palestinian people, who are now justifiably clamoring 
both for reform and elections. As far as I am concerned, this clamor is the only 
legitimate one of the six I have outlined here. It's important to point out that 
Arafat's present administration, as well as the Legislative Council, have overstayed 
their original term, which should have ended with a new round of elections in 
1999. Moreover, the whole basis of the 1996 elections was the Oslo accords, which 
in effect simply licensed Arafat and his people to run bits of the West Bank and 
Gaza for the Israelis, without true sovereignty or security. Any attempt to go 
forward on that kind of platform is simply a wasteful ploy.</p>
<p>What then is to be done if the old basis of Palestinian legitimacy no longer 
really exists?</p>
<p>The major interests in Palestinian society, those that have kept life going, 
from the trade unions to health workers, teachers, farmers, lawyers, doctors, 
in addition to all the many NGOs, must now become the basis on which Palestinian 
reform &#150; despite Israel's incursions and the occupation &#150; is to be constructed. 
It seems to me useless to wait for Arafat, or Europe, or the US, or the Arabs 
to do this: it must absolutely be done by Palestinians themselves by way of a 
Constituent Assembly that contains all major elements of Palestinian society.</p>
<p>It must keep Palestinian life going in an orderly way with full participation 
for all concerned. It should also choose an emergency executive committee whose 
mandate is to end the occupation, not negotiate with it. It is quite obvious that 
militarily we are no match for Israel. What is needed is a creative method of 
struggle that mobilizes all the human resources at our disposal to highlight, 
isolate and gradually make untenable the main aspects of Israeli occupation, e.g. 
settlements, settlement roads, roadblocks and house demolitions.</p>
<p>For such a Palestinian strategy to work there has to be an Israeli component 
made up of individuals and groups with whom a common basis of struggle against 
occupation can, and indeed must, be established. This is the great lesson of the 
South African struggle: that it proposed the vision of a multiracial society from 
which neither individuals nor groups and leaders were ever deflected. The only 
vision coming out of Israel today is violence, forcible separation and the continued 
subordination of Palestinians to an idea of Jewish supremacy. Not every Israeli 
believes in these things, of course, but it must be up to us to project the idea 
of coexistence in two states that have natural relations with each other on the 
basis of sovereignty and equality.</p>
<p>We have never faced a worse or, at the same time, a more seminal moment. The 
Arab order is in total disarray; the US administration is effectively controlled 
by the Christian right and the Israeli lobby, and our society has been nearly 
wrecked by poor leadership and the insanity of thinking that suicide bombing will 
lead directly to an Islamic Palestinian state. There is always hope for the future, 
but one has to able to look for it and find it in the right place. It is quite 
clear that in the absence of any serious Palestinian or Arab information policy 
in the United States (especially in Congress), we cannot for a moment delude ourselves 
that Powell and Bush are about to set a real agenda for Palestinian rehabilitation. 
That's why I keep saying that the effort must come from us, by us, for us.</p>
<p>Who else but the Palestinian people can construct the legitimacy they need 
to rule themselves and fight the occupation with weapons that don't kill innocents 
and lose us more support than ever before?</p>
