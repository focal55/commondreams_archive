<p>Democrats and Greens seem intent on re-fighting the last war
indefinitely as Democrats continue to blame Ralph Nader and the
Greens for sabotaging Al Gore's election chances in 2000. Greens
reply that Gore beat himself, though they add that even if they
helped Gore beat himself they had every right to do so.</P>

<P> It's a fascinating argument replayed on our letters page nearly
every edition since the election, but we're not so much interested in
fighting over the last war as we are in winning the next one. As we
have said before, a big part of that effort is to see that
Republicans don't regain control of the Senate.</P>

<P> Greens are now nominating candidates for this fall's election and
they promise aggressive slates. But Minnesota Greens haven't done
progressive populists any favors with their decision to challenge
Sen. Paul Wellstone. </P>

<P> Wellstone, perhaps the most progressive populist in the Senate,
already faced the determined opposition of the White House, which
recruited former St. Paul mayor Norm Coleman to run against him.
Republicans have made ousting Wellstone a priority precisely because
of his vocal opposition to most of what George W. Bush stands
for.</P>

<P> Ken Jerome-Stern writes on page 17 that a maturing Green Party
decided to nominate Ed McGaa, a political novice also known as "Eagle
Man," for the Senate. We disagree. Causing this mischief for
Wellstone, who supports many of the Green Party's core values, looks
more like a sign of the party's immaturity. </P>

<P> Green leaders in other parts of the country have said they intend
to put up candidates against moderate and conservative Democrats in
part to force Democrats to adopt more progressive positions. </P>

<P> Some Minnesota Greens said they supported McGaa because Wellstone
supported the use of military force against the perpetrators of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attack and he also voted for the USA PATRIOT Act.
However, McGaa, a US Marine Corps veteran of Korean and Vietnam wars,
also supports those measures and has professed that he is unfamiliar
with the Green Party's values. </P>

<P> The main attraction of McGaa appears to be that he is a Sioux and
and an author of books on Native American spirituality. Reports from
the convention indicate that delegates did not know much more about
his position on political issues.</P>

<P> Winona LaDuke, Nader's running mate in the 2000 race, appealed to
the convention to pass up the Senate race, but as Green spokeswoman
Holle Brian told The Progressive's Ruth Conniff, "People came to the
convention with the goal of endorsing a candidate come hell or high
water."</P>

<P> Ultimately, as we have said before, voters will make the choice.
We hope they recognize that Wellstone needs their support for a third
term. We also hope the Greens will choose their fights better.</P>

<P> A better course this year would be for Greens to offer to pull
back races this fall against Democrats who agree to support instant
runoff voting (IRV) and proportional representation.</P>

<P> Under the plurality voting system used in most Senate and
congressional races, it would be hard to endorse even so estimable a
candidate as our own columnist Ted Glick against as flawed a product
as Sen. Bob Torricelli, D-N.J., knowing that a vote for Glick would
help to reinstate Trent Lott as majority leader and remove the last
meaningful oversight to Dubya's rule by executive decree.</P>

<P> It would be better to see if Torricelli would commit to support
IRV, which would eliminate the threat of spoiler candidacies, and
proportional representation, which could be used to replace
congressional gerrymandering and ensure minority representation.</P>

<P> State legislatures can adopt instant runoff voting in state and
federal races but they need the approval of Congress to set up
proportional representation in congressional districts. Having
prominent Congress members pushing for those changes will perhaps
help get them out of committee. Republicans should be amenable, with
Ross Perot's spoiler role in 1992 and '96 presidential races vivid in
their memory.</P>

<P> If Torricelli and other Democrats agree by Oct. 1 to push for IRV
in statewide races and proportional representation in congressional
races, Greens might withdraw from those races. They could still
concentrate on races where they need a certain proportion of the vote
to remain on the ballot for the next election, as well as races
against those Demos who refuse to commit their support to IRV and
proportional representation.</P>

<P> In the meantime, Democrats had better get over their murderous
rage at the upstart Greens. They are here, they are determined to be
heard, and there are just enough of them to make life difficult for
the Democrats. It would be better for Democrats to work in coalition
with Greens, particularly when IRV would do away with the spoiler
role that neither side wants the Greens to maintain. And with Bush's
Justice Department bringing back the FBI's domestic spying program
and sending off US citizens to military brigs for indeterminate
detention, there just aren't enough progressive voters out there to
allow us the luxury of splitting our side and allowing Bush and his
right-wing cohorts to consolidate their hold on the government.</P>
