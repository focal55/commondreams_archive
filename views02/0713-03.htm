<p>The Bush administration appears to be trying to prove that a war can be won 
by sabre-rattling alone. Amid an almost deafening public indifference, hardly 
a day goes by without a new report or disclosure suggesting that a US attack, 
at the end of this year or early next, is a virtual certainty. </p>
<p> The official position was set out by President George Bush at his press conference 
on Monday. He said America was committed to "regime change" in Baghdad and would 
use "all the tools at our disposal" to achieve that end. But he insisted again 
that he had not made a final decision on any plan. He dismissed the leak of detailed 
Pentagon war plans to <i>The New York Times</i> last week as "somebody down there 
at level five flexing some 'know-how' muscle". </p>
<p> This week the leaks have continued, first in a report claiming that the US 
would use Jordanian airfields to launch its assault &#173; even though the Jordanians 
have not been informed of the plan, and every indication is that they would not 
give permission if asked. Then came another and somewhat contradictory report 
in <i>USA Today</i>, to the effect that the military planners had "raised the 
bar" for an invasion. It would now require a serious provocation by Saddam Hussein, 
such as invading a neighbour or attacking the Kurds or Shia Muslims in the south, 
before the US war machine started to roll. Like the other reports, it was sourced 
to anonymous "officials". </p>
<p> The implication of the <i>New York Times</i> revelations is that the "Afghan 
model" for an invasion of Iraq, involving bombing, special forces and covert CIA 
operations, with the help of an internal insurrection (for the opposition Northern 
Alliance read the Kurds), had been dropped. Instead the blueprint, entitled <i>Cent-Com 
Course for Action</i>, puts the emphasis on an all-out assault involving 250,000 
or 300,000 US troops, and a massive air attack aimed at crucial infrastructure 
targets as well as suspected sites where weapons of mass destruction are being 
developed or stored. </p>
<p> Some analysts believe the source of the leak to be military commanders who 
believe the politicians are blithely talking up an operation whose potential cost 
in casualties for US forces they do not fully appreciate. But others take the 
report as part of a process of softening up President Saddam, forcing him into 
a rash move that would give Washington the pretext it required. Talk of US and 
British agents stirring up trouble among the Kurds might, for example, prod the 
Iraqi leader into a strike against them, thus offering the US justification to 
step in. </p>
<p> This strategy would also explain why Washington is so averse to protracted 
negotiations over the return of United Nations weapons inspectors, and was delighted 
by the failure of the latest round of talks last week in Geneva. Paul Wolfowitz, 
the Deputy Defence Secretary and a leading proponent of action to get rid of President 
Saddam, has derided the inspection process. They would be unable to inspect anything 
worth inspecting, he insists, while the talks would enable President Saddam to 
play for time, throwing open his doors to stave off an invasion. </p>
<p> Instead, Washington is starting to focus on a possible provocation that would 
clear any conceivable bar: links between Iraq and al-Qa'ida pointing to Baghdad 
having had a hand in terrorist attacks, or even 11 September itself. After the 
attacks, the CIA and the Pentagon seemed if anything to play down reports that 
Mohamed Atta, the hijackers' ringleader, met an Iraqi intelligence officer in 
Prague earlier in 2001. But officials are now looking at that episode again, while 
an Iraqi defector claimed in a television documentary this week that he had seen 
Osama bin Laden in Baghdad in July 1998, just before al-Qa'ida attacked two US 
embassies in east Africa. </p>
<p> Either story, if confirmed, would vindicate Washington's argument for toppling 
President Saddam &#173; that while he might not use chemical, nuclear or biological 
weapons, he would make them available to terrorists. If the US could prove a connection 
between Iraq and al-Qa'ida, doubts over whether an invasion was justified would 
disappear. In the meantime, the sabre-rattling continues.</p>
