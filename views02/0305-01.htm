WASHINGTON - Just 15 miles south of here, the federal government is building a $600 million spaghetti-bowl interchange at just one of the zillion intersections of the Interstate Highway System. This follows an investment of at least $200 million to add four lanes to Interstate 95 immediately south of this crowded interchange. 
<P> There is enough spent there to build a great university campus - complete with medical school, linear accelerator and chemistry laboratories. This mindless splurge, which is being replicated all over the country, will accomplish nothing. 
<P> The four new lanes are now bumper-to-bumper by 11 most Saturday mornings. This is because motor vehicle traffic abhors a vacuum. Buses, cars and trucks go where the capacity is. And traffic is expanding faster than road capacity. 
<P> Despite this investment of taxpayer dollars, the capacity of this particular interchange is locked in for the next 40 years simply because of the bridge abutments and other built-in arrangements. 
<P> State and federal highway agencies throw hundreds of billions around like this without blinking, with no public debate and virtually no media notice. It&#39;s on automatic. 
<P> Similarly, federal agencies and airport authorities dump tens of billions into new runways, aprons and other projects. That, too, is on automatic. 
<P> It doesn&#39;t take a nuclear physicist to figure out why. The combination of forces favoring sprawl, concrete and steel - automakers, contractors and oil companies - is virtually unbeatable here. 
<P> The hired guns in pinstripes representing the major airlines are likewise unstoppable. Witness last fall&#39;s congressional $15 billion bailout of the major airlines, whose callous and reckless indifference to security concerns played a role in the hijackings of Sept. 11. 
<P> These same forces have traditionally thwarted attempts by former Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and other progressive thinkers to advance rail solutions to inter-city transportation problems. These interests have succeeded in preventing Amtrak from fulfilling the promise made when President Richard Nixon created it three decades ago. 
<P> Now, with the support of White House Budget Director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., this combine has hatched a cabal to kill off Amtrak when it is most needed. 
<P> This conspiracy - and it is not too strong a term - centers on a report concocted by the so-called Amtrak Reform Council. This was a 1997 creation of then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi. 
<P> This elitist exercise in anti-urban, regionalist bias was forced on Congress by those two Republicans as a condition of continuing the modest level - compared with the subsidies given the airline and highway businesses - of operating subsidies provided to Amtrak. 
<P> According to the 1997 law, Amtrak had to show a profit by 2002 or this Amtrak Reform Council would call on the passenger system to come up with a liquidation plan. 
<P> No national or regional passenger system in the world shows a profit, any more than the airline or trucking industries could operate without government money. All transportation - other than canoes, bikes and scooters - is subsidized. 
<P> The council also produced a plan to &quot;reorganize&quot; Amtrak. Complaining loudly about the modest subsidies Amtrak receives to run a national passenger system, the council proposes to break up and sell off the entire system, including the only tracks Amtrak owns - the northeastern corridor, running from Washington to Boston. 
<P> Already under the reform council&#39;s pressure to cut costs, Amtrak has announced it will cut 18 long-distance trains from service this fall, including trains running through the district of New York Republican Jack Quinn, chairman of the House Transportation Subcommittee on Railroads. 
<P> The reorganization &quot;plan&quot; crafted by the council is a predictable one, considering the council&#39;s makeup. Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Lott saw to it that the panel would be dominated by the most dedicated, right-wing, anti-government ideologues they could find - people who would be indifferent to the interests of Amtrak&#39;s middle-class customers. 
<P> The plan the reform council produced is an audacious union-busting grab for government property, with a death grip on the public purse. It would sell off Amtrak&#39;s assets, liquidating some, and offer parts of its system to private operators. These private operators would be subsidized, of course, according to the reform council scheme. One estimate is $100 billion over a decade. 
<P> Privatization moves in Massachusetts and Britain have proved disastrous. The $100 billion is a good estimate of what Amtrak should have gotten but didn&#39;t because of its well-heeled opponents. This outrageous plan for Amtrak is a classic case study of what can happen when entrenched big money is pitted against the common citizen in this town.
