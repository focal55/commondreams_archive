<p>When Johannesburg hosts the World Summit on Sustainable Development 
(WSSD) next week, it will be hosting three conferences: one for 
official delegates, one for "civil society," and one for those unable 
to pay the US$150 registration fee to qualify for membership to 
"civil society." This three-tiered arrangement of the conferences 
tells an uncomfortable story of bureaucratic power, control and 
resistance, one that is very much of our time.

<p>To understand what's going on, it's worth reading between the lines 
of the official pronouncements that have been published in the run up 
to the Summit. And if we look at the bevy of press releases and 
research findings from the World Bank, the WSSD secretariat and 
others, we find that the Summit's sponsors have come up with an earth 
shattering idea, one that diagnoses-and purports to 
treat-environmental problems the world over. The idea is this: 
special interest groups are bad for the environment.

<p>Okay, so it's not such an earth shattering idea. But there's some 
merit in it. Consider industrial lobbies. They are able to have their 
way because they are small, well organised, and have every incentive 
to avoid paying for costly environmentally-friendly change. One need 
only look to the Bush administration's cosy relationship with the 
U.S. energy industry for evidence. If only this unrepresentative 
power of small groups could be managed, the environment would 
flourish-or so the argument runs.

<p>Have a look at that again. It's a magnificent piece of blamestorming. 
This logic tars both industrial interest groups and small progressive 
organisations with the same brush, not because of their politics, 
power, or relationship to society or the environment but because they 
are both small.

<p>This couches environmental problems as a battle between small and big 
groups. Political issues take a back seat. Size is the important 
factor here. Thus, small groups such as Food First, the Environmental 
Defense Fund, or Greenpeace, their massive subscriber base 
notwithstanding, count as small special interest groups. As such, 
they come in for the same policy prescription, the same levelling 
discipline. Having diagnosed that only size matters, the 
international institutions safeguarding the environment, together 
with their corporate partners, present their cure: increase the 
international policing of domestic politics. This focus on small 
groups provides a license to fight not only the small but immensely 
powerful industrial interest groups, but also the small and much less 
powerful groups that constitute civil society at home and abroad. And 
this strikes at the heart of democracy.

<p>If this interpretation is correct, we might expect to see a schism in 
the public sphere between those groups and agencies willing to 
cooperate with corporate interests and those who are not.  The word 
for this process is "partnership." And there's a great deal of it 
around. At the Johannesburg summit itself, the "civil society" 
secretariat has sought corporate funding. The International Chambers 
of Commerce and the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development for their part have been exceptionally promiscuous, 
partnering with the UN, the World Bank, some NGOs and a smattering of 
academic institutions to demonstrate that, if business is left free 
from the shackles of state regulation, it can consummate its affairs 
responsibly.

<p>The orgy of partnerships at the WSSD (and almost every other major 
multilateral event of late) might make us want to think again about 
Margaret Mead's oft-quoted soundbite: "Never doubt that a small group 
of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world.  Indeed, it's 
the only thing that ever has."  Although this slogan has been recited 
as a hard-times mantra by embattled progressives the world over, it's 
a double-edged slogan. It provides too much succour to those whose 
trust in people's ability to choose action rather than free-riding 
wavers more than it ought. It is also incorrect.

<p>Many of the finest moments in history have come not from a group of 
well organised individuals, but the collective actions of hundreds of 
thousands. Whether this action has been in the home, in the fields, 
in the factories, or in the classroom, populism and mass action 
remain important. In light of the large-scale mobilisations around 
the World Bank, World Trade Organization and corporate rule over the 
past five years, the most appropriate response to the corporate 
take-over of the WSSD is also demonstrably feasible: a blaze of mass 
politics.
