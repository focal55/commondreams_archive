Not every day you'll catch me declaring my profound agreement
with the interloper in the White House. So take note.  In his State of the Union, George Bush urged Americans to
volunteer, to help build an America that "serves
goals greater than the self.”  He said "America needs citizens to extend the compassion
of our country to every part of the world." 
<P>
I couldn't agree more. 
<P>
It is therefore absolutely essential to publicize the work of American men and women who are doing just that. 
<P>
This is the third day of Sharon's new military campaign against Palestinian civilians. With 20,000 reservists called, it
promises to be a long and bloody one.
<P>
Tanks wreak destruction
in Ramallah, Hebron, and other Palestinian towns. Israeli Defense Force (IDF) soldiers
vandalize homes, wantonly destroying furniture and precious
food. 
<P>
Journalists and TV offices are top targets. The IDF
shoots at ambulances, arrests medical personnel, and storm
hospitals. 
<P>
Yesterday they destroyed offices and equipment
belonging to two human rights organizations, LAW and Al-Haq.
<P>
Five Palestinian policemen in IDF custody were apparently
executed in cold blood. 
<P>
There are reports of more mass executions
in Ramallah today. Sharon calls it a war against "the
infrastructure of terror.” But the
only infrastructure that matters is the determination of
Palestinians to shake off the occupation or take Israel
to Hell with them. Sharon's war is a war against the Palestinian
population, and against humanity. 
<P>
Amidst this ugly orgy, dozens of Americans join hundreds
of Europeans in an international effort to protect the life
of Palestinians and bear witness to what the American media
doesn't ask and doesn't tell. 
<P>
The internationals, as they call themselves, have been coming
to Palestine for some time now, for periods between a few
days to a few months. They do not have any official status,
but are self-organized in a number of groups, such as the
"Colorado Campaign for Middle East Peace,”
"Direct Action for Free Palestine,”
"International Solidarity Movement,”
and others.
<P>
Most of the time, the internationals help Palestinians mount
peaceful, non-violent resistance. The foreigners' presence
enable Palestinians to demonstrate against the occupation
without being shot at with live bullets. 
<P>
Other protest actions
include the dismantling of roadblocks, which allow families
short breathers to drive in and out of their villages for
essential restocking or to sell produce. Palestinians cannot
do such things on their own without risking their life.
Returning activists describe these actions as very effective. 
<P>
Beyond the immediate relief, international presence brings
a message of solidarity and humanity to a population that
is rapidly losing faith in the world. 
<P>
Since yesterday, the role of international presence changed
dramatically. Caught together with the Palestinians in the
military assault, American and European activists find themselves
at the forefront of the war. They accompany medical personnel,
serving as "human shields"
in the hope of deterring the IDF from the usual lax shooting
policy. And they use their cellphones to broadcast direct
evidence of what the IDF would rather you did not know. 
<P>
Nancy Stohlman is in refugee camp Aida, which, she reports,
is shelled by tanks. How shelling a densely populated urban
environment helps the IDF preventing suicide bombs is beyond
my reasoning powers. Together with her hosts, she is waiting
for the tanks and the soldiers to move in. 
<P>
In the camp,
almost everything adds to the tension of waiting. Nancy
describes how "a deaf boy found her staring
at a wall of martyr posters, and for 25 minutes, using gestures,
described the manner of each of their deaths."
<P>
Her journals can be read at <A HREF="http://www.ccmep.org" TARGET="NEW">www.ccmep.org</A>.
<P>
Jordan Flaherty is in the refugee camp Al-Azzeh, in Bethlehem,
together with twenty-three other internationals. They have

spread out in the camp, accommodated by local families, in
an attempt to provide residents with some protection. Some
have also been riding with ambulances. 
<P>
Jordan reported that,
in order to get to his present location, he had to cross
a street running under fire from an IDF sniper ensconced
in the overlooking settlement. Needless to say, Jordan is
completely unarmed. The camp is shelled occasionally by
the tanks, and an incursion is expected within a day. Those
who needed to escape escaped; the rest are waiting.
<P>
This is Jordan's second time in Palestine. Although the tension
is higher, he stresses that the international presence in
Palestine is not going to shrink. A big recruitment, planned
for later this year under the name "freedom
summer,” will hopefully bring thousands of internationals
to Palestine. He urges more people to join because "this
is really making a difference.”  For information, visit: <A HREF="http://www.palsolidarity.org" TARGET="NEW">www.palsolidarity.org</A>
<P>


Brooklynite Adam Shapiro negotiated with the IDF for three
long hours the passage of ambulances to Arafat's compound,
and ended up trapped inside. The first ambulance was stopped
on the way out and both the doctors and wounded were arrested.
<P>
Seeing that, Adam remained inside, tending to wounds with
inadequate medical supplies, and keeping in touch with the outside
world with a dying cellphone. In the morning he was invited
to share breakfast with the blockaded Arafat. Adam left
the compound today, but other internationals came in, braving
the IDF, and intend to stay. 
<P>


The internationals shatter the lie of the manufactured consensus
that the war in the Middle East is between Jews and Arabs.
It isn't. It is a war between racism and justice. That is
why the American media routinely ignores their efforts.
Only the photo-op with Arafat forced the news editors to
break their gag rule. 
<P>


The IDF is alarmed by the presence of internationals. Frenchmen
Jose Bove, McDonald's eminence grise, is also in Palestine.
<P>
He was arrested two days ago together with nine other internationals
and three Palestinians and taken to the settlement of Bet-El.
The IDF declared martial law in Ramallah and is trying to
evacuate the internationals and the media. Nobody knows
what the IDF is capable of doing once the eyes of the world
are covered. 
<P>
Shapiro, Stohlman, Flaherty, and the hundreds of peace activists
currently staying in Palestine cannot stop Sharon. They
can only slow him down in the hope that the world, that
means us, stops him in time. Will we? 
<P>
Says Irish Caoimhe Butterly, who is also in Arafat's compound:
"I urge all Irish citizens, government officials and diplomats
to show courage in standing up against the brutal aggression
used by the Israeli military against the Palestinian people
and the war policies of the Israeli government. 
<P>
“The Palestinian
people desperately need our help and protection - I have
witnessed the execution-style killings and the house to
house searches and destruction the military has carried
out in refugee camps and in cities. 
<P>
“Only international action
and the voices of people working for peace and justice can
overcome these criminal Israeli actions." 
<P>
Count the U.S. president out. George Bush used his rambling press
announcement to express cautious endorsement of the Butcher
of Beirut. Bush barely managed to mention the Palestinians.
<P>
Thanks to the good services of Cheney and Rumsfeld,
he had earlier this year swallowed the bait of Sharon's
contrived equation between fundamentalist terrorism and
the Palestinian struggle against the long Israeli occupation.
Sharon's hook is now stuck deep in the throat of American
foreign policy. 
<P>

But other Americans do listen to their inner call of duty.
They are participating in a true international "army
of compassion,” enduring the occupation together
with Palestinians. They may not enjoy the cachet of sophisticated
war toys, fawning media accolades, and "black
hawk down" style adulation, but they are the real
elite troops. 
<P>
With their ordinary heroism, they are America's
finest and bravest.
<P>
