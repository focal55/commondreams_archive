<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Just 
as Americans are recovering from the harrowing television re-runs of the 11 September 
attacks, their President is going to launch the biggest reshaping of the Middle 
East since the British and French parceled out the Arab lands after the 1914-18 
war. When he addresses the United Nations on Thursday, George Bush will be threatening 
not only Iraq &#150; which had absolutely nothing to do with the crimes against 
humanity in New York and Washington &#150; but Syria, Iran and, by extension, 
Saudi Arabia and Egypt.</p> 
<p>The Syrian Accountability Act, which accuses Damascus of supporting "terrorism", 
will come into force as President Bush is speaking and will follow only days after 
the State Department branded the Lebanese Hizbollah as the "A-team of terrorism", 
more dangerous even than Osama bin Laden's al-Qa'ida. Like Iraq, the Hizbollah 
had nothing to do with the 11 September attacks &#150; indeed, they were among 
the first to condemn them &#150; but the White House now seems set on painting 
allies and enemies alike in the Middle East as a focus of evil.</p>
<p>Only <i>The Nation</i> among all of America's newspapers and magazines has 
dared to point out that a large number of former Israeli lobbyists are now working 
within the American administration and the Bush plans for the Middle East &#150; 
which could cause a massive political upheaval in the Arab world &#150; fit perfectly 
into Israel's own dreams for the region. The magazine listed Vice-President Dick 
Cheney &#150; the arch-hawk in the US administration &#150; and John Bolton, now 
under-secretary of state for Arms Control, with Douglas Feith, the third most 
senior executive at the Pentagon, as members of the advisory board of the pro-Israeli 
Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (Jinsa) before joining the Bush 
government. Richard Perle, chairman of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board, is 
still an adviser on the institute, as is the former CIA director James Woolsey.</p>
<p>Michael Ledeen, described by <i>The Nation</i> as "one of the most influential 
'Jinsans' in Washington" has been calling for "total war" against "terror" &#150; 
with "regime change" for Syria, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority. 
Mr Perle advises the Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld &#150; who refers to the 
West Bank and Gaza as "the so-called occupied territories" &#150; and arranged 
the anti-Saudi "kernel of evil" briefing by Laurent Murawiec that so outraged 
the Saudi royal family last month. The Saudi regime may itself be in great danger 
as the princes of the House of Saud attempt to seize more power for themselves 
in advance of the departure of the dying King Fahd.</p>
<p>Jinsa's website says it exists to "inform the American Defense and foreign 
affairs community about the important role Israel can and does play in bolstering 
democratic interests in the Mediterranean and the Middle East". Next month, Michael 
Rubin of the right-wing and pro-Israeli American Enterprise Institute &#150; who 
referred to the outgoing UN human rights commissioner Mary Robinson as an abettor 
of "terrorism" &#150; joins the US Defense Department as an Iran-Iraq "expert".</p>
<p>According to <i>The Nation</i>, Irving Moskovitz, the California bingo magnate 
who has funded settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, is a donor as 
well as a director of Jinsa.</p>
<p>President Bush, of course, will not be talking about the influence of these 
pro-Israeli lobbyists when he presents his vision of the Middle East at the United 
Nations on Thursday.</p>
<p>Nor will he give the slightest indication that the region is, in the words 
of its own kings and dictators, a powder keg of resentment and anger. The tectonic 
plates of the Arab world are now grinding with increasing violence. Into this 
political earthquake zone, Mr Bush now seems intent on leading his country, with 
his loyal British ally.</p>
<p>Most of today's Arab nations were fashioned out of the ruins of the Ottoman 
Empire by Britain and France in the aftermath of the First World War &#150; and 
Palestinians still blame Britain today for supporting the formation of a Jewish 
homeland in Palestine.</p>
<p>Both European nations stationed tens of thousands of troops across the region, 
suppressing Arab revolts in Palestine, Syria and Lebanon &#150; itself created 
by the French at the request of its Christian Maronite community. The whole colonial 
framework led to the loss of tens of thousands of lives before both the British 
and French retreated from the Middle East.</p>
<p>Now President Bush seems set on following the colonial powers into the region 
for another military and political adventure &#150; ostensibly to spread "democracy" 
among those nations it most despises (Iraq, Palestine and Iran) but in fact more 
likely to increase American control of an increasingly anti-Western Arab world.</p>
<p>The Arabs themselves warn that this will lead to massive instability and widespread 
violence. The Israelis &#150; and their allies in the US administration &#150; 
are hell bent on the whole shebang.</p> </p> </p>
