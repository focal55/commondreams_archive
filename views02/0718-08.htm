<p>In response to more than 25 years of violence and
armed struggle in the province of Aceh, Indonesia, a
group of academics and activists have undertaken the
task of creating a peace education curriculum grounded
in the core Islamic peace beliefs and rooted in the
Acehnese social and cultural values.

<p>Islam, derived from the word salam, peace, is at the
core of its very name, a religion of peace.

<p>Many times miscalculated as a religion of vengeance
and retribution, Islam on a global scale has received defamatory attention in recent times.  Yet its truest practitioners continue to quote the Qu'ran as a book of peacemaking directives.

<p>Inequity, violence and a highly traumatized
population serve as the backdrop for this curriculum
and the accompanying teacher and student trainings.
Many rural Acehnese are under-educated, while the city
of Banda Aceh is experiencing a rapid rate of
urbanization.  These factors contribute to a level of dissatisfaction with the centralized Indonesian government, and cause the Acehnese to become further entrenched in the separatist movement.

<p>In the past year alone more than 600 people have been
killed in Aceh.  Nearly every Acehnese has a story of
witness to violence.  Few are untouched by the bloody
struggle.

<p>For the past three decades, violence has been the
modus operandi for resolving conflicts in Aceh.  The
GAM (Free Aceh Movement) and Indonesian military
routinely and aggressively perpetrate acts of violence
which often catch civilians in the crossfire.  Like
many international conflicts, the blame and
frustration is so deep and the feelings so hot that
this power struggle has assumed a life of its own.

<p>Young people angry at the disparity of wealth and
inaccess to better education and thus a better life
have taken up arms to ameliorate their situation.
Admittedly they recognize that weapons are a quick fix
and permit no long-term solution, but are good tools
for getting revenge and perpetuating the conflict.

<p>Recognizing that violence only perpetuates more
violence, the curriculum team began developing a peace education program for high school-aged students as well as teachers, and over the past year has conducted trainings and workshops which have reached both private and public schools throughout Aceh.

<p>Thus far, the Acehnese academic community, including
students, teachers, administrators and government
officials, have embraced this peace initiative with
open arms.  Led by Director, Dr. Asna Husin, supported
by UNICEF, AusAID, and the
Washington, DC-based non-profit Nonviolence
International, this curriculum seeks to bring an
active, dynamic peace perspective to Aceh so that
future generations of Acehnese need not live under the
same threatening conditions that currently exist.

<p>Six basic principles form the foundation for the
curriculum: Introspection and Sincerity, Rights and Responsibilities, Conflict and Violence, Democracy and Justice, Plurality of Creation, and Paths to Peace. Embedded in the lessons in these chapters are crucial Acehnese proverbs that have superficial as well as deeper meanings for bringing about peace and justice.

<p>Central to the curriculum is the teaching that Allah
desires peace.  It is not enough to have peace just
between the individual and Allah, however.  If there
is injustice or inequality among humans, then Allah is
not satisfied.  Moreover, Islam teaches that peace is
not a receptive, passive condition where only
self-interests are served.  Rather peace is a dynamic
which must be continually refined, redefined and
struggled to achieve.

<p>In achieving peace, humans must examine our wants and
needs.  We all experience social, spiritual, physical
and psychological needs, all of which must be kept in
a rough balance to maintain peace.  Our excessive
wants, however, are often the cause of conflict and
violence because this means that others needs are not
being met.

<p>The peace paradigm this curriculum espouses is one
where Allah encompasses the realms of peace within,
peace in the community, and peace with nature.  The
Aceh peace education curriculum teaches that in Islam,
nature is meant to serve our needs  not our wants.

<p>Therefore, to have peace with Allah and peace between
human beings, we must also respect the peace that
exists in nature and not take advantage of natural
resources which bring great wealth to a few and great
poverty to many.  It is the economic injustices that
are perpetrated at a structural level which cause
tremendous personal violence on an individual level.

<p>In Aceh, peacemaking is not a theory or hypothetical
question to be answered with leisure.  It is an
inventive means for proactively addressing the
systemic, militaristic and interpersonal violence
which disrupt every corner of society.
