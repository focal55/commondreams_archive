<p>THROWN INTO the caboose at birth, shuffled around Congress as an unwanted foster 
child, and abandoned by the absentee fathers of public policy, Amtrak is now 31, 
a product one would expect from the crumbling stations of the transportation ghetto. 
The same forces of willful neglect now condemn the rail company for looking for 
handouts. Unlike the damsel in distress pulled off the tracks just in time, Amtrak 
is about to be run over as if it were just another welfare mother. 
<P>Amtrak's new president, David Gunn, has said that the latest shortfalls of 
the passenger rail company are so severe that the system will be shut down in 
July unless it receives a loan guarantee of up to $200 million. Gunn has tried 
to win support by being candid about Amtrak's past.
<P>''The company had lost credibility on many fronts, and its management structure 
was ineffectual,'' Gunn said. ''The company made bad decisions while pursuing 
an impossible goal of self-sufficiency.''</P>
<P>The response from the White House was to pour more coal into the locomotive 
and come around the bend at full speed to bear down on Amtrak. It wants to break 
up the company altogether. The Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington 
would become its own line in a state-federal partnership. Other routes might either 
be privatized or require states interested in maintaining service to provide the 
operating funds.</P>
<P>For a split moment after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, it looked as if 
Americans, through the momentary fear of flying, might explore the possibilities 
of better rail service between big cities. Fear turned into an obsession by the 
nation to get back to ''normal,'' with Americans soon complaining more about airport 
check-in times than whether the random checking of people's shoes has anything 
to do with security.</P>
<P>The obsession for normality meant that Amtrak was sent back to the waiting 
platform of double standards. Last year alone the nation's highways and roads 
received $32 billion from the Department of Transportation, more than the $24 
billion Amtrak has received in its entire 31 years. Air travel, at $13 billion 
last year, receives more funding in two years than Amtrak has in its three decades. 
The General Accounting Office this year said the cost of modernizing America's 
passenger rail system would be $30 billion over the next 20 years. That is still 
less than what America spent last year on highways.</P>
<P>In its budget request for 2003, the Department of Transportation spent most 
of the section devoted to Amtrak complaining about the money it has lost, $20.4 
billion since 1971. The White House says that Amtrak has ''utterly failed.'' The 
White House says that Amtrak's stupid mortgaging of Penn Station in New York to 
cover losses was a ''financial absurdity.'' It concluded that Amtrak is ''clearly 
in desperate financial condition.''</P>
<P>Amtrak is so beaten down by this bad-mouthing that it has asked for only $1.2 
billion next year, less than half of what GAO says it would take for modernization. 
There is no such bad-mouthing for highways and airlines.</P>
<P>The roads get their money even though last month Kenneth Mead, the inspector 
general of the Department of Transportation, reported that the amount of money 
recovered from highway construction fraud has tripled in the last three years 
to $43 million. The Big Dig will get finished by the feds and Massachusetts taxpayers 
even though a project that began with a projected pricetag of $2.5 billion will 
now cost about $15 billion.</P>
<P>Airports get their subsidies, and the nation's airlines got a $15 billion Sept. 
11 bailout even though they, too, suffer from ineffectual management that barely 
cared about passenger security. The major American airlines lost a combined $7 
billion last year and $2.4 billion in the first quarter of this year. In 15 months, 
the airlines have lost nearly half of what Amtrak has lost in 31 years.</P>
<P>The proposal by the White House to foist the cost of Amtrak on the states is 
the real financial absurdity, given that they are reeling from more than $40 billion 
in revenue shortfalls. There are some efforts in Congress to get Amtrak its $1.2 
billion, but nothing like the lobbying for the roads. Bush's proposal to cut roads 
down to $23 billion has been met by a Congress that has all but insured appropriations 
of closer to $30 billion.</P>
<P>The highways and airlines did not need to wait until the nick of time to be 
saved. The damsel representing Amtrak is still wriggling on the tracks. She can 
see the cowcatcher coming at her head.</P>
