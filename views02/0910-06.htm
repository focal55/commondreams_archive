<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->My 
personal acre of hell froze over for an instant last month: I felt a lusty pang 
of love for Phyllis Schlafly, baroness of the religious right and most things 
wrong. Schlafly, you see, offered the best advice to schools regarding this week's 
anniversary of Sept. 11: "There is nothing that schools can add to what happened 
on September 11, that the children haven't already seen in the media. They should 
stay off it and teach what's true." Like English and math. 
<p> But the Eagle Forum Lady's words have soared no further than the wingtips 
of her quote marks. Schools, pre-schools and probably au-pairs everywhere will 
be riveting their wards to a wasted day (or week) of warmed-over grief and hero 
worship, to maniacal patriotism and manufactured gravity. It isn't enough that 
adults muck up the world on a daily basis in the name of power and pride, or electoral 
necessity. Let's draft the kids, too, and muck them up with the same conceits. 
<p> I'm happy to say that my daughter's school is showing admirable restraint, 
as such things go. It is going no further than the wearing of red, white and blue 
for a day, the moment of silence at noon, and the student-led -- if they so choose 
-- talking about "feelings," that wormy substitute for reflection that so often 
turns classrooms into talk show sets. Pointless, but still an improvement over 
last May, when the school's year-end assembly culminated in the showing of one 
of the World Trade Center towers afire and with Lee Greenwood's nasal pride for 
a soundtrack. I don't know which of the two -- the burning images or Greenwood's 
voice -- was more traumatic, but my 8-year-old was in tears all the same. It was, 
of course, the desired effect. It was also a needless and cruel parting shot from 
an otherwise fine school year. 
<p> No risk-taking this time around. I'm taking Wednesday off and taking my daughter 
with me. We'll loiter on the beach or compare the musty smells of a couple of 
used bookstores, find a fun cemetery to walk around or look up the number of crematories 
in the Yellow Pages -- anything but play reverent to the day's pieties. 
<p> This isn't to deny the day's importance, let alone the loss it marks for so 
many thousands. But in truth most of us millions arraigned in the safety of our 
routines cannot know much about that loss and don't want to know much beyond the 
rituals of easy empathy. Life as we know it in its everyday grinds and pleasures 
hasn't changed. We're not at war, never were, and only get away with pretending 
to be because we've too easily accepted the speechmongering of a president for 
whom perpetual war is the only viable re-election strategy. 
<p> September 11 is one of the great tragedies of history, an act of cowardice 
and evil possible only when the fanaticism of religion -- and yes, absolutely, 
Islam in this age -- combusts with bigotry. Whatever the grievances of one part 
of the world against another, of Arabs against America if you like, many of which 
are perfectly legitimate, none, not a one, not by any definition of retaliation, 
self-defense, attention-grabbing or desperation, justifies the events of September 
11. 
<p> Muftis and mullahs with their turban-tongued sermons have no business lecturing 
America about its many failures when every minaret from Algiers to Islamabad is 
a mile-marker of repression, a stake through the human and civil rights of people 
at the mercy of the world's most totalitarian governments. Out of that came the 
preachy terrors of Osama and his rags of bandits. In a previous age that's all 
they'd have remained -- rags. But technology is their short-cut to mayhem, so 
we must deal with them. 
<p> We must, but what we have done has been quite different. America has never 
had a less worthy enemy, yet we've elevated him, or it, into an enemy as worthy 
of a war supposedly as important as the fight against Hitler and as open-ended 
as the Cold War, with demands on the national treasury, the national defense, 
the national esprit de corps nearly as intense as was required for those previous 
wars, and with sacrifices in our own civil liberties that make this "war for freedom" 
a farce of a contradiction. We'll look back on this one day and wonder how we 
could have so easily been duped, how we could have let a president use September 
11, misuse and abuse it like no tragedy ever has, mostly for the wrong reasons 
-- namely his re-election and his administration's pay-back to energy and military 
contractors, for whom fattish profits are always a question mark without a good, 
fattish war to bank on. 
<p> The question not asked in the year since September 11 is this: Are we better 
off than we were a year ago? Of course not. We're probably not any safer from 
freak attacks. We're economically weaker, thanks to an administration's reckless 
give-aways and overspending. And as if that could have even been possible a year 
ago, we are more reviled around the world than we were then, because our national 
arrogance, unlike Wall Street, has been on a bull run unparalleled since William 
McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt bullied about. 
<p> I only need to look at such perversities of arrogance as "America Bless God," 
that astounding bumper sticker peddled by religious fanatics of our own, to know 
that something more than perspective has been lost in the past year. While the 
nation's routines are unscathed, the nation's ideals are not. They're corroding 
from within. So forgive me if I don't play along in Wednesday's spectacles. It's 
not for lack of sorrow. But the mourning is misplaced.
