<p><I>Mutual aid is as much a law of animal life as mutual struggle.<br>
</I>Pter Alekseevich Kropotkin, <BR>
<I>"Mutual Aid" (1902)</I>
<P>What we all learned in mid-October was that President Bush has come up with 
the very best way to combat terrorism. It's called pre-emption. According to the 
document: "The United States will not hesitate to strike pre-emptively against 
its enemies, even if it faces international opposition, and will never again allow 
its military supremacy to be threatened. As a matter of common sense and self-defense, 
America will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. In 
the new world we have entered, the only path to peace and security is the path 
of action." He was right. It's just no one told him what kind of action was needed. 
I could give him some hints. They come from a variety of reports. 
<P>According to a report in the New York Times on Oct. 9, donations of condoms 
from rich nations to poor ones have declined. The world's poorest countries need 
between 8 billion and 10 billion condoms a year to stem the spread of AIDS. Fourteen 
thousand people are infected by the AIDS virus every day in the world's poorest 
countries. The decline in donations from donor countries was led by the United 
States. In 1990 it gave the third world 800 million condoms. In 2000 it gave away 
only 360 million. Mr. Bush could have announced when he spoke at the United Nations 
that in order to combat terrorism we were going to deprive the terrorists of one 
of their chief weapons-the belief that the United States doesn't care about the 
rest of the world. He could have announced that we were going to assemble an international 
coalition to make sure that the world's poorest countries get the eight billion 
to 10 billion condoms it is believed they need to stem the spread of the AIDS 
virus. He didn't. That would have offended his right-wing constituency and not 
offending them is far more important than saving lives. 
<P>In 2001 the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was formed. 
At its inception United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan said he hoped Western 
donations would be $7 billion to $10 billion a year. Its executive director said 
that since its formation the fund has received requests from poor countries totaling 
about $8 billion but has received only $2.1 billion in pledges. In his speech 
at the United Nations Mr. Bush could have announced his intention to assemble 
an international coalition to insure that the organization receive the $8 billion 
needed each year to help the fund achieve its goals. He didn't. Instead his first 
pledge was $200 million. 
<P>In March of 2001 the World Health Organization reported that more than a billion 
people have no access to clean water and 3.4 million people die every year from 
diseases which could be remedied by better supplies and sanitation. According 
to the organization, low-cost initiatives to purify water and improve personal 
hygiene could halve the number of people suffering from poor water and sanitation 
by 2015. In his speech at the United Nations Mr. Bush could have said that the 
deaths of 3.4 million people each year were unacceptable. He could have said that 
waiting until 2015 to halve the number of people who have potable water was unacceptable. 
He could have announced that he was assembling an international coalition led 
by the United States to make sure that that goal was achieved by 2005. He didn't. 
It never occurred to him. 
<P>On Oct. 15, the United Nations said progress toward reducing world hunger had 
stalled. The U.N.'s Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization issued a report 
entitled <I>The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2002. </I>It says more than 
nine million people die each year from hunger. Six million of them are children 
under the age of five. Mr. Bush addressed the United Nations a few days earlier. 
The report would have been available to him had he asked. He could have announced 
that he was assembling an international coalition to fight hunger and to make 
sure that the number of people dying from starvation around the world would be 
reduced by half within five years. He didn't. 
<P>Instead of saying those things he said: "While the U.S. will constantly strive 
to enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate to 
act alone." He was not referring to the herculean task of providing water, food, 
condoms and sanitation to Third World countries. He did not say that he would 
call upon the American people to make whatever sacrifices might be needed to accomplish 
those goals because that way, and that way alone, we could show the world that 
we were a compassionate people and that way, and not by force, could we defang 
the terrorists. 
<P>Instead he said that if the international coalition did not support us he would 
act alone to impose his view of how the world should be, by armed force if necessary. 
<P>According to a fact sheet from the United States Mission to the United Nations, 
on Oct. 11 Mr. Bush said: "Ultimately, one of the best weapons, one of the truest 
weapons that we have against terrorism is to show the world the true strength 
of character and kindness of the American people." Those comments, coupled with 
his planned attack on Iraq, demonstrate that what he lacks in compassion he makes 
up for with a keen sense of humor. The people who get killed in his unilateral 
war will probably not quite get it. Neither will many of the rest of us.
