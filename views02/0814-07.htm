<p> GAZA CITY -- There is a bouquet of plastic purple flowers in the center of 
a cheap wooden table. It’s easier to stare at it than into the faces of either 
of the men speaking. The air is suffocatingly hot -- no breeze passes through 
the half-open window. I’m thirsty but won’t drink the orange soda our host passes 
around in paper cups. 
<p>We want to see Israel’s blood. 
<p>Fayiz and Muhammad Shehadeh trade turns almost shouting their anger at the 
lawyer and human rights activists who’ve come to ask for sworn affidavits. Their 
brother, Salah Shehadeh, one of the leaders of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassem brigades, 
the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), was the target of 
the July 22nd bombing in which fourteen others died, nine of them children, when 
a two thousand pound bomb obliterated the two-story apartment building in a crowded 
residential area in Gaza City just before midnight. 
<p>I’ve come to hear what these two brothers have to say, though among ourselves—workers 
for the <a href="http://www.mezan.org/" target="_new">Mezan Center for Human Rights</a>—we 
know that their testimony is the least important, despite the high profile of 
their now-dead brother. A war crimes trial must center on the innocent who died 
or whose lives were destroyed in order to be successful, not on the venomous hatred 
of a man and his supporters who knowingly sent boys to blow themselves up in places 
also populated with innocent civilians. 
<p>Muhammad continues his speech. 
<p>We won’t have anything to do with your affidavits. We won’t sign anything. 
We don’t want a trial. We know about European justice. Look at Belgium. Will Sharon 
be tried for his war crimes? Will the victims of Sabra and Shatila ever rest in 
peace? Will the survivors ever see justice done in their names? What about Israel’s 
war against our people every day? Who cares about the United Nations? Count how 
many resolutions have passed against Israel’s criminal behavior. What have they 
accomplished? Who cares? The United States? The US, with its massive arms sales 
to Israel every year? The European Union that sits there and does nothing no matter 
how many pleas for intervention on behalf of our people it receives? Do you think 
your stupid, bureaucratic papers will make one bit of difference to the people 
suffering under Israel’s domination? Do you think they will stop being hungry? 
Do you think it will give them jobs? Do you think their humiliation will end? 
Do you think Israel will stop killing them whenever it wants? You can take your 
papers and your British Colonialist lawyer and get out of here. We know what Israel 
understands. Israel understands blood and power. Nothing else. 
<p>The tirade ends and more cold drinks are offered. No real offense to you guys 
for trying, you see. But we want to make our position clear. 
<p>It’s clear. I hear it today as clearly as I heard it then. The words are still 
ringing in my ears and I want to protest, but I have no grounds. They are the 
angriest, truest words I have heard this summer. When I walked amid the rubble 
of the blasted building and young boys followed me shaking a basket full of missile 
remains and saying, “Made in America” I remember feeling only shame. Is it any 
surprise that so many people have lost all confidence in the international democratic 
legal institutions set up presumably on their behalf? Where is justice each day 
when the sadists of the occupation are stripping another man of his clothes in 
front of his son? When they are daily detaining hundreds sitting in sweltering 
taxis at the Deir al-Balah checkpoint –people trying to get to work or to school, 
or just trying to return home? When their tanks are rolling up the streets of 
Rafah or Beit Lahia firing at anything that moves terrifying children, many of 
whom are malnourished and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder? When 
their loudspeakers are arrogantly broadcasting yet another 24-hour curfew? “Mamnua 
Tajawwal; Mamnua Tajawwal” (It’s forbidden to go out). 
<p>Should we be proud to know that the F16s and Apache and Blackhawk helicopters 
that fly overhead in Gaza every day terrorizing a population of a million and 
a half prisoners are made in the United States? Is it gratifying that the state-of-the-art 
US military technology for which American taxpayers fork over billions every year 
are used to murder, wound, subjugate, humiliate, ruin, and dispossess people all 
over the world? 
<p>Leaving the home of the Shehadeh brothers, we are assaulted by the hot, desert 
wind again. The sand and dust clings to our faces mingling with our sweat. There 
is little to talk about. I know that the families who lost children, mothers, 
fathers, cousins, on that terrible night in July will never see justice –anymore 
than will the families who lose their sons, fathers, mothers, and daughters at 
the hands of the Occupation Forces every day in the Gaza Strip. Worse, I know 
that nobody cares. 
<p>Just days later more tanks roll into the city to destroy metal workshops, or 
“bomb factories” as the Israeli forces call them. This happens twice while I’m 
living in Gaza City this summer. Never mind that people’s livelihoods have been 
ruined; that more unemployed will line up for international food aid. These places 
contained the materials used for making bombs, so they must be destroyed. No one 
questions this logic. –Like banning lead pencils going into Iraq. Who knows to 
what sinister use a pencil might be put?? 
<p>I have little doubt that some of the materials in those metal workshops did 
indeed end up in the hands of homemade explosives experts. Does this justify destroying 
a man’s entire business? How long do we accept that a regional military superpower 
has the right to smash the lives of the people whose land it occupies each day, 
but that these people have no right to self-defense? I ponder this for a while 
and find myself thinking I’d rather not see both peoples armed. I’d rather see 
them both disarmed. But imagine the outrage, the indignation, the self-righteous 
ire of those whose military toy boxes come under threat. Imagine the look on the 
faces of the beneficiaries of our huge murder corporations when foreign tanks 
roll into Fort Worth, Texas or Mesa, Arizona or Hartford, Ct. to demolish the 
mega-metal workshops called Lockheed Martin or Boeing or United Technologies. 
<p>Sorry, you can’t have any more Blackhawk helicopters, no more F16 fighter jets 
or AGM air-to-ground missiles. No more Hellfire anti-tank missiles or Apache Longbow 
helicopters. Goodbye to the F100-PW-229 aircraft engines, adios low altitude navigation 
targeting infrared night systems. Tanks, don’t forget to stop in Lexington, Mass 
to put an end to Raytheon’s AN-TPQ-37 Firefinder counterbattery radar systems 
and their Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles. Move on to Fairfax, Virginia 
to halt the production of ExxonMobil’s JP-8 aviation jet fuel. Move south to Orlando, 
Florida to wipe out PGSUS LLC’s Standoff Attack Missiles, and then backtrack to 
Oshkosh, Wisconsin where the Oshkosh Truck Corporation is producing and selling 
Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks. The list goes on and on. The profits 
and the price tags for these items more jaw dropping than the items themselves. 
<p>The news bulletin might give us pause if worded correctly. “Metal workshops 
throughout the United States fired on and bulldozed this afternoon after it was 
determined that they contained the materials used to produce Weapons of Mass Destruction.” 
<p>I think the rest of the world might sleep more peacefully that night.
