IN NEARLY 20 years of speaking and writing about nonviolence, Rusty 
Nelson has grown accustomed to skepticism and challenge. These days, the 
climate for his message is about as open and hospitable as a bayonet.
<P>"So many people are as anxious as John Ashcroft for everybody to just shut 
up and go along with what the president says," said the 57-year-old Vietnam 
veteran. "That's what's really scary about all of this."
<P>Director of the Peace and Justice Action League of Spokane, Wash., Nelson 
recently was disinvited from speaking to the class of a public high school 
teacher I know in rural Washington.
<P>Said my friend, who shall remain anonymous: "Both my principal and the 
superintendent said the topic of nonviolence was too controversial now, a real 
hot potato that would cause trouble. They said the only way the students would 
be allowed to hear him was if I also invited an extreme hawk to speak so it 
would be a 'balanced' presentation. I told them the kids already hear plenty 
from the other side -- everyday on TV, in the paper, from the White House. It 
didn't matter."
<P>Like a lot of us, my friend knows she is not the only American who has 
declined to march in lockstep for the war on terrorism. But sometimes, she 
said, when she called to talk about Nelson, it sure feels that way.
<P>For his part, Nelson was disappointed at the disinvitation, but not 
surprised. A Veteran's Day speech he gave in another public high school near 
the Idaho border ended with a faculty member -- a retired military officer -- 
calling him a liar and the school's principal sending letters of apology to 
the students' parents.
<P>"I'd told them about another vet I knew, who came home from Vietnam and 
killed himself. I talked about the futility of war, the unused element of 
nonviolence, about how we passed on diplomacy," said Nelson. "I'd given a 
similar speech before at a Unitarian church. The reaction was a lot different."
<P>Nelson's path to pacifism was slow and not without irony.
<P>"My dad was a Navy chaplain, I was in R.O.T.C. in college in South Carolina 
and went to Vietnam with an Army mobile marine force," he said. "Some of that 
footage from 'Apocalypse Now' looks pretty familiar."
<P>Vietnam itself caused no immediate epiphanies:
<P>"I bought the Domino Theory, hook, line and sinker. Once I got there and 
saw the reality though, I remember thinking, 'Boy it would really be a waste 
if I got killed over here for this.' "
<P>Now, "the bitterness I have over Vietnam is from not ever hearing about 
nonviolence before I went. It was like I didn't have all the cards. Nobody (in 
authority) ever challenged the rightness of what was being done; it was just 
what our country was doing."
<P>Anti-war protesters, he said, "just seemed like strange people, far away 
from South Carolina or where I grew up in Georgia."
<P>By the time Nelson and his wife Nancy moved to Spokane from her native 
Minnesota, both knew plenty about nonviolence. Joining a Mennonite Church 
community set them off in a direction that has defined their lives and 30-year 
marriage.
<P>"I didn't consider myself a pacifist, it just made sense, politically and 
spiritually," said Nelson. "It was the right thing to do."
<P>Now grandparents, thanks to their two adopted children (who are African 
American, unlike Nancy and Rusty), the Nelsons work part-time jobs to pay the 
bills and split duties at the Peace and Justice Action League.
<P>Does the current national climate of intolerance for dissent cause Nelson 
to despair?
<P>"I have my moments," he said. "The scary thing is, we haven't hit bottom 
yet. While I do feel the pendulum is going to swing back the other way -- I 
hear from too many kindred spirits out there who are courageous and articulate 
about the distortions of this war -- I just don't know how low we can go 
before we start rising."
