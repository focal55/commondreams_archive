<p> The picture that has emerged from the chaos of Washington over the 
past several days is a gruesome one. While evidence steadily grows of 
a gross failure to prepare, despite overwhelming reason to do so, for 
the possibility of terrorist attacks, the Bush administration has 
been shameless in its frenzied efforts to evade responsibility and 
prevent the American public from seeking the truth. 

<p>While National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice approached the press 
with a thirty-seven minute spiel that repeated the word 'general' or 
'generalized' nineteen times in reference to prior warnings of 
terrorist threats, Vice President Dick Cheney laid down a 
thinly-veiled threat to "my democratic friends in Congress," warning 
that "they need to be very cautious not to seek political advantage 
by making incendiary suggestions" that the White House had 
information which could have prevented the tragedy of September 11.

<p>A chorus of administration apologists were quick to respond that 
calls for investigation were, as Cheney suggested, "thoroughly 
irresponsible and totally unworthy of national leaders in times of 
war." Trent Lott accused dissidents of "talking like our enemy is 
George W. Bush and not Osama bin Laden," while Senator Christopher S. 
Bond explained that "the real story here is a bunch of Democrats 
stumbling for anything to put a dent in the president's popularity."

<p>However, these words ring suspiciously hollow to those who, 
rightfully frightened of further terrorist attacks, expect the Bush 
administration to learn from its mistakes instead of hiding them -- 
and these mistakes are becoming more glaring every day.

<p>An intelligence summary given to Condoleeza Rice on June 28 stated 
"it is highly likely that a significant al Qaeda attack is in the 
near future, within several weeks." On July 5, a month and a day 
before President Bush's now-infamous briefing on possible al Qaeda 
hijacking, Richard Clarke, the government's top counterterrorism 
official, warned that "something spectacular is going to happen here, 
and it's going to happen soon." Unlike the July 10 FBI memo about 
suspicious activity in Arizona flight schools, all this was common 
knowledge within the White House -- and raises the question of why, 
when the President received the report of August 6, he was on a 
"working vacation" at his ranch in Texas.   

<p>"I knew [Osama bin Laden] was a menace and I knew he was a problem," 
Bush later said in a Washington Post interview. "But I didn't feel 
that sense of urgency." 

<p>The indifference of our President in the face of such clear warning 
seems inexplicable. So does his assertion that "never did we realize 
that the enemy was so well organized," that al Qaeda "struck in a way 
that was unimaginable." Rice verified this, saying that "I don't 
think anyone could have predicted that . . . they would try to use an 
airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a missile." But the 
organization of al Qaeda had been demonstrated numerous times, and 
the use of airplanes as bombs imagined. Exactly two years before the 
September 11 attacks, a federal report warned that "suicide bombers 
belonging to al-Qaida's martyrdom battalion could crash-land an 
aircraft packed with high explosives . . . into the Pentagon, the 
headquarters of the CIA, the White House."

<p>Given all this, it is unlikely that any amount of Administration 
resistance will stop the investigations, and it is only a matter of 
time before the press seizes on an FBI budget submitted by Attorney 
General John Ashcroft on September 10.

<p>Coming one day after Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld threatened 
presidential veto of the Senate's proposed diversion of $600 million 
to counterterrorism from ballistic missile defense, Ashcroft's budget 
was decidedly cavalier about the prospect of terrorism. According to 
a February 28 New York Times article, Ashcroft identified over one 
dozen objectives more important than fighting terrorism, and rejected 
an FBI request of $58 million for counterterrorism field agents, 
intelligence analysts, and translators. In fact, he proposed cuts in 
fourteen programs, including a $65 million cut for state and local 
counterterrorism programs. By contrast, counterterrorism spending 
under Janet Reno increased by over 25% from 1999 to 2001.   

<p>The September 10 FBI budget is a perfect symbol of the Bush 
administration's failure to prepare for a wave of terrorism that even 
then was accepted as inevitable and imminent. Their repeated denials 
of specific foreknowledge of September 11 are misleading -- the real 
issue is an irresponsibility bordering on the criminal, akin to a 
landlord who knew his building was going to burn yet failed to buy 
fire extinguishers. Administration backpedaling suddenly looks an 
attempt to cover their tracks. 

<p>This, along with a practical appreciation for the value of a 
dissent-free atmosphere in carrying out policies and retaining power, 
has been the Bush administration's guiding mentality, and it is 
making itself obvious in their rabid attempts to stifle the latest 
debates. It is more than investigation of possible counterterrorism 
oversight that they are resisting. They are resisting the erosion of 
the dissent-free culture of political orthodoxy that has dominated 
this nation's for the last eight months -- and it comes not a moment 
too soon.

<p>The President who couldn't even name the leader of Pakistan has 
embarked on a foreign-policy nightmare. America has allied itself 
with a number of flagrantly undemocratic nations, from Uzbekistan to 
Malaysia. Evidence emerges almost daily of our probable role in an 
aborted coup in Venezuela, while our support of a brutal civil war in 
Columbia resembles the early years of Vietnam. One and a half million 
troops are massed at the India-Pakistan border, ready to plunge the 
Indian subcontinent into chaos. War with Iraq looms. The situation in 
Israel and Palestine threatens to destabilize the entire region, and 
our policies in the Holy Land risk birthing a new generation of 
anti-American terrorists. 

<p>Meanwhile, the Bush administration has revived talk of using nuclear 
weapons on a first-strike basis, overturned the 1972 Anti-Ballistic 
Missile treaty, declined to sign a biological weapons treaty, hid our 
own production of biological weapons, refused to recognize 
International Criminal Court, held up the World Council on Children, 
and -- after rejecting the Kyoto Accords -- replaced the head of the 
International Panel on Climate Change. Domestically, we have an 
energy policy written by the same people responsible for staging an 
energy 'crisis' that cost the state of California $30 billion. The 
denial of public inquiry into the matter was justified with an 
invocation of, more or less, the divine right of kings -- fitting, 
perhaps, given the administration's disregard of the Constitution in 
the name of fighting terrorism.

<p>To top it all off, contrary to Bush's campaign promises, our budget 
deficit is at least $121 billion -- and, according to a note from 
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill in our government's 2001 financial 
report, it may actually run to <i>half a trillion dollars.</i>

<p>The time has come to lift the star-spangled shroud of silence that 
has hidden the affairs of our nation.
