Private borrowing was the engine for the U.S. economy during the 1990s, as 
the decade ended with the federal budget in surplus.  And the current 
recession will be a year old this March.  What to do?  We turn our attention 
to President Bush.

<p>“We need a plan to lengthen unemployment benefits, we need a plan to shorten 
the recession,” the president said in his recent radio broadcast.

<p>Some 1.2 million Americans have been fired during the past 10 months, with 
another million driven into part-time work, the Wall Street Journal recently 
reported, citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The official 
Dec. jobless rate was 5.8 percent, up from a revised Nov. rate of 5.6 
percent.

<p>The president faults Senate Democrats for blocking his economic recovery 
plan.

<p>Democrat Tom Daschle, Senate majority leader, took a different view of 
Bush’s plan, while supporting his war in Afghanistan.  For example, Daschle 
criticized the president’s $1.35 trillion income-tax cut for removing the 
federal government’s “flexibility.”  His tax cut has worsened the recession 
and is leading to a projected federal deficit that will hinder an economic 
revival, Daschle added.

<p>On one hand, federal deficit spending is supposed to be the wrong policy to 
help the economy grow. Presumably, public borrowing is a bad thing.  Case in 
point is the Clinton administration’s success in sustaining growth and 
creating a federal budget surplus that emerged in 1997.  Some claim that 
this improved the prospects for long-term interest rates.

<p>On the other hand, the engine of the American economy last decade was 
private debt.  Consumers and corporations doubled their debt in the 1990s.  
How?  Lots of foreign money flowed into America, attracted partly by the 
high value of the dollar.  Overseas financing enabled the U.S. economy to be 
the “consumer of the last resort,” thus keeping the global market system 
afloat.

<p>Then America went into recession last March.  National economies that relied 
on U.S. corporations and consumers buying their exports with borrowed money 
began to sink.  As global economic activity led by  America contracted, 
business investment began to decline.  Consequently, payrolls shrank.  U.S. 
workers had less income.  Their ability to repay and take on more debt (the 
linchpin of expansion in the 1990s) also fell.

<p>In the meantime, hope was high that monetary policy would maintain U.S. 
economic growth.  But cutting the cost to borrow money has proven to be an 
inefficient form of economic stimulus, at best.  In 2001, the Federal 
Reserve cut interest rates roughly once a month.  Growth has not been 
forthcoming.

<p>What of federal deficit spending to stimulate the U.S. economy?  If not now, 
one wonders when absent monetary policy to stimulate a recovery in 2002?

<p>Meanwhile, for millions of Americans seeing unemployment rise as part-time 
work grows and full-time jobs shrink, such questions take on a special 
urgency.  Those out of a job before the recession began are increasingly off 
the political radar screen.  What will it take for Democrats and Republicans 
to wake up and legislate as if the American people mattered?
