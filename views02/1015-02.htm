<p>The world has every right to feel angry. Not just with the perpetrators of 
the Saturday night massacre in Bali, but with the governments who vowed to wage 
a "war on terror" which would make attacks like it less likely. 
<P>Of course, no one is accusing our leaders of having a chance to prevent this 
act of mass murder and deliberately failing to take it. (No one, that is, except 
the conspiracy obsessives of radical Islamism, already spreading the word that 
Saturday's bombers were US agents, seeking to justify and intervention.) 
<P>But there is much western governments promised to do after 9/11 which would 
at least have obstructed the path of the men who plotted evil last weekend. Washington 
called it a "war on terror" and, with remarkably little resistance, most of the 
world's people either signed up for it or acquiesced in it. Prevention of horrors 
like Saturday's was the new strategy's primary purpose. Yet all too little of 
that "war" effort has actually materialized.
<P>This new global gameplan was meant to have two core elements at least according 
to its British advocates. First would be a ruthless, unblinking pursuit of al-Qaida. 
In the pained weeks that followed the attacks on New York and Washington, citizens 
in the US and beyond imagined the full force of the state - its army, police and 
the complete battery of its secret services - deployed against the new enemy. 
Nothing would be allowed to distract from this goal. If that meant unholy alliances, 
so be it. If that meant temporarily shelving other foreign policy interests, OK: 
hunting down Osama bin Laden and his henchmen was to be the sole priority. 
<P>On this view, Afghanistan was merely the beginning. Uprooting the al-Qaida 
bases that had mushroomed there was necessary, but hardly sufficient. The whole 
terrifying point about al-Qaida was that it was not located in one targetable 
territory, neatly confined to one set of borders. Instead it had spread like a 
vapor to as many as 50 countries, with up to 100,000 militants ready for action. 
Bombing a few camps would hardly reach this enemy at all. 
<P>The only way to fight this new fire was with new fire. Since al-Qaida's methods 
were not those of a conventional army, the response would have to be equally unconventional. 
The military analyst Martin van Creveld had warned a decade earlier of "asymmetric 
war" and now the world understood what he meant. He urged armies to put aside 
their ships and rockets, and take on the enemy on its own terrain. The soldiers 
of al-Qaida did not march in columns on battlefields but wore jeans, rented apartments 
and posed as students in Hamburg, Brixton and Florida. To win, our soldiers would 
have to learn a new language of combat. 
<P>Last weekend's atrocity has only underlined the tricky, slippery nature of 
the new enemy. No one is even sure if Bali was an al-Qaida operation or, for that 
matter, whether such thing as an "al-Qaida operation" even exists. The Indonesian 
government says it was, noting the expertise required to trigger a series of simultaneous 
explosions - a know how only al-Qaida could possess. Others are doubtful, insisting 
that Bin Laden's men tend to prefer military, political or culturally iconic targets. 
It is the homegrown Indonesian Jemaah Islamiyah which hits nightclubs and similar 
symbols of "western decadence". 
<P>Even if it was the Jemaah group, there might still be an al-Qaida link. It 
could be subtle, with al-Qaida acting as an inspiration rather than as direct 
command. This is one more reason why al-Qaida represents such a formidable foe: 
it is not an organization in the western sense at all. It may just be an animating 
idea, spreading fast throughout the Islamic world. 
<P>Which brings us to the second prong of the war on terror many of us thought 
we signed up to a year ago. This held that if al-Qaida was truly to be defeated, 
killing or arresting its activists would not do the trick: lopping off a head 
today would only make another grow tomorrow. Every counter-terrorist struggle 
in the world, from Algiers to Belfast, had taught the same lesson: in the end, 
there can be no military victory over an enemy which enjoys even a limited degree 
of popular support. Instead, there has to be political action. Not an attempt 
to compromise with the killers - Bin-Laden is hardly demanding roundtable talks 
- but to win over the constituency that offers them tacit backing: to drain the 
sea in which they swim. 
<P>Taken together, these two elements amounted to a strategy that was tough on 
terror, tough on the causes of terror. The west would pursue Al-Qaida operatives, 
even as it moved to address the grievances which made too many in the Muslim world 
rally to Bin-Laden's flag. 
<P>That meant, among other things, a new alternative energy strategy, aimed eventually 
at weaning the west off oil. No longer would the US and others need to manipulate 
the Middle East just to safeguard their petrol supply. They could let the peoples 
of the Arab world choose their own governments for once. The US would move its 
troops out of Saudi Arabia, healing one of the sores Bin-Laden most likes to inflame: 
the presence of "infidels" on holy Muslim soil. And Washington would pick up where 
Clinton left off, devoting serious political muscle to the Israeli-Palestinian 
peace process. Genuine movement in that area would instantly rob the Islamists 
of one of their greatest recruiting pitches. 
<P>Who knows what impact all that might have had? We certainly don't, because 
it has hardly been tried. Nor has the military component of the war on terror 
fared much better. Bin-Laden was allowed to vanish, along with the Taliban leader 
Mullah Omar, who escaped the wrath of the mightiest army in the world on board 
a clapped-out motorbike. The jump-suited captives at Camp X-Ray appear too low-level 
to have much useful to say. Nor do the US intelligence agencies inspire much confidence: 
they remain at war with each other while their political masters tend to hear 
only what they want to hear. 
<P>None of this is a surprise. For the prosecutors of the war on terror - who 
promised to focus like a laser beam - have let their eye wander. Like the rulers 
of Orwell's 1984, our leaders have urged us to switch our hatred overnight not 
from Eastasia to Eurasia but from al-Qaida to Baghdad. Now we are to believe Saddam 
is the urgent, number one priority. 
<P>Bali has proved why that is a woeful error. A war on Iraq will win yet more 
backing for jihadism in the Muslim world, apparently concerning all Bin Laden's 
most lurid predictions of a clash of west against Islam. A prolonged US occupation 
of Iraq will be the greatest provocation yet. But it will also be a distraction 
from the struggle we were all urged to join a year ago. Bali has proved what Clinton 
argued a fortnight ago: that radical Islamism remains the "most pressing" threat 
in the world today. Clinton gets that. The only question is, does Tony Blair? 
And if he does, is he telling George W Bush?</p>
