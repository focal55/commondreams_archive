<p> "Wars and rumors of wars" goes a phrase from a verse in the New Testament. 
These days we have both. But of late we seem to be hearing much more of the rumors 
of war --against Iraq -- than we do reports about the war on terrorism. </p>
<p>The nearly daily rumors of war against Iraq are deeply troubling. Let us acknowledge 
the obvious: Saddam Hussein is a malevolent force in the volatile Middle East, 
a leader who is guilty of heinous acts. But this seems a case where the old childhood 
adage applies. "Two wrongs don't make a right." In my book it remains wrong to 
invade a nation that has not attacked our country or our allies.</p>
<p>As the rumors mount and the drumbeat for war grows louder, there are a host 
of specific questions to be asked and answered. For openers, what really is the 
case against Saddam? That is, what do we know about his capacities and intentions? 
What real evidence is there that Saddam and his regime constitute an imminent 
threat to the American people or our allies?</p>
<p>We have heard the cryptic slogan-like accusations. "This is a man who has poisoned 
his own people." "He is secretly developing weapons of mass destruction." "He 
has violated U.N. mandates." But these are more slogans than a convincing or substantive 
case for a war that would not only put American lives at risk but that would further 
jeopardize the already sorely tested and traumatized people of Iraq. </p>
<p>Second, the administration has given no indication that it will seek a constitutionally 
required Declaration of War from Congress. The intent of such a requirement is, 
at least in part, that a convincing case be made for such a drastic course of 
action as invading another country or going to war. Yes, some elements of secrecy 
are lost in such open deliberations and proceedings. But I thought that was the 
point, that we do things differently here.</p>
<p>When we turn to the ethical tradition of the Christian faith, other important 
questions arise from the Augustinian doctrine of just war. This set of teachings 
attempts to describe the conditions that must be met if a Christian is to take 
part in what is always an unholy yet sometimes unavoidable military action.</p>
<p>I will not attempt here to consider each of the criteria that the just war 
tradition holds forth. But ponder this one. For a war to be considered "just," 
all other available means of resolving conflict have been tried and exhausted. 
A recent article in "The Christian Century" magazine cites the work of George 
Lopez and his colleagues at the University of Notre Dame. Lopez has outlined a 
three-part strategy to contain Saddam without military action.</p>
<p>"The first step is to revise U.N. sanctions to tighten controls on Iraq's oil 
revenues and military-related goods while easing restrictions on civilian economic 
activity. The second is to bring back U.N. weapons inspectors to complete the 
U.N. disarmament mandate and re-establish an Ongoing Monitoring and Verification 
system. Finally, in the event that Iraq refuses to allow weapons inspections, 
create a border monitoring and control system."</p>
<p>Beyond the questions of substantive and compelling evidence of an Iraqi threat, 
processes of deliberation in duly constituted bodies and exhausting other means 
to resolve a conflict, the largest looming question here is the matter of U.S. 
moral authority. If we do not hold ourselves to high moral standards there is 
nothing left but "might makes right," and that really does mean a world of fear 
and brutality for all.</p>
<p>Moral authority does not derive from bravado, nor is it grounded in the impulse 
toward revenge. Since Sept. 11 there has been some of both, but really surprisingly 
little. By and large, the American people have responded with decency and restraint. 
Still, one can understand and forgive a certain amount of bravado and appeal to 
emotion from the person on the street, but not from the person in the White House.</p>
<p>Moral authority does derive from a capacity for self-criticism, for honest 
self-examination. It derives from the ability to apply the values and judgments 
made of others to oneself. It derives from the capacity to discern the power of 
self-interest to warp and distort one's judgment and actions.</p>
<p>Two generations ago the great American theologian, Reinhold Niebuhr, wrote: 
"Moral pride is the pretension of finite man that his highly conditioned virtue 
is the final righteousness and that his very relative moral standards are absolute." 
In matters of war and rumors of war, one wants a leader who has doubts, who is 
not absolutely sure of himself. Having doubts does not mean being paralyzed into 
inaction. It means recognizing one's own capacity for self-deception. </p>
<p>The president has set a course for which he ought to remain resolute -- taking 
seriously the reality and threat of terrorism. But this course will be defensible 
only if the United States does not make of it a license for unilateral adventurism. 
Moreover, launching war on Iraq seems a sure way to recruit more to the terrorist 
cause.</p>
<p>An unprovoked U.S. invasion of Iraq may -- at its best, and there's no assurance 
of such an outcome at all -- provide a short-term solution. But this short-term 
solution will squander the moral authority that must be the basis of our long-term 
hope and leadership at this crucial and precarious moment in the world's history.</p>
