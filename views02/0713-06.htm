<p>The US has historically been one of the most resolute advocates of the Rule 
of Law. However, current trends indicate that it is moving dangerously towards 
completely shunning this approach, resulting in US reliance on Rule of Force as 
the principal means for solving global conflicts. While on the one hand the US 
disavows current obligations under international law and refuses to participate 
in new international legal mechanisms, it expects other countries to adhere to 
such laws and to US directives. Continued US attempts to increase its military 
domination combined with its withdrawal from international legal processes are 
eroding national and international security in an already unstable and unbalanced 
international environment. 
<p><b>Security in the Post-September 11th World </b> 
<p>President Bush has used September 11th to define a new dichotomy dividing states-the 
states with the US and the states for terror-an overly simplistic dichotomy that 
had been missing since the dissolution of the USSR and the end of the Cold War. 
In the aftermath of September 11th, the US made an appeal to the international 
community to join in the fight against terrorism. On the surface, the anti-terrorism 
campaign initially offered a chance for many countries, including countries subsequently 
labeled by the Bush administration as part of an "axis of evil," to realign themselves 
to be on more friendly terms with the US. 
<p>As a result, many countries have changed their political priorities, diverting 
large amounts of resources and attention to the US-led war on terrorism. Furthermore, 
many countries in critical regions such as the Middle East, South Asia and North 
East Asia are following the US example, countering domestic and regional disputes 
with force and rejecting multilateral diplomacy and arms control. In fact, the 
war on terrorism has only added fuel to fire in escalating regional crises. 
<p>September 11th also reinvigorated concerns about the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction and their means of delivery. There are legitimate fears regarding 
terrorists acquiring or making nuclear, chemical, biological or radiological weapons. 
However, the US-led response to these fears has been to offer solutions that would 
counter rather than prevent proliferation. 
<p><b>New Nuclear Policy: First Strike </b> 
<p>Serious concerns about US plans were raised this year when portions of the 
classified US Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) that was released to Congress in January 
2002 leaked to the media in March. Despite treaty commitments to reduce its reliance 
on nuclear weapons, the NPR reaffirms the role of nuclear weapons in US national 
security policy. In the past, nuclear weapons have been viewed as a deterrent 
against the use of nuclear weapons. However, the NPR reveals that the US intends 
to integrate nuclear weapons into a full spectrum of war-fighting capabilities, 
including missile defenses. The NPR unveils that nuclear weapons are no longer 
weapons of last resort, but instruments that could be used in fighting wars. The 
NPR also raises the possible resumption by the US of full-scale nuclear testing 
and plans to develop and deploy new "earth-penetrating" nuclear weapons. 
<p>Furthermore, the NPR calls for the development of contingency plans to use 
nuclear weapons against seven states-Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, North Korea, Russia 
and China-constituting a disturbing threat in particular to the named states and 
in general to international peace and security. Contrary to long-standing US assurances 
not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States, five of these named states 
are non-nuclear states. 
<p>The Bush administration announced in June that it will release a document outlining 
a strategy of striking first. The doctrine will be incorporated into the National 
Security Strategy that will be released in Fall 2002. President George W. Bush 
argues that the US needs such a strategy in order to counter "terrorists and tyrants," 
a phrase that encompasses both states and non-state actors, because Cold War policies 
of deterrence and containment do not fit the post-September 11th world. The argument 
also extends a justification for developing new low-yield, earth-penetrating nuclear 
weapons that could be used preemptively to destroy deeply buried targets and bunkers. 
While there remains an opportunity to address the prospect of terrorism from weapons 
of mass destruction (WMD) and legitimate concerns about WMD and missile proliferation, 
this opportunity is being rapidly squandered. When the US reserves to itself the 
right to strike first with nuclear weapons, it relinquishes the moral high ground 
and the right to tell other nations to give up their weapons of mass destruction. 
<p><b>Arms Control: Significant Nuclear Reductions or Maximum Nuclear Flexibility? 
</b> 
<p>Presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin signed the Strategic Offensive 
Reductions Treaty between the US and the Russia during a summit in Moscow on 23 
May. The treaty calls for the reduction of strategic forces of each country's 
arsenal to 1,700 to 2,200 by 2012, the year in which the treaty expires. It also 
does not require the destruction of a single missile launcher or warhead and each 
side can carry out the reductions at its own pace and even reverse them to temporarily 
build up its forces. In other words, the treaty allows either side to worry more 
about protecting their own nuclear options than constraining the options of the 
other country. A senior US administration official stated, "What we have now agreed 
to do under the treaty is what we wanted to do anyway. That's our kind of treaty." 
<p>Under the terms of the treaty, either side can temporarily suspend reductions 
or even build up forces without violating the treaty. This will allow maximum 
flexibility to the US, which insists on continuing to rely on nuclear weapons 
in its national security policy. The US Nuclear Posture Review, released in January 
2002, stated, "In the event that US relations with Russia significantly worsen 
in the future, the US may need to revise its nuclear force level and posture." 
The new treaty will allow the US to do so. Rather than completely destroying the 
strategic weapons, the US has repeatedly stated that it will shelve or stockpile 
the warheads. 
<p><b>Abdicating Law </b> 
<p>The alternative to a rule-by-force policy is the Rule of Law. Since its founding, 
the US has historically sought to create a legal framework to foster national 
and international security. Under Article VI of the US constitution, "all Treaties 
made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall 
be the supreme Law of the Land." A treaty becomes US law when two-thirds of the 
US Senate give "advice and consent" to its ratification. Although treaties may 
not be perfect, they are critical to articulating and codifying global norms and 
standards. Among other things, treaties contribute to national and international 
security by establishing mechanisms to enforce articulated norms, measure progress, 
and promote accountability, transparency, and confidence building measures between 
countries. 
<p>Although US support for international law and institutions slowly began to 
decline as the 20th century progressed, since the Clinton administration, the 
US has been more hostile toward international law and international legal mechanisms. 
And the trend has only accelerated during the Bush administration. Under the Clinton 
administration, the US refused to sign the Treaty Banning Anti-Personnel Mines 
(Landmines Treaty); the Senate failed to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty 
(CTBT); and the US attempted to obstruct completion of the Rome Statute to create 
an International Criminal Court (ICC), although Clinton did sign this Treaty at 
the final moment. Since President Bush took office, among other actions demonstrating 
its disdain for international law, the US has: 
<p> 
<ul>
<li>withdrawn from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty; <br>
</li>
<li>resisted the idea of a standardized procedure for reporting on nuclear disarmament 
obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and, in fact, increased the 
role of nuclear weapons in US national security policy; <br>
</li>
<li>sought to terminate the process to promote compliance with the Biological 
Weapons Convention (BWC); <br>
</li>
<li>spurned proposals from Russia and China to ban weapons in Outer Space and 
Space-based weapons; </li>
<li>withdrawn its signature from the International Criminal Court Treaty; <br>
</li>
<li>withdrawn its support for the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, even though 
it played a key role in its creation. <br>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Conclusions </b> 
<p>The shift in US policy to rely on force first and consider itself above law 
is detrimental to its own security as well as to international insecurity. Unless 
this process is reversed and unless the US begins to cooperate with other countries 
to ensure a global Rule of Law above the Rule of Force, international disorder 
will gain ground
