<p>Didn't have anything good to do earlier this week, so decided to spend the day at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI).

<p>AEI is the granddaddy of the big corporate front groups.  Their job?

<p>Re-engineer the political economy to the liking of their corporate paymasters.

<p>Last year, AEI took in $23 million from corporations, corporate foundations, and wealthy individuals.

<p>Need to undermine the antitrust laws?

<p>Hire AEI scholar in residence Robert Bork to spew his ideology.

<p>Need to slander the United Nations?

<p>Hire AEI scholar in residence Jeanne Kirkpatrick to do the dirty work.

<p>AEI, Heritage, and Cato, the big three corporate fronts in our nation's capital, have done immeasurable damage to our democracy, advancing corporatist and extremist right-wing views.

<p>We wanted to know: is it the power of their ideas, or is it their power?

<p>After spending a day at AEI, we suspect it's the latter.

<p>In the morning, we caught a session titled: Europe: Anti-Semitism Resurgent?

<p>Looked around the audience. There was Bork. There was Kirkpatrick.

<p>They were there to listen to what was supposed to be a debate between two right-wingers, Ruth Wisse of Harvard University and John O'Sullivan, of United Press International.

<p>But there was little debate.

<p>Everyone agreed that the issue wasn't anti-semitism, as traditionally defined, but anti-Israel views.

<p>In fact, Wisse and O'Sullivan had now effectively redefined the term anti-semitism to mean anti-Israel.

<p>We had suspected this, but didn't get a confirmation until a questioner in the audience asked Wisse about Billy Graham's 1972 conversation with Richard Nixon, memorialized on the White House tapes, and made public earlier this year by the National Archives.

<p>In the conversation, Graham says to Nixon that "a lot of Jews are great friends of mine."

<p>"They swarm around me and are friendly to me," Graham says. "Because they know I am friendly to Israel and so forth. They don't know how I really feel about what they're doing to this country."

<p>And how does he feel?

<p>Graham tells Nixon that the Jews have a "stranglehold" on the country, and "this stranglehold has got to be broken or the country's going down the drain."

<p>"You believe that?" Nixon says.

<p>"Yes, sir," Graham replies.

<p>"Oh boy," Nixon says. "So do I. I can't ever say that but I believe it."

<p>So, the questioner wanted to know whether Professor Wisse considered these sentiments, as expressed by Graham, and widely publicized earlier this year, to be anti-semitic.

<p>No, they are not anti-semitic, Professor Wisse says.

<p>Not anti-semitic?

<p>No, anti-semitism exists today in the form of "political organization" against Israel.

<p>Inference: the religious right in this country, as long as they organize politically to support Israel, can say and think whatever they want about Jews.

<p>Not anti-semitism.

<p>We went for a walk in the rain, a reality check with nature, and then back in to catch another AEI panel, this one titled: "Does Excessive Regulation Threaten Subprime Lending?" featuring Gary Gilmer, the vice chairman of Household International, a finance company which just last week was slapped by a group of state attorneys general for engaging in predatory lending -- basically ripping off the poor with outrageous interest rates and fees.

<p>The company paid $484 million to settle the case.

<p>Household is one of the largest sub-prime lenders in the country.

<p>While sub-prime lenders provide credit to borrowers with damaged credit, some of these lenders have engaged in predatory practices whereby consumers -- even those with good credit -- are targeted to borrow money on disadvantageous terms, including high interest rates, steep bank fees and payments for undisclosed insurance products.

<p>The high costs serve to increase the consumer's debt burden and reduce the equity in the consumer's home.

<p>You would think that the company would have a sense of humility after being so publicly spanked for engaging in such wrongdoing.

<p>But no.

<p>Instead, AEI gives the company's vice chairman a forum to attack the same state laws that his company allegedly violated and that led to the $484 million payment.

<p>Tough state laws that seek to curb predatory lending, like one passed recently in Georgia, have the finance industry in a tizzy.

<p>The finance companies say they are refusing to make loans in Georgia, perhaps as part of a drive to get that law, and other similar laws repealed.

<p>Maybe it's time to simplify the entire legal morass in this area by bringing back the usury laws -- by mandating a simple cap on interest rates.

<p>The usury laws were erased in the early 1980s after a heavy lobbying effort by finance companies like Household.

<p>We raised the possibility of bringing back the usury laws with the AEI panel members, but they unanimously thought it was a bad idea.

<p>We went outside again, to get some fresh air. The rain had turned to a cold drizzle. In anticipation, we returned for the day's final panel, titled In Defense of Empires.

<p>Deepak Lal, a professor at the UCLA, argued that imperialism should not be perceived as a negative phenomenon. Empires provide international order. Empires promote prosperity by integrating separate areas into a common economic space. Empires are good.

<p>After picking up the materials, listening to about 30 minutes of Professor Lal's talk -- with no mention of the violence necessary to create and maintain empires -- we walked out, back into the rain.

<p>And we thought: maybe it is all harmless to talk this way.  It's almost laughable.

<p>Nobody can believe this stuff, can they?
