<p>The topic of Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz's speech Friday 
to the World Affairs Council and Commonwealth Club was "Building the Bridge to 
a More Peaceful Future." The peace envisioned by Wolfowitz is a "Pax Americana,
" where the United States pre-emptively annihilates any would-be regional or 
global challengers. It is a peace that can only be the product of endless war 
against the people of the world and brings to mind previous wars "to end all 
war" and "to make the world safe for democracy."
<P>As the main ideologue behind war on Iraq and the aggressive new doctrine of 
pre-emption and unbridled U.S. military supremacy, Wolfowitz is a key part of 
the inner circle of war planners in the Bush administration. For his extreme 
hawkishness, he has been dubbed "the velociraptor" by the conservative London 
Economist.
<P>Following Sept. 11, Wolfowitz wanted to go after Iraq first. But he was 
initially rebuffed, as there was no credible link between Iraq and al Qaeda. 
Bombing Afghanistan, however, could be positioned as a "just response" to the 
terrorist attacks. The velociraptor's too-candid gaffe about "ending states 
who sponsor terrorism" was a bit over the top. But following the rout of the 
Taliban and the "axis of evil" speech in January, "regime change" was to 
become openly embraced and espoused by President Bush himself, though it has 
been cosmeticized of late to "disarming Iraq" and making Saddam Hussein comply 
with U.N. resolutions.
<P>In fact, the war on Iraq and the new National Security Strategy of pre-
emption and global domination were not created in response to Sept. 11. The 
deaths of thousands of Americans on that day have been used as an opportunity 
to pursue plans that had been in the works since the early 1990s.
<P>The earliest incarnation of the doctrine of pre-emption was the draft 
Defense Planning Guidance written under the supervision of Wolfowitz for then-
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and President Bush "the father." It argued 
that with the collapse of the Soviet Union, U.S. policy should be to "prevent 
the emergence of a new rival" and use American military dominance to 
"establish and protect a new order."
<P>"We will retain the pre-eminent responsibility for addressing selectively 
those wrongs which threaten not only our interests, but those of our allies or 
friends, or which could seriously unsettle international relations," the draft 
states. U.S. intervention overseas would be "a constant fixture" of this 
policy. This came to be known as the Wolfowitz Doctrine.
<P>The leak of the draft DPG to the New York Times and the subsequent 
publication of excerpts from the document created a firestorm of criticism. 
The revised Defense Planning Guidance was sanitized and softened substantially.
<P>The doctrine was resurrected and further developed in 2000 in a document 
called "Rebuilding America's Defenses," published by the right-wing Project 
for the New American Century. It called for the United States to bolster its 
direct military role in the oil-rich and strategic Middle East rather than 
relying on surrogates. "The U.S. has for decades sought to play a more 
permanent role in gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with 
Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American 
force presence in the gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam 
Hussein." Finally this year, the doctrine was enshrined as official U.S. 
policy in the National Security Strategy. But the potential human toll of 
thousands of Iraqi lives seems never to make it into the cost/benefit 
calculations of Wolfowitz. (See the Sept. 22 New York Times Magazine article 
"Sunshine Warrior," where only potential American deaths make it into the 
equation, and even then as something of an afterthought.)
<P>There are growing numbers of people who "believe that as people living in 
the United States it is our responsibility to resist the injustices done by 
our government, in our names." (from the peace group Not in Our Name's pledge 
of resistance). During the Vietnam War, President Lyndon Johnson and his top 
advisers could not appear in public without being confronted by those opposed 
to the war. Now, days or weeks before the outbreak on war on Iraq, phase II of 
the post-Sept. 11 war on terrorism, nothing less is required.

<P><I>Bert Knorr works with the Not in Our Name Project (<a href="http://www.notinourname.net" target="_new">www.notinourname.net</a>), 
which opposes war in Iraq. He is a graduate of the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced 
International Studies, where Paul Wolfowitz served as dean between the Bush administrations.</I>
