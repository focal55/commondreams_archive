<p>While I joined with the millions of my fellow countrymen in mourning the victims 
of September 11, I may have been alone in celebrating another signal event: the 
anniversary of President Bush’s economic forum convened on August 13, 2002, at 
Baylor University in Waco, Texas. Hard to imagine that it was just over a month 
ago that Bush and his economic team including Vice President Cheney, Secretary 
of the Treasure O’Neill, Commerce Secretary Evans and OMB Director Daniels gathered 
for a symposium with “government policy makers, small investors, small business 
owners, industry experts, teachers, workers, business ethicists, union members, 
corporate executives, economists, business students, academics, researchers, and 
others” for brain-storming, soul-searching panels designed to revivify the American 
Dream and jump-start the sluggish economy. 
<p>With a quick glance backward, a swift survey of present trends, and a dash 
of prognosis forward, it is safe to call Bush’s forum an unqualified success. 
Who’s worried about the economy now? We’ve got an impending war to worry about. 
Funny how those worrisome and intractable pocketbook issues just skittered away 
in the all-scattering winds of war. Does it really matter that 2 million jobs 
have been lost since George W. Bush took office? Who cares if Americans have seen 
an average of thirty percent of their combined household worth sliced and diced 
since the President’s ascent to the White House? What me worry about the steady 
rise in bankruptcies, both personal and corporate? And what about the latest data 
on mortgage delinquencies, reflecting those indicators at new highs? That looming 
deficit, which various prognosticators agree will mount into stratospheric regions 
during the next decade? Silly us. What’s a deficit of say, five hundred billion 
compared to the measly fifty billion that the Pentagon estimates the war in Iraq 
will cost? As Secretary said after a September 16 speech in Portland, Maine: “Whatever 
it is that’s finally decided to be done, we will succeed and we can afford it.” 
Meanwhile, White House advisors termed Bush economic advisor Lawrence Lindsey’s 
estimate for the war effort as landing somewhere between $100 billion and $200 
billion as being “premature.” Heck yes, it’s premature, the dang war hasn’t even 
been declared yet. 
<p>Now some skeptics argue that the President and his advisors are just playing 
a political possum game with all this saber-rattling, misdirecting voters away 
from bread and butter issues during the midterm Congressional campaign. Of course 
the doubters are mainly Democratic, sore losers in the making. Why would the President 
do that? The economy will always be with us, won’t it? Certainly the deficit isn’t 
going to run away. Not with the numbers Bush and his team are running up. And 
not with the tax cut that the Congress compliantly passed at the President’s behest. 
First things first: let’s mow down Hussein and then tackle the economy. By then 
Bush and the rest of the oil oligarchy will be in a much better frame of mind, 
anyway. Why bother them when we have to count on the feckless Saudis as our main 
source for oil? 
<p>Besides, Americans are ready for another war. As Edward Wheeler, a Democrat 
and retired Chrysler worker from Toledo, Ohio, said in the August 15 edition of 
the Los Angeles Times: “And I mean, it’s no big secret that we’re not very liked 
over there to begin with, so what’s a few bombs?” That’s the spirit! Bring on 
the bombs! They crash and glow and look good on TV. Let’s forget about that stupid 
old economy. Causes nothing but heartburn and head aches anyway. And we have more 
fun things to do. Like blowing up buildings. Zeroing in on suspected biological 
warfare plants and letting loose with a slew of Tomahawk missiles. Finding Hussein 
and bringing this dictator who the United States government put into power in 
a CIA-orchestrated coup and bringing him to justice. And meanwhile if we kill 
several thousand men, women and children that never really appreciated us in the 
first place, well – so what? That’s the price they’ll have to pay, being that 
their freedom and liberty is at stake. </p>
