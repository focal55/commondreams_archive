Earth Day is a perfect time to celebrate the first, true gift of the Earth to 
us: food. Before we toss our hats into the air, though, we might want to start 
with an admission.
<p>While we in the United States like to think we're blessed with the world's 
best and cheapest food, we've actually let market prices lie to us.
<p>They don't register all the hidden costs of our "factory farming" model, costs 
that undermine the very sustainability of nature's gifts. Food prices don't count 
the fact that soil is eroding on prime farmland many times faster than nature 
rebuilds it, or the marine life we're losing because of nitrogen runoff from overusing 
fertilizers. The latter has created a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico as big as 
Massachusetts and still growing.
<p>The prices don't include the loss of plant diversity that occurs when our seed 
is supplied by just a few companies aggressively marketing a limited selection 
or the wells in Midwest states poisoned by farm chemicals.
<p>They don't consider the over-exploited oceans, where extinction threatens one-third 
of fish species, or the farm families and entire rural communities wiped out by 
rising farm costs and lower returns.
<p>These are merely the uncounted costs of producing our increasingly unhealthy 
diet. Eating it adds a host of additional costs, including more than 5,000 deaths 
each year from food-borne illnesses, even as agribusiness--especially the meat 
industry--has fought against adding the cost of stricter food safety procedures 
to the bottom line.
<p>We've boasted that ours is the world's most efficient food system, but no business 
could stay afloat for long while ignoring its real costs.
<p>Efficiency and sustainability--the maintenance of Earth's gifts to us and our 
health over time--can no longer be seen as contradictory aims.
<p>Looked at this way, solving our food-related environmental and health crisis 
doesn't require a change in values. No one wants to destroy our Earth or get sick 
from what he or she eats. It requires a change in perception.
<p>We have to see differently. We have to see, then measure and count, the real 
costs of producing food and of our sudden (in historical terms) shift to a meat-based, 
processed, high-fat and sugar diet.
<p>Just as important, we have to see that we can have the healthy food we need 
within a more honest framework of cost-counting.
<p>During the last 30 years, agriculturists around the world have been learning 
to align with nature's genius to create sustainable efficiency--getting the most 
from nature without destroying it.
<p>With true sustainability we do not have to blanket the planet with pesticides 
or turn to untried technologies such as genetically engineered seeds that threaten 
ecological disruption.
<p>Last year, in the first worldwide study of sustainable farming practices, covering 
70 million acres in more than 50 countries, researchers noted that applying ecology-protecting 
methods increased yields substantially. They recorded increases of 150% in root 
crops. True, in some cases sustainable practices can mean lower yields but, because 
production costs drop even more, farmers reap better livelihoods. Besides, overproduction, 
not underproduction, has been the bane of U.S. agriculture.
<p>Once we dispel the myth of efficiency hiding costs, we discover that sustainable 
is synonymous with real efficiency--getting the most of our resources over time.
<p>To eat well, we don't have to acquiesce to a degrading environment, a tragic 
loss of species, a heart-rending erosion of family farming. We can redirect tax 
subsidies to further nonchemical practices and support independent, ecologically 
committed farmers, without fearing that we'll risk inefficiency-induced scarcity.
<p>We must let go of the false trade-off between protecting the planet and feeding 
ourselves.
