"I have a dream today."
	
<p>Martin Luther King Jr.'s words are, in retrospect, downright 
commonplace: don't we all have a dream? A dream of owning our own 
home, getting zero percent financing on a new car, or taking early 
retirement? Or, our dreams might be more mundane--finding a job. 
Putting food on the table. Getting our kids home from school in one 
piece.
	
<p>Still, some dreams are bigger than others. Some have a way of 
capturing our imaginations. And King's dream, like his goal of 
freedom, continues to ring as true as it remains elusive.
	
<p>But one thing's for sure: King wasn't dreaming when he made 
his speech. As Donald Rumsfeld might say, he knew the hard realities 
on the ground--the ground being the red hills of Georgia, the 
sweltering "desert" of Mississippi, and "the slums and ghettos of our 
northern cities."
	
<p>King's dream was born out of the harsh landscapes of war, 
racism, classism, anti-unionism, and the physical and emotional abuse 
that attend any attempt at genuinely changing the system: contempt, 
fear, anger, threats and jail. Rising out of these harsh landscapes 
makes King's dream not an idle wish  but a hard-earned 
acknowledgement of reality--a reality that, for many, was 
uncomfortable and threatening.
	
<p>As the brother of a September eleventh victim, calling for 
justice, not revenge, for the terrorist attacks, I've gotten a small 
taste of those hard realities and harsh landscapes. People seeking 
alternatives to war--and to the killings of additional innocent 
civilians--are routinely dismissed as naive; our sympathies are 
misguided; and most importantly, we're not living in the real world. 
In other words, we're dreamers.
	
<p>It's a potent image: peace-seekers napping in comfy homes 
while soldiers bed down in harm's way. Idealistic pacifists handing 
out leaflets on street corners made safe by military force. 
Soft-bellied peaceniks dithering while "they come over and kill us 
all." You hear it on radio shows and television, you hear it hurled 
out of car windows. We're well-intentioned, but we're irrelevant. 
Someone else does the heavy lifting while we dream on.
	
<p>But don't we come from a nation of dreamers?
	
<p>How else to explain the popular depiction of America as "a 
sleeping giant," reluctantly awakened to action--military, of 
course--by the noisy doings of an evil world? The notion that 
Americans could be roused to some other kind of action--seeking 
social justice, addressing economic inequities, rethinking foreign 
policy, asking tough questions--isn't part of the program. This is a 
giant with a one-track mind.
	
<p>"I think he's a bit naive on how the world works regarding 
our forward projection of power," says a self-identified Marine 
caller to a radio show on which I guested, "and what we have to do in 
order to maintain our quality of life and what we know is good and 
free" (we have to kill innocent people.)  And there's others: "If we 
don't do something now, it's going to be worse later on" (we have to 
kill a few innocent people so more innocent people don't get killed); 
"If we had gotten the guys from the 1993 bombing, maybe this wouldn't 
have happened," (we should have killed them sooner); "You're not much 
of a brother" (or else you'd be killing someone else's brother in his 
name); "Morally, if that's the way you felt, I'd have no argument 
with you, but you don't like what the Bush administration is doing" 
(you can pray, but don't try to actually change anything); "Me and my 
family might be the next ones to get killed by terrorists--have you 
thought about that angle?" (after all, what have you got to lose?). 
And: "Do you want to kiss Osama on the lips?" (because you must be 
gay if you don't want to kick his ass).
	
<p>Who's living in the real world? And who's dreaming?
	
<p>Cable pundit Bill O'Reilly asks, "Weren't the German people 
responsible for Hitler?" by way of justifying the bombing of 
civilians in Afghanistan--who, he deduces, are equally responsible 
for the Taliban. When I point out that the September eleventh 
terrorists considered their victims--including my 
brother--responsible for  U.S. foreign policy, he says I've missed 
the point: "We had to defeat these people with as few casualties as 
possible, which is why we bombed."
	
<p>Whose casualties? Where, and how many? If they're not 
American, they're irrelevant. Just before Christmas, Rick Roberts, a 
talk show host in San Diego, paints an appropriately humane portrait 
of the American victims: "People got up on the morning of the 
eleventh, kissed their kids goodbye, dropped them off at day care, 
patted the dog on the head, took a last gulp of coffee before getting 
in their cars and driving to work." So far, so good. "They were 
attacked by a premeditated, cold blooded murderer." No argument there.
	
<p>But about the question of our civilian dead versus 
Afghanistan's civilian dead: "They were murdered. We did not do that."
	
<p>Murdered? Accidentally killed? Wrongly targeted? Hanging 
around past sunset?  The right verb is cold comfort when you're dead. 
But is anyone dead in Afghanistan? What about that figure of 3,700 
civilian deaths, culled from a variety of non-U.S. news reports? Mr. 
Roberts finds the figure suspect: they're faking obituaries to garner 
sympathy.
	
<p>Tell me again: who's not living in the real world? Of course, 
we should acknowledge and honor our innocent dead, civilian or 
military. We should remember their humanity. But aren't we dreaming 
when we suggest that the rest simply don't exist?
	
<p>Mark Twain, recently getting the Ken Burns treatment on PBS, 
knew something about a society living in denial. In Huckleberry Finn, 
he has Huck fibbing about a riverboat accident to explain his late 
arrival at Aunt Sally's:
	
<p>"We blowed out a cylinder-head," Huck reports.
`	
<p>"Good gracious!" replies Aunt Sally. "Anybody hurt?"
	
<p>"N'm. Killed a nigger."
	
<p>"Well, it's lucky: because sometimes people do get hurt."
	
<p>Innocent people get hurt and killed in war. Is it naive to 
acknowledge this reality? Are we dreaming when we seek alternatives? 
Are we being disingenuous when we express surprise at the increasing 
tensions between India and Pakistan, the increasing violence between 
Israelis and Palestinians, the reports of China's plans to expand its 
nuclear weapons program?  Do we act in a vacuum, or do our actions 
and reactions have real consequences in the real world? Aren't we 
dreaming when we pretend they don't--when photos, stories and 
eyewitness reports falling outside the purview of the Pentagon are 
dismissed, denied, and denied again?
	
<p>Joan Didion, in one chapter of Political Fictions, examines 
the "systematic obfuscation and prevarication" that followed the 
disclosure of a massacre at El Mozote in El Salvador in the 1980s--in 
which those demanding official recognition of the civilian murders 
were repeatedly stonewalled with official denial--concluding,
	
<p>"...We had emerged a people again so yearning to accept the 
government version, or again so angry, as to buy into a revision of 
history in which those Americans who differed...were again our true, 
and our only sinister, enemy."
	
<p>Are those questioning the "obfuscation and prevarication" 
surrounding our unlimited use of force in the war on terrorism the 
enemy? Or are they the ones living in the real world--while the rest 
of us are dreaming?
	
<p>"What happened to us, what we did, is stuff that most people 
don't want to hear. And the people that particularly don't want to 
hear it are the people that sent us over," writes Vietnam veteran Ben 
Chitty, who served in the U.S. Navy from 1965 to 1969, in the book, 
Hell, Healing and Resistance. "The only people in America who took 
the war as seriously as we did were the people in the anti-war 
movement. Most other people in the United States didn't care. And it 
wasn't that they were bad people, or unkind, or stupid, or couldn't 
see what was going on. It was because they were busy. They were busy 
working, they were busy being parents, they were busy at their jobs, 
they were busy going to school, they were busy going to the movies, 
busy going to McDonald's, busy going to Burger King. They were too 
busy to pay attention to the half-million Americans over in Vietnam, 
the 58,000 being killed. They were just too busy."
	
<p>Who's dreaming, and who's living in the real world? This 
morning I read a news account of  fellow September eleventh family 
members who have journeyed to Afghanistan--to meet with civilians who 
lost family members of their own from the U.S. bombing. Their mission 
is one of reconciliation, of acknowledging the shared humanity of 
everyone touched by the terrorist attacks and the resulting war--and 
seeking a better way.
	
<p>Are they dreamers? Are they living in the real world?
	
<p>Or are they wide awake--and acting on these other words from 
Martin Luther King, Jr.:
	
<p>"When evil men plot, good men must plan. When evil men burn 
and bomb, good men must build and bind. When evil men shout ugly 
words of hatred, good men must commit themselves to the glories of 
love. Where evil men would  seek to perpetuate an unjust status quo, 
good men must seek to bring into a being a real order of justice."
