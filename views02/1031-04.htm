<p>The Democrats should have an easy time winning control of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate in next week's election. Recession is 
deepening, unemployment is rising, and corporate corruption headlines 
are proliferating. Health care costs, drug prices and the number of 
Americans without health care coverage are all increasing. Median 
household incomes are falling. Corporate crime has heavily depleted 
401Ks and other pension losses.
<p>These should all help the Democrats win against the corporate-indentured 
Republicans marinated in corporate cash, soft on corporate and 
environmental crimes and demonstrably anti-labor.
<p>Why then is the overall contest for Party control of Congress too close 
to call? Because Democrats are not clearly, relentlessly and 
aggressively emphasizing these fundamental issues to distinguish 
themselves from the Republicans. Why? Are they unaware, neglectful or 
torpid? No, their chronic ambiguity flows from being largely indentured 
to the same monied commercial interests as the Republicans.
<p>So Governor Shaheen of New Hampshire, running for the U.S. Senate, 
refers to corporate crime as "corporate mismanagement" and other 
Democratic candidates are allowing the Republicans to blur key 
poll-tested issues like prescription drug benefits, tax cuts for the 
super wealthy, and corporate crime enforcement.
<p>Voters want to know whose side candidates are on in their daily struggles as 
workers, consumers, patients, small taxpayers and savers on the one hand, and, 
on the other hand, the giant corporations that pay for control of our government 
in order to get all the goodies that come out of the hides of working families. 
Fairness is the great issue in American politics, stupid! 
<p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Democrats won election after election 
by conveying one singularly clear impression - that the Republican Party 
was beholden to the wealthy and the Democratic Party represented the 
working people. Karl Rove, in the Bush White House, understands this 
history. That is why he is engaged in the "blur and spur" strategy of 
fuzzing the hot-button issues to portray the Republicans as fighters for 
ordinary Americans, instead of the big businesses which own them. This 
is also why the Republicans are using the spur of the drumbeats of war 
to distract the country away from pressing domestic necessities, 
injustices and hazards.
<p>By a margin of nearly two to one the American people do not want a war 
against Iraq that involves an invasion, American casualties and 
essentially having the United States go it alone. Not when rigorous UN 
inspectors can go to Iraq first.
<p>Even more Americans would join these citizens if the mass media relayed 
the facts about how boxed in the militarily-weakened dictator of Iraq 
is, surrounded by more powerful enemies (Iran, Turkey, Israel), 
two-thirds of his country out of his rigid control (no fly zones), 
deterred, contained and under 24-hour satellite surveillance.
<p>More voters would be anti-war if there was greater media discussion 
about the likelihood of awful civilian casualties and sickness among the 
innocent children and adults of Iraq. Voters would also be anti-war if 
Americans were given the facts about the opposition to the touted 
conduct of this war from inside the Pentagon, among retired military 
officers and other experts who believe the risks of undermining the 
effort against terrorism, of generating a boomerang of domestic 
terrorism around theworld and an endemic civil war in Iraq (where the 
U.S. stays as expensive occupier) are not worth toppling the government 
of Iraq by a unilateral invasion.
      
<p>When a group of Gulf War veterans had a news conference at the National Press 
Club in Washington on October 24 to point out some of these consequences (which 
included conditions, leading to the sickness of 128,000 Gulf War veterans in 1991) 
the media did not show up. (For their statements, see <a href="http://www.veteransforcommonsense.org" target="_new">www.veteransforcommonsense.org</a>). 
<p>The "cakewalk" view of the planned war widely espoused by the circle of 
chickenhawks surrounding George W. Bush is obscuring serious public 
debate about another possible outcome -- diverse human and economic 
consequences adverse to U.S. and global security during and after the 
war is over.
<p>The Democrats can still raise their voices for the people in the next 
few days before November 5th, if they understand that waffling rarely 
wins campaigns. The people want it straight talk and real action.</p>
