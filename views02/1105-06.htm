<p>"Unfettered access" and "material breach." On the surface, it all seems so 
clear and straightforward. If Iraq does not give weapons inspectors "unfettered 
access," they will yet again be in "material breach" of the United Nations' weapons 
of mass destruction disarmament mandate.</p>
<p>But what does the actual inspections record tell us? We pick up the story in 
September 1997. UNSCOM Executive Chairman Richard Butler had been on the job for 
only a month, having replaced Rolf Ekeus who served in that post from 1991 until 
1997.</p>
<p>Because it had become evident that Iraq was still concealing its mostly defanged 
weapons of mass destruction program, UNSCOM chief weapons inspector Scott Ritter 
was given a new angle: Assume Saddam Hussein could not be trusted and find out, 
by clandestine scientific means, what he was hiding.</p>
<p>Hence, the formation of the Capable Site Concealment Investigations team -- 
an entity designed to stimulate concealment activities.</p>
<p>Hidden in the back of CISI vehicles were "covert communication interceptors" 
-- a network of 10 radio receivers, each specifically tuned to a unique frequency. 
The receivers were linked to digital tape recorders hidden in the inspectors' 
personal backpacks, making them walking microphones.</p>
<p>The idea was to initiate confrontations at presidential security organizations 
to get senior Iraqi officials yakking on their radios. That way, secret and sensitive 
information could be gathered by UNSCOM. </p>
<p>Oct. 1, 1997: UNSCOM 207 -- a surprise inspection of a secret biological unit 
inside Iraq's Special Security Organization headquarters in Baghdad. But with 
guns pointed at them, the inspectors were denied access to the SSO's Al-Hyatt 
building.</p>
<p>Iraq cried foul, aware that UNSCOM was being manipulated by U.S. intelligence 
sources and that the inspection protocol was being violated, according to a Security 
Council-approved agreement set up by Ekeus in 1997.</p>
<p>The agreement declared certain sites off limits -- presidential palaces, for 
example. (Imagine the United States granting "unfettered access" to all of its 
weapons facilities but denying access to CIA headquarters, Camp David or the president's 
private residence.)</p>
<p>Dismissing concerns about sovereignty, which the U.N. Charter promises not 
to violate except when approving self-defensive military action, CISI was being 
pushed by U.S. planners to go on wild goose chases.</p>
<p>"A lot of information we were given was provided to us by the Americans," explains 
former UNSCOM inspector Roger Hill. "It was either out of date, incorrect or it 
was completely false and designed to take us down the wrong path."</p>
<p>It soon became evident to the inspectors that U.S. officials didn't want the 
inspections to end. They wanted "containment." As long as the inspections were 
unfinished, the United States could keep Iraq under its control with "Saddam in 
his box."</p>
<p>Saddam was playing games and the Clinton administration was too. CISI team 
leader Chris Cobb-Smith became convinced the inspections had become politicized 
by a U.S. effort to purposely provoke confrontations of "access."</p>
<p>Ritter was instructed to come up with a plan that he later presented to senior 
staff in the White House situation room. Ritter's plan was approved with one addition: 
"inspect" Iraq's Defense Ministry.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Butler drew a timeline. According to Ritter, Butler instructed 
him to provoke a confrontation by early December 1998 because the United States 
planned to launch a military strike in mid-December.</p>
<p>As planned, Iraq denied access. But U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan persuaded 
Iraq to relent. The Defense Ministry was inspected. Nothing was found. Then, confirming 
inspectors' suspicions, Butler shut down CISI and "decided" that its function 
would be turned over to U.S. intelligence officials, which effectively gave the 
United States cover to move the disarmament goal posts by simply asserting it 
had weapons "intelligence" about some site.</p>
<p>Ritter resigned in frustration. Hill replaced him and carried out UNSCOM 258 
in violation of the agreement. As Butler was meeting with the Security Council 
to discuss the matter, Clinton gave the green light for Operation Desert Fox.</p>
<p>What assurances are being taken this time to protect the integrity of the internationally 
supported inspections and what's to stop U.S. hawks from arbitrarily moving the 
disarmament goal posts indefinitely as a pretext for unilateral action?</p>
<p>None of these questions are being debated in public. That should make anyone 
concerned about peace and honesty quite nervous.</p>
<p>Indeed, "the time for denying, deceiving and delaying (ought to) come to an 
end." And that goes for U.S. hawks, too. Saddam has been cast as the demon but, 
as the cliché has it, the devil is in the details.</p>
