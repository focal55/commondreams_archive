<p>After meeting Vladimir Putin last year, President Bush assured the American 
people that he had looked into the Russian leader’s eyes and established that 
“he was a good man.” Whether Putin, who now expresses reservations about invading 
Iraq, retains that status is uncertain. It is clear that this President has extraordinary 
confidence in his ability as an opthamologist of the soul. Discerning obvious 
good and evil in the world, he moves singlemindedly with little tolerance for 
dissent. When political leaders of the left are motivated by such confident, singular 
visions, media portray them as mindless apostles of political correctness, demagogues, 
and utopians. When such a style emanates from the right, it becomes moral courage 
and political conviction. I believe that neither left nor right is well served 
by this mindset, but its dangers become all the more apparent as we approach war. 
<p>Though this Administration periodically invokes self defense, much of its rhetoric—and 
the evident contradictions in its case—belie this rationale. The case against 
Iraq rides on the Administration’s obsessive quest for “regime change.” Every 
state in that vital region must not only respect borders but deploy itself in 
such a way that it can never become a threat to US cultural, economic, or military 
interests. 
<p>The Guardian commented late last summer that” First the pretext was Iraq's 
non-existent links with… September 11. Then it was the anthrax attacks in the 
US, which turned out to be a domestic problem. Then it was the long-running dispute 
over Iraq's drastically depleted chemical and biological weapons capacity and 
its resistance to the return of UN weapons inspectors. But now that Saddam has 
begun to signal a climbdown on inspectors (apparently going a good deal further 
in private messages passed to the US administration via Jordan's King Abdullah), 
they seem to be something of a side issue after all. As John Bolton, the US undersecretary 
for arms control, blurted out, the "regime change" policy "will not be altered, 
whether inspectors go in or not".” 
<p>Responding to such criticisms, the Administration now seeks to resurrect the 
al-Qaida connection, but, as the Washington Post comments, even US intelligence 
officials discount such reports. The Administration’s further contention, that 
an al-Qaida official sought medical treatment in Iraq would, even if true, hardly 
constitute a role in sustaining terrorism even remotely equal to the part played 
by many prominent Saudis. 
<p>Iraq’s Arab neighbors fear a US attack on Iraq more than an Iraqi attack on 
them. One Israeli military analyst even comments: “there is no such thing as a 
long-range Iraqi missile with an effective biological warhead. No one has found 
an Iraqi biological warhead. The chances of Iraq having succeeded in developing 
operative warheads without tests are zero.” In any case, Saddam Hussein, a ruthless, 
secular tyrant interested in preserving his own power, is unlikely either to unleash 
biolgocal weapons or pass them to suicidal terrorists. As Middle Eastern expert 
Stephen Zunes points out, if Osama had such weapons, Saddam might be his first 
target. 
<p>Attacking Iran offers few certain benefits and poses open-ended risks. Even 
the bombing of the weak and despised Taliban network yielded much less than many 
now suggest. The New York Times reported in June that: “Classified investigations 
of the Qaeda threat now under way at the FBI and CIA have concluded that the war 
in Afghanistan failed to diminish the threat to the United States … Instead, the 
war might have complicated counterterrorism efforts by dispersing potential attackers 
across a wider geographic area.” 
<p>An attack on a far stronger Iraq both licenses and might catalyze war between 
Pakistan and India, Saddam’s use of his remaining arsenal against US forces or 
Israel, a possible Israeli nuclear strike, and dangerous responses by other Arab 
nations facing new domestic unrest in the wake of an intensified US presence in 
the Gulf. Terrorism on US soil, as even the CIA acknowledges, become more likely 
if the US threatens Saddam’s survival. 
<p>Defenders of pre-emptive strike against Iraq are right about one thing. Simply 
opposing this war is not enough. But there are better preventive strategies than 
war. In the seventies and eighties, grass roots mobilizations—often collaborating 
across borders-- encouraged democracy in formerly totalitarian societies, limited 
the testing and development of nuclear weaponry, enabled mutual security pacts, 
and forced more generous international economic policies. Contrary to views now 
widely held, activism both in the developed West and in many “Third World” states 
did inhibit the spread of nuclear weapons to many nations once expected to gain 
them. 
<p>It is time to enforce UN Resolution 687—in full. That resolution requires establishment 
throughout the Middle East of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, which 
would eliminate not only Iraqi weapons but also nuclear and chemical stores likely 
held by Israel, Syria, and Egypt. Yet for these hopes to bear fruit, this Administration 
must be forced to acknowledge that it is not the sole source of and means toward 
a just world order.
