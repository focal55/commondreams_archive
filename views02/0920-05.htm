<p>The ultimate downfall of the corporate globalizers may be that they know 
        no limits. 
      <p>Not satisfied with imposing pull-down agreements on the trade in goods, 
        Big Business is looking to do the same thing for services through the 
        General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Services includes such 
        economic sectors as finance (banking, insurance, pensions), healthcare, 
        telecommunications, construction, travel and tourism, the professions, 
        education and training, express delivery, energy and environmental services. 
        GATS is part of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and now undergoing 
        renegotiation to become more encompassing. 
      <p>The Wall Street banks and the other service multinationals first want 
        to ensure that countries do not discriminate against foreign service providers. 
        The United States does not let foreign airlines service domestic routes, 
        for example. Such restrictions to protect domestic firms are prevalent 
        in developing countries, and an impediment to the expansionary dreams 
        of the rich country multinationals. 
      <p>But the multinationals want much more than non-discrimination. Their 
        real goal is to use the language of non-discrimination (they talk about 
        "market access" and "national treatment" for foreign companies) in order 
        to force deregulation and privatization. 
      <p>A key priority for the service companies is to place a burden on all 
        countries to show that their regulations are the "least trade restrictive" 
        means to achieve a legitimate purpose. 
      <p>What does this mean? In case after case, the European Union has suggested 
        that the U.S. federalist system -- with overlapping regulatory powers 
        between the states and federal government -- is an impediment to trade. 
        The argument goes like this: American companies with a bigger presence 
        in the United States can more easily manage to deal with separate regulatory 
        agencies in each state. Foreign companies with a smaller presence cannot 
        negotiate this terrain as easily. Thus, goes the EU argument, regulation 
        should be done at the federal level. 
      <p>Do we really want to sacrifice important state-level consumer and civil 
        rights protections -- for example, interest rate caps, limits on corporate 
        discriminatory practices like redlining, restrictions on predatory lending 
        -- because they are inconvenient for European companies? Of course, the 
        real point is not that they are inconvenient for Europeans, but for business. 
        The U.S. companies hope to use GATS to eliminate U.S. regulations -- just 
        like the European corporations want to get rid of rules in the EU. 
      <p>There are relatively weak GATS rules in place now, but ongoing negotiations 
        between nations under corporate influence to tighten them and apply them 
        to more and more services raise serious concerns. 
      <p>What might a strengthened GATS mean for the United States? It's too early 
        to say with certainty, but based on a careful analysis of existing proposals, 
        Professor Patricia Arnold of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee has 
        raised a set of disturbing questions: 
      <ul>
        <li>Will GATS weaken efforts to regulate financial markets in the aftermath 
          of the financial and accounting scandals? Already foreign companies 
          are complaining about the reach of the modest Sarbanes-Oxley accounting 
          reform bill, which would require foreign, as well as U.S. CEOs, if they 
          sell stock on the New York Stock Exchange, to attest personally to the 
          validity of their companies' financial statements. </li>
        <li>If Wall Street gets its way and achieves a partial privatization of 
          Social Security, will GATS make it impossible ever to bring the program 
          back fully into the public sector? GATS requires countries to pay compensatory 
          damage if they grant new public rights over the supply of a service, 
          she notes, making privatization a one-way street. </li>
        <li> Would GATS limit efforts to regulate the health insurance sector? 
          The insurance industry argues that service agreements should prohibit 
          restrictions on the types of insurance products allowed on the market. 
          Might this mean a ban on legal requirements that health insurance policies 
          must cover certain medical conditions? </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some will argue these are Chicken Little sky-is-falling concerns. But 
        if the NAFTA-WTO experience shows anything, it is that corporate lawyers 
        will grab onto any crevice in trade rules to hoist corporate interests 
        above the public interest. 
      <p>Consider the "Chapter 11" investment protections in NAFTA. In a case 
        closely paralleling what might occur in other countries with a GATS agreement, 
        UPS is suing the Canadian postal service for offering express delivery 
        service. The postal service is subsidized for mail delivery, and that 
        subsidy unfairly advantages Canada Post over UPS in the express delivery 
        market, UPS claims. 
      <p>If Canada Post want to compete in the market, they should set up drop-off 
        boxes separate from mail boxes, employ delivery and sorting staff separate 
        from the people who handle the mail, and handle delivery packages at separate 
        facilities from the mail, UPS argues. Since Canada Post had the temerity 
        not to pursue this economic irrationality, UPS is asking for hundreds 
        of millions of dollars in compensation. 
      <p>This is actually happening, and other companies are filing lawsuits in 
        each others' countries against safety regulations, court verdicts and 
        other expressions of domestic sovereignty. 
      
<p>Enough cases like this -- and a more dominant GATS will make sure there are 
many more -- may eventually produce a backlash that will bring down the whole 
WTO-NAFTA edifice. But the damage inflicted in the meantime is too severe. Better 
instead to prevent new agreements that diminish our living standards and roll 
back existing ones. For more information on how to stop the GATS, contact Global
