<p><i>“Each person has inside a basic decency and goodness. If he listens to it 
and acts on it, he is giving a great deal of what it is the world needs most. 
It is not complicated but it takes courage. It takes courage for a person to listen 
to his own goodness and act on it.” </i><br>
--Pablo Casals 
<p><i>“If you are coming to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you are 
coming because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.”

--Australian aboriginal woman 
<p><i>“When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and 
love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they 
seem invincible but in the end, they always fall—think of it, always!” </i><br>
--Mahatma Gandhi 
<p>Around three decades ago I traveled from Tennessee to Washington, D.C. to join 
a protest against the war in Vietnam. My housing had been pre-arranged; the group 
I was traveling with would be staying with a family of Quakers. The weather that 
weekend in November tested our resolve: bone-chilling temperatures and a strong 
wind out of the north. Nonetheless, we marched, we sang, half a million strong 
we came together confidently in common cause. Late on the final day of the weekend, 
my brother-in-law, Johnny, and I found ourselves in a group of agitators at the 
Justice Department. I was caught up in the excitement of the moment—until the 
D.C. police started discharging tear gas canisters into the crowd. We beat a hasty 
retreat, and as I sat excitedly recounting the tale of the confrontation, I noticed 
a troubled glance from the elderly man whose hospitality we were enjoying, not 
disapproving, but gravely concerned. Years later I would remember that expression 
as I read the words of Marianne Williamson: “I am of a generation, which thought 
that we could bring peace to the world, and we didn't think it mattered if we 
ourselves were angry. What we learned is that an angry generation cannot bring 
peace.” 
<p>My <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0706-06.htm">last column on 
patriotism</a> generated a number of responses: more than 60 via e-mail, probably 
around ten in person, all but a couple supportive. A number of these readers said 
that, while they were heartened by my words, they still wondered how to move into 
action. So today I share my thoughts on that. 
<p>First of all, pay attention to what’s going on in your community and in the 
world. Don’t try to hide from or close yourself off to the horrors that are taking 
place. When you see the starving children with bloated bellies feel the hurt, 
feel the anguish, feel the anger. And use your feelings as a wake up call to action. 
<p>To discern what to do, quiet the chatter in your mind through meditation, prayer, 
contemplation or a hike in the woods. Then listen. Each of us has a gift to offer 
the world, and we become aware of how we might offer that gift when we get in 
touch with our inner voice. Perhaps you’ve always wanted to write a letter to 
your local newspaper, but your mind’s internal editor constantly heads you off 
at the pass. Ignore your editor and write it anyway. 
<p>To make a difference in the world, become, as Gandhi says, the change you want 
to see. If you want a peaceful world, explore inwardly and find that peaceful 
part of yourself. Then rather than taking your anger and resentment out on your 
co-worker for something he did or didn’t do, find a way to forgive . . . him and 
yourself. 
<p>Since we are all in this together, there really is no “enemy.” We all want 
to love and be loved. Any action that is not loving, any action that is fear-based—abusive 
language, intolerant behavior, a violent act—is a cry for love, whether it’s coming 
from George W. Bush or Saddam Hussein. 
<p>Service to others can present the next step on our spiritual or psychological 
path. If, for example, you offer a basket of food to a destitute family in a condescending 
manner, your gift might feed the flesh, but not the spirit—theirs or yours. And, 
if you become conscious of this, you get an opportunity to understand the importance 
of humility and how your well-being is inextricably intertwined with those whom 
you might serve. 
<p>We do make a difference—individually and as a group. In fact, every loving 
thought, every prayer, every compassionate action has a significant affect on 
the world we live in and the fabric of our existence. We might be moved to handle 
our own demons—the judgments, anger and negative beliefs that do not serve us. 
We might be moved to listen to and hold a friend who is hurting. We might be moved 
to serve a meal at the local homeless shelter or build a house with Habitat for 
Humanity. We might be moved to put our freedom on the line by protesting at the 
School of the Americas. Ultimately we might be moved to gather in thousands, millions 
to say, “No more!” 
<p>Being human, we sometimes lose our way, forgetting who we are and what we are 
called to do. At such times we might doubt our purpose and even become hopeless. 
When I am in such a place, I frequently turn to a marvelous touchstone, a quote 
by Frederick Buechner:<i> “The place God calls you to is the place where your 
deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet.” </i> 
<p>Find this place for yourself and your next step will become clear.
