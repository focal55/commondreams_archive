<p>Amazement has been our typical response to the extent of corporate self-dealing, 
opaque bookkeeping and conflicts of interest brought to light by the Enron debacle 
and subsequent scandals of 2002. 
<P> But not for Greg LeRoy, founder-leader of a Washington-based policy group 
called <a href="http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/gjf.htm" target="_new">Good Jobs 
First</a>. LeRoy, a former union official and community organizer, is becoming 
America's No. 1 watchdog of how subsidy-hungry corporations are putting the squeeze 
on state and local governments &#151; and all of us as taxpayers. 
<P> The record is enough to curl your hair. LeRoy's reports have highlighted a 
near tidal wave of tax abatements or outright payments that states and localities 
feel obliged to make to land footloose businesses &#151; or sometimes just to 
convince the ones they have to stay put. 
<P> Just one recent example: the New York Stock Exchange demand of $400 million 
to stay in Manhattan, offering, in LeRoy's words, a "laughable threat to move 
to New Jersey, even though most of its major member firms have already been paid 
to stay in New York!" 
<P> All too often, LeRoy complains, companies simply fail to create the jobs or 
pay the wages or invest the dollars they promised in return for their tax breaks 
or subsidies. 
<P> States and localities, he charges, are grossly negligent in monitoring and 
evaluating the effectiveness of the massive incentives they offer. He highlights 
a finding by the U.S. Economic Development Administration that only two states 
(Maryland and New York) have created models to figure how well subsidies work. 
The other 48 collect no data on effectiveness, or rely on data from client companies 
&#151; leaving the fox, as it were, in charge of the chicken coop. 
<P> Last month in Baltimore, LeRoy's Good Jobs First, formed in 1998, held its 
first-ever national conference, 300 people from 36 states involved in community-based 
organizations, labor organizations, state tax and budget watchdog groups, environmental/smart 
growth organizations and academia. 
<P> Whether from the left or right, the attendees agreed that state and local 
economic development efforts should be fully accountable &#151; "to fix the candy 
store mess," as LeRoy puts it. 
<P> The anger doesn't seem so much targeted at local governments, however. All 
too often they find themselves beaten down, abused by businesses playing one state 
or locality against another. 
<P> Says LeRoy, it's simply wrong to hand out corporate subsidies when the recipient 
businesses often turn out to be paying poverty-level wages, denying health-care 
coverage to employees, polluting the environment, fueling sprawl by fleeing inner 
cities and older suburbs, or "merely moving jobs from one city to another." 
<P> The case for relocation subsidies is getting all the weaker, he notes, because 
today's big challenge isn't capturing footloose jobs. Instead, it's building people's 
skills. With the graying of America, the country's workforce growth is projected 
to decline to a bare replacement rate. Skilled labor will be scarce for a generation 
or more to come. 
<P> Conclusion? Education is of indisputable, paramount importance. That means, 
LeRoy argues, that monies flowing to property-tax abatements or corporate income-tax 
cuts are devouring public budgets far better spent on building Americans' skills 
for the 21st century. 
<P> What is looking up &#151; at least a little &#151; is the battle for accountability. 
Largely due to grass-roots campaigns by the types of people at the Good Jobs First 
conference, the number of states with "clawbacks" &#151; requirements for return 
of subsidies if a firm tries to leave, or doesn't provide the new jobs it promises 
&#151; has risen from nine to 17 in the past decade. In 1992, only eight states 
attached job-quality standards to their subsidies; today, 37 do. 
<P> Still, across the country, state and local economic-development offices remain 
instinctively secretive, even with vast sums of public money at stake. New state 
accountability systems &#151; like the ones from Maine, Minnesota and North Carolina, 
highlighted at the Good Jobs First conference &#151; are still rare. 
<P> What is different is the start of a coherent, connected national constituency 
to exchange experiences, highlight accountability measures, and fight for reform. 
The Baltimore conference, first of its kind, may start that ball rolling. 
<P> Ironically, it's a cause likely to be bolstered by accounts of juggled books 
and abuse of shareholders by some of our most gigantic publicly traded corporations. 
In this climate, calls for broad-based reform, for honest and open accounting, 
for putting the <i>public</i> interest first, should be gaining new resonance 
coast to coast.
