<p><i>Success is counted sweetest<br>
By those who ne'er succeed.<br>
To comprehend a nectar<br>
Requires sorest need.<br>
<br>
Not one of all the purple host<br>
Who took the flag today<br>
Can tell the definition,<br>
So clear, of victory<br>
<br>
As he, defeated, dying,<br>
On whose forbidden ear<br>
The distant strains of triumph<br>
Break agonized and clear!<br>
</i> --Emily Dickinson<br>

<p>The landscape this November 6 is barren. The Democrats managed to lose the 
Senate, and now the Republicans will have their way. They will be able to clog 
the benches with rightwing judges, cement Bush's retrograde tax cuts, and roll 
back environmental, labor, and a host of other protections.</p>
												
<p>This election was a referendum on, among other things, the Democratic Party 
leadership, and they lost it.</p>
												
<p>Democrats had tremendous advantages, which they squandered.</p>
												
<p>History was on their side, since the President's party almost always loses 
seats in mid-term elections.</p>
												
<p>The economy was on their side, with the stock market tanking and unemployment 
rising.</p>
												
<p>The Wall Street scandals--Enron, Harken, Halliburton, et. al.--were on their 
side, and these scandals continued to cascade right up to election day and even 
implicated the President and the Vice President personally.</p>
												
<p>The mood of the nation was on their side, with a sizable majority of Americans 
saying the country was headed in the wrong direction.</p>
												
<p>But still the Democrats could not make the sale.</p>
												
<p>Sure, Bush played the war card; what other card did he have available? And 
yes, it was crass, with Karl Rove telling Bush to &quot;seize the moment&quot; 
of September 11 to change topics away from the economy and the Wall Street scandals 
to the Iraq war and terrorism.</p>
												
<p>Yet the Democrats let him get away with it.</p>
												
<p>The leadership (attention, Dick Gephardt!) did not challenge Bush directly 
on the war.</p>
												
<p>Nor did they (Tom Daschle, call home!) stake out a clear position on Bush's 
tax cuts, even though the remaining ones overwhelmingly benefit the top 2 percent 
of Americans.</p>
												
<p>With a muddle for a message, the Democrats failed to energize or enlarge their 
base and instead opted to fight on Republican turf, wrestling over a few thousand 
voters in district after district, state after state. Those voters were conservative 
Democrats, Independents, and moderate Republicans.</p>
												
<p>Now Democrats are being told that they need to run even more to the middle, 
but that's not where the votes are.</p>
												
<p>If the Democrats are to give themselves a fighting chance to win, and if they 
are going to stand as the party of the people, they had better start appealing 
to the poor, people of color, and the majority of Americans who didn't show up 
at the polls November 5.</p>
												
<p>A huge majority of Americans want a raise in the minimum wage.</p>
												
<p>A huge majority of Americans believe that corporations have too much power.</p>
<p>A huge majority of Americans identify health care as one of their top concerns.</p>
<p>A huge majority of Americans want the environment protected, and a decent, 
affordable education for their kids.</p>
												
<p>The Democrats ought to be able to say: We'll give you a big raise, we'll give 
you free health care, we'll give your kids a free college education, we'll curb 
corporate power and take the money out of politics, and we'll clean up the environment 
while we're at it.</p>
<p>If they can't sell that, they can't sell peanuts at the ballpark.</p>
												
<p>The problem isn't that the Democrats haven't been &quot;moderate&quot; enough; 
the problem is, they haven't been bold enough.</p>
												
<p>Until they get bold, the strains of triumph will remain distant.</p>
