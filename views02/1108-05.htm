<p>The Democrats' loss in both houses of
Congress has prompted more than the usual debate
over what went wrong. It seems clear that the most
fundamental strategic error made by the Democrats
was to allow President Bush to displace their issues
by making Iraq dominate media coverage of the
election season.

         <p>It is important not to bury this lesson, as the history of this election is already being rewritten. Trent Lott, Senate Republican leader, claims a mandate for the President: "The American people said, 'Yes, we trust this man'," he said. And Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, whose surrender to President Bush helped seal his party's fate, concurred, saying that the elections have given the President "an opportunity here to enact and proceed with the plan (on Iraq) as he has articulated it."

         <p>But 80 percent of the electorate did not vote
for Republican candidates. So it takes quite an
imagination to see this election as a mandate for
anything except fixing our broken-down
democracy.

         <p>Back in August, things were moving in the
Democrats' direction. Due to massive fraud and
corporate crime, millions of older employees had
lost their savings and began postponing their
retirement. By a lopsided margin of 55 to 25
percent, the public said that President Bush cared
more about the interests of large corporations than
about ordinary working people. Democrats led
Republicans on the economy, the budget, Social
Security, and almost all of the biggest election
issues except "national security and terrorism."

         <p>Then George W. Bush discovered Iraq.

         <p>The Democrats could have said, why now?
How did Saddam Hussein suddenly become a
national security threat just 8 weeks before the
election? Or more politely, they could have told
President Bush to bring this up after the election, as
his father did with the first Gulf War.

         <p>But they caved instead. What is most
amazing about this surrender is that it is not, as in so
many other cases, a result of the corruption of our
politics by campaign contributions. There was no
clamor from Wall Street or the Chamber of
Commerce for attacking Iraq. There may be oil and
gas companies that stand to profit from this war, but
they give most of their political contributions to
Republicans.

         <p>Of course corruption is still part of the story
here. Democrats could have pursued a whole set of
scandals that might topple the Bush administration.
The Democratic leadership has apparently decided
to tread carefully in the area of corporate
malfeasance for fear that some of their own
luminaries might wind up on the wrong side of an
investigation. Clinton's former Treasury Secretary
Bob Rubin, for example, might have to explain
some phone calls he made to Treasury last year,
asking whether they were going to intervene to
protect Enron's bond ratings.

         <p>But the Democrats' betrayal on the war is a
different story. It is the latest, and the most morally repugnant, of a series of crucial political decisions in which telling the truth would have been a much better strategy even from the standpoint of their own self-interest. When President Bush proposed his massive tax cut, with 40 percent of it going to the richest 1 percent of the country (average
income: $1.1 million), they could have opposed it
on the grounds of fairness. Instead they chose to
complain about its effects on the federal budget
deficit. They posed as the party of fiscal
conservatism, making up all kinds of gross
exaggerations about the effect of tax cuts on the
deficit and the economy.

         <p>Thus voters are increasingly left with a
choice between a party whose principles favor the
rich and powerful, and another that has almost no
principles at all. It is no wonder that most do not
bother to show up at the polls.

         <p>Fixing this problem will require a major
overhaul, including real campaign finance reform
that puts an end to the legalized bribery of our
elected officials. But in the mean time, the
Democrats might want to consider a novel strategy:
tell the truth once in a while, at least when it's in
your favor. You can hardly do worse than you have
done with your poll-driven, don't-challenge-a- president-with-high-approval-ratings, gutless capitulation.
