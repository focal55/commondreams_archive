In branding Iran, Iraq and North Korea as an &#34;axis of evil,&#34; and deliberately 
evoking the Fascist moniker chosen by Hitler's Germany, Mussolini's Italy and 
Tojo's Japan, President George W. Bush has laid out both broad strategic aims 
of his &#34;first war of the 21st century&#34; and its justification. 
<P>The conflict is no longer &#34;just&#34; against terrorism with global reach. 
Rather, countries unfriendly to America will be prevented -- by war if necessary 
-- from developing chemical, nuclear or biological warheads and the missiles needed 
to deliver them. &#34;The civilized world faces unprecedented dangers,&#34; the 
President said, warning that inaction, like appeasement 60 years ago, will lead 
to disaster.</P>
<P>That the Second World War ended in obliterating nuclear flashes that incinerated 
tens of thousands of people, and that now an American president is willing to 
wage war to avert such a catastrophe being visited on an American city, may be 
an irony lost on Baghdad, Tehran or Pyongyang.</P>
<P>In one sense, Mr. Bush's new strategy simply adds a pre-emptive offensive component 
to his long-championed National Missile Defence. North Korea, Iran and Iraq all 
have, or are close to having, long-range missiles. All three are known to be seeking 
nuclear weapons capability. Iran and Iraq have -- and have used -- chemical weapons.</P>
<P>So, instead of relying solely on a defensive antimissile shield to protect 
against surprise attacks from &#34;rogue states,&#34; as those three countries 
used to be dubbed, the President has now laid down justification for a pre-emptive 
war, while stopping well short of any clear ultimatum.</P>
<P>&#34;By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and 
growing danger,&#34; Mr. Bush said. &#34;They could provide these arms to terrorists, 
giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt 
to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference 
would be catastrophic.&#34;</P>
<P>But little except military ambition and visceral antipathy to the United States 
links the new &#34;axis.&#34; Iran, a large, sophisticated and -- compared to 
the Arab world -- relatively democratic society, is Iraq's bitter rival and sometime 
enemy. The two fought a brutal eight-year war in the 1980s. Iraq, a secular and 
brutal police state, has been America's nemesis ever since Saddam Hussein survived 
the first president Bush's deliberately aborted gulf war. North Korea, where half 
the population verges on starvation while the bizarre Kim Jong-il, son of reclusive 
Kim il-Sung, runs a Stalinist regime that is both quixotic and draconian.</P>
<P>Mr. Bush lumps the three together. But each poses a vastly different threat 
and none seems as easily attackable as the Taliban's Afghanistan, where a regime 
with no friends and little military strength proved relatively easy prey for a 
combination of air power, special forces and proxy militias.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, at least one other undemocratic and already nuclear-armed regime, 
Pakistan, which on Sept. 10 was an isolated pariah state headed by a military 
ruler, apparently poses no such threat -- simply by virtue of having bowed to 
Washington's blunt and far-reaching demands in the wake of the terrorist attacks 
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</P>
<P>Equally problematic will be Washington's difficulty in assembling any sort 
of coalition against North Korea, Iran or Iraq, let alone finding military partners 
in a conflict.</P>
<P>Iran has lots of friends. Beijing won't stand by if North Korea is attacked. 
And even Iraq commands far more sympathy in the West and support in the Arab world 
than the Taliban's Afghanistan.</P>
<P>President Bush &#34;may have put himself in a box because by talking so tough 
he may have to do something,&#34; James Lindsay, a senior fellow at The Brookings 
Institution, said yesterday.</P>
<P>While the White House insisted that the President's tough talk wasn't &#34;sending 
a signal that military action is imminent,&#34; and that the Bush administration 
was still willing to talk to Tehran and Pyongyang (but not Baghdad), the next 
step remains destabilizing vague.</P>
<P>Ivo Daalder, another senior, foreign policy studies fellow at Brookings, said 
he believed it was a &#34;colossal mistake&#34; for Mr. Bush to have put Iran 
and North Korea in the same category as Baghdad, because it forces the administration 
&#34;into to a highly confrontational policy.&#34;</P>
<P>Given the relative speed and ease with which military action toppled the Taliban, 
and at the same time silenced criticism from both Washington's allies and its 
traditional rivals, the Bush administration may be hoping that similarly aggressive 
leadership against tougher adversaries will produce similarly docile support, 
or at worst, silence, in the future.</P>
<P>At home, the President, who enjoys record high approval ratings, can be sure 
of broad domestic support for his tough stance, as he has since Sept. 11. Backing 
for Mr. Bush has extended across the political spectrum.</P>
<P>The President may also believe that rhetoric and sabre-rattling after the military 
success in Afghanistan will cow (or persuade) at least some of the new triumvirate 
of evil to dramatically change course -- rather like General Pervez Musharraf's 
transformation from pariah head of a military government to Washington's newest 
best friend.</P>
<P>That seems unlikely.</P>
<P>&#34;Little Bush's accusation against Iraq is baseless,&#34; Salim al-Qubaisi, 
head of Iraq's puppet parliament's foreign-relations committee, said yesterday. 
In Tehran, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said the world wasn't ready to accept 
American hegemony. And in North Korea, state radio spouted a somewhat more venomous-than-usual 
denunciation of America.</P>
<P>Still, Washington and Tehran both made efforts in the wake of Sept. 11 to restart 
a dialogue. That may yet re-emerge. Currently, the Bush administration is in high 
dudgeon over an alleged Iranian arms shipment to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority 
and Tehran's interference in western Afghanistan.</P>
<P>Yet, to dismiss President Bush's grim warning that -- with or without allies, 
and whether or not the world approves -- America will not risk the calamitous 
possibility that a rogue state could obliterate a U.S. city as rhetorical sabre-rattling, 
would be to forget very recent history.</P>
<P>Within hours of the shocking sights of the World Trade Center towers collapsing 
and entombing thousands of Americans, Mr. Bush told a still reeling country that 
he would destroy states harbouring terrorist organizations. In Kabul, the Taliban 
regime didn't take him seriously. Nor, perhaps, did America's friends.</P>
