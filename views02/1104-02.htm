<p>It's underrecognized and underreported. It's also one of the most significant 
epidemics in the world today.</p>
<p>It's gender violence, manifested essentially as violence against women. A new 
report by the World Health Organization addresses the devastating effects worldwide 
of gender violence. According to the report, it claims almost 1.6 million lives 
each year, about 3 percent of deaths by all causes. Women of all social classes 
and religions suffer significant harm to their health and quality of life. This 
epidemic demands new, more effective policies.</p>
<p>Domestic violence is perhaps the most common kind of gender violence around 
the world. Few precise figures exist, but sometimes the numbers can be shocking. 
Some studies conducted in the United States reveal that each year approximately 
4 million women are attacked by their husbands or partners.</p>
<p>According to another U.S. study, violence against women is responsible for 
a large proportion of medical visits, and for approximately one-third of emergency 
room visits. Another study found that in the United States, domestic violence 
is the most frequent cause of injury in women treated in emergency rooms, more 
common than motor vehicle accidents and robberies combined. It is estimated that 
their treatment costs between $3 billion and $5 billion a year.</p>
<p>No wonder public health experts consider violence against women a global public 
health issue, one requiring a public health approach. Worldwide, violence is as 
common a cause of death and disability among women of reproductive age as cancer, 
and a greater cause of ill health than traffic accidents and malaria together.</p>
<p>Various cultural, economic and social factors, including shame and fear of 
retaliation, contribute to women's reluctance to report these acts. Legal and 
criminal systems in many countries make the process difficult. Frequently, fear 
keeps women trapped in abusive relationships. It has been found that almost 80 
percent of all serious gender-violence injuries and deaths occur when female victims 
of violence try to leave a relationship, or after they have left.</p>
<p>The stubborn fact is that in many countries, violence against women, especially 
in the domestic setting, is seen as normal behavior. The belief that men have 
a right to abuse women tends to perpetuate violent situations. In that sense, 
domestic violence exemplifies perverse power relationships. When these kind of 
relationships become established, people become conditioned to accept violence 
as a legitimate means of settling conflicts, both within the family and in society 
at large, thus creating and perpetuating a vicious cycle. Violence begets violence, 
and often does irreparable damage to the family and to the social structure.</p>
<p>Although physical violence and sexual violence are easier to see, other forms 
of violence include emotional abuse, such as verbal humiliation, threats of physical 
aggression or abandonment, economic blackmail, and forced confinement to the home. 
Many women consider psychological abuse and humiliation even more devastating 
than physical violence. The experience of violence makes female victims more susceptible 
to a variety of problems such as depression, suicide, and alcohol and drug abuse.</p>
<p>Studies in Bolivia and Puerto Rico found that 58 percent of battered women 
had been sexually assaulted by their partners; in Colombia that figure was 46 
percent. Sexual violence increases women's risk of contracting sexually transmitted 
diseases, including AIDS (through forced sexual relations or the difficulty in 
persuading men to use condoms). It also increases the number of unplanned pregnancies 
and may lead to various gynecological problems such as chronic pelvic pain and 
painful intercourse.</p>
<p>Increasingly, the health sector is being urged to consider domestic violence 
as a serious health problem and to research the causes, consequences and ways 
to prevent it. Such a multi-causal problem demands a multi-faceted response, with 
the involvement of different sectors (legal, educational, labor, justice, criminal 
and public health) in the search for solutions. For too long violence against 
women has remained an ignored epidemic. The above evidence shows why it shouldn't 
continue to be so.</p>

Americas: The Social Pandemic of the 20th Century.&quot; </i></p> </p>
