<p>PARIS</b> </a> The death in Baghdad of the Abu Nidal, the Palestinian terrorist, 
conveys a lesson generally neglected in today's American war against terrorism.
<p>The lesson is that Middle Eastern terrorism has been around for a long time 
and has been worse in the past than it is today. It has never been “defeated,” 
nor have its motivations ever been simple. Americans did not notice, because they 
were rarely the victims. Americans noticed Al Qaeda because Osama bin Laden made 
them notice last Sept. 11, and because he declares the United States his enemy.
<p>For Abu Nidal, there were two avowed enemies: Israel and the Palestinian leaders 
who were prepared to consider a peaceful settlement with Israel. Whether these 
were really his enemies, or whether he was a hired gun, of Israel among others, 
is questioned, as Patrick Seale has written (<i>IHT, Aug. 22</i>). The current 
violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been an appalling form 
of war between two defined national entities, the Palestinians and the Israelis, 
with the two sides using the weapons available to them, high-tech on the Israeli 
side, the suicidal act of terrorism on the Palestinian. Abu Nidal's organization, 
in contrast, practiced terror for personal power and profit. His followers killed 
or wounded nearly a thousand people in 20 countries between 1973 and 1994. Had 
he thought of crashing airplanes into office towers, and found the people to do 
it, and had it been useful to him, he undoubtedly would have killed many more 
than Al Qaeda has done. His seeming obsession was the destruction of Israel. But 
his actions, overall, tended to suit Israel's tactical interests. Some in the 
Arab world accused him of cynical secret collaboration with Israel, contributing 
to the subversion of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and providing a pretext 
for Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 - in an effort to destroy that organization, 
which then had its headquarters there.
<p>Israel's creation had ruined his father and family, before 1948 one of the 
richest and most successful in the old British Mandated Palestine. His father 
was said to have controlled l0 percent of pre-1948 Palestine's produce exports 
to Europe. The family's agricultural properties were expropriated by Israel. He 
joined Yasser Arafat's Fatah.
<p>After the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when Israel had been shocked by its initial 
defeats in simultaneous Egyptian and Syrian invasions, Yasser Arafat gave his 
first indication of possible compromise with the Israelis. Abu Nidal broke with 
him. He began killing those PLO officials who approached the Israelis about peace. 
He was responsible for the murders of PLO representatives in London, Brussels, 
and Rome. His people attacked Arafat deputies and associates in the organization's 
exile headquarters in Tunis. Some credit Abu Nidal's attacks on PLO moderates 
as having seriously if not fatally delayed Palestinian implementation of the peace 
program launched in Oslo in 1993.
<p>He also believed in the utility of indiscriminate terror. His organization 
attacked passengers on a Greek tourist ship, worshippers at Sabbath services in 
a Turkish synagogue and several airliners. In 1982, his militants bombed a well-known 
Jewish restaurant in Paris. In 1985, on the same day and at the same hour, they 
machine-gunned crowds at El Al counters in Rome and Vienna.
<p>He was sentenced in absentia to death in Italy, and was wanted by courts or 
investigators in the United States, Britain and France. The PLO condemned him 
to death. His presence in Iraq has been one reason given by the United States 
for calling that nation a &quot;rogue state.&quot; The State Department once described 
his group as &quot;the most dangerous terrorist organization in existence.&quot; 
<p>Some in the Middle East concluded that he was a psychopath, a victim of paranoia 
that caused him to murder some 150 of his own followers, suspected of dissidence. 
Others, as Seale has written, thought him a mercenary traitor to his ostensible 
cause. He has been quiet for the last 10 years, and now he is dead - according 
to the Iraqis a traitor to their interests. Possibly he had been recruited, via 
intermediaries in the Gulf, to the American cause, so as to spare the United States 
a war to dispose of Saddam Hussein. Possibly even Mossad got back to him. Possibly 
Saddam simply decided that he was an inconvenience. Only his enemies still remembered 
him, until his death sent the newspaper obituary writers to their files this week. 
But in his day he did a lot of harm, and was a big man - just as Osama bin Laden 
is a big man today.
