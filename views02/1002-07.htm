<p>Although the economy was slowing even before President Bush took office, he 
has made the situation much worse than it had to be. What could have been a mild 
and brief recession has instead turned into a prolonged downturn likely to last 
more than two years.
<p>In terms of increases in unemployment and the gap between the economy's actual 
and potential performance, the downturn is already substantial.
<p>The president appears to believe that every economic problem is spelled T-A-X.
<p> That misguided thinking has precluded him from adopting a sound policy program.
<p>The centerpiece of his economic agenda, the tax cut that he pushed through 
Congress, was fiscally irresponsible.
<p>The administration also disingenuously disguised the true cost of the tax cut, 
both by having it magically disappear in 2010 and by using the little-known alternative 
minimum tax to reduce the recorded revenue loss.
<p>The administration belatedly tried to sell the tax cut as a short-term stimulus 
measure, but that is like arguing that a few new Ferraris are the solution to 
a city's public transportation problems. The cost-effectiveness is abysmally low.
<p>A much better alternative to the sports car approach to economic stimulus would 
have provided assistance to states and localities to meet the fiscal shortfall 
that inevitably develops as the economy goes into a downturn.
<p>This assistance would have provided more generous unemployment benefits to 
displaced workers, who will almost immediately spend the money on goods and services.
<p>Similarly, on the corporate scandals, the Bush administration should have acted 
faster and more resolutely.
<p>The administration still has not advocated legislation forcing companies to 
properly report stock options as expenses. The indiscriminate awarding of such 
options has been shown to be an important underlying source of the problems facing 
corporate America; they provided strong incentives to report large profits, and 
top executives did better for themselves by increasing these reported profits 
than by improving the fundamentals of the corporation.
<p>To be sure, I believed that the Clinton administration should have supported 
such a reform in the 1990s.
<p>At the time, my argument was based on the theory that bad information leads 
to bad decisions, with adverse consequences for the economy. Now we have the evidence.
<p>And yet the Bush administration still refuses to take the action.
<p>Some of my other qualms about economic policy during the 1990s apply with much 
more force now.
<p>For example, partly in an attempt to break the legislative deadlock with the 
conservative Republicans who took over Congress in 1995, the Clinton administration 
allowed the deregulation agenda to be pushed too far. But that does not mean Republican 
conservatives should be allowed to push it still further.
<p>Even today, the administration has not owned up to the excesses of the past--the 
mistakes, for instance, evidenced by electricity deregulation in California and 
elsewhere--nor has it set forth a program for dealing with the myriad scandals 
facing the financial industry, from allocations of initial public offerings of 
stock to distorted advice given by brokerage houses with clear conflicts of interest.
<p>As we should have learned long ago, market-friendly government regulation is 
necessary if markets are to work well.
<p>I wish that we had done more to address corporate welfare in the 1990s, but 
we didn't. Now Bush has made this situation much worse. Indeed, corporate coddling 
has reached new heights with soaring agriculture subsidies, most of which go to 
rich farmers and corporate farms, and new steel tariffs, which have rightly exposed 
us around the world to charges of hypocrisy.
<p>It's no secret that I am a tough grader on economic policy. The Bush administration 
may want to pretend that its F is really an A. But that won't change the reality.
<p>We'd all be better off if the administration would spend more time rethinking 
its policies and less time muddling the debate with doublespeak.</p>
<p><i>Joseph E. Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University, is a recipient of 
the 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in economics. He was chairman of the Council of 
Economic Advisors under President Clinton.</i></p>
