<p>Mark Twain was no fan of war, which he described as "a wanton waste of projectiles," 
and he nurtured a healthy disdain for anyone who suggested that patriotism was 
best displayed through enthusiastic support for military adventures abroad. The 
phrase "our country, right or wrong" was, he argued, "an insult to the nation." 
</p>
<p> But Twain's deepest disgust was reserved for politicians who played on fear 
and uncertainty to promote the interests of what would come to be known as the 
military-industrial complex. Describing how Americans were frequently goaded into 
war by their leaders, Twain recalled: "Statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting 
blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing 
falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations 
of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just, and 
will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque 
self-deception." </p>
<p> Twain, a longtime leader of the old Anti-Imperialist League, uttered those 
words a century ago. But for opponents of George W. Bush's election year efforts 
to justify war with Iraq, they ring truer than most of what has been said by Republican 
or Democratic candidates in Tuesday's congressional contests. </p>
<p> So much truer, in fact, that some anti-war activists have decided to vote 
for Twain. </p>
<p> Never mind that the author of "The Innocents Abroad," "Tom Sawyer," "Huckleberry 
Finn" and "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" has been dead since 1910, 
nor even that "Mark Twain" is merely the pen name for the prolific Samuel Clemens. 
Voters in western Wisconsin will be casting ballots Tuesday for Mark Twain for 
Congress. </p>
<p> The Twain campaign was started in the old Mississippi River town of LaCrosse, 
where activists with the La Crosse Coalition for Peace and Justice were upset 
with U.S. Representative Ron Kind, a Democrat who voted in October for the House 
resolution authorizing George W. Bush to wage a unilateral war against Iraq. Kind, 
a co-chair of the New Democrat Network, the congressional arm of the conservative 
Democratic Leadership Council, was the only one of five Democrats in Wisconsin's 
House delegation to vote in favor of the resolution. In fact, a pair of Wisconsin 
Democrats, Senator Russ Feingold and Representative Tammy Baldwin, were among 
the most outspoken congressional foes of the resolution. Baldwin was one of the 
chief organizers of opposition forces before the House vote on the Iraq resolution, 
which saw a majority of House Democrats oppose the president's position. </p>
<p> But Kind voted with a minority of House Democrats and a majority of House 
Republicans last month to give the president what Constitutional scholars have 
described as "unprecedented" war-making powers. Kind has said that, while he shares 
many of the reservations expressed by his constituents in regard to launching 
a war against Iraq, he thinks Congressional support for the president's position 
could cause Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to be more cooperative – thus making 
it possible to avoid war. </p>
<p> Kind's explanation of his stance have not gone down well with all of his constituents 
in a sprawling district where anti-war demonstrations and meetings have been held 
in a number of communities. But Kind's foes in this fall's contest did not exactly 
wow peace activists. Republican Bill Arndt is a pro-Bush, pro-war conservative, 
while Libertarian Jeff Zastrow offers little in the way of a progressive alternative 
to Kind. "We didn't see any competition for Kind, and we wanted to let him know 
we are disappointed in him," explained Daniel Poler, a Coalition for Peace and 
Justice member. </p>
<p> So the peace activists decided to launch a write-in campaign for Mark Twain. 
"It's a protest against the government and candidates, Kind in particular, for 
not listening to those of us against a war in Iraq," declared Poler. In the local 
newspaper, he explained the simple logic of the campaign: "A write-in vote for 
‘Mark Twain' will send a message to our representatives that we are very disappointed 
that our voices were not heard." </p>
<p> In a sense, Twain was a natural choice. The author visited towns on the Wisconsin 
side of the Mississippi, and wrote of them in his classic book, Life on the Mississippi. 
He even praised LaCrosse's "stately red brick buildings," a fact frequently mentioned 
in a city where the downtown is still made up of stately red brick buildings. 
Besides, Poler explained, in a city that prides itself on its river heritage, 
"(Twain's) name is easy to remember." </p>
<p> Kind is not exactly sweating the challenge. The congressman is confident that 
he will best the author and all other comers. And for good reason. LaCrosse is 
a reliably Democratic city, and Kind, a three-term incumbent, is popular the surrounding 
rural counties that make up Wisconsin's Third Congressional District. Yet, the 
region has a long history of anti-war activism, going back to the days when it 
was a hotbed of support for former U.S. Senator Robert M. La Follette and the 
Wisconsin Progressives who opposed World War I. </p>
<p> After the House vote on Iraq, a local activist paid $1,800 for space on a 
prominently placed billboard, which now reads, "No War with Iraq. Ron Kind Should 
Resign." And the LaCrosse Peace and Justice Coalition has organized a number of 
anti-war demonstrations, including one at a downtown park on November 2, where 
the Twain candidacy was promoted. Write-in campaigns rarely yield big tallies 
on election day. But the Twain campaign seems to be connecting with some voters; 
a pre-election letter to the editor from LaCrosse resident John Schaldach criticized 
Kind's vote on the Iraq resolution and noted that, "A friend e-mailed me today 
about a grassroots campaign to write in Mark Twain for the 3rd congressional district 
in protest of Ron Kind's vote on the resolution. In that (Kind) is facing extremely 
weak opposition, this seems like a safe year to register a protest vote." </p>
<p> Thus, Schaldach concluded, "On Nov. 5, I will vote Mark Twain." </p>
<p> Despite Schaldach's commitment, the Twain campaign remains an uphill effort. 
That's probably for the best, as the author never showed much interest in winning 
a place in the U.S. Capitol. It was Twain who observed that: "It could probably 
be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly native American criminal 
class except Congress." </p>
