<p>TOKYO -- THE details may change each year, but when the 14th International 
AIDS Conference got underway last week in Barcelona, the flood of alarming statistics 
about the progression of the disease around the world was entirely familiar.</p>
<P> Soon, average life expectancy will dip below 40 years in 10 African countries. 
Twenty-five million children will be orphaned worldwide by the disease by the 
end of the decade. In Russia, H.I.V. infection has increased 15-fold in three 
years. In China, 17 percent of the population has yet to hear of AIDS, even as 
the disease takes off there in earnest.</p>
<P> Sometime soon, AIDS will have killed more people than all the wars of the 
20th century. Yet, in a paradoxical way, the most pessimistic data coming out 
of the conference may come from the few bright spots, including the United States 
and a few other rich countries.</p>
<P> People in the United States and Western Europe, where annual treatments may 
average $35,000 per patient, have begun to think of AIDS as a survivable condition. 
Each year, moreover, new data seem to feed a growing conviction in the wealthiest 
countries that the epidemic has been blunted in their own backyards. </p>
<P> In Japan, the world's second-largest economy and a lavish spender on scientific 
research, there has never been an AIDS epidemic. Search as one might, it was nearly 
impossible last week to find more than a brief mention of the Barcelona conference 
in newspapers.</p>
<P> AIDS has always created a chasm between rich and poor. More than ever before, 
though, the pandemic is carving up the world into islands of affluence, medical 
prowess and good governance, and vast regions of poverty, imploding institutions 
and despair.</p>
<P> Perhaps the most glaring symbol of this divide is the tepid Western response 
to the United Nations' plea for $10 billion a year to fight AIDS. Many experts 
call this the minimum amount needed to blunt the epidemic and care for the sick 
and dying. But the world's rich nations, lacking the same sense of urgency that 
drove them to action in response to Al Qaeda, or in the gulf war, are now offering 
less than one-third of this sum.</p>
<P> Strong moral objections have long been raised to the West's seeming indifference 
to the plight of many African societies. And yet the growing magnitude of the 
AIDS crisis has tested the illusion of invulnerability, prompting a search for 
more pragmatic solutions.</p>
<P> "The world stood by when AIDS was spreading in Africa," said Peter Piot, executive 
director of the United Nations AIDS program. "We can't do the same thing now that 
it is spreading in Eastern Europe, at the doorsteps of the E.U."</p>
<P> Beyond the universe of AIDS experts, however, many people involved in international 
affairs say appeals to realism like this do not go far enough. For them, the central 
lesson of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks is that in today's globalized world there 
is no such thing as lasting insulation from other people's crises. When entire 
societies are allowed to collapse and human miseries are permitted to fester, 
sooner or later those who had the means to help do something about it but didn't 
will have a steep bill to pay.</p>
<P> TODAY, some people will say, `Why should we care?' " said Joseph S. Nye Jr., 
dean of the Kennedy School at Harvard University and author of "The Paradox of 
American Power" (Oxford University, 2002). "Well, in the mid-1990's, many people 
said pretty much the same thing about Afghanistan: `It is in terrible shape, but 
what does it matter to us?' On Sept. 11 we found out what it matters to us."</p>
<P> If the challenge from AIDS was limited primarily to Africa, a continent perennially 
shunted to the periphery of the world's concerns, some might still maintain that 
wealthy nations need do little more than apply the kinds of Band-Aids and moral 
salves that are being employed there now. According to yet another statistic issued 
in Barcelona, although 28.5 million of the world's 40 million people infected 
with H.I.V. live in Africa, only about 30,000 Africans are receiving treatment 
with anti-retroviral drugs.</p>
<P> Year by year, however, it is becoming clearer that Africa is hardly alone. 
In Russia, the rate of infection is growing as fast as anywhere. China and India 
each acknowledge millions of recent cases, and yet both are thought to be vastly 
underreporting the crisis. In Indonesia, the disease has been spreading like wildfire.</p>
<P> In the future, the main hotspots highlighted in any new atlas of this epidemic 
will be major countries (albeit not Western ones) that are the anchors of entire 
regions. The doomsday scenarios that full-blown AIDS epidemics in all these places 
imply are almost too extreme to contemplate.</p>
<P> For self-interested Westerners, it is easy to conjure images of the devastation 
that could visit the more affluent parts of Europe if the former Soviet empire 
were to be sucked into the AIDS vortex: refugees streaming into Europe, economic 
collapse, even the outbreak of violence on such a scale that the rich nations 
might be forced to intervene. But the West is less accustomed to contemplating 
more distant catastrophes. </p>
<P> In thinking about India and China, Africa may once again serve as the best 
cautionary model of how a disease can change the course of human history. Africa, 
with all its problems, had made great strides in terms of life expectancy, and 
in some countries, economic development as well. Like a century suddenly torn 
off a calendar, those gains are now being wiped out, and with one-third or more 
of adults infected with H.I.V., few institutions can remain intact. </p>
<P> In living memory the world has seen mass death in places like China, with 
its great famine, and the damage has stayed contained. This is a vastly different 
era, though, one of huge trade and investment linking all parts of the world, 
not to mention the proliferation of nuclear weapons. And the wholesale collapse 
of institutions, like China's army — the world's largest — is something mankind 
has never seen.</p>
<P> Yet these are precisely the kinds of threats that the international conference-goers 
have been warning of.</p>
<P> Given such realities, it would seem the world is rapidly approaching a critical 
fork in the road. One way, perhaps, lies death on a scale unseen since the worst 
plagues of the past. The other way lies a Herculean common struggle against AIDS, 
of uncertain outcome. Either way, experts from a multitude of disciplines say 
everyone — rich and poor — will be involved.</p>
<P> "The message of Sept. 11 is that there are no more quarantines," said Ramesh 
Thakur, a political scientist and vice rector of the United Nations University 
in Tokyo, "and isolation is an illusion."</p>
