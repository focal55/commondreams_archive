<p>The journalist I.F. Stone used to joke that the government issues so much information 
every day, it can't help but let the truth slip out every once in a while. The 
Bush Administration's recent report on global warming is a classic example. Though 
far from perfect, it contains some crucial but awkward truths that neither George 
W. Bush nor his environmentalist critics want to confront. Which may explain why 
the Administration has sought to bury the report, while critics have misrepresented 
its most ominous conclusion. </p>
<p> <i>U.S. Climate Action Report 2002</i> made headlines because it contradicted 
so much of what the Administration has said about global warming. Not only is 
global warming real, according to the report, but its consequences--heat waves, 
water shortages, rising sea levels, loss of beaches and marshes, more frequent 
and violent weather--will be punishing for Americans. The report's biggest surprise 
was its admission that human activities, especially the burning of oil and other 
fossil fuels, are the primary cause of climate change. Of course, the rest of 
the world has known since 1995 that human actions have "a discernible impact" 
on the global climate, to quote a landmark report by the United Nations Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change. But the White House has resisted this conclusion. After 
all, if burning fossil fuels is to blame for global warming, it makes sense to 
burn less of them. To a lifelong oilman like Bush, who continues to rely on his 
former industry colleagues for campaign contributions as well as senior staff, 
such a view is nothing less than heresy. </p>
<p>No wonder, then, that Bush and his high command have virtually repudiated the 
report. Although their staffs helped write it, both EPA Administrator Christine 
Todd Whitman and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham claimed they were unaware of 
the report until the <i>New York Times </i>disclosed its existence on June 3. 
Bush himself dismissed it as a mere product of "the bureaucracy," that oft-vilified 
bogyman of right-wing ideology. But he could equally have blamed his own father. 
The only reason <i>U.S. Climate Action Report 2002</i> was compiled in the first 
place is that George Bush the First signed a global warming treaty at the 1992 
Earth Summit that obligates the United States to periodically furnish such reports 
to the UN (one more reason, it seems, to despise treaties). But somebody in the 
Administration must have seen trouble coming, because the report could not have 
been released with less fanfare: It was simply posted on the EPA's website, three 
unguided links in from the homepage. If you weren't looking for it, you'd never 
find it. </p>
<p> The Administration has been hammered for issuing a report that on one hand 
admits that global warming threatens catastrophe but on the other maintains there 
is no need to reduce consumption of fossil fuels. The report squares this circle 
by arguing that global warming has now become inevitable, so we should focus less 
on preventing it than on adapting to it. To deal with water scarcity, for example, 
the report advocates building more dams and raising the price of water to encourage 
conservation. Critics see such recommendations as proof that the Administration 
is doing nothing about global warming. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. </p>
<p> The worst thing about the new global warming report is that it is absolutely 
correct about a fundamental but often unmentioned aspect of the problem: the lag 
effect. Most greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for approximately 100 years. 
The upshot of this undeniable chemical fact is that no matter what remedial steps 
are taken today, humanity is doomed to experience however much global warming 
the past 100 years of human activities will generate. That does not mean we should 
make matters worse by continuing to burn fossil fuels, as Bush foolishly urges; 
our children and grandchildren deserve better than that. It does mean, however, 
that we as a civilization must not only shift to green energy sources immediately 
but also begin planning how we will adapt to a world that is bound to be a hotter, 
drier, more disaster-punctuated place in the twenty-first century. </p>
<p> Many environmentalists know it is too late to prevent global warming; the 
best we can do is minimize its scope. They don't like to admit this truth, because 
they fear it will discourage people from making, and demanding, the personal and 
institutional changes needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There is that 
risk. But a truth does not disappear simply because it is inconvenient. Besides, 
a green energy future would mean more, not less, economic well-being for most 
Americans, while also increasing our chances of avoiding the most extreme global 
warming scenarios. Sometimes the truth hurts. But avoiding it will hurt even more.</p>
