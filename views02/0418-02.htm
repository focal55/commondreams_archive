What can an ordinary man do when he faces an enormous fire? He can try to flee 
the flames, abandoning to their fate all those who either cannot run or have nowhere 
to run to. He can stand around and moan. He can blame others. And he can also 
fill the teaspoon he holds in his hand with water, over and over again, and splash 
it on the blaze.
<p>Every one of us has a teaspoon.</p>
<p>During these days, every man of peace must draw water &#150; at least enough 
to fill the spoon he holds &#150; and pour it on the fire: make his voice heard, 
object to war crimes by either side, help the victims of these war crimes; demonstrate, 
persuade, write, debate, garner support for reasonable compromise, oppose the 
continuation of the Israeli occupation and the Islamic/anti-Semitic campaign for 
Israel's extermination. The spoon in the ordinary man's hand is truly very small, 
and the fire large indeed &#150; but even so he must use it.</p>
<p>In Israel, and in Palestine as well, there must be a "teaspoon muster", joined 
by every person willing to do his utmost to halt the wheels of the repression, 
the killing, the retaliation, and the retaliation for retaliation.</p>
<p>On the Israeli side, it is best to talk not of "unilateral separation", but 
specifically of an Israeli initiative to end the occupation, for the defense of 
the state of Israel.</p>
<p>Today, the majority of the Israeli public can be mobilized to topple the settlers' 
government and elect in its stead a coalition with realistic positions. All this 
is to be based on a plan. If the Palestinian leadership agrees to this plan, all 
the better; but this plan's great advantage is that it can be implemented even 
if the Palestinian leadership remains neck-deep in belligerency, or prisoner in 
the hands of the forces of jihad.</p>
<p>1. Israel will end the occupation of the Palestinian population, and will set 
up a closed, fortified line in accordance with demographic reality &#150; a line 
not the same as the Green Line, but adjacent to it &#150; that will include no 
occupied Palestinian population. The permanent Israel-Palestine borders will be 
determined through negotiation, with the Palestinian leadership proving, by its 
deeds, that it has renounced the Islamic campaign to annihilate Israel.</p>
<p>2. Israel will agree to the immediate establishment of a Palestinian state 
in the populated Palestinian areas, even if this state arises before a peace treaty 
is signed between the sides. Militarily and morally, it will be easier for Israel 
to face an enemy state than to continue fighting a cluster of armed gangs.</p>
<p>3. Israel will morally acknowledge that it played a role in bringing about 
the Israeli-Palestinian tragedy. At the same time, it will demand of every decent 
man that he acknowledge the role of the Arab countries and the Palestinians in 
this tragedy.</p>
<p>The calamity of the Palestinian refugees is one of the origins of the violence, 
the hatred, and the terror. Israel must accept no solution that does not include 
the human, economic, and political rehabilitation of the Palestinian refugees 
&#150; not within Israel's borders, but in their homeland, Palestine &#150; through 
international and Israeli participation in the task of rehabilitation.</p>
<p>4. A comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Arab war must be sought not only 
between Israel and the Palestinian leadership, but also, and perhaps primarily, 
between Israel and the Arab League (which perhaps has the power to restrain displays 
of Palestinian extremism). The Saudi plan, some of whose elements were adopted 
by the Arab League, can serve as a point of departure &#150; but definitely not 
as the finish line &#150; for negotiations between Israel and the League on a 
comprehensive solution to the Israel-Arab war.</p>
<p>5. A unilateral Israeli move to end the occupation, including the dismantling 
of the vast majority of the settlements, would come about only if the burden of 
minimizing the danger that Israeli society is being asked to face is shouldered 
by those who demand that Israel carry out such a move in the absence of an Israeli-Palestinian 
agreement.</p>
<p>The condition for ending the occupation will not be some paper signed by Yasser 
Arafat, but a solid agreement concretely linking Israel with NATO and the European 
Union, so as to deter the promoters of the Islamic holy war and to lay to rest 
once and for all the dream of eliminating Israel &#150; and also to ensure that 
the end of the occupation will not be a shot in the arm encouraging those who 
are inflamed with warmongering Arab nationalism, and will not enable them to attack 
Israel after it relinquishes its control over the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Around such a plan as this, it will be possible to consolidate a majority of 
the public, a majority in the next elections, and perhaps even a majority in the 
current Knesset &#150; a majority that consists of the left, the center and the 
more pragmatic elements of the moderate right.</p>
