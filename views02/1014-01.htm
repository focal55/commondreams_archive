<p> Why? Yesterday's crime against humanity in Bali provoked an almost identical 
reaction to the atrocities of 11 September 2001. Everyone wanted to know who had 
planted the bombs &#150; almost certainly a satellite of al-Qa'ida &#150; and 
everyone wanted to know how the killers planned their massacre.</p>
<p>But no one &#150; neither the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, nor Tony 
Blair nor Jack Straw &#150; wanted to talk about motives. "Terrorism" was the 
all-important word (an accurate one too), which was used to smother any discussion 
about what lay behind the crime.</p>
<p>Australians were the principal victims and their murderers must have known 
they would be. So why were they targeted? John Howard has been among President 
Bush's toughest supporters. Australia lined up to join the "war on terror" within 
24 hours of the attacks on New York and Washington last year. Australian special 
forces have been operating with American troops in the Afghan mountains against 
al-Qa'ida. It's a fair bet that yesterday's savagery was al-Qa'ida hitting back.</p>
<p>The French have already paid a price for their initial support for Mr Bush. 
The killing of 11 French submarine technicians in Karachi has been followed by 
the suicide attack on the French oil tanker <i>Limburg</i> off the coast of Yemen. 
Now, it seems, it is the turn of Australia.</p>
<p>If the group which set off the three bombs in Bali is one of the "Islamist" 
movements on the edge of al-Qa'ida, the choice of target was familiar: a nightclub, 
a place associated in the mind of Islamists with sex, alcohol and immorality &#150; 
the same type of target Palestinian suicide bombers have struck in Israel.</p>
<p>If millions of Muslims are revolted at the Bali massacre, few will approve 
of nightclubs. The usual moral slippage can be employed; the bombing was terrible, 
but ... Or so the murderers will hope.</p>
<p>The victims were largely young civilians, just as innocent as the thousands 
who died in the World Trade Center. Civilians get no quarter in this war, whether 
they are investment brokers in New York, Afghan families or Australian honeymooners.</p>
<p>So who is next? When is Britain's turn? Where are Britons most at risk? Alas, 
they are scattered across the globe in embassies, on holidays, on every airline 
of the world. Our support for the United States &#150; an infinitely closer alliance 
than any support from France &#150; makes Britain the most likely candidate for 
attack after the US. Then there are the small, more vulnerable nations that give 
quiet assistance to the American military; Belgium, which hosts Nato HQ; Canada, 
whose special forces have also been operating in Afghanistan; Ireland, which allows 
US military aircraft to refuel at Shannon.</p>
<p>Bali only emphasizes what the last year should have taught us: that individual 
innocence no longer protects us, that we are living &#150; whether we know it 
or not &#150; in a terrifying new age.</p>
