<p>This past weekend, the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) convened a national 
conversation in New York City. Politicians of all stripes gathered to rub shoulders 
with lobbyists and corporate contributors in the smarmy swirl that characterizes 
DLC meetings. The DLC generally uses these occasions to suggest ways that Democrats 
can benefit by becoming more like Republicans. But on this occasion, members of 
the DLC should have considered following the example set by Fed Chair Alan Greenspan 
in his recent Senate testimony: admit up front that they've been wrong. For in 
the current situation, the DLC is simply out of step with the needs of the country 
and the opinion of a growing majority of Americans. Here are just a few of the 
issues the DLC gets wrong: </p>
<p> 1. At a time when the public thinks big business has too much influence in 
Washington, the DLC's mission is to increase the influence of business in the 
Democratic Party. Or as Simon Rosenberg, head of the DLC's corporate-funded political 
action committee, the New Democrat Network, put it, "We're trying to raise money 
to help them lessen their reliance on traditional interest groups in the Democratic 
Party." But today, two-thirds of the public says big business already has too 
much influence in Washington. By 50 to 37 percent, Americans say Bush favors the 
interests of big corporations over ordinary working people. By 49 to 37 percent, 
they say Democrats favor ordinary working people. That advantage would disappear 
if the DLC has its way. </p>
<p> 2. New Democrats joined with conservative Republicans in contributing to the 
current mess. DLC icon Senator Joe Lieberman and other New Dems joined with Gingrich 
and Republicans to pass securities "reform," a centerpiece of Gingrich's Contract 
With America, over President Clinton's veto. The measure, which the DLC touts 
to this day, made it harder for shareholders to hold executives and accountants 
liable for misleading reports. Clinton is surely right to now point to this measure 
as contributing directly to the current scandals. </p>
<p> New Democrats in the House and Senate, led by the ethically challenged former 
New Dem co-chair Representative Jim Moran, worked with Republicans to frustrate 
Arthur Levitt, Clinton's chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in Levitt's 
attempt to ban auditors from doing consulting for the companies they audit. As 
Clinton notes, this led directly to the Enron scandals, in which auditors had 
every incentive to ignore shady off-the-books maneuvers. </p>
<p> And Lieberman, the DLC's favored candidate for President, made the fight against 
honest accounting of executive stock options his personal mission. Honest accounting, 
urged by such "radicals" like Alan Greenspan and Warren Buffett, would have tempered 
the abuse of stock options; as things stood, executives had a multimillion-dollar 
incentive to cook the books in the short term so they could cash out. Lieberman 
continues to block efforts for this reform to this day, but now claims, in his 
best Claude Raines imitation, to be shocked that stock options have been abused, 
and haven't been used to redistribute wealth, as he thought. </p>
<p> 3. New Dems joined with Republicans in diluting efforts to clean up the current 
mess. New Dems in the House offered bipartisan support for the Republican accounting 
reform bill that was certified as harmless by the accountants' lobby. Before the 
WorldCom revelations, when it looked like reform was going to be bottled up in 
the Senate, Lieberman and DLC head Al From launched a PR drive to warn Democrats 
against being antibusiness and doing too much. </p>
<p> Lieberman, as chair of the Senate Operations Committee, has been notably reluctant 
to trace Enron's use of political money and clout in the Bush and Clinton Administrations 
and Congress. Part of the reason may be that, according to Federal Election Commission 
reports, the New Democrat Network PAC received more than $250,000 in contributions 
from companies implicated in the Enron scandals, including $25,000 from Enron 
in 2000 and $20,000 from Arthur Andersen last year. </p>
<p> 4. Led by Senator John Breaux, New Democrats have helped to block a real prescription-drug 
benefit for seniors. The key issue is whether the benefit will use the power of 
Medicare to negotiate the best price for seniors. For drug companies, this is 
heresy. They headed a multimillion-dollar fundraiser for Republicans last month, 
after which President Bush repaid them with a speech opposing efforts to limit 
drug prices. New Dems are less expensive. According to a study released by Public 
Citizen, the New Democratic Network pocketed some $475,000 from drug companies 
over the past twenty-one months, and its single biggest donor was the drug lobby, 
at $50,000. Breaux is also leading the efforts to turn Medicare into a voucher 
program, which would increase risk and cost to seniors already struggling to pay 
soaring health costs on fixed incomes. </p>
<p> 5. The DLC champions privatization of Social Security as a centerpiece of 
its program for the new century. Or in DLC speak, as Will Marshall, one of its 
founders, puts it, "using choice and competition to advance...the big social insurance 
programs like Social Security and Medicare." The DLC provides bipartisan support 
for a Bush folly that, as Senator Tom Daschle says, would turn Social Security 
from a guarantee into a gamble. </p>
<p> 6. The DLC trumpets the corporate trade agenda, scorning efforts to build 
environmental and worker rights protections into trade accords. The DLC campaigns 
on this cause to this day, even as the US trade deficit has reached levels that 
Alan Greenspan announces are unsustainable, the dollar is sinking and a harsh 
readjustment is threatened. </p>
<p> 7. The DLC opposes affirmative action. DLC leaders initially criticized Clinton's 
decision to mend, not end, affirmative action. The Hyde Park Declaration, their 
last major policy statement, contains a thinly masked call to end affirmative 
action, saying we should "shift the emphasis of affirmative action strategies 
from group preferences to economic empowerment of all disadvantaged citizens." 
</p>
<p> 8. The DLC's political advice is often wrongheaded. The most recent DLC insight 
is that Democrats should target affluent, white, office-park males-one of the 
most Republican constituencies in the electorate. To appeal to that constituency, 
the DLC says, Democrats should abandon any populist rhetoric, tone down the drive 
for corporate accountability, embrace fiscal austerity and free trade, and distance 
themselves from unions. That may make for good corporate fundraising, but it's 
hard to imagine a better recipe for defeat. </p>
<p> 9. The DLC remains wedded to fiscal austerity, even though we've gone from 
peace and prosperity to war and recession. Like George W. Bush, the DLC sees no 
reason to allow fundamentally changed conditions to affect its ideological positions. 
Its support for investment in education and worker training, innovation and R&amp;D, 
and its opposition to Bush's tax cuts, have been laudable and helpful. But it 
remains wedded to a Coolidge Democrat position, arguing that returning the budget 
to surplus would help generate growth (by lowering long-term interest rates). 
The DLC has little to offer on policies needed to respond to the current crisis, 
because interest rates are already low, consumers and companies are tightening 
their belts, the stock market is tanking and the trade deficit is unsustainable. 
</p>
<p> Since the DLC is infamous for taking credit for every victory and blaming 
others for every defeat, its leaders are not likely to admit that they've been 
wrong. So a word of advice to aspiring politicians hoping for a future in the 
Democratic Party: Go to the banquets. Meet the money. Taste the food. But be wary 
of the moonshine they are peddling at the podium.</p> </p>
