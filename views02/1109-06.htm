<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Why doesn’t our society see peace as a viable option?  We relegate 
peacemakers to the footnotes in our history books and all but ignore the 
important role nonviolence has played throughout history.

<p>Many of my students think that nonviolence means just laying down or 
getting stepped on, a passive act rather than a powerful active stance for 
justice.  We are taught to compartmentalize our lives, to put things in 
neat categories whose boundaries don’t touch.  Fight or flight, we’re taught.

<p>Violence is a simple dichotomy: good versus evil, right versus wrong, you 
versus me.

<p>So how do we deal with that?

<p>By teaching young people about strategic, organized nonviolent 
strategy.  Peace is an inside job I was recently told.  It starts with 
taking a deep look at authenticity.  Is our education authentic?  Are 
standardized tests making us smarter and more well-equipped to deal with 
the real problems we encounter everyday?

<p>How do we feel about our career options?  Is work exciting?  Can we work in 
a way that nourishes our talents and skills and preserves the planet for 
the seventh future generation?  Are we autodidactic?

<p>How do we even get to the point where we can think of how we can enjoy our 
lives when problems like police brutality, racism, classism, 
gentrification, verbal violence, environmental injustice, neo-fascism, 
globalization, capitalism, misogyny, structural and institutional violence, 
militarism and the ever-expanding academic-prison-industrial complex are 
rampant.  Not to mention the ongoing global threat of nuclear weapons…

<p>It all seems so overwhelming when we stop to think about it.

<p>Fortunately, I received some words of comfort from a friend of mine who 
spent a month at the Findhorn Foundation in Scotland.  She said, “Leah, 
there is enough of everything.  Enough time, enough love, enough energy, 
enough resources and enough money to build and meet the needs of the entire 
planet.”  Those words are not utopic.

<p>It starts with a paradigm shift.  The problems we face are a result of a 
crisis of perception  of “us” versus “them” where we retain the good 
qualities and they embody the evil ones.  Life is not that simple.  Dr. 
King said that there’s some good in the worst of us and some evil in the 
best of us.  Hate the sin, not the sinner, he said.

<p>For my part, I have chosen to address the injustices in the world through 
education.  I believe in peace education because it is proactive - it is 
its own agenda.  It is a response, not a reaction.

<p>Peace education corrects the version of history that deems mankind is a 
violent and vicious species and instead tells the stories of where the 
anonymous, unsung peacemakers have quietly changed millions of lives.  It 
is the patient coursework that advocates reading the literature of peace, 
the words of Tolstoy and Dorothy Day, of Einstein and of Joan Baez.  It is 
the classroom instruction that encourages students to start learning in the 
real world.  Peace education advocates community service and a view of the 
world where the personal, local, national and global issues are interconnected.

<p>At this point, peace education is its own semester-long class where 
students venture daily to learn about how nonviolence applies to 
them.  They are in a Patch Adams-style learning environment where every 
student is a teacher and every teacher is a student.  When I am absent, my 
students teach the class.

<p>It’s more than just one class, though.  Peace must be a balance between 
content and process, where the material students learn in every class - 
French, History, Science, Math - is geared at promoting peace and 
responsible citizenship, and where the process is also nonviolent  where 
administrators, teachers and students share power rather than reinforcing 
the traditional patriarchal “power-over” structure.

<p>So what are you waiting for?  It starts with you.  Run don’t walk to get 
Grace Llewellyn’s book “The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School 
and Get a Real Life and Education.”  Grab William Upski Wimsatt’s book “No 
More Prisons.”  Watch “A Bug’s Life” and learn about the power dynamics 
that keep the ‘powerful few’ in power over the ‘powerless many’ and make 
the connections between that film and real life.

<p>Talk with your friends and your enemies  you probably have a lot in 
common.  Get organized.  You have power even though you might not be able 
to vote yet.  Take back this world and make it what you want it to be.
