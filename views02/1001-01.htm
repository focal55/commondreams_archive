<p>It sure smells like imperialism. That's the word historians use when powerful 
nations grab control of desired resources, be it the gold of the New World or 
the oil of the Middle East.
<p>Imperialist greed is what "regime change" in Iraq and "anticipatory self-defense" 
are all about, and all of the rest of the Bush administration's talk about security 
and democracy is a bunch of malarkey.
<p>In the laundry list of reasons the Bush team has been trotting out in defense 
of a unilateral invasion of Iraq, oil is never mentioned. Is the fact that Iraq 
holds a huge pool of oil a piddling footnote to this debate? Is that Gulf War 
protest sign, "No Blood for Oil," too cynical, even passe? Perhaps we should ask 
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who served as a Chevron director and 
had an oil tanker named after her.
<p> Despite her corporate connections, Rice is a scholar, and she should know 
her history: For 50 years, we and the British before us have assumed the same 
neocolonial posture vis-a-vis Iraq as we do with Saudi Arabia and its surrounding 
sheikdoms and Iran. The Gulf War, fought to save U.S. corporate interests in Kuwait 
and Saudi Arabia, was only the latest example of this heavy-handed policy. Think 
Halliburton and Vice President Dick Cheney.
<p>The strategy is pretty much the same as that drawn up by the Romans: Find and 
support local strongmen who can deliver the goods to the imperial capital, come 
hell or high water. How they treat their own people is not our business; we have 
never cared about democracy in the Mideast unless one of its dictators happened 
to fail to toe our line.
<p>That is why our CIA facilitated the rise to power of Iraq's Baath party and 
ultimately the succession of Saddam Hussein as its current leader. The first Bush 
administration supported Hussein, providing him with the means to wage chemical 
and biological war, up to the day he invaded Kuwait, another of our client states. 
After his defeat, we became totally disinterested in the freedom of the people 
of the countries we had rescued. So much so, in fact, that Saudi Arabia was allowed 
to thrive as the world capital of religious hatred and the major sponsor of terrorists, 
producing Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 hijackers who gave us the Sept. 11 
tragedy.
<p>The same contempt for democracy has marked our policy toward Iran, that other 
member of the "axis of evil" we helped create. When Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh 
moved to eliminate foreign control over Iran's oil, the CIA and its British counterpart 
overthrew him in 1953. Despite our babbling about democracy, we had no compunction 
about replacing the elected Mossadegh with a guy who claimed the hereditary right 
to the throne as shah of all shahs.
<p>When the shah dared to act in the interest of his people--and his own bank 
account--by bolstering the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the 
push for higher oil prices, we came to regard him, too, as expendable.
<p>Even our support of Israel had less to do with the struggle of a brave people 
for a deserved homeland and more with the usefulness of that country as an agent 
of our Mideast ambitions and a reliable ally in offsetting expanding Soviet influence 
in the region.
<p>With the end of the Cold War, we were at a loss for a noble rationale to justify 
our heavy Mideast presence, which has been enormously profitable to some American 
corporations and industries that are well represented in this administration. 
Support democracy? We do subsidize Israel, the region's only functioning democracy, 
but our motives look less than pure when we fawn over cooperative dictatorships 
such as the regime in the United Arab Emirates, which forked over $6.4 billion 
to Lockheed Martin for fighter jets and gives us access to its oil.
<p>Having just fought to free themselves from one of history's great empires, 
this nation's founding founders fiercely and repeatedly warned of the risks of 
imperial ambitions. Because of this, most Americans, whether liberal or conservative, 
grasp the fundamental truth that foreign entanglements destabilize, backfire and 
cost too much in lives and dollars. 
<p>Instead of exploiting our natural patriotism to fight a nonsensical war, our 
government should forgo the temptations of empire.
