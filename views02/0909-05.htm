<p>One sign of maturity is the ability to suffer outrage and gut-wrenching grief without going nuts. Days before America's saddest anniversary since Pearl Harbor, Americans remain clearly -- and justifiably -- outraged, and our grief is palpable. But must we go nuts?</p>
    <p> The administration's monomaniacal focus on Iraq's Saddam Hussein as the fount of all terrorism was starting to sound like a clinical case of transference until, in recent days, the White House seemed to take a deep breath. Wouldn't any clinician worth her salt observe that Hussein (without having done much of anything since last September) has become immensely bigger and more menacing precisely as Osama bin Laden (remember him?) has become less available?</p>
    <p> To say such a thing is, I know from hard experience, to invite the incredulity of those who wonder if you are proposing to wait until Hussein <i>does</i> something before you take care of that weasel. Well, actually, yes.</p>
    <p> It isn't as though the "something" the Iraqi president could do would change our way of life. We're not talking about Hitler (though the name keeps coming up). We're not talking about the Soviets, who did threaten to bury us. Hussein's military has been both decimated (by us) and exposed as unmenacing. What threat has Iraq uttered against us to justify the war talk that permeates Washington these days?</p>
    <p> Ah, but don't forget his weapons of mass destruction.</p>
    <p> I don't. But it strikes me as a little weird that we are willing to take lethal, potentially globally destabilizing action on our surmise that he (1) has such weapons and (2) intends to use them against us, when, as far as I can tell, we took no useful action in the face of pretty firm knowledge before last September. </p>
    <p> This point is made by Dennis L. Cuddy, a historical researcher, in one of the 150 or so books timed for publication at the 9/11 anniversary. Says Cuddy ("September 11 Prior Knowledge"): As early as the mid-1990s, more than 8,000 former Iraqi soldiers were settled around the United States by our government. Might some of those be terrorists?</p>
    <p> The CIA was monitoring hijacking leader Mohamed Atta in Germany until May 2000 -- about a month before he is believed to have come to the United States to attend flight school. Does it make sense that the monitoring stopped when he entered this country?</p>
    <p> "Relevant to the atttacks of Sept. 11," Cuddy says, "Vice President Cheney acknowledged that the government knew something big was going to happen soon, but they didn't have the details. Even if that were true, why was no preventive contingency planning done? Why was it not considered that the World Trade Center might be the target, since terrorists had already tried to blow it up once?"</p>
    <p> Cuddy's point is that we had sufficient prior knowledge to have prevented 9/11. Mine is that the knowledge Cuddy adduces shows how difficult it is to prevent terrorist attacks. Should we have shut down U.S. airports in light of the pre-9/11 threat? And for how long and at what cost to the U.S. and world economies?</p>
    <p> Maybe the difficulty of preventing the random acts of terrorism is another reason for our focus on Hussein.</p>
    <p> That's frustration. This is insanity: to believe that Saddam has chemical and biological weapons and, in addition, has murderous sympathizers around the world -- and to believe that his last order wouldn't be to unleash those weapons and those sympathizers on America and American interests abroad.</p>
    <p> That we are the principal target of his weapons of mass destruction is, as far as I can see, shakily based speculation. That we would be the principal target after an attack on Baghdad is beyond doubt. How then would such an attack reduce the threat of anti-American terrorism?</p>
    <p> But doesn't that amount to <i>defending </i> the Iraqi butcher? No, it is a call for a return to sanity. Alfred L. McAllister, a behavioral science professor at the University of Texas, Houston, did a survey on how Americans think of war and enemies pre-9/11 and post-9/11. He found significant increases in the numbers of those who, post-attack, believe  that military force is needed when  our economic security is threatened, that terrorists do not deserve to be treated like human beings and that in some nations, the leaders and their followers are no better than animals.  Oh, and he also found a significantly increased tendency to substitute euphemisms for "ghastly events."</p>
    <p> Perhaps like "regime change" for "premeditated murder?"</p>
