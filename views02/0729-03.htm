<p>The daily beat of the Washington drum gets louder and more insistent. It is 
assumed that Britain will answer the president's call to arms against Iraq. Every 
troop movement or redeployment by the UK Ministry of Defence is interpreted by 
commentators with urgent and inevitable significance. But before Bush comes to 
shove, the British government owes the people of the UK a clear explanation of 
the reasons why British forces may be asked to put their lives at risk. 
<P>By any standards, the prime minister's performance before the chairmen and 
women of the select committees of the House of Commons was a virtuoso one. But 
in his answers to the chairman of the foreign affairs committee, and to Charles 
Kennedy the following day at prime minister's questions, there were more than 
a few latent ambiguities, which Mr Blair did nothing to dispel in his end-of-term 
report to the press last week. 
<P>Let us begin by accepting that it is a reasonable assumption that Iraq under 
Saddam Hussein has continued to develop programs for chemical and biological weapons 
and may have the means of delivery. We can't be so sure of nuclear capability 
but, to be on the safe side, let us assume that Saddam Hussein is working towards 
it, as he has been in the past. 
<P>No government committed to the security of its citizens can sensibly exclude, 
in all possible circumstances, the use of military force. But equally, no government 
committed to the rule of international law can choose war unless it is convinced 
that all other avenues of action have been tried and exhausted. 
<P>It should be the first priority of the UN security council and all of its members 
to return the weapons inspectors to Iraq. We should not abandon the strategy of 
containment and deterrence followed since the end of the Gulf war in favor of 
military action unless there is compelling and immediate evidence that self-defence 
requires it. 
<P>What is the objective of current British policy towards Iraq? Military action 
should never be undertaken without clear and realistic political objectives that 
are capable of achievement. The current sanctions policy and no-fly zones are 
designed to contain the Iraqi regime and limit its ability to develop weapons, 
threaten its neighbors or destabilize the region. Can British national security 
only be served by joining in military action for the removal of the current regime? 
<P>If policy on Iraq is to change, the prime minister needs to inform the country. 
Even with a majority of 180, he cannot expect to be taken on trust. He cannot 
even expect to be taken on trust by his own party. 
<P>Where is the evidence to justify a change of policy? The prime minister has 
said that the government is planning to publish the evidence against Saddam Hussein, 
but that he would need to "choose his time" to do this. That time is now. If the 
government has the evidence, it should publish it. If the government is confident 
of its case, it should take it to the British people. 
<P>Just how will military action achieve a better state of peace? Does the British 
government share the somewhat improbable view of some US officials who claim that 
a new regime in Baghdad will create a "benign ripple effect" throughout the region, 
encouraging open and democratic government in neighboring Arab states and helping 
to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? 
<P>What if these officials are wrong and instead of a ripple of democracy there 
is a bow wave of instability? What if the Kurds in the north of Iraq use change 
in Baghdad as an opportunity to declare an independent Kurdistan? In the present 
fragile state of politics in Turkey, how can we expect Ankara to react? And would 
Iran stand quietly by? Would a dismembered Iraq add to or subtract from stability? 
In 1991 the allies most certainly regarded the break-up of Iraq as one of several 
powerful reasons for not marching on Baghdad after Iraq had been expelled from 
Kuwait. 
<P>Under what legal authority would military action be taken? The government's 
claim is that any British action in Iraq would be "in accordance with international 
law". Existing UN resolutions can be interpreted to permit military strikes as 
part of the enforcement of weapons inspection, as they were in December 1998, 
but they do not allow for regime change. Article 51 of the UN charter gives states 
the right of self-defence, but is silent on the issue of anticipatory action in 
self-defence. Even if the right to pre-emptive action in self-defence can be inferred, 
the imminence of an attack justifying it must be urgent. "Clear and present danger" 
must be given content if it is to justify military action under article 51. 
<P>If the earlier assumption about Iraq having biological and chemical weapons 
is valid, what assessment has the MoD made about the risk of them being used against 
any British force engaged in conflict against Iraq? Even more chillingly, what 
assessment has been made about the risks of them being used against Israel, and 
of the likely response of that nuclear-capable country? 
<P>Crucially, would the deployment of British troops be subject to a debate and 
an affirmative vote of the House of Commons? The prime minister told Charles Kennedy: 
"We will obviously consider how we can best consult the House properly should 
any such action arise." That response suggests that a vote will only be forthcoming 
if the government is confident of winning it. The prime minister is right to be 
anxious. It is not only Labour backbenchers that have been expressing reservations 
but also former Tory ministers still in the House such as Douglas Hogg and John 
Gummer and, outside the House, the former foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind. 
<P>There is only one way to consult parliament where British lives are concerned, 
and that is with a full debate and a substantive vote. If the prime minister avoids 
a vote in parliament because he thinks he would lose, he will have difficulty 
in leading public opinion in the country. 
<P>It has been a characteristic of the Falklands, the Gulf war, Bosnia, Kosovo, 
Sierra Leone and, more recently, Afghanistan, that the prime minister of the day 
has enjoyed majority support for British involvement in military action. As Sir 
Humphrey might say, it would be "courageous" of the prime minister to embark on 
a military campaign without public support this time. He can only expect that 
support if he answers the questions I have posed and takes the British people 
into his confidence.
