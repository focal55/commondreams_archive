<p>It's show time! Time for the Republican Party to deliver on decades of big 
promises to the true believers: Ban abortions! Renew family values! Win the drug 
war! Slash taxes! Just remember, guys, no more excuses about Democrats obstructing 
the GOP platform. Your bluff has been called.
<p>It is tempting for the Republicans to keep coasting on the wave of wartime 
popularity even though they now control both halls of Congress, but that tactic 
is risky, as the failure of the first Bush presidency attests. Foreign policy 
is an unpredictable business -- don't look now, but Muslim fundamentalists have 
won in Pakistan, Afghanistan is ungovernable and the U.S. march to war against 
Iraq to distract from the failure to smash Al Qaeda is mired in U.N. diplomacy.
<p>Not even another stunning victory over Saddam Hussein will be sufficient to 
ensure reelection for Bush if the economy is in the doldrums, if the national 
debt accelerates and if the Christian right is again frustrated in its relentless 
quest to ban abortions.
<p> The president and his party are now wholly responsible for stewardship of 
the American economy. Their fate two years from now will hang mostly on hard numbers: 
how many of us are unemployed and what remains of our 401Ks.
<p>Yet Bush's key palliative for the stagnant economy, the tax cut, has failed 
miserably as a stimulus and instead has contributed to a sharply rising national 
debt.
<p>Combine that with the spiraling cost of throwing money at any program with 
the vaguest connection to national security and it seems clear that red ink will 
flow heavily from here to the next election.
<p>And don't expect Joe and Jane Middle Class to rescue Wall Street. The Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department -- trying to please a White 
House run by old corporate con artists -- are stumbling over themselves to avoid 
responsibility for policing publicly held companies.
<p>It might take a decade or two before regular folks forget how they learned 
painfully anew that gambling, whether on stocks or craps, always brings out the 
sharks.
<p>Big business bet heavily on the Republicans in this election in order to block 
any attempts to bring more CEOs to justice. Better to distract the public from 
the ugly side of deregulation by beating the patriotic war drums and indulging 
the rhetoric of the Christian right by pretending to restore family values.
<p>On the latter front, the GOP's moment of truth may have finally arrived -- 
the mere pretense of commitment to an extremist social agenda may no longer be 
enough for anti-abortion voters. Controlling all branches of the federal government, 
Bush &amp; Co. is going to be under the gun to actually ban abortions, something 
the GOP has boldly pledged for decades.
<p>The social conservatives in the party provided the foot soldiers in the midterm 
election, and they will now demand concrete victories, beginning with a right-wing 
makeover of the judiciary. Bush already has announced that he will resubmit the 
list of conservative federal judicial appointees stalled in the last Senate. And 
with the relatively moderate Sandra Day O'Connor the most likely to step down, 
Bush has promised to appoint an anti-choice Antonin Scalia clone to solidify right-wing 
dominance of the Supreme Court.
<p>Under such leadership, the highest court in the land would be likely to strike 
down Roe vs. Wade. But the mere thought of this long-sought "victory" makes the 
GOP's political pros squirm: To go back to the days when abortion was illegal 
and women routinely died as a result of self-inflicted coat-hanger wounds is hardly 
a prescription for future Republican victories.
<p>The GOP has long blamed Democratic control of one or both houses of Congress 
for its failure to act on a radical agenda that is not supported by most Americans. 
This, in fact, is the disaster that befell the "Gingrich Revolution."
<p>There is another choice for Bush, however. He could lead his party back to 
its roots. That Republican Party was suspicious of foreign entanglements, vigorously 
in favor of population control and civil rights and -- while certainly pro-big 
business -- was committed to stewardship of the nation's resources and the integrity 
of economic instruments such as the stock market. 
<p>Such a turn toward core American values would make Bush a serious leader. Unfortunately, 
he seems to have mastered the tongue of the demagogue and too much enjoys the 
victories that slick words and tough talk afford to consider charting the more 
moderate path Americans seek.
