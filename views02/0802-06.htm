<p>Britain's daily newspapers, which cover the ongoing war in Afghanistan in far 
greater detail than American media, have grown increasingly scathing in their 
reports of U.S. bombing raids that have gone awry - blowing apart the homes of 
innocent villagers, ruining what remains of a battered nation's infrastructure 
and killing dozens of guests at a wedding. "The American military must take tips 
from Bart Simpson," London's Independent newspaper surmised after U.S. commanders 
attempted to deny responsibility for the wedding bombing. 
<P>It is not just the press that is picking apart military missteps by the United 
States and Britain in a war that continues to tote up civilian casualties at a 
horrifying rate. The new archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, describes the 
ongoing war in Afghanistan as "morally tainted." And, despite Prime Minister Tony 
Blair's continued support for the U.S-led war, the senior member of Blair's Labor 
Party majority in parliament, Tam Dalyell, calls the continued bombing of Afghanistan 
"deeply wrong." 
<P>Where are the American echoes of the free press, outspoken cleric and angry 
parliamentarian of our chief ally in this misguided war? Why do other countries 
engage in open, freewheeling, often contentious dialogue about military missteps 
while America barely discusses them? 
<P>Certainly, the U.S. media must accept a good deal of the blame for the failure 
of the discourse. The coverage of what has become an exceptionally costly military 
mission has been so inept, so anecdotal and so addicted to Bush administration 
spin that many Americans were surprised - when reports of the wedding bombing 
came out - to learn U.S. planes were still dropping tons of bombs on Afghanistan 
day in and day out. 
<P>But, as inadequate as the news reporting and commentary has been, the most 
serious failure of oversight has been that of the Congress. For the most part, 
Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate have abandoned their constitutional 
duty to question, to challenge, to honestly advise and cautiously consent to war-making 
by the executive branch. 
<P>Only a handful of members have spoken out forcefully about this war's lack 
of focus and disturbingly high level of civilian casualties. Of these lonely voices 
of reason, the loudest is that of U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, the chair 
of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and a potential candidate for the Democratic 
presidential nomination in 2004. 
<P>Speaking on the floor of the House late last month, Kucinich raised questions 
of utility and morality in a chamber where such concerns are rarely voiced these 
days. 
<P>"Recent news accounts indicate that hundreds and hundreds of innocent civilians 
of Afghanistan have been killed 'accidentally' in bombings by U.S. warplanes," 
Kucinich declared on the floor of the House, where he questioned why the bombing 
continued. "We have no quarrel with the Afghan people. The Taliban are overthrown. 
Al-Qaida has fled. Bin Laden has vanished. And yet the bombs still drop, indiscriminately." 
<P>In most of the parliaments of the world - including Britain's - Kucinich's 
concerns would have placed him very much in the mainstream of the debate over 
this war. In the U.S. Congress, however, his was an isolated cry of conscience. 
<P>"Whatever moral authority our nation had at the beginning of the conflict is 
rapidly being lost," he told the House. "This act does not represent America. 
Democracy does not wed terror. This act must not be cloaked in the irresponsible 
and inhuman euphemism of 'collateral damage.' Stop the bombing. Let an international 
police force continue in Afghanistan. Let the humble people of Afghanistan be 
spared friendly fire issued from the skies. Enough of bombing the villages to 
save the villages! Stop the bombing!"</p> </p>
