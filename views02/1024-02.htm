<p>TRUTH HAS yet to be killed in the war on terror. Sure, sometimes it goes AWOL, 
especially in the United States where, still, not enough journalists are asking 
the tough questions of the White House. 
<P></P>
Often it gets taken hostage. That's what's happening now, as news organizations, 
including ABC, NBC, CNN, The New York Times and the Washington Post, are un-reporting 
facts they reported four years ago. They're saying that U.N. weapons inspectors 
were "kicked out" of Iraq when, in 1998, they said that they were "pulled out." 
<P></P>
Then there's how truth gets raped. President George W. Bush does that when, for 
example, he cites reports that say Iraq is close to having a nuclear weapon when 
the cited reports say no such thing.
<P></P>
Today's topic is how truth gets caught in the crossfire: Two recent incidents 
involving media coverage of Israel and its occupied territories made me lift mine 
eyes off SniperVision and back unto the Middle East.
<P></P>
The first involves The Star's Sandro Contenta who, in August, left Jerusalem to 
become our European correspondent. No sooner is he gone than Daniel Seaman, director 
of Israel's Government Press Office, tells the magazine <i>Kol Ha'Ir </i>that 
he engineered Contenta's departure, along with that of three other journalists 
from other organizations, because he "boycotted" them.
<P></P>
"The(ir) editorial boards got the message and replaced their people."
<P></P>
Without a grievance from reporters' unions? Astonishing.
<P></P>
Of course, this ridiculous charge was denied by all.
<P></P>
In the same piece, Seaman also claims that reporters for the BBC, CNN, Reuters, 
Associated Press, ABC and CBS are all under the direct control of the Palestinian 
Authority. 
<P></P>
As if AOL Time Warner, Viacom, Disney etc. take their marching orders from Yasser 
Arafat. (Mind you, right now they're taking direction from the Beltway Sniper, 
a master media manipulator &#8212; at least until his ratings drop.)
<P></P>
Seaman presents himself as a man concerned with the truth. But he hurts his cause 
more than he helps it. At a time when the pro-Israel side says it needs all the 
positive coverage it can get, the guy dealing with the very people &#8212; journalists 
&#8212; who can make or break that coverage, needs to freshen up his media relations 
skills.
<P></P>
Which brings us to incident number two: Once again, CBC-TV's Neil Macdonald is 
the target of a concerted e-mail attack by a pro-Israeli watchdog group objecting 
to his Oct. 3 report about Palestinians being harassed out of their olive groves 
by Jewish settlers.
<P></P>
"In the report, the Jewish settlers were portrayed as callous usurpers and oppressors, 
the Palestinians as innocent victims of Israeli oppression," complains the Vancouver-based 
Israel Action Committee. "This one-sidedness is irresponsible journalism and a 
betrayal of public trust."
<P></P>
Cautioning its members not to reveal the source of the campaign, the committee 
asks them "to flood the CBC" with missives "protesting this bias and informing 
the CBC that we will continue to bombard their offices with messages of protest 
until their Middle East coverage improves."
<P></P>
And so it came to pass that CBC had e-mails from Alabama, Arizona and Arkansas, 
places where the network can't be seen.
<P></P>
"So many of these campaigns are just so totally fabricated and organized on the 
basis of very misleading information," says CBC chief journalist Tony Burman. 
"We're aware of the incredible emotions this story generates. But there are parts 
of this debate that crossed the line into total hysteria."
<P></P>
In the Internet age, these e-mail campaigns are common. CNN, for example, has 
received thousands in a single day.
<P></P>
According to The Star's letters page editor Gabe Gonda, this paper has also been 
targeted.
<P></P>
"I've had, in specific campaigns, hundreds of letters emanating from links on 
a bias-in-media site &#8212; and they've come from both sides, pro-Israeli, pro-Palestinian," 
he says. 
<P></P>
"What happens is, organizations whose job it is to monitor so-called accuracy 
in media, which means monitoring for your own bias or for your own cause, are 
set up."
<P></P>
And many of them are being set up all the time. So many charges of bias are being 
hurled almost indiscriminately, perhaps obscuring the legitimate complaints that 
may arise.
<P></P>
"I agree," says B'nai Brith's Frank Dimant, who has often criticized The Star's 
coverage in <i>The Jewish Tribune</i>. "If there is a campaign over everything, 
it diminishes the value of a real campaign."
<P></P>
It also diminishes the truth.
<P></P>
That's because, if media are expected to act as nothing more than megaphones for 
the "official truth," the awful truth is that there will be no truth left standing.
