<p> As I watch and read the news, I rarely see an African-American point

of view on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I hear one member of

Congress after another offering unequivocal support for the policies of

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. But some members of the

Congressional Black Caucus have a different view. They provide balance

to the current debate on U.S. Mideast policy.

 

      <p>African Americans bring a unique perspective. Some members of the

black community feel a sense of kinship with the Jewish community. The

biblical struggle of the Jews resonates with religious African

Americans. And members of an older generation remember the cooperation

between blacks and Jews during the civil-rights movement.

 

      <p>Other segments of the black community identify with the plight of the

Palestinians under Israeli occupation. Palestinians, not unlike African

Americans, are the underdog. They are the "blacks" of the Mideast,

living under poor, segregated and oppressive conditions.

 

      <p>And it does not escape the memory of some that Israel was a close ally of South Africa under apartheid, a major supplier of arms to the white

minority regime.

 

      <p>"Many of us here in the United States have long been concerned about

reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that reveal a

pattern of excessive, and often indiscriminate, use of lethal force by

Israeli security forces in situations where Palestinian demonstrators

were unarmed or posed no threat of death or serious injury to the

security forces or to others," Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga., recently

declared. "As long as the occupation continues, bloodshed will continue

and increase." Recently, McKinney attended a rally in Washington, D.C.,

calling for an end to the Israeli occupation.

 

      <p>Other members of the Congressional Black Caucus are also speaking out. "The Palestinians have a right to have a state, and the Israelis have a right to safety and security; neither of these goals can be achieved

with a military solution," says Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif.

 

      <p>Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the veteran civil-rights activist and former

chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, advocates a

more active U.S. role in brokering a political solution. A colleague of

the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Lewis says King "knew that both

peoples were subject to laws passed with the particular intent of

oppressing them simply because they were Jewish or black. He knew that

both peoples have been subjected to oppression and genocide on a level

unprecedented in history."

 

      <p>At the protest in Washington on April 20, McKinney said: "We, as the

world's most powerful nation, have a responsibility to act in defense

of the weak and to protect them from harm. We failed in Rwanda, we

failed in Srebrenica, we failed in East Timor, and now as we speak, we

failed in Jenin."

 

<p>As the world waits to see how many Palestinians were killed in the

West Bank town of Jenin, some lawmakers on the Hill are proposing a

resolution to show their solidarity with Israel. Congress should listen to the courageous voices of the Black Caucus before it rubberstamps Sharon's brutality.
