I recently had the good fortune to see Russell Crowe's brilliant new film, "A Beautiful Mind." In fact, I saw it twice -- the second time with my brother Stephen, who has struggled with mental illness most of his life.
<P>

Our family's firsthand struggle with the problems of lack of coverage for mental illness treatment has played a major part in shaping my legislative efforts in Congress.
</p>
<P>

Stephen told me the film was very moving to him because finally "problems with mental illness were not being treated as separate but as part of the mainstream" of life. In Stephen's expert eyes, this movie helps end the stigma of mental illness.
</p>
<P>

A few days later, I met a man in his 50s, who like me, had seen the film twice -- the second time with his son, David, age 26, who has bipolar disease. He said that David "felt like the movie got it right and was very moved by it."
</p>
<P>

What a gift John Nash has given to the world. By allowing his life story to be told, he has shed light on the reality of mental illness. Maybe it takes a brilliant, powerful film like this one, directed with insightful sensitivity by Ron Howard, to put a human face on mental illness.
</p>
<P>

Discrimination against people with mental illness is widespread. For many years, I have worked with my colleague Sen. Pete Dominici, R-N.M., to pass the "Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act."
</p>
<P>

With the majority of congressional members -- 66 senators and 244 House members -- and more than 150 organizations supporting the parity bill in the last Congress, we came very close. But the insurance lobby and their congressional friends killed the bill.
</p>
<P>

Discrimination in the treatment of mental health treatment illness is a civil rights issue. Parity legislation is needed to end discrimination in the coverage for mental illness.
</p>
<P>

No longer would plans be allowed to set arbitrary limits on mental health coverage that are different from those imposed on other medical illnesses. No longer would mental illness be treated as a separate class of illness.
</p>
<P>

Think of what fairness in treatment for mental illness would mean. Think of the lives saved, the suffering eased. Suicide is linked to untreated mental illness in 90 percent of cases. Americans with mental illness, who are homeless or warehoused in jails, would instead get the humane care they need. Workplace productivity would improve, with less absenteeism and a higher quality of work. Other medical costs would go down. There would be fewer broken families, broken lives and broken dreams.
</p>
<P>

The bill's opponents claim our country cannot afford decent mental health care. The independent Congressional Budget Office estimated that the increase in premiums would be less than 1 percent, without even taking into account the savings from the $70 billion per year cost of untreated mental illness.
</p>
<P>

But the insurance industry, sparing no expense in their efforts to kill this bill, marched on Washington every day. The Republican leadership in the House of Representatives and the White House did their bidding.
</p>
<P>

Instead, one House committee has promised to "hold a hearing," and the White House told Sen. Dominici they would help "next year."
</p>
<P>

To succeed, I believe we will need a greater citizen power. To counteract the powerful insurance lobby, thousands of citizens must come to our nation's Capitol and meet face to face with their representatives. They must make it clear that people with mental illness and their loved ones will no longer accept this discrimination.
</p>
<P>

I believe that "A Beautiful Mind" delivers an important message to our country. Mental illness is real and it takes treatment to make a difference.
</p>
<P>

Without proper treatment, the many forms of mental illness can cripple, even kill. Depression alone affects about 19 million adults. But less than one-third of adults with a diagnosable mental disorder, and even a smaller proportion of children, receive any mental health services in a given year.
</p>
<P>

Effective treatments are available, and with fair and equal access to treatment, people can live productive and satisfying lives.
</p>
<P>

It is my hope that the story of John Nash will spur people throughout our country to help end the discrimination. The inspiring message of "A Beautiful Mind" has the power to make a real difference.
</p>
