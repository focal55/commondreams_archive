<p>America is still, a year later, shaking a little on its foundations, but its 
sense of itself and its pride in the traditions it upholds seem more strongly 
defined (and sometimes more narrowly so) than ever before in my lifetime. Nothing, 
alas, so concentrates the mind as a head-on assault.
<p>Yet even as this sense of "us" seems to intensify--all those flags murmuring, 
"You can't destroy us. We stand tall and firm"--so too, inevitably, does a sense 
of "them." As a grateful immigrant who has long found this nation to be the most 
accommodating of places (and ideas), I worry that the John Wayne stance it's projecting 
outside its borders is taking it further away from a world that it needs desperately 
to get closer to.
<p>In recent months I have traveled across Bolivia, Vietnam, Tibet, Peru, India 
and many other places, and everywhere I go I come away with the same impression: 
It's not Islam that's on trial worldwide, but the USA.
<p> The United States is the cynosure of every eye, the country that every other 
looks to with a mix of admiration, resentment and envy. Radical Islam is in most 
places just a muttering in the corner.
<p>A year ago, of course, we saw a great outpouring of sympathy around the world 
for what Americans were going through (and, among more hardened types, a sense 
that the world's great protected superpower was at last experiencing what is a 
daily fact of life for most humans). But with every passing month it feels as 
if the U.S. is growing more isolated, to the point where now it seems in many 
places just as it seemed to me in Yemen, six weeks before Sept. 11: another planet.
<p>It's in the nature of an empire, of course, to be unpopular--the Russians were 
nobody's favorite in the 1980s (least of all, I found, among their supposed comrades 
in Cuba and Vietnam); the Raj, burnished in such golden hues on PBS, seldom seemed 
so benign when it was a center of world power.
<p>In the case of the U.S., inevitably, the image is complicated because the youngest 
kid on the global block happens to be the strongest. This is hardly a consoling 
state of affairs for those older hands who believe that power comes only with 
experience and the truth lies in a distant past that the young can't even remember.
<p>Many people abroad seem to feel that U.S. leaders are much less sophisticated 
and worldly than the leaders of much smaller places, while the American people 
(whom everyone seems to like) are less interested, at times, in learning about 
the world than in changing it. Certainly the world knows more about us than we 
know about it.
<p>And when, in Hong Kong this spring, I saw a sign scrawled near the Star Ferry 
terminal, in Tagalog and English, saying "U.S., Go Home!" and in La Paz saw a 
similar message scribbled across an elegant colonial building ("U.S., Out of Afghanistan!"), 
what I really felt I was seeing was the same message I've been seeing for as long 
as I've been traveling: "America, leave us alone!" A sentiment complicated by 
the fact that it is often accompanied by a cry, just as urgent, of "America, take 
us in!"
<p>In the year since the attacks on the U.S., people here have learned to live 
with a much keener sense of frailty and fallibility and a much sharper understanding 
that we need to learn more about a world that is larger than our notions of it. 
With American dreams come responsibilities.
<p>Yet in the rest of the world, the U.S., everyone's favorite scapegoat, remains 
more a target of skepticism than ever before; when everything goes wrong, after 
all, people blame the person on top. For many around the world, I suspect, the 
shock of the attacks is gradually being eroded by the image of Washington's response, 
which allows them to say: "They're doing what they always do. Taking their frustrations 
out on the poor."
<p>Today is the first day when Sept. 11 no longer has to signify a particular 
traumatic incident; it can refer now to a new day, Sept. 11, 2002. The United 
States will always be, to some extent, imprisoned by its power. But if it can 
show the world that it can be humble and ready to change, some good may yet come 
of all it has suffered. Perhaps the best thing we can learn from older nations--Vietnam, 
say, or Japan--is that the most useful response to loss is to start looking beyond 
our wounds and toward how we can avoid hurting others, and getting hurt, again.</p>

2001) and, coming this winter, &quot;Abandon,&quot; a novel about California, 
Islam and the dialogue between them.</i></p>
