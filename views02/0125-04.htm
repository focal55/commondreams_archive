Politicians and journalists have interpreted 
widespread support for the military actions in 
Afghanistan as a significant shift in Americans' 
attitudes toward war. In the weeks following the 
massacre of September 11, Vice President Dick 
Cheney described the crowd's reaction to a speech 
he made in New York: "There wasn't a dove in the 
room," he said with a smile.

<p>This isn't the first time in the post-Vietnam 
era that our leaders have made such 
pronouncements. "By God, we've kicked the 
Vietnam syndrome once and for all," President 
George Bush the First declared in 1991, in the wake 
of the Persian Gulf War.

<p>But their words are starkly contradicted by 
their own actions. In every military action since 
Vietnam, our politicians and generals have been 
extremely reluctant to risk American military 
casualties. In the Persian Gulf War, there were more 
soldiers killed in training and accidents (including 
"friendly fire") than at the hands of enemy troops. 
In the war over Kosovo we did not lose even a 
single pilot.

<p>The murder of thousands of civilians in the 
worst terrorist action ever on American soil seems 
not to have changed this part of the "Vietnam 
syndrome" at all. The US military has fought this 
war, like the others, from the air. Our planes now 
bomb from altitudes so high that they cannot even 
be seen by the fighters and civilians below. 

<p>When it came time to search the caves of 
Tora Bora for Osama and his friends, US officials 
started talking about "the right mix of incentives" 
(money, weapons) to get Afghans to do the job.

<p>From the safety and calm of their armchairs 
and op-ed pages, pundits have argued vehemently 
that American troops should take on these tasks. 
But this isn't likely to happen any time soon. 

<p>What our politicians fear, but nobody wants 
to talk about, are the political consequences of 
American casualties. This is not because Americans 
are lacking in courage; as the heroic actions of the 
firefighters and others at the site of the World Trade 
Center showed, there is no shortage of people who 
are willing to risk their lives for the sake of their 
fellow citizens.

<p>But since Vietnam, there has been a 
widespread mistrust of American foreign policy. 
During the war, we were told that we were helping 
the Vietnamese -- saving them and the world from 
communism. This turned out to be a huge lie, with 
terrible consequences. Millions discovered that the 
United States was really fighting a dirty colonial 
war that the French had abandoned. 

<p>Recent revelations have only reinforced this 
mistrust, as well as the worst picture imaginable of 
that war: the atrocities committed by former Senator 
Bob Kerrey, for example, or historian Michael 
Beschloss's analysis of President Lyndon Johnson's 
tapes, showing that he knew as early as 1965 that 
the war in Vietnam could not be won -- yet 
continued to send tens of thousands of Americans to 
die there.

<p>In the post-Vietnam era, Washington has 
mainly contracted out the dirty work -- mass murder 
in Guatemala and El Salvador, or trying to 
overthrow the government of Nicaragua in the 
1980s. But whether the US military was directly 
involved -- as it was in the invasions of Grenada 
and Panama, the Persian Gulf War and Kosovo -- or 
not, it is a sordid record. In general, US officials 
lied about the purpose of their interventions, and 
none of them had much to do with US national 
security.

<p>For these reasons, public support for the 
"War on Terrorism" is miles wide but only an inch 
deep. Our political leaders want to use this crusade 
the way they used the "War Against Communism," 
and more recently, the "War on Drugs" in 
Colombia: as an excuse for the violence and 
brutality that are necessary to police a worldwide 
empire.  

<p>It remains to be seen how much of this they 
can get away with, or whether they will expand the 
current war to countries such as Iraq, Somalia, Iran 
or elsewhere. But they know one thing very well: 
they cannot allow the US casualty count to rise very 
high before people begin to question their motives.

<p>This "Vietnam syndrome" will not be 
reversed. It is a permanent change in American 
consciousness, like those that followed the abolition 
of slavery or the victories -- however partial and 
incomplete -- of the civil rights movement. What 
will fade, eventually, is our leaders' addiction to 
empire. But when that goes, America will not have 
much need for foreign military adventures.
