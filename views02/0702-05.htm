<p>A case can be made against the international criminal court, which came into 
being yesterday. The best shot came from Douglas Hurd. In a recent lecture he 
offered the classic conservative defense of shapeless evolution over the reformer's 
formulaic rigidity. 
<P>South Africa, Northern Ireland and Palestine were examples he cited to show 
that politics rather than law provide the effective route away from criminality 
towards democratic change. Judges could never compromise, never bend to reality. 
Criminal indictments against apartheid politicians, for example, would have been 
disastrous. "Policy can be selective; law has to be universal," said Lord Hurd. 
So the ICC "is an institution too far". 
<P>This is the acceptable face of the anti-ICC position. Hurd, after all, is an 
internationalist. The face that matters, however, is quite different. It is ugly, 
brutish and self-regarding, to the point where it sees only beauty, justice and 
irreproachable rectitude in the mirror. This is the face of American exceptionalism, 
shown first by Bill Clinton's narrow-eyed aversion to the ICC, and now in the 
full-frontal harshness of the Bush regime, threatening to scupper both the court 
and, failing that, UN peace-keeping operations in Bosnia and anywhere else the 
US might have forces deployed on such work. 
<P>There are many disagreements these days between the great power and the great 
majority of powers. None seems to me more precise, more pointed, or more philosophically 
complete than their differences over the international criminal court. 
<P>The great power has opposed the setting up of an ICC from the start. This wasn't 
on Hurdite grounds, so much as on the basis of age-old resistance, going back 
past the second world war, to American troops being vulnerable to any foreigner's 
jurisdiction. So at one level it's a troops matter. High Pentagon officers - not 
politicians - have been tooling round Britain, France and Canada for two years 
demanding, with improper ferocity, that these major peacekeeping allies also repudiate 
the ICC. At another level, the campaign is the highest of high politics: an assertion 
that no US official shall be put at even the remotest risk of charges, by some 
pesky foreign magistrate or judge, of war crimes, genocide or serious human rights 
abuses. 
<P>As originally conceived, the ICC might have presented such a risk. Who could 
doubt that, under a loosely framed statute, officials of the great power would 
become the target of choice for a radically politicized functionary from any of 
the great majority that signed up to the court? In reality, no such possibility 
exists. As finally negotiated - by the great power that, having secured its victories, 
tossed the ICC scornfully back in the face of the majority - every lurid hazard 
has been removed. 
<P>The court cannot act retrospectively. Henry Kissinger is safe, as, for that 
matter, is Margaret Thatcher. Possible rogue prosecutors are screened behind a 
three-judge panel, with the UN security council retaining ultimate powers to stop 
the case. National courts will always be able to forestall the ICC by taking up 
the case themselves. The chances of any American, from soldier to president, being 
indicted for their actions in Afghanistan or Bosnia are zero - as France and Britain, 
equally engaged in peacekeeping and other sharp-end activities, have recognized 
by their consistent support, through every American tantrum, for the ICC. 
<P>The tantrums have been startling to behold. The veto on further UN operations 
in Bosnia, suspended for a couple more days, is only the most recent and ruthless. 
So repelled was Congress by the court that it empowered the president to send 
in the military to rescue any future American soldiers held at ICC headquarters 
in the Hague: the Netherlands Invasion Act, as it is known in Europe. Senators 
and Congressmen have lined up to assert a case for national sovereignty by elevating 
this largely phantom enemy into an irresistible global force of anti-Americanism 
sufficient to justify the institutional paranoia that has most of Bushite Washington 
in its grip. 
<P>I try to understand the American position, placing it in an existential context. 
The court involves some mitigation of power politics. It's therefore bound to 
be an uncomfortable presence. In reality the big power-players - China and Russia 
are also non-signatories - will find almost as many ways of fixing it as they 
do the UN itself, but the ICC's very existence, now ratified by nearly 80 states, 
declares for a world order not entirely dictated by military and economic might. 
<P>It was finally brought to birth against American resistance, despite a large 
contribution from the vast well of US expertise in international law. If not anti-American 
in conception, it has acquired that attribute through the actions of America itself. 
This therefore becomes a self-reinforcing political reality, just as the court 
itself, deprived of US influence, will less reliably observe American norms. 
<P>In a Congress many of whose members take the wisdom of Senator Jesse Helms, 
anti-UN man incarnate, as the output of a latter-day philosopher-king, the ICC 
can only be an affront to the country that won the war, to be the last great power 
left standing. To place oneself, even hypothetically, in the hands of prosecutors 
and judges who, for all the safeguards, might form a praetorian guard of juridical 
aggressors fashioned in Syria, Vietnam and the Congo Republic, is a fate perhaps 
best avoided. 
<P>What a pitiful world view this represents, however. The court may be an experiment, 
but it's an intensely honorable one. It offers a less political, less invidious 
and therefore better possibility of bringing genocidal leaders to justice than 
the ad hoc tribunals now trying Rwandan and Balkan crimes. 
<P>It has problems to resolve, growing out of the usual inadequacies of UN majority 
rule: how will it ensure the best lawyers are chosen, how will it be financed, 
how will it recruit its investigating force? But many great nations, the great 
majority, have labored to produce a realistic expression of the international 
will to see a world governed, in this respect at least, according to the kind 
of value system that America once upon a time was not frightened to express: lawful, 
internationalist, and defending the equality of human rights. 
<P>Tony Blair put up a robust defense of this yesterday: there are, thank goodness, 
some causes on which he disdains to play the proxy American. But it's probable 
that the US veto re Bosnia will stand, which means the EU taking over the UN policing 
responsibilities sooner than intended. 
<P>Will Washington sacrifice other UN peacekeeping operations - Lebanon, West 
Sahara, Sierra Leone, all up for renewal soon - to the hubris that cannot tolerate 
the ICC? Unless there is an outcry, it seems likely. At home, criticism remains 
muted, though not silent. The obligation on the great majority outside, to be 
unmistakably heard, has seldom been greater.</p>
