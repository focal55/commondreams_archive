<p> Back in January, when the Enron
scandal threatened to ensnare the Bush
Administration, White House press secretary
Ari Fleischer bragged to NBC's Tom Brokaw
after a hard day of managing the news. "Did you
notice all the Enron stuff that everybody was
asking about? Look what made it on the air --
the business-scandal side of it."

         <p>Fleischer had succeeded in burying the political-scandal side of the story, and it was a remarkable professional achievement in the world of spin. Here was an Administration that was locked in "a carnal embrace" with Enron: President, Vice-President, top economic and political advisers, Secretary of the Army, US Trade Representative -- and more. But the political fallout was barely registering.

         <p>Now Fleischer's magic, and President
Bush's teflon coating, may finally be fading.
The discovery that there were numerous
warning signs leading up to the massacre of
September 11, that went unheeded, could mark
the beginning of a Great Unraveling.

         <p>The Bush Administration and its allies
have shamelessly exploited September 11 to get
what they want, from mountains of new pork at
the Pentagon to Fast Track authority for
negotiating new foreign commercial
agreements. The latter passed the House by one
vote last December, after a threat from House
speaker Dennis Hastert: "This Congress will
either support our president -- who's fighting a
courageous war on terrorism and redefining
American world leadership -- or it will undercut
the president at the worst possible time."

         <p>They have been quick to question the
patriotism of their opponents, and it has worked.
The Democratic leadership was cowed into
silence, which gave President Bush very high
approval ratings -- they remain at 76 percent.
Many observers attribute these results to the
"War Against Terrorism," but this is
exaggerated. A public that hears only praise and
no criticism will predictably answer "yes" to
pollsters who ask whether the President is doing
a good job.

         <p>This unfortunate dynamic has
encouraged a President who couldn't get a
majority of the popular vote to govern as though
he had won an overwhelming mandate from the
electorate.

         <p>Vice President Dick Cheney has lashed
out hard at his critics, calling their actions
"thoroughly irresponsible and totally unworthy
of national leaders in a time of war."

         <p>But it's not working any more. The
Democrats softened their rhetoric, but Senate
majority leader Tom Daschle is still demanding
that an independent commission be set up to
investigate what our government knew and did
before September 11.

        <p> The Bush Administration has been less
than forthright about what was known about
possible attacks, and when it became known.
For example, National Security Adviser
Condoleeza Rice told reporters last week that
US intelligence officials were focused on
overseas threats in the months prior to
September 11. But according to the Washington
Post, a secret briefing memo presented to
President Bush on August 6 -- headlined "Bin
Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.," -- was
focused on attacks within the United States.

         <p>Meanwhile, Senator Joseph Lieberman
is threatening to subpoena White House officials
for information on their contacts with Enron
officials. And there is yet another scandal in the
making, over the role of the Administration in
supporting the military coup last month against
the democratically elected President of
Venezuela.

         <p>This is currently under internal
investigation at the State Department and
Pentagon, and Senate hearings could follow.
Lest anyone think that foreign policy scandals
don't have legs, recall that the Iran-Contra
investigation came close to toppling the Reagan
presidency in 1987. Ironically, two of the
suspects in the Venezuelan coup are re-treads
from Iran-Contra: Assistant Secretary of State
Otto Reich, and National Security Council
official Elliot Abrams, who was convicted of
lying to Congress.

         <p>The Bush administration may survive all
of these challenges and more. But once the
teflon is gone, its whole agenda could very well
collapse. Most Americans are concerned with
bread and butter issues, such as prescription
drug costs, health insurance, and education --
issues for which this Administration offers them
nothing. Cheney's vision of a war without end, a
replacement for the Cold War that will justify
any overseas military adventure -- Iraq,
Somalia, Colombia -- appeals to the national
security establishment and some private sector
beneficiaries. But it won't attract many voters.
