<p>The Bush administration seems to be moving toward preemptive nuclear strikes 
against those who threaten the U.S. with weapons of mass destruction. This threat 
to use nuclear weapons has a big flaw: We might have to make good on it.
<p>Weapons of mass destruction are indeed the central threat to U.S. national 
security and our way of life. The Bush administration's nuclear posture review 
already has eroded the "nuclear taboo"; the new strategic doctrine now being developed 
may make the use of nuclear weapons even more likely.
<p>Warfare has matured to the point that a nuclear weapon that can fit in a cargo 
container, a truck or even a suitcase could destroy a city. If we can prevent 
a catastrophe involving chemical, biological, nuclear or radiological weapons 
by striking first, then we must. But we should do so within the bounds of international 
law. These rules are to our advantage and in the interest of civilization as a 
whole. If our example encourages most of the world to stop playing by the rules 
most of the time, we will be in even greater danger.
<p>International law allows for preemptory self-defense, but it demands that such 
first strikes must meet two strict requirements: necessity and proportionality.
<p>First, it must be demonstrated that force is necessary to prevent an imminent 
attack. It is not enough that an enemy possesses weapons of mass destruction. 
There must be a credible indication that their use is imminent.
<p>Second, the preemptive action must be proportionate to the threat. Only a truly 
mammoth threat would be proportionate to the use of a nuclear weapon. Since no 
threat of the magnitude of a nuclear weapon's devastation has been made public, 
the administration's proposed strategic doctrine suggests a lowering of this legal 
standard. It seems to assert that the U.S. has an exclusive privilege to step 
outside the law.
<p>If the most powerful nation in the world asserts such a first-use doctrine, 
other countries--some facing overwhelming threats--are likely to begin to make 
similar claims. The reason that only a tiny minority of countries has joined the 
"nuclear club" is that the vulnerability of all, bolstered by international law 
in the form of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, has convinced most countries 
that these weapons are unusable, despite the example of World War II.
<p>But if the U.S. uses another nuclear weapon, we should expect one to be used 
against us.
<p>This might happen anyway. The West was slow out of the gate in rendering assistance 
to the former Soviet Union to secure its arsenal, and it still does not give this 
critical task the attention it demands. There are dark corners of Iraq and elsewhere 
where international inspectors are unwelcome.
<p>More countries with nuclear weapons will mean more places for terrorists to 
steal or buy nuclear weapons or material. Less confidence in our conventional 
superiority will weaken our friendships and embolden our enemies to put their 
focus where we have--on nuclear weapons.
<p>Terrorists have demonstrated to us that they have the will to act with absolute 
brutality. There are plenty of reasons to believe we may lose a city to terrorism. 
We should not add one more reason through a misguided doctrine.
<p>Terrorists may not have cities to burn, but we do. Civilization is the source 
of our strength and their one true enemy. Redefining ourselves to be more like 
them will not make us more secure. It will leave our cities naked before the world.
