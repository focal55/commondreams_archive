<p>A little over a month after the 1991 Gulf War, Maarti Ahtisaari, then UN special 
rapporteur, commented on conditions inside Iraq: 'Nothing we had heard or read 
could have prepared us for this particular devastation, a country reduced to a 
pre-industrial age, for a considerable time to come.'
<p>Since Ahtisaari's remarks, Iraq has slid from the impossible to the apocalyptic. 
The Unicef report, State Of The World's Children (2001), rates the country 11 
points below Eritrea, with the highest increase in infant mortality on earth. 
<p>Water-borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, polio -- largely eradicated 
prior to 1990 -- have become epidemic. A child with dysentery in 1989 had a one-in-600 
chance of dying. By 1999 it was one in 50. Had the weapons inspectors (UNSCOM) 
in their search for biological weapons turned on any tap in Iraq, they would have 
found them.
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that each month an average of 
5000 children aged under five die as a result of 'embargo-related causes'. Last 
December, 11,500 people died, the majority of them children.
<p>By 1993 doctors had made a new diagnosis. With inflation stratospheric the 
price of staple foods rose by up to 11,000 times. Malnourishment became rampant. 
Mothers too weak to breast feed, and unable to afford milk powder, fed babies 
sugared water or tea. They became wasted, bloated and almost all died. Doctors 
called them the 'sugar babies'. 
<p>'Time is running out for the children of Iraq,' wrote Dieter Hannusch of the 
World Food Program in 1995. Time ran out for seven-year-old Yasmin that year. 
Diagnosed with a minor heart ailment in 1990, a small surgical procedure would 
correct it when facilities were restored. But in five years a minor ailment become 
a major one and her damaged heart failed her frail body. 
<p>'I hope they told her before she died that she had failed to comply with the 
United Nations embargo,' remarked an Iraqi friend with searing fury. Dignity in 
death too, is the embargo's victim -- shroud cloth and coffins have been vetoed 
by the UN Sanctions Committee
<p>In Basra, Iraq's beautiful, battered southern city, decimated in Desert Storm, 
Dr Jenan Hussein's thesis compares the rate of cancers and birth abnormalities 
with those in Hiroshima. A quarter of live births now are of premature weight. 
In the Pediatric and Maternity Hospital, small faces, the haunted eyes of parents 
and the conditions haunt the stoniest heart. 
<p>When I returned after six months, Dr Hussein said hesitantly: 'You remember 
those children you wrote about in June? I am sorry, they have all died.'
<p>They included 17 babies in the premature baby unit without even oxygen. Incubators 
too were vetoed.
<p>The US and UK have bombed Iraq on an ongoing basis since Operation Desert Fox 
in December 1998 -- and again we prepare to bomb the 'most traumatized child population 
on earth', according to experts. 
<p>Denial is rampant. One child told Count Hans von Sponeck, who succeeded Denis 
Halliday as UN aid co-ordinator, that when the bombs come: 'I play the piano so 
I can't hear them.'
<p>An eight-year-old said that when the bombing starts: 'My father goes outside 
and stands by the gate to protect our house.'
<p>One doctor reached on a crackly line inside Iraq said: 'I can cope with anything 
now, patients who die for want of simple treatment, operating without anesthetics. 
What I cannot cope with is the children's fear. When the bombing starts I swear 
that I can hear the cries of every child, in every house in every street in the 
entire neighborhood.'
<p>This psychological effect permeates every level of life. It would seem the 
UN Convention on the Rights of the Child lies in the mass grave of the children 
of Iraq -- some report a million and rising -- who die of 'embargo-related causes'.
<p>Now America again threatens to attack a country with no functioning fire engines, 
no disaster provision, and where even radios for ambulances are vetoed. In 1991, 
General Norman Schwartzkopf boasted of a 'turkey shoot' for the Allied forces 
inside Iraq. This time, we will be bombing a sitting duck.</p>
