<p>The question dominating the news: When will we go to war against Iraq?

<p>The answer: We are already at war with Iraq.

<p>The debate over the Bush administration's call for war is usually described 
as hawks v. doves -- those for the war pitted against those opposing war. 
In fact, the debate in mainstream news is hawks v. hawks; the question 
isn't whether or not to wage war, but what form that war should take.

<p>Bush and the ultra-hawks want a full-scale war as soon as feasible, to 
secure control over Iraq and its oil. The hawks at the moderate extreme 
argue for continuing "containment," a euphemism for devastating economic 
sanctions and regular bombing in the so-called "no-fly zones."

<p>Sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, are administered 
through the United Nations but in place only because the United States 
insists; most of the rest of the world has condemned them. The embargo has 
helped cause the deaths of more than 500,000 children under the age of 5, 
according to a UNICEF study. That's why two former U.N. humanitarian 
coordinators in Iraq -- Denis Halliday and Hans von Sponeck -- have 
resigned in protest, calling the sanctions immoral and even genocidal.

<p>Though the sanctions have strengthened Saddam Hussein's control over Iraq 
while punishing ordinary people, the United States insists they remain.

<p>Starting with a complete ban on oil sales and frequent restrictions even on 
basic medicines, the sanctions have gone through stages. Currently, there 
is no limit on total oil sales and most medicines are allowed in, but there 
are still major problems with funding projects to repair critical 
infrastructure and foster economic development.

<p>Combined with the almost complete (and quite deliberate) destruction of 
Iraq's civilian infrastructure, particularly water- and sewage-treatment 
plants, by U.S. forces during the Gulf War, the sanctions have meant 
increased malnutrition, disease and death -- not for Saddam but for the 
Iraqi people.

<p>U.S. official blithely claim that the so-called "smart sanctions" approved 
by the Security Council in July would solve these problems. But instead of 
feeding Iraqis, the changes mostly helped confuse the public -- which, 
according to some U.S. officials, was the original intent of smart sanctions.

<p>Now, as worldwide attention to the effects of sanctions has decreased, the 
humanitarian situation has worsened. Even as cumbersome bureaucratic 
procedures for approving imports were supposedly streamlined, the monetary 
value of "holds" (contracts held up by some nation on the Sanctions 
Committee, almost always the United States) is at $4.7 billion, higher than 
before smart sanctions were proposed. Worse, because of a retroactive 
oil-pricing scheme recently implemented by the United States (oil companies 
don't know what price they'll pay for Iraqi crude until after it is 
loaded), Iraqi oil exports are way down; in August, exports averaged 
800,000 barrels per day, compared with more than 2 million at earlier 
points. This funding shortfall means Iraq is unable to pay even for some 
approved humanitarian imports.

<p>U.S. officials blame all this on Saddam, and certainly the Iraqi government 
has made some questionable allocations of resources. But Tun Myat, the 
current U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, has described Iraq's food 
distribution as "second to none," echoing evaluations by other UN officials.

<p>While the sanctions kill slowly, the United States continues to patrol the 
no-fly zones in the northern and southern parts of Iraq, bombing at will 
and killing civilians -- at least 27 attacks by U.S. planes in 2002. The 
most recent, on Sunday (Aug. 25), killed eight, according to Iraq.

<p>When challenged, U.S. officials robotically repeat that they bomb only when 
threatened by Iraqi air defenses. However, despite U.S. claims, there is no 
U.N. Security Council authorization for this violation of Iraqi 
sovereignty. U.S. journalists rarely mention the obvious point -- that if 
the United States ceased its illegal patrols, Iraqi radar would not "light 
up" U.S. planes, making U.S. attacks unnecessary.

<p>While not militarily significant, these attacks serve to terrorize the 
Iraqi people and remind everyone that the United States exempts itself from 
international law. Combined with the sanctions, they constitute a war on 
the people of Iraq.

<p>While the fanatical hawks argue with the moderate hawks about the way in 
which a war against Iraq should proceed, virtually all the world opposes a 
full-scale war. It's time for us to realize that most of the rest of the 
world also wants to stop the containment war, end the suffering of the 
Iraqi people and begin the diplomatic process necessary for regional peace.
