<p>SANTA CRUZ, Calif. -- How did I, a mayor of a small town in California, wind 
up in a tug of war with the Drug Enforcement Agency? </p>
<P> This week, I stood in front of Santa Cruz's city hall as a local group that 
provides medical marijuana went about its weekly task of distributing the drug 
to the sick and dying.</p>
<P> My story begins on the morning of Sept. 5 when approximately 30 men, dressed 
in military fatigues and carrying automatic weapons, descended on a small cooperative 
farm run by the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana in northern Santa Cruz 
County, about 65 miles south of San Francisco. They were pulling up organically 
grown marijuana plants. </p>
<P> When the Santa Cruz County sheriff's office learned what was going on, it 
was at a loss to explain who the intruders were or what type of response was in 
order. I didn't hear about the raid until 10 a.m., when I was called by members 
of the collective. I then telephoned the Santa Cruz police chief and other local 
officials. The chief hadn't heard anything either. </p>
<P> Later it became clear that the D.E.A. was making a raid. Agents collected 
more than 130 plants and arrested the founders of the medical marijuana collective, 
Valerie and Mike Corral. The Corrals were taken to a federal detention center 
in San Jose, but no charges were filed and they were subsequently released.</p>
<P> The D.E.A. was right to release them. But the Corrals shouldn't have been 
there in the first place. They had not been breaking the law. They were growing 
marijuana specifically for people who had been legally prescribed the substance 
to help them with chronic pain brought on by cancer, diabetes and other illnesses. 
</p>
<P> These weren't new laws, either. Residents in Santa Cruz County had voted in 
1992 to legalize the use of medical marijuana. In 1996, Californians approved 
Proposition 215, a statewide measure to allow the use of marijuana for medicinal 
purposes. Two years ago our city council passed an ordinance to make it easier 
to grow and distribute medical marijuana under the new law.</p>
<P> Before the morning raid, Santa Cruz had a good relationship with drug enforcement 
officials. Santa Cruz, like many communities, has a problem with illegal drugs, 
most notably heroin and methamphetamine. In the last 15 months, the D.E.A. has 
conducted two operations here; working with the sheriff's office and the Santa 
Cruz Police Department, the agency has caught hundreds of drug dealers and users. 
According to our police chief, "the D.E.A. did an excellent job" in these operations. 
</p>
<P> That was not the case on Sept. 5. The D.E.A. came to town unannounced and 
under cover of darkness.</p>
<P> I'm worried that the agency is going to be coming to other towns, too. Since 
1996, eight other states — Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii, 
Colorado and Maine — have passed laws allowing for the use of medical marijuana. 
At the same time, the Department of Justice has made it clear that it opposes 
the use of marijuana under any circumstances. </p>
<P> Clearly, state law and federal law are on a collision course. I would not 
be surprised if there are more raids. </p>
<P> And if there are more raids, more mayors and elected officials will find themselves 
doing what we did here this week: standing with people like the Corrals as they 
deliver medical marijuana to patients who are using the drug on the advice of 
a physician.</p>
<P> The government is fighting a losing battle. In the states where medical marijuana 
has been on the ballot, it has received overwhelming approval from voters. Canada 
and Great Britain recently approved the medical use of marijuana and plan to have 
the government grow and distribute it. </p>
<P> As medical costs skyrocket, medical marijuana is a cost-effective way to treat 
people with chronic pain. Most of all, making medical marijuana available is an 
act of common sense and compassion. The Corrals' collective lost 40 members this 
year; many of them left this world with Ms. Corral holding their hand.</p>
<P> I'm hopeful that this week's events will prompt the federal government to 
begin working with state and local governments to determine how far it can go 
in regulating activity that has been approved by the states and that has negligible 
effects on interstate commerce. There's legislation in Congress, supported by 
a bipartisan coalition, that would allow all states to approve medical marijuana, 
thus eliminating any conflict with federal law. To me, that makes sense. But until 
it passes, I'm standing with the Corrals. </p>
