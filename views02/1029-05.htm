<p>Call me a McGovern wimp, but it was refreshing to run into the man himself 
and be reminded by this genuine patriot and war hero of just how thoughtless is 
the current rush to war with Iraq.
<p>The macho mouths whose combat experience most often consists of battles for 
talk-show ratings would have you believe that it takes great courage to bang the 
drums of war, whereas it is cowardly to speak the language of peace and diplomacy.
<p>George McGovern is living proof that just the opposite is true.
<p> Recall his losing 1972 contest with President Nixon, who successfully branded 
McGovern a subversive peacenik for calling for an end to the war in Vietnam. The 
result was a further, futile escalation of carpet-bombing into Cambodia, which 
paved the way for the genocidal Khmer Rouge to take over a devastated country.
<p>At the time, McGovern thought it unseemly to defend himself against Nixon's 
attacks by trading on his own heroic war record, and he still speaks with suspicion 
of those who "wear their patriotism or their religion on their sleeves."
<p>McGovern, 80, who earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for his 35 B-24 combat 
missions against Nazi Germany, takes particular umbrage with those who now talk 
of Saddam Hussein as a modern-day Hitler.
<p>"Hitler, in possession of the world's then-greatest military force, had the 
power to destroy Western civilization," McGovern observed, while Hussein, his 
military eviscerated in the Gulf War and afterward, can easily be contained.
<p>McGovern was speaking on a cruise ship in Boston Harbor to a group of Nation 
magazine subscribers. Many men in the audience were veterans of what has come 
to be viewed as the good war, and like McGovern they expressed contempt for the 
so-called chicken hawks who dominate the Bush war camp: men eager to send others 
into combat, which they themselves have not experienced.
<p>"I'm sick and tired of those old men dreaming up wars for young men to die 
in," McGovern said in an interview. "You know that &#91;Vice President&#93; Dick 
Cheney, &#91;Defense Secretary&#93; Donald Rumsfeld and &#91;Deputy Defense Secretary&#93; 
Paul Wolfowitz have not been in a war and will not fight in this one they are 
planning."
<p>McGovern says the administration is committed to a jingoistic unilateralism 
that will only encourage more hostility and attacks on the United States. President 
Bush "claims that people around the world hate us for our freedom, but it is our 
freedom they love and our arrogance that they hate," McGovern said. He cited a 
recent statement by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice that the administration's 
main accomplishment was "the hardening of America."
<p>The biggest problem he has with Bush's White House is a pattern of lying that 
McGovern believes rivals that of Nixon's. For example, "Bush has said repeatedly 
that Saddam Hussein threw the international arms inspectors out of Iraq, but that's 
not true. We withdrew our inspectors."
<p>The president, McGovern said, also too often relies on the language of the 
religious right. "I'm troubled by a president who has used the word 'evil' so 
many times that he doesn't seem to understand that there has always been evil 
and always will be, unless God intervenes directly."
<p>The former senator is critical as well of Democrats in Congress for failing 
to challenge the president's hyperaggressive foreign policy.
<p>Mourning Sen. Paul Wellstone, one of the few bold congressional critics of 
the White House's call for war, McGovern said "whoever replaces him owes it to 
his memory to respect his opposition to the war." 
<p>In a time when bravery is all too easily confused with bravado, George McGovern 
stands as a compelling reminder that it takes real courage to fight for peace.</p>
