<p>Thomas Hobbes, the 17th-century English political philosopher, felt that the 
lives of human beings were naturally "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short." 
He maintains that, in order to survive this grim reality, humanity engages in 
continual warfare, "every one against every one."</P>
<P>Three hundrred years later, in 1949, George Orwell published his chilling, 
anti-utopian novel, "Nineteen Eighty-Four," in which the brutish ruling party 
of Oceania rules society on the basis of slogans such as "War is Peace." In both 
Hobbes&#39; "Leviathan" and Orwell&#39;s "Nineteen Eighty-Four" the frightening 
image of a never-ending war is evoked.</P>
<P>Enter America&#39;s unelected president, George W. Bush, and his "War on Terrorism." 
This war that Bush presents to the American people is a war that will not be over 
until he says it is. "The prospect of a war without end," writes historian Howard 
Zinn, in a March 2002 issue of The Progressive, is unlike the wars of any previous 
administration. "Indeed," writes Zinn, "presidents have been anxious to assurre 
the nation that the sacrifices demanded would be finite" with an eventual "light 
at the end of the tunnel."</P>
<P>With the macho bluster of an Old West lawman -- telling America that Osama 
bin Laden is "Wanted Dead or Alive" -- Bush says his administration will show 
no mercy toward anybody who harbors terrorists or plans to develop weapons of 
mass destruction. </P>
<P>Never mind that presidential brother Jeb Bush is governor of Florida, which 
has long harbored anti-Castro terrorists who&#39;ve hijacked aircraft and boats 
without being charged with any crime. Or perhaps the president might explain why 
one of Pol Pot&#39;s chief terrorists now lives confortably in Mount Vernon, N.Y.</P>
<P>Indeed, George Bush&#39;s "War on Terrorism" is in many ways a reincarnation 
of America&#39;s "red scare" of the 1950s. It too was used to justify the growth 
of a war economy, suspension of democratic rights and the silencing of dissent. 
</P>
<P>The U.S.A. Patriot Act defines a "domestic terrorist" as anyone who "violates 
the law and is engaged in actions that appear to be intended to influence the 
government by intimidation or coercion." Such a broad definition might have been 
used against the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who in fact used civil disobedience 
to fight segregation and racism.</P>
<P>By keeping the specific elements of his "War on Terrorism" as vague as possible, 
Bush hopes to make use of it whenever it might be expedient for maintaining his 
power.</P>
<P>Also, by continuously waving the flag of Sept. 11, Bush hopes that Americans 
will forget the shadowy means by which he become president in the first place. 
Under the facade of being a hero in times of peril, Bush can take a light hand 
with polluters and corporate wrongdoers like Enron while taking a heavy hand to 
all dissenters and anti-globalization radicals.</P>
<P>As Zinn says at the end of his Progressive article, "Our most deadly enemies 
are not in caves and compounds abroad, but in the corporate boardrooms and governmental 
offices where decisions are made that consign millions to death and misery -- 
not deliberately but as the collateral damage of the lust for profits and power."</P>
<P>It is the responsibility of all of us to move out of the Orwellian shadow that 
Bush has cast upon the country with his talk of "War on Terror" and "Axis of Evil," 
and begin to question the political legitimacy of the president and stand up for 
our First Amendment rights to dissent and question. The painful memory of Sept. 
11 must leave us not quivering with fear and manipulated by jingoistic jargon, 
but motivated by a renewed commitment to democratic rights. </P>
<P> <I>Donald E. Winters, Minneapolis. Humanities professor, Minneapolis Community 
and Technical College.</I></P>
