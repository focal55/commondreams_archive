<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->As 
war with Iraq looms bewilderingly larger this summer, it would be an overstatement 
to say that there's now a Peace Camp (or more precisely, an Anti-Invasion-Now 
Camp) in Washington. There sure as hell is a Privately Held Doubts Camp, however. 
People worry about the costs -- in lives, money and reputation -- that such a 
war would inflict on America; some even worry about the number of Iraqi casualties 
we would inflict. They worry about what would become of Iraq if we shuffle Saddam 
Hussein off this mortal coil; they worry that the administration doesn't even 
know what should happen if we do. They worry that the war would inflame an already 
enraged Arab and Muslim world; they worry that the war would drive a deeper rift 
between us and Europe; they worry that the administration really doesn't care 
if we estrange the rest of the world. 
<p> Some congressional heavyweights have begun to audibly express such concerns. 
Key Republicans -- such as Dick Armey, Chuck Hagel and Henry Hyde -- have wondered 
if we really have the grounds to go to war, and a number of Democratic senators 
-- Carl Levin, Barbara Boxer, John Kerry and Bob Graham -- have expressed similar 
misgivings. The most important Democrats, however -- Senate Majority Leader Tom 
Daschle, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt and Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
Chairman Joseph Biden -- are staying discreetly mum, though there are days when 
Gephardt sounds distinctly hawkish. And it's these three leaders -- Daschle and 
Biden in particular -- who can set the Democrats' agenda and shape their talking 
points on the Iraq issue. 
<p> Biden has begun to hold hearings, which can be a good way to air questions 
that Democrats may have without having to commit themselves to a particular position. 
But so far, what most Democrats are saying is merely that the administration needs 
to make a case for going to war (a more compelling case than those that have emerged 
thus far through news leaks). They have not said what they'll do if that case 
doesn't measure up, nor are they saying why they think the administration will 
be able to make a better case than it's made thus far. 
<p> You can understand the calculations behind such reticence. No significant 
constituency is expressing alarm yet about U.S. military action. Biden's committee 
has yet to hear expert testimony that pokes holes in the administration's as yet 
unmade case. It's tricky opposing a war before the official case for that war 
emerges. 
<p> But there's another kind of calculation that Democrats -- their leaders in 
particular -- are making, and it's political. It's an entirely proper calculation 
for party leaders to make. The Democrats are suddenly staring at the prospect 
of a very good election year. This reversal of fortune is entirely the result 
of the corporate scandals, the market's fall, the president's miserable economic 
stewardship, his Harken troubles, his vice president's Halliburton troubles and 
his party's utter indenture to big business. When the dominant issue in the land 
was national security, however, Bush was riding high, and the Democrats opted 
to stay by his side in all things nondomestic. 
<p> So they backed the president's initial response to the al-Qaeda attacks, for 
good reasons that went well beyond the political. But the leadership's Velcro 
adherence to the president's military initiatives now extends far beyond Afghanistan. 
Democrats have said virtually nothing about Bush's stunning announcement that 
the United States is now free to wage preemptive -- if need be, nuclear -- war. 
And they still have said little about Iraq, which apparently is to be the object 
of our first preemptive war, though the administration has yet to specify what 
exactly we'd be preempting. 
<p> The choice now before discreetly doubting Democrats is a bit like the one 
that confronted the Democratic Congress of 1965&#150;1966, when, at Lyndon Johnson's 
insistence, it enacted the Voting Rights Act and Medicare and, with Johnson, declared 
war on poverty. The opportunity to transform America was real, as was that little 
war in Vietnam, which in the course of the year grew into a big war. Some Democrats 
doubted the wisdom of that war, but most decided that with the prospects for fundamental 
social change so high, it was not the time to break with the president. 
<p> It was a difficult question for leaders of the left, too; some, such as the 
great civil-rights organizer and nonviolence advocate Bayard Rustin, decided that 
the opportunity to create a more egalitarian America eclipsed any imperative to 
oppose the war. "How does one judge a man like Bayard," his friend Michael Harrington 
later wrote, "who did the wrong thing for the right reason?" 
<p> That, I fear, is what people may be asking years from now of our congressional 
Democrats. The right reason this year may be nothing so fundamental as it was 
in 1965, but being able to block Bush's legislative initiatives and end the right-wing 
offensive of the past decade constitute genuine gains. And yet a war likely to 
have disastrous consequences in much of the world, a war that will let the terrifying 
genie of preemptive war out of the bottle, is being prepared. With ancestral voices 
prophesying war and all the polls pointing to victory, the Democrats' silence 
is understandable. But not excusable.</p>
