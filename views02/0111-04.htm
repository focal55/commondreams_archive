            On the morning of September 11, President Bush was sitting in the 
            second-grade class of the Emma E. Booker Elementary School. The location 
            is revealing: Up to the moment Chief of Staff Andrew Card whispered 
            in his ear, Bush believed he was going to be an Education President. 
            The second plane put an end to that, of course; and when he signed 
            his education plan into law on January 8, the celebration was understandably 
            muted. 
            <p>Nonetheless, the legislation delivers a huge victory to Bush: This 
              year's reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education 
              Act is widely regarded as the most ambitious federal overhaul of 
              public schools since the 1960s. States will now test all students 
              annually from third to eighth grade, while launching a federally 
              guided drive for universal literacy among schoolchildren. Perhaps 
              more strikingly, a political party that once called for the abolition 
              of the Education Department has radically enhanced the federal presence 
              in public schools. After repeating the mantra of local control and 
              states' rights for a generation, the GOP now intrudes on both. What 
              has happened? </p>
            <p> The Bush revolution in education is the culmination of a decade 
              of educational reform spearheaded by conservatives and business 
              leaders. To gauge the significance of this trend, consider the original 
              aspirations for an American public school system: As Horace Mann, 
              and later John Dewey, saw it, public schools were necessary to fashion 
              a common national culture out of a far-flung and often immigrant 
              population, and to prepare young people to be reflective and critical 
              citizens in a democratic society. The emphasis was on self-governance 
              through self-respect; a sense of cultural ownership through participation; 
              and ultimately, freedom from tyranny through rational deliberation. 
            </p>
            <p> Fast-forward to 2002: The new Bush testing regime emphasizes minimal 
              competence along a narrow range of skills, with an eye toward satisfying 
              the low end of the labor market. All this sits well with a business 
              community whose first preoccupation is "global competitiveness": 
              a community most comfortable thinking in terms of inputs (dollars 
              spent on public schools) in relation to outputs (test scores). No 
              one disputes that schools must inculcate the skills necessary for 
              economic survival. But does it follow that the theory behind public 
              schooling should be overwhelmingly economic? One of the reform movement's 
              founding documents is <i>Reinventing Education: Entrepreneurship 
              in America's Public Schools</i>, by Lou Gerstner, chairman of IBM. 
              Gerstner describes schoolchildren as human capital, teachers as 
              sellers in a marketplace and the public school system as a monopoly. 
              Predictably, CEOs bring to education reform CEO rhetoric: stringent, 
              intolerant of failure, even punitive--hence the word "sanction," 
              as if some schools had been turning away weapons inspectors. </p>
            <p> Nowhere has this orientation been more frank than in George W. 
              Bush's policies, first as Texas governor and now as President. When 
              he invited a group of "education leaders" to join him for his first 
              day in the White House, the guest list was dominated by Fortune 
              500 CEOs. One, Harold McGraw, the publishing scion and current chairman 
              of McGraw-Hill, summed up: "It's a great day for education, because 
              we now have substantial alignment among all the key constituents--the 
              public, the education community, business and political leaders--that 
              results matter." </p>
            <p> The phrase "results matter," like the popular buzzwords "accountability" 
              and "standards," means one thing: more standardized testing. The 
              Business Roundtable, an organization of powerful CEOs (including 
              Gerstner) intensely focused on education issues, admits in one position 
              paper that "voices of opposition to these policies...emanate from 
              parents and teachers." No matter: Testing is a "bedrock principle" 
              for the Roundtable, and the "leadership and credibility of the business 
              community is needed" to make sure standardized testing becomes a 
              reality. </p>
            <p> Why the infatuation with testing? For its most conservative enthusiasts, 
              testing makes sense as a lone solution to school failure because, 
              they insist, adequate resources are already in place, and only the 
              threat of exposure and censure is necessary for schools to succeed. 
              Moreover, among those who style themselves "compassionate conservatives," 
              education has become a sentimental and, all things considered, cheap 
              way to talk about equalizing opportunity without committing to substantial 
              income redistribution. Liberal faddishness, not chronic underfunding 
              of poorer schools or child poverty itself, is blamed for underachievement: 
              "Child-centered" education, "progressive" education or "whole language"--each 
              has been singled out as a social menace that can be vanquished only 
              by applying a more rational, results-oriented and business-minded 
              approach to public education. </p>
            <p>And, not surprisingly, the Bush legislation has ardent supporters 
              in the testing and textbook publishing industries. Only days after 
              the 2000 election, an executive for publishing giant NCS Pearson 
              addressed a Waldorf ballroom filled with Wall Street analysts. According 
              to <i>Education Week</i>, the executive displayed a quote from President-elect 
              Bush calling for state testing and school-by-school report cards, 
              and announced, "This almost reads like our business plan." The bill 
              has allotted $387 million to get states up to speed; the National 
              Association of State Boards of Education estimates that properly 
              funding the testing mandate could cost anywhere from $2.7 billion 
              to $7 billion. The bottom line? "This promises to be a bonanza for 
              the testing companies," says Monte Neill of FairTest, a Boston-based 
              nonprofit. "Fifteen states now test in all the grades Bush wants. 
              All the rest are going to have to increase the amount of testing 
              they do." Testing was already big business: According to Peter Sacks, 
              author of <i>Standardized Minds: The High Price of America's Testing 
              Culture and What We Can Do to Change It</i>, between 1960 and 1989 
              sales of standardized tests to public schools more than doubled, 
              while enrollment increased only 15 percent. Over the past five years 
              alone, state testing expenditures have almost tripled, from $141 
              million to $390 million, according to Achieve Inc., a standards-movement 
              group formed by governors and CEOs. Under the new legislation, as 
              many as fifteen states might need to triple their testing budgets. 
            </p>
            <p> All of which has led to a feeding frenzy. Educational Testing 
              Service, maker of the SAT, has always been nonprofit; but it recently 
              created a for-profit, K-12 subsidiary, ETS K-12 Works, to provide 
              "testing and measurement services to the nation's elementary and 
              secondary schools." To help market it, the company replaced CEO 
              Nancy Cole, an educator with a background in psychometrics, with 
              an executive from the marketing wing of the pharmaceutical industry. 
              As new CEO Kurt Landgraf recently declared, ETS has a "moral responsibility" 
              to participate in the debate on the "viability of high-stakes outcome 
              testing," for "the betterment of our society and the people in it." 
            </p>
            <p> The big educational testing companies have thus dispatched lobbyists 
              to Capitol Hill. Bruce Hunter, who represents the American Association 
              of School Administrators, says, "I've been lobbying on education 
              issues since 1982, but the test publishers have been active at a 
              level I've never seen before. At every hearing, every discussion, 
              the big test publishers are always present with at least one lobbyist, 
              sometimes more." Both standardized testing and textbook publishing 
              are dominated by the so-called Big Three--McGraw-Hill, Houghton-Mifflin 
              and Harcourt General--all identified as "Bush stocks" by Wall Street 
              analysts in the wake of the 2000 election. </p>
            <p> While critics of the Bush Administration's energy policies have 
              pointed repeatedly to its intimacy with the oil and gas industry--specifically 
              the now-imploding Enron--few education critics have noted the Administration's 
              cozy relationship with McGraw-Hill. At its heart lies the three-generation 
              social mingling between the McGraw and Bush families. The McGraws 
              are old Bush friends, dating back to the 1930s, when Joseph and 
              Permelia Pryor Reed began to establish Jupiter Island, a barrier 
              island off the coast of Florida, as a haven for the Northeast wealthy. 
              The island's original roster of socialite vacationers reads like 
              a who's who of American industry, finance and government: the Meads, 
              the Mellons, the Paysons, the Whitneys, the Lovetts, the Harrimans--and 
              Prescott Bush and James McGraw Jr. The generations of the two families 
              parallel each other closely in age: the patriarchs Prescott and 
              James Jr., son George and nephew Harold Jr., and grandson George 
              W. and grandnephew Harold III, who now runs the family publishing 
              empire. </p>
            <p> The amount of cross-pollination and mutual admiration between 
              the Administration and that empire is striking: Harold McGraw Jr. 
              sits on the national grant advisory and founding board of the Barbara 
              Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. McGraw in turn received the 
              highest literacy award from President Bush in the early 1990s, for 
              his contributions to the cause of literacy. The McGraw Foundation 
              awarded current Bush Education Secretary Rod Paige its highest educator's 
              award while Paige was Houston's school chief; Paige, in turn, was 
              the keynote speaker at McGraw-Hill's "government initiatives" conference 
              last spring. Harold McGraw III was selected as a member of President 
              George W. Bush's transition advisory team, along with McGraw-Hill 
              board member Edward Rust Jr., the CEO of State Farm and an active 
              member of the Business Roundtable on educational issues. An ex-chief 
              of staff for Barbara Bush is returning to work for Laura Bush in 
              the White House--after a stint with McGraw-Hill as a media relations 
              executive. John Negroponte left his position as McGraw-Hill's executive 
              vice president for global markets to become Bush's ambassador to 
              the United Nations. </p>
            <p> And over the years, Bush's education policies have been a considerable 
              boon to the textbook publishing conglomerate. In the mid-1990s, 
              then-Governor Bush became intensely focused on childhood literacy 
              in Texas. For a period of roughly two years, most often at the invitation 
              of the Governor, a small group of reading experts testified repeatedly 
              about what would constitute a "scientifically valid" reading curriculum 
              for Texas schoolchildren. As critics pointed out, a preponderance 
              of the consultants were McGraw-Hill authors. "Like ants at a picnic," 
              recalls Richard Allington, an education professor at the University 
              of Florida. "They wrote statements of principles for the Texas Education 
              Agency, advised on the development of the reading curriculum framework, 
              helped shape the state board of education call for new reading textbooks. 
              Not surprisingly, the 'research' was presented as supporting McGraw-Hill 
              products." And not surprisingly, the company gained a dominant share 
              in Texas's lucrative textbook marketplace. <i>Educational Marketer</i> 
              dubbed McGraw-Hill's campaign in the state "masterful," identifying 
              standards-based reform and the success of McGraw-Hill's "scientifically 
              valid" phonics-based reading program as the source of the company's 
              eventual triumph in Texas. </p>
            <p>Is the pattern repeating itself at the national level? On the day 
              he assumed the White House--the day he invited Harold McGraw III 
              into his office--Bush called on Congress to help him eliminate the 
              nation's "reading deficit" by implementing the "findings of years 
              of scientific research on reading." Bush would loosen the purse 
              strings on one condition: Instructional practices must be "scientifically 
              based." </p>
            <p>To the literacy cognoscenti, the meaning was clear: Classrooms 
              must follow the conclusions of the National Reading Panel, a blue-ribbon 
              panel assembled by Congress in the late 1990s to determine the "status 
              of research-based knowledge, including the effectiveness of various 
              approaches to teaching children to read." Thanks to the NRP report, 
              the phrase "scientifically based reading instruction" appears dozens 
              of times in the new federal reading legislation. Education Secretary 
              Paige recently explained in a speech before reading educators, "The 
              National Reading Panel screened more than 100,000 studies of reading 
              and...found that the most effective course of reading instruction 
              includes explicit and systematic instruction in phonemic awareness, 
              [and] phonics." </p>
            <p>Why is the same conservative constituency that loves testing even 
              more moonstruck by phonics? For starters, phonics is traditional 
              and rote--the pupil begins by sounding out letters, then works through 
              vocabulary drills, then short passages using the learned vocabulary. 
              Furthermore, to teach phonics you need a textbook and usually a 
              series of items--worksheets, tests, teacher's editions--that constitute 
              an elaborate purchase for a school district and a profitable product 
              line for a publisher. In addition, heavily scripted phonics programs 
              are routinely marketed as compensation for bad teachers. (What's 
              not mentioned is that they often repel, and even drive out, good 
              teachers.) Finally, as Gerald Coles, author of <i>Reading Lessons: 
              The Debate Over Literacy</i>, points out, "Phonics is a way of thinking 
              about illiteracy that doesn't involve thinking about larger social 
              injustices. To cure illiteracy, presumably all children need is 
              a new set of textbooks." </p>
            <p> Coles believes the NRP's conclusions, now implemented into law, 
              are likely to be as friendly to McGraw-Hill's bottom line as Bush's 
              policies were in Texas. "Combine the NRP report and the Bush legislation, 
              and they suddenly have quite a paddle for rowing toward huge profits," 
              he says. "Their products have been designed to embody the phrase 
              'scientifically based.'" </p>
            <p> Several critics have emerged with key questions about the NRP 
              report. To begin with, the 100,000 figure is wildly misleading. 
              The central findings--those most likely to guide school practices, 
              and thus their purchase of textbooks--involved only thirty-eight 
              studies. Coles argues that those studies are often themselves of 
              questionable relevance. On the decisive question of whether phonics 
              instruction has an impact on reading comprehension, for example, 
              the panel cited just three studies supporting a significant boost: 
              one conducted in Spain, one in Finland and one comparing phonics 
              to placing words and pictures into categories--as Coles puts it, 
              in effect comparing phonics to "no instruction at all." Coles found 
              the NRP report to be consistently slanted in favor of the skills-based, 
              phonics approach. Another researcher, Stephen Krashen of the University 
              of Southern California, complains that the report misrepresents 
              his research and is rife with errors. </p>
            <p> Nonetheless, the NRP report was sold to the public as a conclusive 
              end to the so-called Reading Wars. It was presented to educators 
              across the country, and reported by the media, as the triumph of 
              disinterested science, largely by means of a thirty-page media-friendly 
              summary and viewer-friendly video. Both are in lieu of a forbidding 
              "Reports of the Subgroups," which weighs in at a media-repellent 
              600 pages. </p>
            <p> Elaine Garan, an education professor at California State University, 
              Fresno, has parsed through all three. She believes there are wide 
              discrepancies between what was reported to the public and what the 
              panel actually found. Most blatantly, the summary proclaimed that 
              "systematic phonics instruction produces significant benefits for 
              students in kindergarten through sixth grade," while the report 
              itself said, "There were insufficient data to draw any conclusions 
              about the effects of phonics instruction with normally developing 
              readers above first grade." </p>
            <p>According to one panel member, there is a simple explanation for 
              the discrepancy: Widmeyer Communications, the powerful Washington, 
              DC, public relations firm hired by the government to promote the 
              panel's work. Widmeyer had represented McGraw-Hill's flagship literacy 
              product Open Court during the Texas literacy drive, and now it counts 
              McGraw-Hill and the Business Roundtable among its most prominent 
              clients. "They wrote the introduction to the final report," says 
              NRP member Joanne Yatvin. "And they wrote the summary, and prepared 
              the video, and did the press releases." </p>
            <p> Yatvin remains frustrated with Widmeyer's influence over the panel--from 
              stacking public hearings with alumni from Bush's Texas literacy 
              drive, to minimizing the impact of her dissent by burying her minority 
              report. Yatvin even recalls, with disgust, a Widmeyer flack getting 
              in between her and a reporter (Scott Widmeyer, Widmeyer's CEO, denies 
              that this happened). Other panel members echo Yatvin's concerns, 
              although the NRP chair, Donald Langenberg, chancellor of the University 
              System of Maryland, says the PR firm was "very nearly invisible" 
              and insists the panel's reading recommendations were "balanced." 
            </p>
            <p> It has been phonics-based programs, however, that seem to have 
              enjoyed a boost in the wake of the report. In Texas and California, 
              McGraw-Hill literacy products have been adopted by school districts 
              on the basis of their purported scientific validity. With the new 
              education bill, Bush has tripled funding for early literacy, bumping 
              it up to approximately $1 billion a year over the next six years. 
              And he has just tapped Christopher Doherty to be in charge of spending 
              that money. His qualifications? As head of the nonprofit Baltimore 
              Curriculum Project, Doherty brought DISTAR--McGraw-Hill's other 
              literacy product--to Baltimore's public schools. "The bill stresses 
              that the federal government must focus in early reading on those 
              programs that have been scientifically proven to be effective," 
              Doherty told the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>. "My job will be to help identify 
              those districts and states that show they are going to implement 
              K-3 reading programs based on that scientific research." </p>
            <p> Phonics and testing, we're meant to believe, are an intensive 
              therapy set to turn around laggard schools. But administrators, 
              teachers, parents and children know better; all are bracing for 
              the changes wrought by the new legislation. In Oakland the school 
              board wants to spend its money somewhere else, introducing a resolution 
              calling for the district to "cease immediately funding any and all 
              identified un-funded state mandated costs, including but not limited 
              to state-mandated testing, assessment and evaluations." Roy Romer, 
              the superintendent in Los Angeles, told the <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>, 
              "It's a good bill only if they fund it." Apprised that the increase 
              would come to roughly 35 cents per student per day, he concluded, 
              "It's just a bunch of new mandates." </p>
            <p> If this sounds like a dodge by those afraid of accountability, 
              why the suspicion among successful districts? Last May more than 
              two-thirds of eighth graders in the affluent New York suburb of 
              Scarsdale boycotted a new standardized test, protesting the dumbing 
              down of the district's curriculum. Elizabeth Burmaster, recently 
              elected Wisconsin's state superintendent of public instruction, 
              finds the new legislation wasteful and redundant. "The money we 
              have for public education is going to lowering class size," she 
              says, pointing out that Wisconsin has worked hard to develop its 
              own accountability system and that its students are perennially 
              among the highest-scoring in the nation. "But the federal legislation 
              basically says, 'Nope, you have to go back in and redo your state 
              assessment system.' To what purpose?" </p>
            <p> For the Bush Administration, passing the education bill may end 
              up being the easy part. The public liked its emphasis on high expectations 
              for schools and children (as opposed to the "soft bigotry of low 
              expectations" attributed to bleeding-heart educators). A quasi-religious, 
              and very American, faith in education helped the rhetoric of accountability 
              to resonate; people half-consciously believe that schools ought 
              to be able to equalize life opportunity, regardless of grinding 
              poverty in one district, booming affluence in the next. But that 
              disparity isn't going anywhere soon. The big players now at the 
              education table, some with a considerable financial stake in the 
              new regime, believe that money is best spent on testing and textbooks, 
              rather than on introducing equity into the system over the long 
              term. Meanwhile, thanks to a suave PR campaign, a large segment 
              of the education community takes for granted that the science behind 
              educational research is disinterested and rigorous. Both assumptions 
              prevail in the current legislation; both need to be examined with 
              clarity and skepticism in the years to come.</p>
