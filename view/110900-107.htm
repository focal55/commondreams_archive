I 
              so totally hope that Al Gore decides to fight like a junkyard dog 
              for Florida's 25 electoral votes.
            </font>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Forget 
              the polite blathering about respecting the process. This is Florida, 
              where they don't have sidewalks and where alligators crawl or slither 
              or whatever they do out of swamps and eat small dogs.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most 
              of all, Florida is a state where you go in and point fingers and 
              yell and scream and make a lot of noise to be heard.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
              he does just that, Al Gore can, finally, become a hero.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's 
              how:</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
              a straight-on, old-fashioned popular vote election, the vice president 
              would already have won the presidency. That's a position no one 
              thought he would be in at this point. The whole line of analysis 
              went that Bush was the popular guy, while Gore was the boring technocrat 
              who might piece it all together with electoral votes.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Turns 
              out the analysis was wrong. Gore's the popular guy -- well, OK, 
              not really popular, but more so than Bush.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              problem is that popular guy doesn't get to go to the White House 
              without getting his ticket punched in Florida. So he needs to make 
              his case.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Frankly, 
              it's a good case.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Polls 
              show that Gore won the popular vote because his candidacy was overwhelmingly 
              favored by women, people of color, gays and lesbians, trade unionists 
              and others who don't hold a lot of power in this country. The people 
              who need a president most have placed their faith in Al Gore.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
              fact leaves Gore without a choice.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              vice president needs to put aside his own fears, his own ego, his 
              own sense of self-image. He needs to become the tribune of the people 
              who rode the bus and walked in the rain and stood in those long 
              lines to vote for him. He needs to say, ``Look, Florida has a long 
              history of political shenanigans, vote fraud and disenfranchisement. 
              But it stops here. It stops when Jeb Bush and his minions seek to 
              deny the office of the presidency to the elected president of the 
              United States.''</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gore 
              should announce that he believes he has won the presidency -- a 
              fair statement for a winner of the popular vote and the current 
              leader in the electoral vote count. And he should say, bluntly, 
              that he believes that his election is threatened by local officials 
              who have too long a history of turning the wheels of government 
              to aid their interests.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gore 
              should not back down until the last ballot is counted. He should 
              not ease up until he is certain that every fundamental question 
              about the process in Florida has been answered.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's 
              fine if Gore does this for himself.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
              it is necessary that he fight for Florida as the voice of those 
              who have no voice otherwise -- the millions of voters who chose 
              to believe in the promise of a Gore presidency.</font></P>
<P align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
In 
              some presidential terms, the chief executive proves himself in his 
              final days. In others, he shows quiet strength throughout his tenure. 
              In this one, if Al Gore is to be the president, he must make his 
              stand at the start. He must fight for his presidency. And if he 
              fails to do so, Gore must recognize that he is letting down not 
              just himself but millions of Americans who dared to put their trust 
              in a man who has done so little to earn that trust.
