EIGHT YEARS AGO this summer, a young woman from Berkeley named Leona 
Benten arrived on a jet at New York's John F. Kennedy International 
Airport bearing three little white pills she had picked up in London. 
Alerted to her arrival, customs officials detained her and seized the 
illegal pills, not knowing that national media had also been tipped 
off about this supposed ``smuggling'' attempt. The story was Page One 
news around the world, for this was no ordinary illegal drug.
<P>  The pills were a French medication called RU-486. Already legal in 
Europe for years, this drug, when prescribed and supervised by a 
physician, can be taken within the first two months of an unwanted 
pregnancy, thereby producing a ``medical'' abortion. RU-486 had 
already been shown to be safe and effective, and womens' health 
activists around the country were calling for its approval in the 
United States. Besides offering another option for early abortion, 
surveys of doctors indicated that it could significantly improve the 
problem of lack of access to safe abortion in this country, as some 
doctors who did not perform surgical abortions planned to offer the 
pill when it became available.	 
</P>
<P>  A few years earlier, the French minister of health, when ordering 
the drug's approval there, had called it ``the moral property of 
women.'' Politics, however, kept the 
landmark drug out of U.S. medical offices.	 
</P>
<P>  ``Right to life'' activists threatened politicians and drug 
companies with boycotts and even violence should the drug be brought 
here.	 
</P>
<P>  Then-President Bush took the extraordinary step of explicitly 
banning the drug. To counter this, pro-choice physicians and 
activists gained the endorsement of RU-486 by the American Medical 
Association -- hardly a radical women's rights organization -- as 
well as that of many other politicians and other health groups. All 
to no avail.	 
</P>
<P>  In San Francisco, a group of women's health clinicians and 
activists were increasingly frustrated by the impasse, and so adopted 
a kind of ``street theater'' in staging the Benten ``importation.'' 
As hoped, the resulting media circus and Supreme Court case -- the 
court refused Benten's request to get the pills back -- got the 
attention of Bill Clinton, then in his first campaign for president, 
and he pledged to remove the political obstacles to the pill.	 
</P>
<P>  All these years later, American women are still waiting for this 
medication, now known as Mifepristone. Now the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, which has dragged its bureaucratic feet on this topic 
for years, threatens to finally approve the pill with so many 
restrictions as to effectively keep the pill inaccessible to most 
American women.	 
</P>
<P>  The proposed restrictions go well beyond what any objective 
health-care orga 
nization has recommended. They are clearly a concession to 
anti-abortion politics, rather than good science and compassion.	 
</P>
<P>  For example, forcing doctors to register with the government to 
use the pill could be seen as a form of intimidation in a highly 
politicized environment where doctors providing abortions have been 
threatened, harmed and even murdered.	 
Ironically, in the interim of the long delay in getting RU-486 
approved here, other medications have been tested that essentially 
perform the same function. No such restrictions apply for these other 
drugs. If a physician is knowledgeable and a woman with an unwanted 
pregnancy does not desire a surgical abortion -- and if she is early 
enough in her pregnancy -- a 
``medical'' (pill-induced) abortion can be made available. But RU-486 
has been developed and extensively tested and used for just this 
purpose, and it is shameful that we are still a ``second-class'' 
nation in this regard.	 
</P>
<P>  Anyone concerned with women's health and equality, including and 
especially our elected representatives, should oppose this latest 
``sneak attempt to limit reproductive choice. San Francisco's Board 
of Supervisors is considering a resolution by Supervisor Gavin Newsom 
that does just that. Our state and federal legislators should follow 
suit.	 
</P>
<P>Proper governmental regulation of new medications is indeed crucial. 
But politics should not be a controlling factor in setting medical 
and public health policies. RU-486 has already been safely and 
effectively used by more than half a million women worldwide, without 
the kinds of restrictions now proposed here. More than 95 percent of 
women who have already used the drug would recommend it to others. It 
represents a choice in reproductive options that should be the moral 
property of American women, too.
