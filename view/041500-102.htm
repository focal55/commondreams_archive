<p>WASHINGTON, April 14 --  The 
students with purple hair, the 
graying academics with Jerry Garcia beards and the  union organizers 
with their anti-W.T.O. buttons had 
crowded into a college auditorium in 
Minneapolis to hear some red-meat 
-- make that green-vegetable -- radicalism. And Ralph Nader, America's foremost anti-corporate  curmudgeon, did not disappoint:

<p> Global  corporations are sucking 
the life out of small businesses and 
family farms. Pollution is poisoning 
our rivers and air. Inner-city schools 
and health clinics are crumbling. 
And while the nation corrodes, the 
rich are buying and selling politicians like  baseball cards.

<p> "Big business is on a collision 
course with American democracy, 
and American democracy has been 
losing," said Mr. Nader, who in his 
dark suit was the most conventional-looking person in the room.

<p> The man who became famous by 
killing off a sporty but unstable little 
car called the Corvair some 35 years 
ago is at it again, running for president on the Green Party line.

<p> But unlike his previous presidential run,  in 1996, when he refused to 
raise money, spent less than $5,000 
and attracted barely 1 percent of the 
vote, this time he is serious, Mr. 
Nader insists.

<p> "I specifically said I wasn't going 
to campaign in '96," he said in an 
interview. "This is a campaign."

<p> Mr. Nader is cranking up that 
 campaign just in time to step onto 
the world stage this weekend, when 
tens of thousands of protesters descend on Washington to demonstrate 
against the International Monetary 
Fund and the World Bank. Green 
Party affiliates from around the 
world are playing a major role in the 
protests, and Mr. Nader himself will 
address demonstrators near the 
White House on Sunday. 

<p> The goal of Mr. Nader's run is not 
to win, of course, but to get more 
than 5 percent of the vote, the  number that  would qualify him  for millions in federal campaign matching 
funds that he says he would use to 
build the Green Party.

<p> "If the Green Party breaks 5 percent, the Democratic Party won't be 
the same again,"   Mr. Nader, still 
irrepressibly dour and hauntingly 
hungry-looking at 66, said in reflecting on the prospect of  undercutting 
the  centrist Democratic Leadership 
Council and its president, Al From. 
"If you think Al From and the Democratic Leadership Council has a grip 
on the Democratic Party, wait and 
see what a significant and growing 
progressive third party can do." 

<p> Aides to Vice President Al  Gore, 
the apparent Democratic nominee, 
 say they are not losing sleep over a 
Nader challenge. Mr. Nader is not 
 the most skillful of campaigners, and 
even many  liberal allies question his 
ability to move voters. Further,  the 
Green Party is better known for its 
internal squabbling than for its ability to run campaigns or raise money. 

<p>    But Mr. Gore's yielding even a few 
percentage points to Mr. Nader 
would  be damaging to the vice president if the election was tight. And  a 
recent poll by the Zogby Group 
showed Mr. Nader receiving more 
support than Patrick J. Buchanan, 
the likely Reform Party nominee,  5 
percent to 3 percent. The poll indicated that the vast majority of Mr. 
Nader's support came from Democrats and that he was doing particularly well in California, considered a 
vital state for Mr. Gore.

<p> All of which suggests that an aggressive Nader campaign could entirely offset  advantages Mr. Gore 
might  gain from  Mr. Buchanan's 
candidacy, which  is expected to siphon votes from the apparent  Republican nominee,  Gov. George W. Bush.

<p> Mr. Nader intends to remain a 
thorn in Mr. Gore's side by promoting causes  that many liberals,  large 
numbers of whom chose  Bill Bradley 
in the Democratic primaries,  say the 
Clinton administration has lacked 
the will to see through:  universal 
health care, the environment, campaign finance reform and an attack 
on urban poverty.

<p> And unlike Mr. Bradley, Mr. Nader 
is a fierce opponent of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement 
and the World Trade Organization, 
endearing him to traditionally Democratic union members who feel that 
the  administration's free-trade policies have hurt American workers. 

<p> As evidence that this year will be 
different from 1996, Mr. Nader says 
he has hired 15 full-time campaign 
workers in Washington and will soon 
dispatch 10 others,  perhaps former 
Bradley campaign organizers 
among them, to get the Green Party 
 on the ballot in every state. (The 
 party is already on the ballot in 13 
states, including New York and California.)

<p> He has also vowed to raise $5 million, and  says he may get  help from 
celebrities like Paul Newman, Warren Beatty, Susan Sarandon,  Bonnie 
Raitt, Jackson Browne and the Indigo Girls. His first major fund-raising 
event, in Washington tonight, drew 
300 people, who paid $25 to  $1,000 
each, adding to the $210,000 or so that 
 the candidate's  aides said they had 
already raised. 

<p> But to get anywhere near 5 percent 
of the vote, Mr. Nader will have to 
overcome some big obstacles, not the 
least of which is the Green Party 
itself. The party is notoriously disorganized and divided.   
<p>Some  members 
oppose any involvement in electoral 
politics;  others are supporting another candidate, Jello Biafra,  former 
lead singer of the rock group the 
Dead Kennedys.

<p> And then there is Mr. Nader, who 
is the first to acknowledge that he is 
not the  best campaigner. Gawky  and 
prone to long speeches, he is also shy 
and painfully uncomfortable with 
asking people for their votes. When a 
 Delta Air Lines worker stopped him 
in the Minneapolis airport last week 
and said,  "I'm a big fan," all he  could 
say in reply  was "thanks."

<p> "Campaigning takes a level of political ego I just don't have yet," he 
said after the man had sped off. 

<p> He is also notoriously private, refusing to tell even co-workers where 
he lives. (It is in an apartment he 
rents in the Dupont Circle section of 
Washington.) The only crumbs of 
biographical information he sprinkles into his hourlong speeches are 
passing references to the town of his 
birth,  Winsted, Conn. Rarely does he 
mention that he is a son of Lebanese 
immigrants, that his father owned a 
restaurant, that he studied Chinese 
at Princeton and law at Harvard.

<p> His secretiveness has spawned a 
host of dark theories among his critics. Some contend that he lives in a 
million-dollar town house here, not in 
the ill-furnished apartment of Nader 
lore. (Mr. Nader says the  town house 
he has been spotted entering is his 
sister's.) They say  that despite his 
seemingly penurious way of living, 
 he is actually quite wealthy, that  he 
purposely spent almost nothing on 
his 1996 campaign to skirt federal 
election laws, which require candidates who spend more than $5,000 to 
file reports disclosing their assets. 

<p> Mr. Nader says he will file a financial disclosure report next month. 
Despite the concerns he frequently 
voices about the dangers of too rapid 
an advance in technology, the report 
will  show, he says, that  he owns 
technology stocks. It will also disclose, he says, that he earned about 
$200,000  in speaking fees last year 
but gave half of it to charities. He 
says that most of the other half  went 
toward "projects" and that  he lives 
on about $25,000 a year.

<p> Asked how so private a man could 
run for so public a job, Mr. Nader, a 
lifelong bachelor,  replied: "When 
you work all the time, you don't have 
a problem in terms of private time. 
There is no private time."

<p> Even among many on the left, Mr. 
Nader is not considered the dream 
candidate. In a recent essay in The 
Nation, Katha Pollitt complained 
that his  1996 campaign had focused 
too much on trade issues, to the 
exclusion of matters like  race relations, health care, and gay and abortion rights.

<p> "The idea of progressives cranking up an organization, raising funds, 
fomenting energy and enthusiasm on 
behalf of this doomed project," Ms. 
Pollitt wrote, "well, it's just too depressing. If working on Nader's campaign is the best way progressives 
can spend the next eight months, it's 
time to hire a hearse and lie down in 
it."

<p> Mr. Nader, who says he is running 
partly at the behest of Green Party 
leaders, replied, "I think she ran out 
of material that week."

<p>Still, his platform seems to reflect 
some of the criticisms of progressives like Ms. Pollitt. At the top is 
universal health care, followed by an 
antipoverty  program built heavily on 
consumer-protection ideas, including 
provisions against loan discrimination by banks, high auto insurance 
rates and landlord abuses.

<p> "Corporate welfare," one of his 
favorite issues, will also be  front and 
center: he will campaign against  tax 
breaks and government subsidies 
that  allow big companies "to privatize profits and socialize risk."

<p> And, in an effort to win support 
from social conservatives, he plans 
to attack big media corporations, 
saying they  exploit children with 
 racy programming and aggressive 
marketing practices. 

<p> Although he is counting on the  anti-globalization  protests this weekend 
to raise his national profile, Mr. Nader says his best hope for gaining 
attention would  be to squeeze between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush in 
televised debates.

<p> The  commission that  determines 
presidential debate participants has 
said a candidate must be receiving 
15 percent in national polls to be 
included. Mr. Nader contends that 
the threshold is ridiculously high, 
and hopes to unite  with  Mr. Buchanan to protest it.   
<p>And  if he prevails, he 
says, he will  pose in those debates 
 the kind of questions that will spark 
interest in his campaign.

<p> "Candidates are asked, 'What is 
your position on welfare, what is 
your   position  on crime?' " Mr. Nader 
said. "That's not the right question. 
It needs an adjective: 'What is your 
position on corporate welfare? What 
is your position on  corporate crime?' 
We're going to open this up. We're 
going to provide adjectives to these 
issues."
