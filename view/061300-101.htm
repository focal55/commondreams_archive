<p>What do the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks that are to resume near Washington today and the local fight over the South Boston waterfront development have in common? Or the fate of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Mugabe-sponsored seizures of white-owned farms in Zimbabwe? Or the NATO bombing of Serbia last year and the American rush toward a missile defense system? These events are some of the  manifestations of a world-shift in the socio-political ethos, and they mark, perhaps, the end of a precious period in history.
<P>
<P>In the decade dating back to the velvet revolution that brought down the Soviet empire and ended the Cold War, extraordinary efforts at peaceful resolution broadly replaced an earlier spirit of bitter confrontation. This happened in unprecedented ways, on small and large scales.
<P>
<P>The wars in the Balkans and Rwanda are exceptions, but they almost prove the point by standing in stark contrast to developments elsewhere. In places as diverse as South Africa, Ireland, Ukraine, and Central America, old enemies found ways to put weapons aside and build new structures of mutual regard. Within the United States the ''culture wars'' of the 1970s and 1980s gave way to a new expansiveness, doubtlessly tied to an expanding economy. The decline in urban violence reflects this, but so does a new politics of inclusion. This was so no where more dramatically than in Boston, where old tribal and racial conflicts came to see a thing of the past.
<P>
<P>But this general, if not universal, comity at home and abroad seems to be slipping away before our eyes, whether our gaze turns toward Zimbabwe, with its racial nightmare, or toward Colombia, where a US-funded escalation of anti-insurgency replays an old scenario, or to Russia, where deadly suspicion of the West reasserts itself.
<P>
<P>In Boston the dormant habit of demonizing the other has snapped awake with a vengeance - and once again the star antagonists are Southie and the press. But nowhere does the precious legacy of post-Cold War momentum toward reconciliation seem more at risk than in the Middle East, especially in the uncertainty following upon the death on Saturday of President Hafez Assad of Syria.
<P>
<P>In some ways the Madrid Peace Conference of 1991, in transforming  the relationship between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization from one of  savage confrontation to one of open-ended dialogue, was the most remarkable occurrence of that remarkable year. That is so because until then the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians had seemed to be nothing less than a fight to the death. If something unpredictably hopeful began to happen then, it was surely because the world currents were running so strongly toward peace.
<P>
<P>The achievements of Madrid, and then of Oslo in 1993, were also based, of course, on the pragmatic decision to postpone the most difficult issues until the end of the negotiations, but surely that was done in the expectation that the broader cultural forces supporting peaceful resolution would only grow stronger. Alas, the opposite seems to be happening.
<P>
<P>All of this is why the meeting underway near Washington is so fraught. Negotiators for Israel and the Palestinian Authority will look for openings in the heretofore closed questions of Jerusalem, the captured territories, and the plight of Palestinian refugees.
<P>
<P>Of these, as Anthony Lewis and others point out, Jerusalem is the most difficult. That is so because the claim each side makes less to the city than to the sacred precinct of the TempleMount/Dome of the Rock is absolute. Compromises regarding redrawn borders of the West Bank and Gaza are on the table, and Israel's recent withdrawal from Lebanon reinforces hope here. A just disposition of the refugee question is conceivable, especially in the context of a booming Israeli economy that is already changing the social landscape. But agreement over Jerusalem and over its most sacred acreage is going to require the wisdom of Solomon.
<P>
<P>To those outside the room in which these talks take place, this dilemma seems insoluble. The simple fact that the negotiations continue, however, means that those inside the room think otherwise.
<P>
<P>President Clinton, Prime Minister Barak, and Chairman Arafat all want resolution now, but each of these figures is politically vulnerable, and it remains to be seen whether any of the three is powerful enough to deliver on what is promised. Assad's death compounds the uncertainty, but even more troubling is the global cold front that has transformed the climate within which this final act plays out. This conclusion of the Middle East Peace process looms as a test, therefore, of the entire international effort to replace war with reconciliation.
<P>
<P>Can the tattered fabric of trust and civility that flew like a flag above every political hope not long ago be raised again, not just on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, but everywhere? When the stakes are so large, so are the possibilities.
<P>
<P>If the Israeli-Palestinian negotiators, despite everything, are able to achieve a final settlement, their accomplishment will resonate around the world, just as Mikhail Gorbachev's and Ronald Reagan's did after Reykjavik.
<P>
<P>If Israel and the Palestinian Authority can come to terms over Jerusalem, then, for one thing, antagonists in Africa will have a much needed spur toward peace. For another, even the most parochial-minded politicians in Boston will have an example of what is possible when narrow loyalties are transcended by a vision of the greater good.
<P>
<P>The eyes of the world, in other words, turn toward Washington this week, with fervent hopes for Palestinians, Israelis, and for everyone.
