SOME U.S. LEADERS are toying with an idea for a new nuclear bomb that 
could have turned NATO's campaign in Kosovo into a nuclear war. For 
more than 50 years, there has been a taboo against unleashing the 
terrible power of the atom in war, but some in the U.S. nuclear 
weapons establishment and their political allies now envision a world 
where nuclear combat could become almost a commonplace event.	 

<P>  Sound crazy? Unfortunately, it's true.	 
</P>
<P>  Top Senate Republicans already have pushed through a measure that 
will allow U.S. weapons labs to begin studies on a so-called 
``mini-nuke,'' intended not to deter a potential enemy but for use in 
small, regional wars. The measure is expected to pass when Congress 
debates the defense budget bill later this month. And even though the 
Pentagon says it ``has no requirement'' for such a new weapon, no one 
in President Clinton's lame-duck administration is expected to take 
on the issue.	 
</P>
<P>Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Wayne Allard, R-Colo., ensured that 
the Senate version of the Defense Authorization Bill for fiscal year 
2001 contains a provision to allow initial development studies on a 
nuclear weapon with an explosive yield of less than five kilotons. 
The senators acted in answer to an Air Force request for permis 
sion to explore creation of an earth-burrowing nuclear warhead that 
could be used in regional wars, such as the Gulf War or Kosovo, to 
destroy underground bunkers.	 
</P>
<P>  The aim would be to kill national leaders such as Saddam Hussein 
or Slobodan Milosevic, or to destroy stocks of biological/chemical 
weapons held by so-called ``rogue'' states. The thinking -- detailed 
in a recent paper, ``Nuclear Weapons in the 21st Century'' by Stephen 
Younger, associate director for nuclear weapons at Los Alamos 
National Laboratory -- is that such bunkers are often in urban areas, 
where use of a ``normal'' nuclear weapon would cause unacceptable 
damage and casualties to the civilian population. A ``mini-nuke,'' 
proponents argue, would be a sure way of killing a dictator, or 
wiping out stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, with little 
or no release of those agents into the environment.	 
</P>
<P>Obviously, the development and deployment of a weapon with a 
relatively small explosive yield -- the Hiroshima bomb, regarded 
today as tiny, was a 15 kiloton weapon -- would be extremely 
dangerous, precisely because the military would regard it as 
``usable.'' The negative political ramifications of launching a 
nuclear war apparently go unheeded by Younger and others promoting 
such a new weapon.	 
</P>
<P>  It is also absurd to assert that such a weapon could be employed 
without en
dangering civilians. A mini-nuke dropped on San Francisco might only 
destroy Twin Peaks, not the entire city. But, even a small nuclear 
weapon would kill thousands of people and bring appalling suffering 
to thousands more victims of burns, radiation sickness, blindness and 
other injuries. Eventually, thousands more would suffer as the result 
of genetic deformities -- exactly as has happened in Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki.	 
</P>
<P>  And even with today's precision weapons, accurate delivery cannot 
be ensured. The accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy during 
NATO's Kosovo air war is a case in point.	 
</P>
<P>  War aside, a number of immediate negative consequences can be 
expected if the United States pursues ``mini-nukes.''	 
</P>
<P>  In the near term, nuclear weapons design and development activity 
at Department of Energy labs would be intensified. Eventually, there 
would be strong pressure to resume nuclear testing, as the weapon 
scientists seek to prove to the military that their new designs work. 
This would wreck the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, already weakened 
by its rejection by the Senate last year. In fact, there already is 
strong pressure from the U.S. nuclear labs, and members of Congress 
such as Sen. Allard, to abandon the test ban treaty and the U.S. 
moratorium on nuclear testing.	 
The United States' move to develop mini-nukes has the potential to 
spur proliferation. The refusal of the ``nuclear-haves'' 
to live up to obligations under the Non-
Proliferation Treaty to pursue nuclear disarmament already has piqued 
India and Pakistan to acquire nuclear capability.	 
</P>
<P>How can the world take seriously Washington's pledge, made during the 
May Non-Proliferation Treaty 2000 Review Conference, to make an 
``unequivocal undertaking'' to work toward eliminating nuclear 
weapons, when at the same time U.S. officials are promoting new, more 
usable bombs?	 
</P>
<P>  Moreover, the United States has signed so-called negative security 
assurances -- promising not to launch a nuclear attack on non-nuclear 
countries. Doesn't the development of a ``mini-nuke'' make a mockery 
of those promises?	 
</P>
<P>  Is the U.S. government really ready to overthrow the international 
consensus that nuclear war would be the ultimate disaster, just for 
the chance to drop a bomb on Saddam Hussein? Does such a policy make 
strategic sense for a peaceful 21st century?	 
</P>
<P>Those touting the use of battlefield nuclear weapons need to look up 
from their blueprints and recognize the potentially frightening 
results of their laboratory experiments.
