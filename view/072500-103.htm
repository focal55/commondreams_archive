WASHINGTON - Seven years ago, America seemed ready for serious health-care reform. Indeed, some say it was his promise of health-care reform that helped President Clinton get elected the first time. The people were ready, and Hillary Clinton - the smart one with the patience and the commitment - was primed to deliver.
<P>
 Then, the whole thing blew up, and neither Hillary nor health-care reform has fully recovered.
<P>
 Now here comes Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., with a plan to reform health care. Don't liberals ever learn?
<P>
 Well, Wellstone thinks he <i>has</i> learned a thing or two from that early '90s disaster. The first lesson, he said at a small press conference on the Capitol grounds the other day, is that "you have to have a proposal that fits the mood of the country - and that the people can understand."
<P>
 The Clinton effort failed on both counts. Hillary Clinton wanted health-care reform that covered the then estimated 38 million Americans without health insurance. The people - or so it seemed to me - wanted health-care reform that would reduce the premiums they feared were soaring out of control. The package that came out of the closed-door White House gatherings of experts was so complicated and so unexposed to the normal give and take of big legislative initiatives, nobody knew - or knows to this day - whether it was any good.
<P>
 Wellstone's second lesson - really a permutation of the first - is that you can't have major health-care reform unless you build a movement to <i>demand</i> it.
<P>
 And the third: Have a good idea, but "never fall in love with a piece of legislation."
<P>
 Here's the core of Wellstone's good idea: A universal health-care plan broad enough to warm the cockles of a liberal heart - but with the specifics left, in good conservative fashion, to the individual states.
<P>
 And here is what he hopes is his special stroke of genius for getting it enacted: He's making common cause with the Service Employees International Union, the nation's largest union of health-care workers. The union will take the lead in building grass-roots support for reform across America - a process that may take a couple of years and, coincidentally, free it from the politics of a presidential election.
<P>
 The rallying cry: "Health care for the people as good as Congress provides for itself."
<P>
 Wellstone says he hasn't even started looking for co-sponsors of his bill, preferring to wait until there's a groundswell for reform. But in general, families earning less than $25,000 a year would pay no more than 0.5 percent of their income for health insurance; those making between $25,000 and $50,000 a maximum of 5 percent, and those making above that no more than 7 percent. The federal government would provide a match of 70 percent or 75 percent to the states that agreed to provide universal coverage.
<P>
 And Wellstone doesn't care how they do it. Would some states choose the single-payer Canadian-style plan Wellstone himself was favoring seven or eight years ago? Fine. A single-payer consortium of states? No problem. Employer mandates? Whatever.
<P>
 The only requirement would be that the states would have to offer affordable health care by the end of 2005.
<P>
 Wellstone says his proposal would cost as much as $700 billion over 10 years or, as he put it, a third of the projected budget surplus. But surplus or not, he thinks it would be money well spent. And if his grass-roots scheme generates the sort of political pressure he has in mind, the money would be spent. After all, the people's health is worth something.
<P>
 The need for thoroughgoing reform - and not just reduced premiums - should be obvious by now, Wellstone says.
<P>
 "Back in 1993-94," he said, "we had high unemployment and some 38 million people without health insurance. Today, with employment at record highs, we have 45 million people without insurance. Forty-five million people without any coverage whatsoever - and we're not even talking about it?"
<P>
 If Wellstone and the Service Employees International Union have their way, we'll be talking about it, all right.
