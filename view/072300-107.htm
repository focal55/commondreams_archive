It started out like a swirling 
cacophony of rat-a-tat-tats on our brain, wearing us down, making 
us numb. Racial profiling, irradiated beef, bottled water, ozone 
depletion, global warming, sweatshops, executions, have a frappuccino -  the bovine growth hormone is on the house, limit habeas 
corpus, expand Niketown, buy a politician, get some corporate 
welfare, Dow is up, strip the rain forest, check out my new 
Palm Pilot.	 
<P> Until finally, we've had enough.	 
</P>
<P> The wake-up 
call sounded last year, when 50,000 citizens took to the streets 
in Seattle to shut down the World Trade Organization's round 
of international trade negotiations.	 
</P>
<P> This summer, building 
on the groundswell of support displayed in Seattle, there will 
be another political seismic shift as thousands of fed-up but 
hopeful citizens demonstrate outside the Republican convention 
in Philadelphia next week and at the Democrats' shindig in Los 
Angeles August 14 through 17.	 
</P>
<P> The protesters will be people 
like you and me --  mothers, bus drivers, students, carpenters, 
architects, lawyers and people of every color and age. We know 
deep in our hearts that our governmental processes are broken 
and that our way of life has been hijacked by corporations and 
the politicians who serve as their hired thugs.	 
</P>
<P> We've known 
for some time now that something is terribly wrong --  that 
the gap between rich and poor is growing, that many of us don't 
have health insurance, retirement funds or pensions, that we're 
grinding out 60- and 70-hour work weeks and there's still not 
enough money to make the rent, feed the kids, pay the mortgage.	 
</P>
<P> We've seen our schools crumble as more prisons are built. 
We've seen our neighborhoods morph into generic clones, with 
the same Blockbusters, Starbucks, Gaps and Wal-Marts.	 
</P>
<P> Inside the convention halls, it will be business as usual. The same 
fat-cat, corporate and industry donors will be at both the Democrat 
and Republican conventions, stuffing politicians' pockets with 
fistfuls of soft-money dollars, hedging their bets so it doesn't 
matter who wins.	 
</P>
<P> ``The Democrats and Republicans are like 
a two-headed monster,'' said Jason Mark, spokesman for Global 
Exchange, which is organizing and training people to demonstrate 
at the conventions. ``They may bicker and fight with each other, 
but it's the same body and the same feet. We don't see any real 
distinction separating them.''	 
</P>
<P> Yes. Forget the Democrats 
and Republicans. The real action won't be found inside the convention 
halls. It's going to be outside, where the people will propose 
a citizen's agenda of the issues that really count.	 
</P>
<P> There will be teach-ins on genetically modified foods, marches against 
sweatshop labor and global corporatization. There will be rallies 
to end the death penalty and highlight the prison-industrial 
complex, a Shadow Convention focusing on campaign finance reform, 
the widening wage gap and the failed war on drugs. There will 
be speeches on homeless issues and lack of universal health 
insurance. People will shout and wave signs about environmental 
destruction and demand support for working families. There will 
be singing and theater, dance and democracy.	 
</P>
<P> ``It's much 
more challenging than stopping the war machine,'' said John 
Sellers, director of the Ruckus Society, a 5-year-old Berkeley 
organization that trains people in nonviolent civil disobedience. 
``It's confronting an entire world view. We have had this corporate 
consciousness descend on us that is hard to pierce through. 
We have to show people that we can choose a different reality 
than the one we have imposed on ourselves.''	 
</P>
<P> Like the vast 
majority of demonstrators, Ruckus-trained protesters are committed 
to nonviolence, but it's possible that, as in Seattle, a handful 
of really frustrated people could destroy Nike, Gap or Planet 
Hollywood property. They may break windows in an empty store 
or throw a trash can at an HMO office.	 
</P>
<P> If that happens, 
you will have to decide whether that kind of behavior falls 
under your definition of violence.	 
</P>
<P> Perhaps it's more violent 
that some of our elderly choose between buying prescription 
drugs and eating. That the federal government pumps $20 billion 
a year into fossil-fuel subsidies. That women in Saipan live 
behind barbed wire where they sew clothes 12 hours a day for 
retailers like Gap, Wal-Mart, Sears, Tommy Hilfiger and The 
Limited. Isn't it violent that nearly 25 percent of California 
residents lack health insurance, and a quarter of the state's 
children live in poverty? And isn't it violent that Gap CEO 
Millard Drexler makes $60,000 an hour while Gap workers in Tehuacan, 
Mexico, make 28 cents an hour?	 
</P>
<P> It just depends on how you look at it.	 
</P>
<P> At the core of this citizen-awakening are two 
truths: Corporations have saturated every aspect of U.S. and 
world culture, merging and putting profit before human needs. 
And secondly, the government --  the very institution that is 
supposed to protect us --  has forsaken us and is instead helping 
the corporations pillage the Earth and her people.	 
</P>
<P> Take the World Bank, for example. For every dollar the American government 
contributes to the bank, American corporations receive $1.35 
in procurement contracts, according to Treasury Department Secretary 
Lawrence Summers, who told Congress in 1995 how companies profit 
from World Bank loans. One of the Bank's current proposals is 
to develop oil fields in the Central African nation of Chad, 
by running more than 600 miles of pipeline out to the coast 
at Cameroon. The environmental impact is expected to be devastating. 
But profits will likely soar for Exxon, Mobil and Chevron, the 
bank's major partners in the project.	 
</P>
<P> Jia Ching Chen is 
an organizer with Youth Action for Global Change, which focuses 
on the U.S. role in driving corporate globalization and teaches 
young people about institutions like the World Bank and the WTO. 
<P> Chen, 27, hopes the unconventional gatherings outside 
the Democratic and Republican conventions will highlight the 
growing gap between rich and poor, a schism he saw in his own 
work as a former architect.	 
</P>
<P> ``I love architecture, but 
it was too painful of a contrast to be detailing a house where 
just for the windows, the owner was spending $250,000,'' Chen 
said. ``You could buy a couple of houses in West Oakland for 
that. I just didn't want to be involved in that kind of amassing 
of personal, private wealth.''	 
</P>
<P> Rose Braz will join Chen 
and thousands of others at the demonstrations. Braz, an Oakland 
criminal defense attorney and the program director for Critical 
Resistance, a national organization working to end prison expansion, 
and other activists have teamed with the Fresno NAACP in a lawsuit 
challenging the construction of a $335 million, 5,000-bed maximum 
security prison in Delano. ``There is something very wrong when 
California is No. 1 in prison spending and 41st in the nation 
for education spending,'' Braz said.	 
</P>
<P> For Braz, Democrats 
like Gov. Gray Davis and Bill Clinton share the same lock-em-up 
mentality as their Republican predecessors. ``Who is more wicked? 
Republican or Democrat? There really is no difference,'' she 
said. ``Since Clinton and Davis have been in office, there have 
been attacks on civil rights throughout the court system. And 
to say it's better to elect Al Gore president so he can appoint 
better Supreme Court justices just doesn't hold water. History 
has shown that a Supreme Court nominated by a Democrat has not 
made a difference.''	 
</P>
<P> Braz has a point. The court's two 
most consistently liberal justices --  John Paul Stevens and 
David Souter --  were appointed, respectively, by Republicans 
Gerald Ford and George Bush. On the other hand, Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
and Stephen Breyer, both consistently pro-corporate, were appointed 
by Clinton.	 
</P>
<P> This summer's protests will illustrate just 
how far both parties have moved away from people's concerns, 
Braz said. ``People are motivated by everything from the degradation 
of the environment to sweatshops to prisons to come together 
for so many different reasons as an alternative to both Democrats 
and Republicans.''	 
</P>
<P> It's going to be a hodgepodge of protests 
because there is so much to protest about.	 
</P>
<P> But to what 
purpose? What will two weeks of marching, demonstrating, singing 
and yelling accomplish, when all is said and done?	 
</P>
<P> Well, remember slavery? Remember when women couldn't vote? Remember 
when we didn't have even the most basic workers' rights? Remember 
being forced to sit at the back of the bus? Remember the Vietnam 
War?	 
</P>
<P> Marching, demonstrating, singing and yelling is the 
way we've historically made change when our government stopped 
listening.	 
</P>
<P> In times of moral crisis, it's always been the 
people who lead and the leaders who follow. It's been the emancipators, 
the suffragettes, the protesters against child labor and inhumane 
working conditions, those who marched and even died to stop 
the war, to gain civil rights, to end apartheid.	 
</P>
<P> As Emma 
Goldman wrote in 1909: ``When in the course of human development, 
existing institutions prove inadequate to the needs of man, 
when they serve merely to enslave, rob and oppress mankind, 
the people have the eternal right to rebel against, and overthrow, 
these institutions.''	 
</P>
