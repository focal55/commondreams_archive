I reckon Richard Pryor and Fred G. Sanford were both right after all.
<P>

Pryor, the socially perceptive, brilliant comedian now quieted by multiple sclerosis, once told a joke about going to court as a black man in America seeking justice. "And that's exactly what I saw -- just us."
<P>

Sanford, the irascible junk dealer portrayed by Redd Foxx on the TV classic "Sanford & Son," stood up in court and disputed a judge's contention that the criminal justice system was colorblind: "Just look around, judge. There are enough (blacks) in here to make a 'Tarzan' movie."
<P>

The truth of those humorous one-liners has long been known to blacks, most of whom can verify the inequality by anecdotal evidence or from experience. But those self-evident truths were borne out earlier this week when a study by Human Rights Watch showed that black male drug users nationwide are sent to prison at 13 times the rate of white male drug users.
<P>

In North Carolina -- sometimes called the "First in Freedom" state -- bruthas are sent to the pokey at 27 times the rate of white men.
<P>

  "Sure," you say, not quite willing to concede that this disparity is due to racism, "but aren't the majority of drug users young black hoodlums who loiter on street corners with their britches hanging down around their knees?"
<P>

Yup -- but only if you believe television reports. Anytime there is a "major drug bust" reported on television you invariably see some young black punks matching the aforementioned description being led away in handcuffs. It makes for good television and serves to reinforce white America's impression of "those" people as lawless, barely civilized druggies.
<P>

The reality, though, is that most illicit drug users in America are white men, and even though the rate of use is slightly higher among blacks, the disparity in the jail time meted out far exceeds the racial difference in drug use.
<P>

Ken Roth, executive director of the New York-based Human Rights Watch, called the racial disparities a "national scandal . . . Black and white drug offenders get radically different treatment in the American justice system."
<P>

I will concede that some of the disparity may be due to economic "classism" instead of racism: that is, a poor, under-represented white cat might well get the same satchelful of time that a black one would get. Another reason for the disparity, and one proponents say is not racist, is the prevalence of crack cocaine use among blacks versus powdered cocaine use among whites. The assumption, long since discredited, was that crack deserved a much stiffer penalty than  cocaine -- in some cases, sentences five times longer -- because crack led to greater violence.
<P>

Poppycock. Crack and powdered cocaine are rightly considered by many states, including North Carolina, to be the same and deserving of the same punishment. Federal courts, though, impose much harsher sentences on crack users and dealers, a fact that indirectly leads to blacks' overrepresentation in prison.
<P>

Thus, as a public service, I'd like to give drug dealers a word of counsel that at least might lower their sentences: get rid of the crack cocaine and  peddle -- if you must, and that's a huge if -- the powdered form of the drug, along with a baggieful of baking soda, and advise customers to make their own crack. Ingredient-wise, baking soda is the only difference between the two forms of the drug.
<P>

The Human Rights Watch report is important not only for unveiling the "national scandal" of unequal treatment under the law, but also for showing just how ludicrously unsuccessful our current national drug policy is.
<P>

There are three options available to a nation beset by unequal application of the law, overcrowded prisons and unworkable drug policies: lock everyone up equally, lock no one up, or develop a drug policy based on treatment and alternatives to prison for deserving defendants, regardless of race.
