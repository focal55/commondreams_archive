Despite the populist rhetoric of this campaign season, many
traditional Democrats are pushing companies to generate higher returns
regardless of social responsibility.
<p>These Democrats may not mean to do it, but this is the practical
consequence of how they're saving for retirement. American teachers,
civil servants, unionized workers, college professors and similar
Democratic stalwarts are putting their savings into giant funds like
TIAA-CREF, the $290-billion teachers' retirement system, and the
$175-billion California Public Employees Retirement System, or CalPERS.
The teachers and others want the highest returns they can get. So the
large institutional investors are demanding that companies make big
profits and boost their share prices.
<p>In recent years, institutional investors have been active in ousting
chief executives at IBM, AT&T, Sears, General Motors, Xerox, Coca-Cola,
Aetna, Compaq Computer and other blue-chip American corporations that
didn't boost share prices enough. TIAA-CREF has even ousted an entire
board that failed to fire an under-performing CEO. While the huge
severance packages for these departing executives makes it hard to feel
sorry for them, they are even better compensated when they generate high
returns.
<p>Not surprisingly, these incentives have been pushing CEOs to do
whatever is necessary within the law to boost their share prices, even if
that means pandering to the carnal appetites of teenage movie-goers,
messing up the environment, raising oil prices, marketing guns and
cigarettes, using sweatshops in East Asia, laying off platoons of
employees and treating patients like fast-food drive-in customers.
<p>It's called cognitive dissonance when a part of your brain wants one
thing and another part wants something different. While the frontal lobes
of traditional Democrats are delighted by the populist campaign rhetoric
that scolds corporations for being socially irresponsible, their
hypothalami want hefty returns on the savings in their pension plans. The
two aren't necessarily--or even probably--compatible.
<p>The board of directors of CalPERS recently rejected a proposal from
one board member to dump shares of tobacco companies and to refrain from
investing in nations that didn't meet some minimally humane political and
social criteria. The board's chairman feared a slippery slope. "Do we one
day ban investments in alcohol, handguns and rap music?" he asked
rhetorically. (CalPERS' investment staff noted that just the sale of the
fund's tobacco stocks would cost it upward of $56 million in transaction
costs alone.)
<p>Mild-mannered folk like California's public retirees--tens of
thousands of people who spent their careers working for the state and are
improbably cast as rabid promoters of free-market capitalism--are also
quietly undermining what remains of European social democracy. They are
not alone in doing so, of course, but given the extensive holdings of
their retirement funds in European-based companies, their influence
should not be underestimated.
<p>When Alcatel, a mostly French-owned telecommunications company,
announced that its annual profit would be less than had been forecast,
its management was driven to the distinctly un-French solution of
restoring profits by laying off about 12,000 employees. CalPERS was not
the sole instigator, although French President Jacques Chirac testily
noted in his Bastille Day address last year that the layoff was triggered
when "California retirees suddenly decided to sell Alcatel."
<p>Europe's traditional "stakeholder" capitalism has made European
companies responsive to employees and communities as well as
shareholders, which is why it doesn't sit well with American
institutional investors intent on making companies attentive only to
them. Not long ago, CalPERS complained that a German utility gave the
cities it served too much control over its board, thereby diminishing the
value of the utility's shares owned by CalPERS. The utility executives
explained that its system of city representation maintained a bond with
the utility's customers, but when CalPERS threatened to dump its shares,
the utility promptly scrapped the system. The problem here isn't with
CalPERS, TIAA-CREF or other big institutional investors. They're only
doing their job, which is to maximize the value of their investors'
portfolios.
<p>The real issue is that power is shifting away from governments to
investors. This means that political speeches calling on companies to be
more socially responsible are meaningless. If we want companies to be
more socially responsible, we'll have to pass laws requiring them to be
so, and those laws will have to be enforced. And not just national laws.
National governments are weakening as highly mobile capital finds better
deals elsewhere around the world, where profits are higher because laws
are meeker. So, ultimately, many such laws will have to be international.
<p>That's why a central question for the coming decade is what sorts of
global agreements can be reached on the environment, energy and labor and
on the production and marketing of dubious products like guns, cigarettes
and smut.
<p>Unless Democrats face head-on the cognitive dissonance in their
brains, they'll continue to practice a politics that has little or
nothing to do with the personal economic choices they're making. And
they'll fail to insist that their candidates talk realistically about how
to redress the balance between the desires of voters and the demands of
investors.
