At long last: Schadenfreude 
dot-com. 

<p>This has been a 
great spring not only 
for those rooting for 
the comeuppance of 
Bill Gates, but for anyone who has 
had quite enough of New Economy 
New Millionaires and their irritatingly unostentatious brand of ostentation. Just a short list of recent 
flameouts includes boo.com (a fashion site that burned through $135 
million in months), den.net (a "digital entertainment network" panting 
haplessly after the demographic 
Holy Grail of Generation Y),  and 
RedRocket.com (toys from Nickelodeon). Among the countless former 
high-fliers in a Wall Street tailspin 
are Drkoop.com and Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, whose shares 
have dropped from $333 in March to 
around $23 today, amid investigations for alleged accounting irregularities. 

<p>      Most of these sites rode in on a 
wave of hype as excessive as those 
that herald Hollywood's bigger 
bombs. (On the Web, as in show 
business, the big hits are often sleepers.) Mr. Saylor was being canonized 
in the press as a Medici -- for underwriting a dubious, if free, online university -- just as his stockholders 
fell on his sword. Now that these 
start-ups are in peril or ruin, their 
press is almost as apocalyptic as the 
initial buzz was celebratory. When 
Disney bought a 60 percent interest 
in Toysmart.com back in August, an 
expert at Forrester Research 
gushed  to The Associated Press, 
"There's nothing bad in it for Disney." When Toysmart went belly-up 
last week, another Forrester analyst 
authoritatively told The A.P. it was 
"the wrong company selling the 
wrong product at the wrong time." 
<I>Now</I> you tell us!

<p>       You have to wonder if these pundits visit the sites they initially tout. I 
found from personal experience five 
months ago that den.net was nearly 
impenetrable even on a fast connection and that no one in its office 
would come to the phone to explain 
why. If anyone wonders whether 
Barnes & Noble has mastered online 
bookselling, just try, as I did this 
week, to order from its not-ready-for-e-time "same-day delivery" service. 
With competitors like this, no one at 
Amazon need go sleepless in Seattle.

<p>     Emotionally satisfying as these 
rags-to-riches-to-rags dot-com sagas 
may be, however, they are often irrelevant to the long and looming future of the Internet. Like some other 
favorite story lines of the past few 
years -- the kiddie-porn scare, the 
"Blair Witch" craze, the day-trader 
menace -- tales of the Nasdaq bubble are transient sideshows in the 
Web's early gold-rush phase that 
may look like quaint olden-days phenomena once the Internet is seamlessly integrated into our lives. As 
with the original California gold 
rush's prospectors, it's inevitable 
that more dot-com prospectuses are 
going to pan fool's gold than pay dirt. 
The disasters won't slow the 
progress of this new technology any 
more than earlier economic setbacks 
did the spread of the railroad and 
electricity. 

<p>      The truly illuminating Internet 
stories are sometimes less visible 
than the morality plays of hubristic 
e-celebrities and evanescent I.P.O.'s. 
That may be because they are buried 
in the very architecture of a technology few of us laymen understand -- 
or because they involve the media's 
own selfish interests. Or both.

<p>      Into this category fall the newest 
corporate marriages in the increasingly intertwined Internet-cable-entertainment-telecommunications industry: AT&T-MediaOne and AOL-Time Warner. These mammoth couplings have been dissected as stock-price stories and captains-of-industry 
personality profiles, to be sure. But if 
it hadn't been for the divine intervention of another corporate giant last 
month -- Disney -- even a hint of the 
worst-case scenarios possible in this 
new media landscape would have 
been invisible to most Americans. 
Few still understand how these new 
powerhouses could make our current 
cable and phone companies look like 
kindly mom-and-pop operations by 
comparison.   
<p>

<p>      What Time Warner did to Disney, 
throwing ABC off its cable in 11 cities 
until a public outcry forced a retreat, 
is just a tiny window into how these 
corporations can behave in their 
even more powerful future, when cable TV service will be inseparable 
from Internet service. There is nothing to stop one of these new megaliths from exerting a larger and 
more surreptitious chokehold on all 
the electronic services that their cable wires will speed by the bundle 
into our homes tomorrow, from chat 
rooms to e-shopping to movies. Even 
in the few weeks since the Disney 
fiasco, when you might think Time 
Warner would be too chastened to 
risk more censure, it has been 
caught misbehaving in Texas, where 
its cable company offered its employees bounties to place bogus orders for a rival Internet service offered by Southwestern Bell. 

<p>      Time Warner has since apologized 
for its recent transgressions, but if it 
can try to squelch Disney (itself described by The Wall Street Journal 
as "one of America's most aggressive corporate bullies"), imagine 
what it can do to smaller companies 
and consumers once Disney and the 
other giants inevitably make deals to 
secure their pieces of the pie. 

<p> Not unlike Windows, which blackballed Web software not made by 
Microsoft, or the most recent edition 
of AOL, which snaked into its users' 
computer settings to override competing programs, the future AOL-TW 
threshold into the Internet/TV can 
be engineered for nefarious purposes. It could make its own products, like Time and CNN, come on 
screen easily and fast while slowing 
down (or blocking) the alternatives, 
whether Newsweek or Drudgewannabe.com. It could do the same with 
merchants, TV channels or non-AOL 
Internet service providers. 

<p> In other words, it could control the 
entertainment and even the news 
grid on your computer/TV screen 
much as the movie studios (including Time Warner's ancestor, Warner 
Brothers) limited Americans' entertainment choices in cities until antitrust action ended such restrictive 
practices in 1948. The result wouldn't 
be the democratic, go-anywhere-you-want Internet of yore but a more 
elaborate version of cable TV, in 
which your cable company adjudicates both your programming 
choices and cyber-activities (and 
can monitor all of them).

<p>      It would be like "someone constantly dealing the deck and knowing 
every card and shuffling at will, but 
never letting you know if you're being dealt every card or not," says 
Jeffrey Chester of the Center for 
Media Education. Gerald Levin, of 
Time Warner, and Steve Case, of 
AOL, have pledged not to be naughty, 
but even if we take them at their 
word, they'll not be running their 
company forever. What's more, what 
they say already fails to square with 
what they do. This week USA Today 
persuasively charged AOL with foot-dragging on last summer's promise 
to open up its instant-messenger system to all non-AOL Internet users.

<p>     The antidote to any possible future 
misbehavior is not necessarily to 
stop the merger -- a non-starter anyway -- but for regulators to set simple rules of the information highway 
(and build them into its construction) so that all comers have equal 
access to its various lanes. Yet most 
of the political pressure on Washington comes from the media giants, not 
the spottily informed public. TV 
news, the main news source for most 
Americans, is mum about this part of 
the merger story, in which so much 
is at stake for its corporate parents; 
it's easier to talk about Mr. Levin 
going tieless. 

<p>      Nor do politicians want to take on 
media corporations whose news divisions cover them and whose donations increasingly support them. At 
my request, the Center for Responsive Politics broke down total campaign contributions by industry over 
the past decade, and the result shows 
a rapid increase of total donations by 
media, communications and electronics companies since the explosion of the Internet -- a stiffer increase than even those made by the 
health care industry. The parties 
more or less split the loot.   
<p>
The Clinton administration has taken a "do-nothing attitude" 
about ensuring fairness for the millions 
who will connect by 
cable into the Internet, according to 
Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard law 
professor who has more than anyone 
framed this issue. Nor is there any 
Teddy Roosevelt Republican in sight 
to ride to the rescue. Still, some public-interest advocates are hopeful 
that voters will be provoked into anger over time, if only because media 
companies arrogant enough to pull 
the plug on Regis Philbin may,  like 
Microsoft before them, eventually 
overplay their hand. But it may take 
something as startling as a totalitarian new voice saying "You've got 
mail" -- Charlton Heston's, perhaps 
-- to wake the country up.
