My nearly 2-year-old son puts his hand on my cheek and turns my
head toward him when he thinks I'm not paying close enough attention to
him. It's his way of getting me to focus. That's what we need to do
now - focus on the relationships, values and commitments that give our
lives coherence and purpose.
<p>From the podiums of Philadelphia and Los Angeles, we hear both parties
chanting the mantra, "leave no child behind." It's time for that
oft-repeated promise to be kept.
<p>But first we must face the fact that what's happening in the streets
of America is connected to what's happening in the hearts of Americans.
Our culture of prosperity is covering up three interrelated kinds of
poverty - material, spiritual and civic - that grip our society.
<p>Regarding the first, the greatest moral question in American politics
today is, what is our prosperity for? Will it serve as an excuse to
forget those left behind? Or will it include those who have fallen
through the cracks in our society, including almost 14 million children?
<p>The question is unanswered, but both party conventions have at least
acknowledged that poverty continues side by side with prosperity. The
biblical prophets say that a society's integrity is judged not by its
wealth and power, but by how it treats its most vulnerable members. When
one in five American children - and one in three children of color - are
still poor, the moral underpinnings of our unprecedented prosperity are
in great disarray.
<p>The post-World War II prosperity benefited most American families. But
the prosperity of the 1990s has sent a financial windfall straight to the
very top. The rising tide has lifted all yachts, but not yet all boats.
It is time to assemble our best ideas and practices to address and solve
the problems of this material poverty that affects so many in our
country. That will require the insights and energies of both liberals and
conservatives, and the formation of new partnerships between government,
the private sector and the civil society - including faith-based
organizations.
<p>But addressing this material poverty is not enough. We also must
address another kind of poverty - the spiritual poverty that comes as the
result of our society's anxious striving after affluence. It is the great
myth of modern advertising that mere prosperity can give us happy,
fulfilled and purposeful lives. But shopping can't satisfy the deepest
longings of the human heart. The market fuels a relentless cycle of
working in order to buy more things, which takes precious time away from
family and community and thus threatens our moral balance.
<p>One need only look at the front pages of our newspapers. Many of the
school shooting sprees that have shocked the nation were carried out by
middle-class white kids from two-parent homes. Listening to them talk,
you discover that something has gone terribly wrong in their value
systems. Affluence helps to mask moral and spiritual poverty.
<p>There also is a third kind of poverty in our political life, a civic
poverty. Widespread cynicism about politics, the alarming decline of
voter turn-out, the increasing control of our political system by moneyed
elites and the coarsening of our public debate can be best understood as
aspects of this civic poverty.
<p>Money so controls the political process that it is no longer hyperbole
to say that politicians' votes are up for sale. Campaign contributions
have become the quid pro quo in politics.
<p>The conventions this summer vividly dramatize this. Witness the
lavish, corporately funded parties in Philadelphia and Los Angeles. As
"Granny D" - the 90-year-old great-grandmother who walked across the
country for campaign finance reform - says, it's not just a matter of
corrupt politicians but a system of money corrupting politics that
ensnares almost everyone. The search for bipartisan solutions to problems
is being drowned in a flood of money, and the great casualty of this is
the very soul of democracy.
<p>These aspects of poverty - of economic well-being, of the human spirit
and of our civic life - affect the future of America, but there is hope.
When I ask students why they spend far more time in volunteer service
projects than would be necessary for a balanced resume, they tell me they
are looking for "meaning" and "connection." Our youth are right in
sensing that service for social justice is key to overcoming our
collective poverty of mind, body and spirit.
<p>Also, inspired by the civil rights movement, a new generation of
activists is targeting the excessive influence of money in politics.
They're building a grass-roots and morally based political reform
movement, and linking it with the growing campaigns for economic justice.
Only a values-based politics can overcome our many states of material,
spiritual and civic poverty. This requires a transition from rhetoric
that blames to solutions that heal. It requires implementing real
answers, not just finding more ways to argue over the questions.
Values-based politics does not ask what is liberal or conservative but,
rather, what is right and what works. This requires communal
soul-searching, because the problems of prosperity are not just material
and political, but also spiritual.
<p>One good sign is that many voices are now calling for a renewed
commitment to the common good over the bottom line, and an ethic of both
personal and social responsibility. Many are finding that engagement in
their communities provides practical solutions toward overcoming poverty,
leads to greater personal satisfaction and creates the rebirth of a
vibrant citizen politics. These are the ingredients for reawakening
genuine democracy.
