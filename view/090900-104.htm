As my plane broke through the clouds on its descent into Heathrow, I almost burst into a spontaneous rendition of "There'll be bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover." I had never been so happy to be anywhere in my life.
<P>Back in my hometown of Chicago, I had flashed my British passport every time I changed money. I had begged the British Airways staff at O'Hare to put me as far forward as possible, so that as soon as the seatbelt sign switched off upon landing, I could bound out of my seat and on to British soil.
<P>I had been to Stone Mountain, Georgia, the Valhalla of the Confederacy where a son et lumi&egrave;re show is put on every evening extolling the glories of the old south. I had watched a child eating out of the garbage in the shadow of the Capitol in Washington, DC; grown men begging on the streets; and in Alabama, an old black man weep for the war medal denied him more than 50 years ago.
<P>US television was full of Bush and Gore, total irrelevances as far as most people are concerned. The majority of people in America do not bother to vote. They aren't stupid. They know that the American dream is light years beyond the reach of the average person.
<P>The "log cabin" myth that every American is fed along with mother's milk, of coming from nowhere to win the White House, is largely just that: a fairy tale.   The example of the man from Hope is the exception that proves the rule. Mega-wealthy people such as Madonna can carp about Britain's "Victorian" hospitals, but in America if you are not insured, you are patched up in ER and then turfed out, or sent to one of the public hospitals. Forget Victorian, we are talking about medieval here. M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res would have its work cut out in many communities in the States today.
<P>During this past August, while making a documentary for the BBC, I have been travelling in America, interviewing numerous African Americans in their seventies, eighties and nineties. I thought that I knew everything about America's barbarous relationship with its former slaves, but what I learned from these people caused me to go to bed in tears each night. Tales of a segregated army during the second world war, servicewomen having their uniforms torn off by mobs, the denial of medals for heroism - all led me to ask each of them why they had fought for a nation that clearly despised and rejected them.
<P>I also talked to younger people who faced institutionalised racism at school, and to taxi drivers who worked three jobs and never saw their families. I heard stories of kids going to high-school dressed in Nazi memorabilia and giving one another the Hitler salute because the constitution guaranteed them freedom of speech and of assembly. I   saw able-bodied black men begging on the streets of Manhattan; overweight teenage girls eating themselves to oblivion in shopping malls; sundown segregation (the races retreating to their own enclaves after work) abounded; and bookshop after bookshop filled with volumes urging everyone on to success and fame, the twin religions of the republic.
<P>My husband and two of our neighbours had taken my father down to the pub when he had come over for a visit to Britain during the last summer we had spent together. He had been overwhelmed. This son of Mississippi had never gone out drinking with white men before.
<P> Earlier that day we went to Brixton in south London, and he had been overcome with pride at what he had seen there and the people he had met. He had spoken with black people solidly connected and secure in the fact that they knew where they came from, they had keys to homes, deeds to property and most of all, living memories of the land of their ancestors. The next day he said: "When folks ask me why you moved here, now I can tell them." Senator Phil Gram urges the British to join Nafta - the North American Free Trade Association, instead of the euro. Gram wants us to remember the long-standing friendship that has existed between our two countries.
<P>It is always best to keep in mind that the United States of America has no friends, only allies and common interests. A free trade association is more likely to mean that America is free to trade, wiping out all vestiges of British culture in the process. Just ask the Canadians. They know all about it.
<P>I'm frankly tired of all those who think that their true place is west over the water, and that the UK is doomed. True, Brits are always welcome, for five minutes, because they talk funny, are a little weird, make great butlers and proper villains. But the fact is that hardly anyone in the States takes Britain seriously. They barely know where it is.
<P>It is always morning in America. But if you cannot keep up, if you are not prepared to sacrifice everything for success, whether it be baking the best cherry pies for the parent teacher association, or being president of the United States, you are less than road-kill. It is a land of deadly seriousness, where there is no rest and no forgiveness. So good luck to all who leave this country seeking fame, fortune and understanding in the land of the free and the home of the brave. But don't venture too far outside your gilded ghettos.
<P>It's sundown out there and the wolves are gathering.
<P> Bonnie Greer presents Unsung Heroes on BBC Radio 4 tonight at 8pm.<br>
