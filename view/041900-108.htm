The April 16 protests in Washington, D.C. against the International

Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank made history and marked a new phase in

the effort to halt and reverse the processes of corporate globalization.



<p>Citizens in developing countries -- from Jordan to Zambia, Indonesia to

Venezuela -- have long protested against the policies of the IMF and World

Bank. On April 16, for the first time, citizens in the United States came

out in large numbers to join the calls for a rollback of IMF and World

Bank powers.



<p>Tens of thousands of people took to the streets, or joined a permitted

demonstration on the Ellipse to denounce structural adjustment policies --

the deregulatory policy package that the Fund and Bank impose on country

after country -- for hurting the poor and exacerbating economic

inequality.



<p>The exact impact of the demonstrations will only be apparent in the years

to come, but it is already clear that the protests -- evidence of the

deepening citizen movement against corporate globalization -- have had

dramatic effect.



<p>First, the U.S. public is newly aware of what the IMF and World Bank are,

and millions of people in the United States have for the first time

learned of how the institutions' policies hurt people in poor countries. 



<p>In anticipation of the protests, the mainstream media focused some

attention on structural adjustment policies, both by conveying the

viewpoints of the Mobilization for Global Justice and, in some instances,

by actually reporting on the effects of structural adjustment in countries

like Haiti or Tanzania. There was probably more U.S. mainstream media

coverage of IMF/World Bank/structural adjustment issues in the past two

weeks than in the previous 20 years combined.



<p>The growing U.S. public concern with IMF and World Bank policy is crucial

because while the Fund and Bank are unaccountable to the people in the

Third World they are allegedly trying to help, they are responsive to the

United States -- the largest shareholder in both institutions and the

dominant influence at the IMF in particular.



<p>The second noteworthy outcome from the April 16 protests was the role of

U.S. organized labor in the permitted demonstration on the Ellipse. The

AFL-CIO and a number of major unions, including the Service Employees, the

Teamsters, the Steelworkers, the American Federation of Government

Employees, the United Electrical workers and UNITE, the textile union,

endorsed the demonstration, and many of the unions sent top official to

address the rally.



<p>Two years ago, the AFL-CIO lent its support to the Clinton

administration's request for $18 billion in funding for the IMF, so the

newfound willingness to strongly denounce IMF and Bank structural

adjustment policies represents an important shift.



<p>The AFL-CIO is also beginning to develop a penetrating critique of the

notion of export-led development -- one of the core principles of

structural adjustment. Instead of joining in a race to the bottom to

produce goods using sweatshop labor or lax environmental standards, the

AFL-CIO is suggesting, countries should instead concentrate on developing

productive capacity to meet local needs.



<p>A third historic occurrence was the endorsement by members of the G-77 --

a grouping of most of the world's developing nations -- of the Washington

protests and a stinging condemnation of the Fund and Bank's structural

adjustment policies.



<p>"I, for one, support the demonstrators," said Arthur Mbanefo of Nigeria,

spokesperson for the G-77 during its recent three-day summit in Havana.

"Many countries have rejected the results of various policy initiatives of

the World Bank and IMF," he said, citing privatization, a refusal to

cancel debt and a "one-size-fits-all" structural adjustment agenda. "We

are very supportive of demonstrations that could forcefully handle those

concerns."



<p>The DC protests seem to have exerted a "Columbus Effect." Just as the

Columbus, Ohio protests against Clinton administration plans to bomb Iraq

led Egyptian President Mubarak to comment that surely he could oppose

bombing if the people of Columbus did, so the Washington protests against

the IMF and World Bank have created more political space for developing

countries to speak up on behalf of their own interests.



<p>The IMF and World Bank spokespeople acknowledged the protests -- pointing

out that it was impossible to ignore them. They emphasized that they are

increasingly focusing on poverty and trying to empower the poor. But they

refuse to abandon their emphasis on structural adjustment, and in fact are

using their very modest debt relief initiative to force poor countries to

undergo still more, carefully monitored structural adjustment. 



<p>Real change at the IMF and World Bank will come not from voluntary

"reforms" in their policies, but from external forces -- such as the U.S.

Congress or large numbers of developing country governments cooperating

closely -- that demand that IMF and Bank powers be curtailed.



<p>With the April 16 protests shining light on the policies of the IMF and

World Bank, expanding the coalition opposed to structural adjustment and

revealing that discontent in the developing world with IMF and Bank

policies is increasingly matched by similar outrage in the rich nations,

the prospect of a successful drive to shrink the authority and power of

the IMF and Bank is greater than at any time in recent history.
