<p>It was one of the worst days of my 15 years in America. As I stood at an intersection in the central Illinois city of Danville in April 1996, a white pickup zoomed by.
<p>
 "Niggerrrrr!" the white driver yelled.
<p>
 Shocked, I could only stare at the white friend who was with me. I wanted to run after the bigot who had called me a nigger and ask him to repeat the word to my face. Then I'd beat him up for his ignorance.
<p>
 On that day, I realized for the first time that my nationality is irrelevant to racists. They only see my brown skin, which to bigots is my sin. And to them, I am as much a nigger or a monkey as any African American.
<p>
 Growing up in Liberia, West Africa, race was hardly an issue, though tribal conflicts existed. I didn't even know what racism was or meant.
<p>
 Even though Liberia was founded by freed slaves from the United States, I don't recall the history of American slavery ever being taught in school. I was also unaware of the civil-rights movement and the racism that still plagues America.
<p>
 Like many people in Third World countries, I believed America was a utopia where everyone was rich. The thought that one was judged there based on the color of one's skin never crossed my mind.
<p>
 When I moved to the United States in 1984, my stepbrothers and their cousins, who were African Americans, frequently warned me about "those damn white folks in this country who want to keep the black man down."
<p>
 At school, where blacks sat on one side of the cafeteria and whites on the other side, I was once labeled a "sellout" for sitting with a white friend on the white side of the room.
<p>
 At first I didn't understand what was going on and why the tension existed. I didn't understand why there was a Black History Month.
<p>
 When I began to study black history in school, I started to see why African Americans were bitter toward Anglos. But none of the history classes I took or books I read prepared me for a recent trip to Alabama.
<p>
 I was sent to cover the re-enactment of a march that led to the passing of 1965 Voting Rights Act, which guaranteed all Americans, regardless of race, the right to vote.
<p>
 Before going to Selma, Ala., where the actual march took place, I visited Birmingham. I had seen film footage from the civil-rights movement on TV, but being in the places where they took place raised powerful feelings.
<p>
 I felt angry as I walked in a downtown area, now the Kelly Ingram Park, where blacks staging sit-ins, even young children, had been attacked by police dogs. The protesters were also sprayed with fire hoses powerful enough to rip the bark from a tree 80 feet away.
<p>
 I felt bitter when I toured the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, where four little girls were killed when it was bombed by white segregationists in the fall of 1963.
<p>
 A feeling that I can't describe came over me at the Civil Rights Institute. There, I touched the gates from the Birmingham jail, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter, and viewed two water fountains labeled "whites only" and "blacks only." The white fountain was clean, but the black fountain was rusty and filthy.
<p>
 The re-enactment of the march in Selma, on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, brought tears to my eyes. It was on that very bridge that young John Lewis, now a congressman from Georgia, led 600 peaceful marchers to protest rules that prevented African Americans from voting.
<p>
 However, before the marchers could make the 54-mile trek to Montgomery, the state capital, they were attacked by Alabama state troopers. The protesters were tear-gassed, whipped with billy clubs and trampled by horses. Lewis suffered a skull fracture.
<p>
 Following that trip, I have a better understanding of the civil-rights movement, the struggles and the blood that was spilled.
<p>
 No, I still don't hate white people, nor do I condone racism. But I certainly have a better understanding of why African Americans are so angry.
<p>
