Thirty years ago, the Club of Rome, a group of internationally known businessmen, statesmen and scientists asked Donella and Dennis Meadows and Jorgen Randers to investigate the long-term consequences of growth on population, industrial capital, food production, resource consumption and pollution.
<P>
      These scientists created a computer model of the world and many scenarios were analyzed.  The results of their study were published in a book in 1972, "The Limits to Growth."  The authors warned that without limits on growth, the world would experience catastrophic declines in population and industrial capacity by the year 2100.  They concluded that we must move toward an economy that is in equilibrium with the Earth's finite flow of natural resources. The controversy sparked by this book continues today.
<P>
     The prevailing view among economists has been that continued economic growth (as measured by Gross Domestic Product or GDP) is the panacea for most of what ails humanity - a rising tide lifts all boats.
<P>
     As evidence of progress, economists showcase statistics about growth in global GDP, increased life spans, improved agricultural outputs, etc.   Ecological economists counter that the rising material standards of industrialized countries have been made possible by the rapidly accelerating, and unsustainable, consumption of natural resources.
<P>
     While GDP has been rising, we have been drawing down our stocks of natural capital at increasing rates - resources such as water, trees, soil and air.  The argument made by those sounding the alarm is not that a dire future is inevitable, but that our future is a matter of choice.  However, we are unlikely to make the right choices unless we rethink many of our assumptions about how the world works.
<P>
     Our economic system needs to be re-calibrated to reflect the most important "bottom line" that over the long term, human activity cannot exceed the sustainable carrying capacity of the Earth.
<P>
     As long as its fundamental tenets are followed, a market economy is supposed to result in an equitable and optimal allocation of society's resources. According to market theory, sellers must bear the full cost of producing the products they sell, and these costs must be reflected in the sales price paid by the buyers.
<P>
     Through price signals, markets are supposed to allocate scarce resources efficiently. Ecological economists believe the global economy has passed from an era in which human labor and technology were the limiting factors in economic growth, to an era where the supply of natural capital is the limiting factor.
<P>
     For example, the limiting factor in determining fish catch today is not the number of boats or fishermen, it is the reproductive capacity of fish populations; for many types of wood, it is remaining forests, not sawmill capacity.
<P>
     Yet, natural capital is still valued at its extraction cost, not at its true replacement value. Governmental subsidies make virgin materials less expensive than other alternatives. And the market price for using the global commons - our air, land and water - for disposal of waste is close to zero.
<P>
     As a result of inappropriate price signals, the regenerative and assimilative capacities of the planet are being exceeded.
<P>
     It is commonly perceived that these problems are isolated and disconnected. However, there are few areas of the world that are not experiencing decline in their natural resource base.  Close to 50 percent of the Earth's land surface has been altered from its original state by human activities such as filling wetlands, converting tall-grass prairies into cornfields and converting forests into suburbs.
<P>
      Approximately 50 dead zones - areas of water with little or no oxygen - have developed in coastal areas as a result of phosphorus and nitrogen from agricultural runoff. The worst of these, in the Gulf of Mexico, covers almost 8,000 square miles and results from pollution in the Mississippi River.
<P>
      Much more ominous is increasing evidence that we are bumping up against the assimilative capacity of the Earth.
<P>
     The first unmistakable sign of human-induced change in the global environment occurred in 1985 when a team of British scientists published their findings that the stratospheric ozone above Antarctica had plunged more than 40 percent, using baseline levels of 1960.
<P>
     Scientists discovered that industrially produced chlorinated molecules were the culprits. The stratospheric ozone layer is essential to life because it shields us from incoming ultraviolet solar radiation. While the biological effects of increased radiation are not entirely understood, scientists do know that direct exposure to ultraviolet radiation damages the human immune system, causes cataracts and increases the incidence of skin cancer.
<P>
      Certain agricultural crops are very sensitive to increased radiation, as are some species of phytoplankton, which anchor marine food chains. How are we going to feed, clothe and shelter an expanding global population when human activity is causing declines in virtually all natural systems?
<P>
     Technological optimists and many modern economists believe that scientific advances will outpace resource scarcity.  It is true that limits to production of goods can be overcome if there are available substitutes for those goods.
<P>
     In the case of many natural resources, we can substitute a more abundant resource for one that is scarce.  For example, Cargill and Dow Chemical are teaming up to make a biodegradable plastic from renewable resources such as corn or wheat instead of from petroleum.  But what are the substitutes for pollination of crops by bees and insects, for creation of soil, for regulation of climate and for protection provided by the ozone layer from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays?  These services are provided by nature for free and they may not be replaceable. 
<P>
     The transition of the American economy from manufacturing to services and information technology obscures the fact that we still depend upon the Earth for our existence.  The information economy creates the illusion that our society has become less material-intensive.  The facts speak otherwise.
<P>
      Since 1950, global demand (per capita) for lumber has doubled and paper use has gone up nearly sixfold.  Nearly half of the world's paper is used for packaging such as cardboard boxes, and another 28 percent is used for printing and writing papers.  Industrialized nations use 75 percent of the world's supply of paper.
<P>
      Consumption of materials (minerals, wood products, metals and synthetics) has grown 18-fold in the U.S. since 1900.  Clearly our priorities need to be reduce, reuse and then recycle.  But this mantra does not fit well with an economic system based on growth and a culture that values material wealth.
<P>
     Herman Daly, Amory Lovins, L. Hunter Lovins and Paul Hawken are regarded as leaders in charting the path for a new form of capitalism.  "Natural Capitalism," co-authored by the Lovins and Hawken, is considered by many to be the blueprint for the next industrial revolution. In short, what they propose is a form of capitalism where living systems matter.
<P>
     To achieve an economy that is ecologically and socially sustainable, all forms of capital, including human and natural, must be fully valued.
<P>
     In addition to recommending changes in how natural and human resources are valued, these leaders tell us that we must increase the efficiency with which we use natural capital by factors of 10 and higher and that we must eliminate the concept of waste.
<P>
      Nature is a closed-loop production system.  In mature ecosystems, all waste and by-products are recycled and used or absorbed somewhere else in the system. In contrast, our manufacturing systems currently follow a one-way, linear model - things are created, used and discarded.
<P>
     Consider the business model of Interface, a large industrial carpet company based in Atlanta.  It leases rather than sells carpet to its customers.  The carpet is manufactured in one-square-meter tiles, which can be individually replaced in worn areas allowing for more efficient use of the product. Its newest product, Solenium, is not toxic, uses 35 percent less material per square meter and lasts twice as long. And, Interface takes the carpet back at the end of its useful life and re-manufactures it into an identical product.
<P>
     The U.S. economy, an ideal to which much of the world aspires, is a high-consumption, materials-intensive model.  In a world with finite natural resources, this raises a troubling question about the equity of distribution of those resources. Our wealth (and our appetite for material possessions) enables us to use about a third of all the materials that pass through the global economy. If the rest of the world were to duplicate our rates of consumption and waste, we would need the resources of several more planets like ours. 
<P>
     We are faced with an extraordinary opportunity.  Can we use our inexhaustible ingenuity and our technology to redesign our global community so that commerce and nature are in harmony?  Can we create an ecologically sustainable economy that provides jobs, clean water and clean air for a global population expected to grow to 10 billion by the year 2050?
