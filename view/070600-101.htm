<p>Most people who grew up in the 
second half of the 20th century believed that climate change was such 
a gradual process that it was almost 
imperceptible during the course of 
an ordinary lifetime.

<p> There may have been times when 
that was true, but it is not the case 
now. The earth has recently warmed 
so much, and the rate of warming is 
now so fast, that the effects have 
become increasingly obvious to the 
scientist and the layman alike.

<p> The decade of the 1990's was very 
likely the hottest of the last millennium. And 1998 -- which had temperatures spiked by a large El Ni&#0241;o phenomenon -- appears to have been the 
hottest year ever recorded.

<p> The oceans are rising, mountain 
glaciers are shrinking, low-lying 
coastal areas are eroding, and the 
very timing of the seasons is changing, with spring coming as much as a 
week earlier in parts of the Northern 
Hemisphere. And all indications are 
that the warming of the earth in the 
21st century will be significantly 
greater than it was in the 20th.

<p> If there were such a thing as a 
global alarm bell, now would be an 
excellent time to ring it.

<p> "With respect to the climate, we 
live in a different world than people 
lived in even 25 years ago," said Dr. 
Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist of Environmental Defense, a national environmental research and 
advocacy organization.

<p> For most of the last 1,000 years the 
earth's temperature varied only 
modestly, moving slowly up or down 
by less than one degree Fahrenheit. 
But that changed with the coming of 
the industrial era in the 19th century. 
At that point the earth started getting steadily warmer.

<p> As Dr. Oppenheimer put it, "About 
1860 we entered a period of about 140 
years in which the rate of climate 
change kicked up, and most of the 
changes were in the positive direction. Between the late 19th century 
and now, the total warming has been 
about 0.7 to 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit -- 
a little more than a degree Fahrenheit if you take the average.

<p> "Then, in the last 25 years, the rate 
of warming further accelerated, to 
about three times that rate of increase. The actual number is approximately 0.35 degrees Fahrenheit 
per decade. And if you look forward 
over the coming decades, the rate of 
increase could double again."

<p> The effects are myriad. "There is 
a pervasive retraction of mountain 
glaciers worldwide," said Dr. Oppenheimer. "The glaciers in Glacier National Park are shrinking. And the 
projection is that if the trend continues, by the end of this century many 
of the glaciers will have simply disappeared.

<p> "Another place where we see significant change is on the Antarctic 
Peninsula, the northernmost part of 
Antarctica where there's been a very 
large warming of 4 1/2 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 50 years alone. Ice 
shelves -- floating ice that's attached 
to the continent -- are starting to 
disintegrate, and huge chunks of ice 
shelf in recent years have simply 
and rapidly cracked apart and floated off into the ocean. The whole ecosystem around the peninsula is 
changing, and eventually this will 
have a significant effect on the wildlife. If the ice starts to disappear, the 
wildlife loses its habitat."

<p> Another inevitable aspect of global 
warming is already well under way 
-- the swelling of the oceans. Sea 
level has been rising for the last 
century, and it's thought to be somewhere between four and eight inches 
higher globally than it was about 100 
years ago.

<p> Coastal erosion has already taken 
a terrible toll on beaches in the United States. And Dr. Oppenheimer offered another dramatic example of 
the price to be paid for global warming -- the potential damage to Everglades National Park in Florida.

<p> "We're spending billions to preserve the ecosystem within which 
that park exists," he said. "But sometime later in this century, using median projections, not even the worst 
projections, a third of that park would 
be gone -- drowned, under water -- if 
we don't act to stem the buildup of the 
greenhouse gases."  

<p> What ultimately will happen if our 
heads remain in the sand is anybody's guess. Said Dr. Oppenheimer: 
"The last time it was as warm as it 
probably will be by the end of this 
century, globally speaking, was several million years ago. There is no 
way we can know for sure that that's 
a world we can safely cope with."
