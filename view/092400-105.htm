FEW PUBLIC-SERVICE groups in our country enjoy the prestige of a federal 
charter. One of them is the Boy Scouts of America. Earlier this month, 
Republican leaders on Capitol Hill ridiculed a few fellow lawmakers for 
suggesting that the federal charter of the Boy Scouts should be revoked.	 
Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, called the suggestion ``an attack on the 
fundamental values of America.'' Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said those who made 
the suggestion ``truly ought to be ashamed.'' House Majority Leader Dick 
Armey, R-Texas, compared the idea to declaring ``open season on the Boy 
Scouts.''	 
Rep. Barr, whose adultery was made public last year, is hardly in a position 
to assign shame. Rep. Armey would seem to argue that certain groups are 
above criticism and that a federal charter is forever. And Rep. Cannon would 
appear to believe that discrimination is one of America's ``fundamental 
values.''
<P> For three generations, scouting has been important in my family. Breaking 
such a strong bond, as I did recently, is a painful act, but I had to do it. 
A few weeks ago, I surrendered my Eagle Scout medal and asked for removal of 
my name from the Eagle Award Registry.	 
My father became an Eagle Scout during the Great Depression. Leadership and 
survival skills learned in scouting saved his life several times as a Navy 
officer in the Pacific during World War II. In the 1950s, my dad became a 
Scoutmaster and my mom became a Cub Scout den mother. I became an Eagle 
Scout in 1962. My eldest son became an Eagle Scout in 1993.	 
</P>
<P>I have cherished the honor of being an Eagle. For nearly 40 years, my Eagle 
medal has had a prominent perch at home, reminding me of so many happy, 
profound, character-shaping experiences. For all that time, the spirit 
represented by this medal has nourished my belief in unselfish service to 
neighbors and strangers, to community and country. For all that time, I have 
considered scouting remarkably effective in helping adolescent males become 
good men.	 
But now, scouting has lost its moral compass. Current leaders of the Boy 
Scouts of America pervert the meaning of ``morally straight'' in the Scout 
Oath. They wrongly equate ``morally straight'' with having a heterosexual 
orientation. I reject this false equation and the official 
Boy Scout policy of hostility toward men and boys who are gay. My own 
orientation is heterosexual. I am ``straight,'' but I refuse to be narrow.	 
</P>
<P>Like other Eagle Scouts, I have tried to become a citizen, in the best 
sense of that term. Decorated Navy officer in the Vietnam era. Staff 
assistant in the Executive Office of the President in a time of crisis. 
Fourteen years as a senior writer, an editor and a bureau chief for the Wall 
Street Journal. Sunday school teacher, Little League baseball and youth 
soccer coach, Scout troop adviser. Supporter of many other community-service 
and charitable groups. Elected member of a local public school board. Mentor 
to troubled youth. Caregiver to a terminally ill parent.	 
My eldest son, Zachary, is a citizen. When a fire destroyed our church, he 
helped restore it by designing safe playground toys and then gathering a 
crew to build them. That effort was his Eagle Scout project. As a teenager, 
he also worked in soup kitchens, promoted a recycling network in his 
township and volunteered for organizations that ease suffering among Amish 
children with rare genetic disorders and among adults from all backgrounds 
with diseases that have no known cure. Zack graduated from high school with 
honors. At Stanford University, he held down several part-time jobs, helped 
bewildered young people strengthen their sense of self-
worth and graduated Phi Beta Kappa. Now he manages a growing organization in 
the nonprofit world.	 
Zack surrendered his Eagle Scout Award, too. He is gay, and he sees no place 
for discrimination or prejudice among the ideals of the Boy Scouts of 
America. I stand up for him, now and always. He is a fine person, a man of 
character and empathy. Character and empathy are what matter. Being gay or 
straight is not a measure of a person's worth.	 
</P>
<P>Nor is being gay a ``choice'' or a ``preference'' or a ``lifestyle.'' Being 
gay is an orientation. Like being left-brained or right-brained, 
right-handed or left-handed, being gay or straight is a fundamental part of 
a human being's natural makeup. Does God favor only the right-handed or the 
left-brained? Does God favor people with certain skin colors or hairlines 
while rejecting people who have others?	 
The Supreme Court of the United States upholds the legal right of the Boy 
Scouts of America to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. But a 
legal right isn't always a moral imperative. The Supreme Court protects the 
legal right of free speech for the Ku Klux Klan, but such protection does 
not constitute moral approval of the KKK's hateful discrimination against 
Catholics, Jews and blacks.	 
</P>
<P>For almost a century, the Scout Law has inspired American boys and young men 
to develop good moral character. The Scout Law declares that all Boy Scouts 
should be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, 
cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent. But how does discrimination 
against boys and men who are gay uphold the Scout Law? What is loyal or 
helpful or friendly or courteous or kind or brave about prejudice? How does 
the teaching of discrimination and prejudice to boys and young men help them 
become trustworthy? How does it help them develop a sense of fairness and 
justice?	 
</P>
<P>Finally, how does the practice of discrimination and prejudice show 
reverence? Aren't all children God's children? Didn't Jesus teach that we 
should love and respect our neighbors and treat them as we would want to be 
treated? Would Jesus want to be a Scoutmaster today?	 

<P><I>Frank Edward Allen, a 1962 Eagle Scout Award recipient, is president and executive director of Institutes for Journalism & Natural Resources.</I>
