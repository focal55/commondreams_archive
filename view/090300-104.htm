WASHINGTON<wbr> - <wbr>Labor Day isn't what it used to be. Yesteryear's huge crowds of
cheering unionists who filled places like Cadillac Square in downtown
Detroit are no more, and the confusion over what's still what in the
booming new economy has made the presidential-campaign debate about
economic issues a thin mix of smug cliches. The peril is that this
overconfidence will come back to haunt the next administration.
<p>This doesn't have much to do with Vice President Al Gore's new
neo-populism--probably at least one-third to one-half sincere--that has
clearly done him a lot of good (8-10 points worth) in the polls. Sure,
there is a large phony quotient: Populists don't usually graduate from
prep school and Harvard, and Gore didn't attack the really big industries
that have given him money (technology, telecommunications and
entertainment). However, his pitch made basic political sense by
undercutting Ralph Nader's third-party competition, baiting GOP-leaning
industries that the public already distrusts (oil, drugs, insurance and
tobacco) and hitting the Bush family with one of its least-favorite
political strategies.
<p>The late Lee Atwater, campaign manager for former President George
Bush, admitted after the 1988 election, "The way to win a presidential
race against the Republicans is to develop the class warfare issue, as
[Michael] Dukakis did at the end. To divide up the haves and have-nots
and to try and reinvigorate the New Deal coalition." Four years later,
populist rhetoric--"the rich get the gold mine and the middle class gets
the shaft"--helped elect Bill Clinton and beat Bush Sr. Small wonder it's
now unnerving the Bush Jr.
<p>But despite this new hint of pizazz, the economic debate between Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and Gore barely goes beyond taxes and
prescription-drug benefits. When it comes to the underlying domestic and
international economy, both candidates are singing from the same
establishment hymnal. The 9-year-old economic up cycle is bound to keep
rolling. The Federal Reserve has everything under control. Cheap goods
from China and Mexico are a boon because they keep inflation down. It's
unfair to say rising wealth concentration is leaving the median family in
the dust, but, hey, globalization is the future, even if it costs factory
jobs--and, off the record, contributors love it.
<p>Three or four decades ago, the clout of the U.S. labor movement would
have made this kind of politico-economic nonchalance impossible. Not now.
In some ways, "labor" has become a counterproductive word--too physical,
even too uncool--to describe the activities of the huge majority of
Americans in the service or knowledge industries. They're no more attuned
to the pain of manufacturing workers being swept aside than
late-19th-century industrial workers and middle class were to the plight
of struggling farmers.
<p>Then and now, great economic transformations riding on the back of
new-wave booms are confusing for people in the middle, disastrous for the
less skilled and ill-educated, and enormously rewarding for those with
capital, skills and education. The latter tend to control both
policymaking and the national debate. So it is in 2000. It's this broad
complex of economic issues that represents the dangerous omission in the
national debate.
<p>Consider: The current business-recovery cycle is almost 10 years old,
longer than any before. Thus the prospects for its continuance--six
months, one year, two?--ought to be a sidebar to every Washington policy
discussion. But that would unnerve the stock market. It would also
disrupt bipartisan happy talk about everything we seemingly can now
afford.
<p>Like previous boom cycles in the late 19th century and earlier in the
20th, the boom of the 1980s and 1990s has been marked by an ever-widening
gap between the rich and everyone else. If you look at the top 30
families and individuals in the annual Forbes 400 list for 1999, the
range of their fortunes is 10 times higher than the top 30 of 1982; yet,
in this same period, median family income barely stayed ahead of
inflation. Obscene CEO-to-worker pay ratios are more of the same. But
where's the debate?
<p>So, too, for the increasingly central role of the Federal Reserve
Board in the U.S. economy. The Fed, which makes no secret of its distaste
for increases in employee wages and benefits, has open and official ties
to the banking industry, which it bails out whenever required. But the
Fed can do no wrong.
<p>Globalization--a vague word for letting U.S. corporations shift
investments and hiring plans overseas--is too important to multinational
firms with big Washington lobbies and even bigger checkbooks. Bush and
Gore will dissect the World Trade Organization, the North American Free
Trade Agreement, normalization of trade with China, Mexico and "fast
track" when Miami has a 12-inch snowfall.
<p>Nader talks about these issues, and Reform Party nominee Pat Buchanan
used to, but Gore's semi-populism may dry up Nader's audience. As for
Buchanan, his acceptance speech at the Reform Party's August convention
identified the "unborn" as the foremost "forgotten Americans." This
suggests Kulturkampf is likely to replace economic populism as Buchanan's
tool for transcending his comic-book nomination scramble and achieving
his critical 5% of the vote in November.
<p>The importance of the vacuum in the economic debate is this: The four
most dangerous words in the English language, even to graybeards on Wall
Street, are: "It's different this time." Yet, the whole unvoiced
assumption of mainstream U.S. politics in this election year is that it
is different this time, so the critical debate omissions have become
common wisdom.
<p>As long as the stock market stays more or less in its current trading
range, and as long as oil prices don't go more than a dollar or two above
$30 a barrel, Bush and Gore can avoid the possible problems. And that's
just 10 weeks more, which makes it likely.
<p>This will leave all sorts of things for the next administration to
deal with. The neglected business cycle is the most obvious boomerang.
Take the never-ending talk about the new economy making the business
cycle obsolete. Discussions about the end of business cycles or new
panics being impossible go back to the 1870s and again in the 1920s and
1960s. Not much is new.
<p>If it isn't different this time, moreover, that will bring another old
equation back into play: the thesis of the so-called Austrian School of
economics: that the longer the prosperity and the bigger the speculative
bubble, the bigger the ultimate pop. Smug politicians are themselves a
caution sign, because some of the shallowest economic discussions came in
the years 1872, 1928 and 1968-1972, just before bad downturns.
<p>Another unnerving sign is the ever-widening gap between the ordinary
family--the $40,000-a-year household whose record debt burden dwarfs its
stock portfolio--and the tech deca-billionaires whose daily ups and downs
are the stuff of media CEO wealth meters. Even forgetting justice and
equity, such gaps and preoccupations have been leading indicators of
former great bubbles and their bursting.
<p>The Fed chairman and Treasury secretary are thought to be too smart,
too well equipped with preventatives, for anything to go wrong. This is
also an old song. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's recent interest-rate
hikes--not so forceful if you look at history--have been hailed for
taming inflation and ensuring the economy (and the stock market) a soft
landing--just like Greenspan's 1994-95 rate hikes. Success having been
declared, no discussion is necessary.
<p>But consider another precedent. In 1980, Fed Chairman Paul A. Volcker,
new to his job, raised interest rates to tame inflation and then backed
off when the economy started to slide into what could have been a serious
election-year recession. As a result, he had to start all over again a
year later, and the outcome was a brutal downturn that pushed the U.S.
unemployment rate above 10% for the first time since the Great
Depression. Greenspan may also have stopped too soon out of deference to
an imminent election and stock-market averages.
<p>Even globalization is intertwined with the fate of the new economy.
Just possibly we can't afford to have $300-billion-a-year trade deficits
in which we import so much oil and so many manufactured goods. But the
cheap goods and parts from Mexico and China that cost jobs in Ohio
suppress wages, keep inflation down and help keep the Dow Jones up, even
if almost 50% of the capital gains go to the top 1% of Americans. The
Fed, Bush and Gore are all pleased.
<p>It is our great experiment. The record in such things is that optimism
prevails--fed by the years of naysayers being embarrassed--until the
bubble pops and it is too late.
<p>Possibly the emptiness of the Bush-Gore dialogue now connotes wisdom.
Perhaps the four words "It's different this time" have become truth, and
their "danger" is only to the investment portfolios of the cautious. Yet,
on this obsolete holiday weekend, when labor's defeat by capital seems so
painfully advanced, it's hard to avoid the feeling that the inability of
our national leaders to debate the great economic transformation underway
is a dangerous failure waiting for an unexpected consequence.  *
