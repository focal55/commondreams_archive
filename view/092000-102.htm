I AM A REGISTERED Democrat. And I'm not proud. For more than 20 years, 
I've resigned myself to voting for a predictable parade of ever less 
palatable rich white men whose party line with every subsequent 
election more closely resembles that of their Republican 
counterparts. True, my personal politics lie slightly to the left of 
the Democratic Party's; ours is a joyless marriage of convenience 
that has never been consummated.
<P>  But I vote Democrat for the same reason millions of other 
disgruntled lefties do: because the Republicans are even worse. And 
we all know that the Greens don't have a snowball's chance in a D.C. 
summer of getting elected, and a vote for Ralph Nader is a vote for 
George W. Bush, blah, blah, blah. Friends, when are we all going to 
stand up and refuse to vote for the lesser of two weasels?	 
</P>
<P>  Oh, I've heard all the arguments. And certainly, the prospect of a 
Bush presidency is more chilling than one with Al Gore at the helm. 
But there's a saying I learned in my spiritual practice that is as 
applicable to politics as to personal growth: If you keep doing what 
you've always done, you'll keep getting what you've always gotten. 
What we've gotten is increasingly rotten.	 
</P>
<P>  There is only one candidate with the courage to stand up to the 
corporate Goliath. Nader's been doing it successfully for over 30 
years. While Gore and Bush flap their gums about campaign finance 
reform, Nader is the only one walking the walk by refusing corporate 
hush money: He accepts contributions from individuals only. No PAC 
money, no soft money, just people donating no more than the legal 
limit of $2,000 apiece.	 
</P>
<P>  Others, who might be inclined to vote for Nader, wonder about his 
leadership abilities. In three decades of public service, Nader has 
built a social movement from the inchoate yearnings of a people 
trampled by mainstream politics. This man began with a vision and a 
constituency of those of us who want to lead safer, healthier, longer 
lives.	 
</P>
<P>  And with his leadership and grass-roots support, Nader demanded 
that our government serve her people -- and helped structure the 
institutions required to implement change. Today, we have Nader and 
his dedicated raiders to thank for environmental protections, better 
citizen access to government, and cars that are a lot safer than they 
would be if it were up to the big boys in Detroit.	 
Nader has other visions that I and most Americans would love to 
support -- developing renewable energy, waging peace, strengthening 
labor laws and getting corporations off the public dole.	 
</P>
<P>Is anyone but Nader talking about the decline in real wages, the 
escalation of child poverty, environmental racism, and the 
implications of the fact that consumer debt is higher than ever?	 
But we don't have to live in fear any more. We have a choice. We can 
and we must vote from a genuine sense of felt passion and hope, vote 
for someone we believe in, someone who shares our vision for the 
future of our country, our Earth, our very humanity. Can Ralph Nader 
win? He can if everyone who believes in the principles that Nader 
both serves and embodies -- default Democrats, floundering 
Republicans and all those who feel disenfranchised -- vote. 	 
</P>
<P>I have a dream that some day we will all cast our ballots for the 
person we know to be the best candidate -- not merely in the one 
likely to defeat our worst fears. If not now, when?
