Every so often somebody complains that, thanks to mass marketing and booming advances in telecommunications, the country is losing its regional flavors. The New South doesn't much resemble the one Flannery O'Connor and William Faulkner chronicled. The Midwest is just one geographic blob now, with few distinguishing features between the Alleghenies and the Rockies.
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<P>

   Even Chicago lost its muscled image under a Mayor Daley with smoother edges than his patriarch. Jackson Hole, Wyo., is beginning to look like every upscale community, malls and all.<P>

  One typical gripe is that the ubiquitous presence of TV, plus ease of travel and upward-mobility trends are erasing our varied accents. We all sound as though we grew up in a California suburb.<P>

   I disagree. And not because I'm writing this in Miami. Sure, this place is considered exotic by those who do not live here, may never visit or, if they do, spend their time in tourist attractions that work at being exotic to make money. Guess what? Beneath that perceived this'll-never-be-Akron exterior, we have PTA bake sales and Girl Scout cookie drives just like everywhere else. But we are different from Akron. Or turn that around just once: Akron is different from Miami.<P>

   Consider South Carolina as an example of how American regionalism is alive and well. Not only do South Carolinians persist in electing to the U.S. Senate Strom Thurmond, someone overqualified to participate in a study on senility's effects, but this state is ripped up about flying the Confederate flag over its Capitol in Columbia. That narrow regional issue has affected national presidential politics. Republicans George W. Bush and John McCain both ran smack into the flag flap, to their regret since moving on to states where Old Dixie in most cases never was an issue till now.<P>

   Bush hedged when asked if the flag should be removed from atop the Capitol, calling it a state decision. Ditto for McCain. Yet a 51-percent majority of South Carolinians now believe the Confederate flag should be removed, according to recent polls. Speaking with the honey of a Southern accent, they still have strong feelings about the Stars and Bars but their bow to 21st Century reality is nontraditional.<P>

   Nor do all South Carolinians buy into the teachings and preachings of an exotic local attraction, Bob Jones University, which forbids interracial dating and is decidedly anti-Catholic. Bush spoke there without even frowning on its bigoted teachings in his troll for votes. The Confederate flag-wavers and those in sympathy with Bob Jones U.'s take on the world got the most attention from the Republicans -- and the media.<P>

   When these narrow controversies flare into the national political spotlight, the media don't always make distinctions between broad regional characteristics and the defining parts that helped create the sum total -- yet may no longer be overly active influences. So people in, say, Nebraska or New Mexico look at South Carolina and see no connection to themselves.<P>

   Regionalism dying? No. It is adapting to the demands of broad-eyed commerce and our gradual growth as a progressive people, but there still are plenty of differences to go around, even as the worst or most-extreme regional instincts and beliefs are fading. And in the information age, every quirky minority view gets air play, often to a region's great consternation. (We know about that in South Florida, too.)<P>

   Regional interests come in all types. In Iowa before the caucuses, the subject on every candidate's lips was his stand on ethanol, a fuel made from corn. Did this matter to voters in Brooklyn? Not unless gas prices hit $5 a gallon.<P>

   Geography, history and a dozen other factors have made us a nation of differences united under the umbrella of one federal government standing upon the firm foundation of the Constitution. Now CNN and the Internet, McDonald's and The Gap unite us, too. But when I visit New Orleans or the outlying Bayou country, I still feel I should have brought my passport. It is that unique, despite the Hard Rock Cafe in the city's heart.<P>

   There are plenty of other U.S. locales just as set apart. I would hate to see these differences meld into one homogeneous sort of New World version of Switzerland. And I admire any presidential candidate blessed with the conceit that he or she can appeal to enough of us to get elected.
<P>

   The thing is, neither Republican front-runner shows much respect for or understanding of our commitment to regional quirks (otherwise we'd move or change) and to being part of a nation that can stay strong only when the greater good is fostered. It is why we fought the Civil War in the first place, but neither Bush nor, to a lesser extent recently, McCain seems to get it. Even if the media don't always understand this, those who would lead the country should.<BR>
