THIS MONTH, Congress will consider whether to allow privatizing one of 
America's vital natural resources -- the commercially valuable ocean 
fish in our coastal waters. The impending decisions about the vast, 
public, ocean domain will affect the whole country, but most of all 
those states and communities on the coasts.
<P>  The federal government is charged with looking after America's 
marine fisheries, which encompass all the fish species that fishermen 
pursue off our coasts, such as tuna, rockfish and swordfish. How 
these fisheries are managed will determine what sort of an ocean our 
children inherit.	 
</P>
<P> Unfortunately, Congress might give away uncontrolled, private 
ownership of U.S. fisheries to a limited number of individuals and 
corporations, which could yield serious consequences for both the 
marine environment and our coastal fishing communities.	 
</P>
<P>  Already, America's fisheries are in bad shape. Forty-three percent 
of the nation's managed fish species are seriously overfished. The 
government has declared fisheries disasters in Alaska, New England 
and here on the West Coast.	 
</P>
<P>  One poorly considered proposal to fix this problem is to parcel 
out shares of our public fisheries to private interests through 
Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) programs, which give shareholders 
exclusive rights to the fish. But where these market-driven programs 
have been tried on a trial basis, they haven't worked well. In 
halibut and sablefish fisheries in Alaska and the surf clam and ocean 
quahog fisheries on the East Coast, they have had serious drawbacks 
for local fishermen, the villages in which they live, and the health 
of the fisheries themselves.	 
</P>
<P>  Since quotas can be bought and sold to the highest bidder, local 
fishermen -- who can't compete with deep-pocketed corporations -- are 
almost inevitably squeezed out. While corporations amass large shares 
of the fishing take, traditional fishermen, their families, and 
communities are forced 
to abandon their heritage. Meanwhile, there is little incentive for 
IFQ shareholders to reduce overexploitation or to protect the ocean 
environment.	 
</P>
<P>  This is precisely what happened under the surf clam IFQ program in 
New Jersey, where shares have become consolidated in the hands of a 
few big companies. Now, the two largest shareholders are not local 
fishermen, but rather one of the country's biggest accounting firms 
and a national bank.	 
</P>
<P>  Moreover, because quotas are set based on the number of fish 
historically caught by individual fishermen, those who tried to allow 
stocks to replenish by fishing responsibly were penalized, while 
those who fished rapaciously were rewarded.	 
</P>
<P>  Proponents of open-ended, unregulated IFQ programs often 
misleadingly claim they will result in significant conservation 
benefits by reducing the number of fishing vessels and, consequently, 
impacts to the marine environment. But, as is typical, under the surf 
clam IFQ program the number of boats in the fishery fell from 133 to 
48, while the remaining boats tripled their catch. Fishermen lost their 
jobs, but conservation was not enhanced.	 
</P>
<P>  In 1996, Congress recognized the dangers of poorly planned IFQ 
programs and placed them under a four-year moratorium to allow time 
to work out the flaws in the system. But while those four years 
slipped by, our legislators did nothing.	 
</P>
<P>  Obviously, Congress cannot fix the quota system before the 
moratorium expires on Sept. 30. At this point, the only reasonable 
course of action is for Congress to extend the ban for another year. 
This will allow time to establish clear and strong national standards 
to ensure that individual fishing quotas safeguard our fishing 
communities, fisheries and fishermen.	 
</P>
<P>The new standards should recognize that fisheries are publicly owned 
resources and grant IFQs for not more than five years, after which 
time they may be renewed or denied, subject to satisfying defined 
criteria. Individuals with no financial stake in the fishery system 
would hold the reviews, to ensure fairness. 	 
</P>
<P>  Furthermore, Congress should require anyone holding a quota to 
provide additional conservation benefits to the fishery, such as 
avoiding catching, killing and discarding unwanted species of fish 
and protecting essential fish habitat. Excessive consolidation of 
quotas must be avoided and preference should be given to fishermen 
with records of conservation-minded fishing practices.	 
</P>
<P>  The oceans belong to all Americans, but those of us lucky enough 
to live near the coasts bear a special responsibility for 
safeguarding this heritage. Having once failed to meet its own 
deadline, Congress needs to extend the IFQ moratorium and immediately 
begin working out a solid plan to preserve and protect our fisheries 
and our fishermen.
