Much of the controversy, anger and distrust we have witnessed over
the past five months of the Elian Gonzalez case could have been prevented
with better understanding and communication between Americans and Cubans.
That is why I urge President Clinton to visit Cuba before he leaves
office.
<p>The president should fly on Air Force One into Jose Marti Airport in
Havana and declare to the Cuban people that the Cold War is finally over.
He should announce that he will use his executive power to normalize
diplomatic relations, lift the travel restrictions imposed on U.S.
citizens who want to travel to Cuba and waive as much of the outdated
economic embargo as current law allows.
<p>The president could speak to students at universities from Havana to
Santiago de Cuba about the importance of human rights, free speech, free
press and free assembly. He could meet with Cardinal Jaime Ortega, the
archbishop of Havana, and encourage the expanding role of the Catholic
Church in Cuban society. He could meet with representatives of American
educational, cultural and nonprofit organizations currently operating on
the island. He could pursue opportunities for American businesses that
want access to Cuban markets. He could nurture the fledgling dialogue
that exists between our nations in the critical areas of drug
trafficking, immigration and counter-terrorism. He could even talk
baseball with Cuba's passionate and knowledgeable fans.
<p>And he could meet with the dissident community working to change the
Cuban government from within. Those dissidents would no doubt tell the
president, as they told me when I visited there recently, that American
isolation does nothing to promote a more open Cuba. For example, the
United States forbids the export of items, such as fax machines and
Internet technology, that would directly and powerfully aid those Cubans
pressing for democratization. We should encourage the free flow of ideas,
not contribute to its suppression.
<p>If the president were to visit, he would find a Cuba that is much more
complex than the stale Cold War rhetoric would have you believe. He would
find that many Cubans, including some in the current government, are
searching for ways to change their country without sacrificing the gains
they have made in education, infant mortality and health care.
<p>The Cuban government, for its part, should extend to President Clinton
the same courtesies given to Pope John Paul II during his historic 1998
trip to the island: the ability to travel wherever he wants, say whatever
he wants and have his public speeches carried live and censorship-free on
Cuban TV and radio.
<p>I'm certain the prospect of such bold, unconventional presidential
travel would upset the most fervent supporters of current U.S. policy
toward Cuba. Ironically, it would also cause discomfort for Fidel Castro.
For 40 years he has used our embargo as a convenient excuse for every
political and economic shortcoming of the Cuban revolution. Castro's
argument has been that as long as Cuba is "under siege" from the United
States, he is justified in stifling dissent.
<p>By visiting Cuba and opening relations between our two countries,
President Clinton could make that excuse disappear forever. He could
break down the walls of ignorance and fear that exist between us. And he
could establish the framework for a more sensible relationship between
the United States and our island neighbor.
