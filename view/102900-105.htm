Come election day, millions may vote for George W. Bush and Al Gore while 
not believing in them. Doubtlessly, some will vote for one of these two 
enthusiastically, but sometimes it seems neither of these candidates has 
inspired many beyond their immediate family and those on their campaign 
payroll. Many unimpassioned voters would consider backing a third party 
candidate, like consumer advocate Ralph Nader - or Pat Buchanan or the 
Libertarian or Natural Law candidates. But voters are scared.

<p>Many are frightened that Gore will win - so they plan to vote for Bush; 
many others are afraid that Bush will win - so they're looking at voting 
for Gore. Are we becoming a nation that votes its fears rather than its 
hopes and convictions? A vote should be a statement of what someone 
believes - and indeed millions will do that come November 7. However, many 
feel sidelined, their heart tells them to vote for a third party candidate, 
but their head tells them to go for the "lesser of two evils."

<p>Even with these shackles there are solutions - if people really do think it 
through. One answer is suggested by the group Citizens for Strategic 
Voting, which is taking out ads in newspapers urging people in states in 
which Gore or Bush does not have a chance of winning to vote for Ralph 
Nader. People could thus vote for Green Party candidate Nader without 
feeling they are helping whichever of the major party candidates they want 
to keep out of the White House. This is of course because the president is 
elected by winning a majority of the electoral college and the candidate 
who wins a given state gets all the electoral votes from that state. And if 
Nader gets 5 percent of the popular vote, as Ross Perot did in 1996, the 
Green Party gets federal money in 2004.

<p>Good enough. But what if you live in one of those "swing states," (like 
Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan, 
Oregon, Washington) or if you don't believe the polls?

<p>Here's a sure-fire solution - if you are close to (and trust) someone who 
is on the other side of the two party divide in your state.

<p>Say a husband plans to vote for Gore since he thinks Bush is dim. His wife 
plans to vote for Bush because she thinks Gore is deceitful. If they both - 
in the their hearts would like to vote for some third party candidate - 
they can do so, by trusting each other and both voting for the third party 
candidate.

<p>If they had just gone along with the husband voting for Gore and the wife 
voting for Bush, in effect they would cancel out each other's vote. But if 
they both vote for a third party candidate, they can magnify their votes. 
For example, if instead of one for Gore and the other for Bush they both 
voted for Nader, they would not change the balance between Gore and Bush, 
but they would give Nader two votes. Instead of "wasting" their votes (by 
canceling out each other), they would double their vote  by giving both to 
the candidate they truly want. They would vote their conviction without 
helping whichever politician they least want. Of course, people can do this 
with any third party candidate, and indeed, with any two third party 
candidates (a husband can vote for one third party candidate, the wife for 
a different one). This would send a strong signal that people are not 
satisfied with the major parties.

<p>A would-be Republican voting for Nader is not as unlikely as it might seem 
to some. Nader's attraction comes largely from his intelligence and 
integrity. In his address at the Green Party convention, he welcomed 
"authentic conservatives" - as opposed to "corporatists." He stands for 
community, for family, for accountability - as well as for social justice, 
the environment and peace. He stands against abusive power, whether by 
corporations - or the government.

<p>This "vote swap" option is exercised by politicians all the time. One 
congressman votes for another's dam project in return for a vote for his 
military base. Maybe it's about time that the public used such tactics.

<p>So there are solutions. People don't need to feel bound by the "lesser of 
two evil argument." Step one: vote your convictions; Step two: figure out 
what's happening in your state and vote with your head; Step three: find a 
friend, relative or co-worker who was planning on voting for the other 
"less of two evils," make a pact and double your heart instead of canceling 
out each other on election day.
