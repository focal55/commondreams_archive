KENT, Ohio -- The National Guardsmen were 
walking up a hill when they suddenly 
wheeled around and fired into a 
group of unarmed students. That was 
how four students died at Kent State 
University on May 4, 1970. 

<p>To see the site is to know that the 
guardsmen were not under threat. 
The closest student killed, Jeffrey 
 Miller, was 85 to 90 yards away, 
Allison Krause 100 yards, William 
Schroeder and Sandra Scheuer 130 
yards. 

<p> Why, then, did it happen? The 
Guard was ill trained and ill led, 
mainly working-class young men resentful of the seemingly privileged 
students. Nothing can excuse the undisciplined shooting. But the deeper 
reasons lay in our  national leadership: its obsessive pursuit of the 
Vietnam War, its paranoia, its mendacity. 

<p> "This is not an invasion of Cambodia," President Nixon had told the 
nation on April 30 as he disclosed that 
U.S. troops were invading Cambodia. 
A president who had campaigned on a 
promise to end the war was widening 
it. If he did not, he said, America 
would be "a pitiful, helpless giant."  

<p> American intelligence, we were 
told, had located a major North Vietnamese headquarters in Cambodia, 
and U.S. forces were going to seize it. 
What they found was a bunch of huts. 

<p> Americans who were not alive in 
1970 must find it hard to understand 
why students at Kent State and other 
universities protested so emotionally 
over Vietnam. There were various 
reasons. But the underlying one was 
the government's persistence in a 
war whose futility was so overwhelmingly evident by then. 

<p> The Nixon administration had begun to reduce the American force in 
Vietnam that at its peak had exceeded 550,000. That was a creditable 
policy. But the administration confounded it by pretending that somehow South Vietnam could prevail 
without us. 

<p> The country was divided. President Nixon did not want to alienate 
those who believed in the war. But, 
fatally, he did not educate the country to understand the war's futility. 
To the contrary, he implied that victory was essential to our credibility 
-- to our not being seen as a pitiful, 
helpless giant. 

<p> In the years of the first Nixon 
administration, 1969 through 1972, 
the United States dropped four million tons of bombs on Indochina, and 
lost 20,492 American lives. Many 
times that number of Vietnamese 
were killed. To what end? 

<p> There was another, profound cost 
to the United States: the further polarization of our society, the shattering of common faith in government. 
Those wounds have not yet healed. 

<p> The attitudes that did such damage persist, too. They can be seen in 
the leading survivor among the policy makers of 1970, Henry Kissinger. 

<p> Writing in Newsweek on the legacy 
of Vietnam, Dr. Kissinger painted 
the critics of the war policy then as 
radical extremists who "challenged 
the very essence of American foreign involvement." Their legacy, he 
suggested, is in the Clinton administration. 

<p> "The conclusions that many in the 
Clinton administration -- and in the 
liberal community -- have drawn 
from the Vietnam War," he wrote, 
"present a profound challenge to traditional American foreign policy. 
They treat the cold war as a misunderstanding, if not an American creation." 

<p> In other words, liberals and the 
Clinton administration are soft on 
Communism. Try saying that to 
Madeleine Albright, Dr. Kissinger. 
Of course the overwhelming majority of liberal Americans supported 
the West's staunch and successful 
resistance to Soviet Communism, 
and look back at the policy  with 
pride. 

<p> Dr. Kissinger always thought that 
criticism of U.S. foreign policy was 
somehow unpatriotic. The irony is 
that, out of office, he has become the 
most nagging of critics. Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor: He has opposed one 
after another intervention to save 
human lives. 

<p> Criticism is valuable because it 
helps to correct public policies. That 
is a great advantage of open societies. But the system works only if 
those in charge are wise enough to 
recognize when a policy, however 
well intentioned, has gone wrong. 
The Vietnam War and its leaders are 
a monument to the failure of that 
necessary wisdom.
