The Subway Series seems to have attracted a bigger
(and certainly more interested) following than the elections
of 2000, even outside of New York City. More people will
probably know about Roger Clemens throwing that piece of
a broken bat at Mike Piazza, and ponder its significance,
too--than any particular confrontation between Presidential
candidates Al Gore and George W. Bush.

         <p>There are a number of very understandable reasons
why Americans might prefer sports to politics. Honesty and
fairness are two of them. You don't get to be Derek Jeter
because your father made the right connections, or you were
born into money. Or worse, because you took a bribe from
rich contributors and threw the game. Ann Richards' famous
sound bite about George W's father, "He was born on third
base and thinks he hit a triple," captured this contrast
between the arena of sports and so many other endeavors, in
a society in which human relations and achievements are so
often corrupted by the influence of money and wealth.

         <p>And our politics offer the polar extreme of this
corruption. Just look at the Presidential contest that is being
served up: while there are certainly some significant
differences between the Republican and Democratic
nominees, these are tiny compared to what would emerge in
an honest, rule-based system like baseball. And even these
differences will, in many cases, soon morph into their
opposites after the game is over, so that fans will barely be
able to recognize the teams that they rooted for amidst the
debris of broken promises and betrayals.

         <p>Much of the public sees the whole game as rigged,
and it is true that most of the outcome is assured in advance.
The great problems of the day will remain un-addressed or
promise to deteriorate, regardless of who wins. Our 43
million citizens without health insurance, the one out of
every six children that grows up in poverty, the failure of
our educational system, the growing inequality of income
and wealth, the self-defeating "war on drugs" that has given
us the world's biggest prison population--on these and most
other crucial issues, neither candidate offers any credible
proposals for change. And it is not for want of solutions--or,
in the world's richest country, a lack of means to solve these
problems.

         <p>For those who would nonetheless try to understand
politics, the media makes it much more difficult than
following sports. In sports reporting, the most important
information is clear and up front. Even if the Yankees or the
Mets are not your team, broadcasters and sports writers will
provide you with helpful information on the players, their
batting averages and earned run averages, and some
interesting history of the teams.

         <p>It is much more difficult to get what you need from
political reporting. Election coverage focuses mainly on
polling data, how potential voters feel about the candidates,
the impressions they have created, their strategies and
demeanor. And if you want to understand the issues
themselves, you may need a research assistant to dig around.
Will Social Security go broke when the baby boomers
retire? Can we afford national health insurance for
everyone? Why did the Federal Reserve raise interest rates
six times over the last 16 months? What do the IMF and
World Bank do? What is our government doing in
Colombia, with hundreds of millions of our tax dollars?

         <p>Some of these questions have very simple answers
(the first one is "no"). Others are more complex but still
easily understandable with less background knowledge than
most sports fans acquire in a single season. But the
information provided by the media is spotty, and perhaps
more importantly--heavily skewed toward the interests of
those with power and wealth.

         <p>In the current election, the media really abandoned
its own most basic principles by collaborating in the
exclusion--led by partisan interests--of consumer advocate
Ralph Nader, from the Presidential debates and most
campaign coverage. Nader is not only the  most qualified
candidate but an American hero, a man of unimpeachable
integrity who many millions would vote for if they had a
chance to see and hear him in the race. But the press went
out of its way to make sure that they didn't. His exclusion is
comparable to suspending Mark McGuire for the season
because he criticized the relentless commercialism of major
league baseball.

         <p>We have a long way to go before we have the kind
of clean elections and independent press that could make
politics a mass spectator sport--let alone a participatory
activity--for the majority of citizens. In the mean time, it
should be no surprise that most Americans choose to grab a
beer and enjoy the game--at least they will have something
to celebrate when their team wins.
