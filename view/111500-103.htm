<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->JOHANNESBURG, 
              South Africa -- The whole world is watching.            
<P align="left">And 
              for the most part, it's giggling.</P>
<P align="left">America's 
              inability to elect a president has captured the imagination of the 
              rest of the planet. Yet -- despite suggestions by Republican George 
              W. Bush's campaign that any delay in finalizing the count could 
              undermine America's authority internationally -- political leaders, 
              editorialists and ordinary folks around the world seem more amused 
              than troubled by the unsettled contest in what British commentators 
              are describing as "The Disunited States of America.''</P>
<P align="left">After 
              suffering through years of admonishments from Americans about the 
              failings of their electoral systems, commentators abroad have delighted 
              in the past week's tales of butterfly ballots, intimidation and 
              fraud, miscounted votes, partisan lawsuits and general chaos in 
              Florida.</P>
<P align="left">As 
              the contest between Bush and Democrat Al Gore grows more and more 
              confused, folks in Yugoslavia, Zimbabwe and other lands say -- with 
              sarcastic tongues planted firmly in cheek -- that they stand ready 
              to provide electoral advice and assistance to the world's last remaining 
              superpower.</P>
<P align="left">"It 
              seems our virus of election manipulation has now found its way to 
              America,'' smirked Yugoslav pol Velimir Illic, who says he is prepared 
              to lend to Gore forces the bulldozer he used to break through barricades 
              to the Parliament Building where Slobodan Milosevic's forces were 
              fiddling with the results of Yugoslavia's Sept. 24 election.</P>
<P align="left">Russian 
              elections chief Alexander Veshnyakov encouraged the United States 
              to imitate Russia's strides from totalitarianism to democracy by 
              ditching the "undemocratic and confusing'' Electoral College.</P>
<P align="left">Fidel 
              Castro's Cuba offered to send "democracy educators'' to help south 
              Floridians organize free and fair elections. Rome's La Republica 
              newspaper simply labeled America's muddled Nov. 7 election "a day 
              worthy of a banana republic.''</P>
<P ALIGN="left"><B>****</B></P>
<P align="left">But 
              no international reaction to America's most muddled election will 
              top that of the Africans, who have long bristled at intimations 
              that their fledgling democracies are inferior to the U.S. system.</P>
<P align="left">"One 
              can't help but chuckle,'' says South African Trade and Industry 
              Minister Alec Erwin, one of the architects of his nation's transition 
              from apartheid police state to freewheeling multiracial democracy. 
              "So much of what's been said about African elections is now being 
              said about an American election.''</P>
<P align="left">The 
              chuckling has been widespread in Africa during the past week, as 
              has sarcasm born of long frustration with American lectures on all 
              things democratic.</P>
<P align="left">Marveling 
              at the oddity of what is being called "the recount of a recount 
              of a recount'' in Florida, Zimbabwe's Herald newspaper wondered 
              "whether the Americans would have accepted a recount in African 
              elections if the ruling party candidate had been beaten, as happened 
              in Florida.'' Pointing to the very real prospect that America will 
              "elect'' a president who failed to win the popular vote, Zimbabwe 
              government spokesman Jonathan Moyo said, "We could not get away 
              with something like that in Zimbabwe without the threat of (economic) 
              sanctions.''</P>
<P align="left">In 
              Zimbabwe, a history of election-related violence, intimidation and 
              fraud has made the presence of international observers a regular 
              feature whenever the country votes. As is the case in many African 
              countries, Zimbabwe has gotten used to election day visits by former 
              President Jimmy Carter and other global governors of democratic 
              practice. A failure to do so, it is generally assumed, could lead 
              to cuts in assistance from the United States, the International 
              Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other sources of Western aid.</P>
<P align="left">"Maybe 
              Africans and others should send observers to help Americans deal 
              with their democracy,'' Moyo joked.</P>
<P align="left">The 
              idea of African democracy corps being dispatched to the United States 
              has become a favorite subject of speculation on the continent.</P>
<P align="left">The 
              respected Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper, which circulates across 
              English-speaking Africa, began an editorial in this week's edition 
              by observing that "the sight of the 'world's greatest democracy' 
              getting its credentials in a knot over who should be pronounced 
              winner in the United States presidential elections should remind 
              us that friendship is a two-way process. It is a shameful reflection 
              on our continent that, in their hour of need, we were not there 
              beside our American brothers and sisters to help and advise where 
              we could, in the same way as they do when our elections come around.''</P>
<P ALIGN="left">Displaying 
              a keen eye for the relative weaknesses of the Republican and Democratic 
              contenders, the Mail &amp; Guardian continued, "We should, no doubt, 
              have established a pan-African Society for the Promotion of Democracy 
              in Primitive Parts, which would have established a friendly rapport 
              with the main political leaders -- using sign language in the case 
              of George W. Bush and reminding Al Gore of the perils of perjury 
              on all possible occasions.</P>
<P align="left">"Before 
              the onset of the contest itself, we should have set up seminars 
              in the main rural centers, where the various models of democracy 
              would have been explained, including the detail that it is 'the 
              people' who are meant to rule and not 'the Electoral College.'</P>
<P align="left">
"We 
              would have been proud to assist voter literacy courses to show officials 
              how to draw up legible ballot papers and printed guide books on 
              why it is necessary to only vote once. And, from our long African 
              experience of these matters, we could have shown (Gore or Bush) 
              how to be a bad loser.''
