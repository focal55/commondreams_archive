Jose Bove milks 250 sheep in the Larzac region of France, a rocky, windswept
place where you would think no farmer could produce anything.  But Bove turns
sheep milk into one of the gastronomical treasures of the world, Roquefort
cheese.  Bove is a leader of the local Roquefort producers association and of
the second largest farmers' organization in France.  So he was well known
locally before he and nine friends drove their tractors to the nearby town of
Millau last year and pulled down an under-construction McDonalds restaurant. 
Now he is well known globally.

<p>Bove's beef with McDonalds began with America's beef industry, particularly its
habit of dosing feedlot cattle with the kinds of hormones that athletes are
tempted to use for the same reason -- to bulk up fast.  Europeans are
disinclined to eat this high-test meat.  The European Union forbids
hormone-raised beef, either domestically produced or imported.  That makes the
American beef industry, and the government officials to whom the beef industry
pays large campaign donations, very angry.
</p>
<p>Now that we have a World Trade Organization, we have an official way to resolve
such conflicts.  WTO resolutions nearly always come out in favor of trade, no
matter what its social or environmental or cultural or health consequences.  It
was no surprise when the WTO declared the EU ban on hormone-raised beef illegal.</p>
<p>The EU refused to lift the ban.  So the WTO imposed the only punishment within
its power.  It allowed the U.S. to slap retaliatory tarriffs -- high taxes
imposed at the border -- on French products.  One of the products thus affected
was Roquefort cheese.  Which made Jose Bove and his Roquefort-producing friends
very angry.</p>
<p>At their hearing on June 30 at least 50,000 people jammed into Millau for a
political demonstration equivalent in purpose to Seattle's anti-WTO bash six
months earlier.  In the crowd's estimation, if not the court's, Bove is a hero. 
The T-shirt seen all over the streets said on the front, in a direct quote from
Bove, &quot;Le Monde n'est pas une marchandise.&quot;  (The world is not merchandise, not
a product, not for sale.)  On the back it said, &quot;Moi non plus.&quot;  (Me neither.)</p>
<p>Bove's supporters are by no means only French.  The American media tend to frame
stories like this as a confrontation between French and U.S. farmers.  But
American farmers actually donated to help with Bove's legal expenses.  One
farmer responded: &quot;A few of us were standing around our co-op this morning
wishing we had some way to help those French guys, and now we have your email
we're glad to send some money so we can have some small part in this.&quot;</p>
<p>The Millau Ten were found guilty -- they readily admitted that they pulled down
the McDonalds.  They are free until their sentences are announced in September. 
Because Bove has a prior record for struggles against the French military and
against genetically engineered crops, he faces months in prison.</p>
<p>Bove's home hamlet of Montredon is tiny; maybe 6 or 7 families live there.  You
would expect its Wednesday evening farmers' market to be a small affair.  In
fact hundreds of people typically show up to shop for vegetables, fruit,
preserves, cheese, meat, wine, ceramics and leather goods.  Jose and a couple of
other guys fire up a barbecue where everyone brings meat to grill.  They sit
around eating and drinking, and then the music starts.  There's a small play. 
It's not possible to distinguish producers from consumers; many folks are both. 
This is a community. </p>
<p>Somehow, over centuries, people have learned not only to make a living in the
sparse Larzac, but to make a rich life.  Jose Bove chose a brilliantly symbolic
act to compare the quality of that life with the antiseptic arrogance of
MacDonalds.  He was protesting more than the injustice of taxing French sheep
farmers to force European consumers to accept U.S. mass-produced beef.  He was
protesting the whole idea that has come to be called globalization.</p>
<p>In a culture dominated by the bare logic of market exchange, everything becomes
commodified, including our time, our intelligence, our landscape, our water, our
food.  Jose and his neighbors are saying no, that's not what we want.  No, we
refuse to be sucked into that system.  We insist that our value to one another
and the value of our land and lives not be measured in dollars or francs.  We
insist that the World Trade Organization not be granted the power to force us to
eat food from factories.  We insist that community, culture, taste, work, and
nature are more important than cheap food or free trade.  We insist on
protecting our traditions from the narrow, heartless economics that would have
us fill our lives with things produced wherever they can be made most
&quot;efficiently.&quot;
