          is like taking a bath: You got to keep doing it every day.' <i>-- Flo 
          Kennedy</i>
</font>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> For 
          close to 20 years there's been a little phrase over my desk that I cut 
          out of a magazine so long ago I've no idea where it came from. I look 
          at it almost daily and am continually struck at how it's a one sentence 
          philosophy of life, politics and activism. It's a Flo Kennedy comment, 
          "Freedom is like taking a bath: You got to keep doing it every day.''</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kennedy, 
          who died last weekend at age 84, was the embodiment of that phrase. 
          She was a font of witty and wicked one-liners that cut to the bone. 
          Her flamboyant clothes -- pink sunglasses and a cowboy hat were her 
          trademarks -- assured her of attention. But like Bella Abzug, another 
          loudmouth New Yorker who favored dramatic headgear, her style -- and 
          her gender -- made her an easy target to criticize and dismiss.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gloria 
          Steinem coined the phrase "verbal karate'' to describe Kennedy's style. 
          Kennedy had a knack for taking complex issues and reducing them to the 
          core concept that exposed bigotry or encouraged action or did whatever 
          the subject required.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
          the death of her mother -- and a stint at owning a hat shop with her 
          sisters -- Kennedy moved to New York, where friends urged her to become 
          a teacher. Instead, Kennedy enrolled in prelaw at Columbia University. 
          "I find that the higher you aim, the better you shoot,'' she said.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She 
          was then refused admission to Columbia Law school -- not because she 
          was black but because she was a woman. Kennedy responded that "to my 
          friends at the NAACP, it all sounds the same.''</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She 
          threatened a lawsuit and was admitted, one of eight women and the only 
          black in her class. She graduated in 1951 but quickly became disillusioned 
          by the law and the courts when she represented the estates of jazz legends 
          Billie Holiday and Charlie Parker. Though she won the case, Kennedy 
          said it taught her "more than I was really ready for ... about the hostility 
          and helplessness of the courts.''</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's 
          when Kennedy decided political activism was the way to change society. 
          She set up an organization to combat racism in journalism and advertising. 
          She discovered picketing ad agencies was a highly effective technique. 
          "When you want to get to the suites, start in the streets,'' she said 
          afterward.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 
          Kennedy was a founding member of the National Women's Political Caucus, 
          she also recognized big groups like that were not the only route to 
          change. "Unity in a movement situation can be overrated,'' she said. 
          "If you were the Establishment, which would you rather see coming in 
          the door: one lion or 500 hundred mice?''</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kennedy 
          did still practice law and it was always politically motivated. In 1969 
          she organized a group of feminist lawyers to challenge the constitutionality 
          of New York state's abortion law. That move pushed the Legislature to 
          liberalize the law the next year -- three years before Roe vs. Wade 
          became the law of the land.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kennedy 
          went on the lecture circuit with Steinem, who called them "the Thelma 
          and Louise of the '70s.'' According to Kennedy's obituary in The New 
          York Times, their lectures frequently drew men to their audience and 
          all too often one of them stood up and asked, "Are you lesbians?''</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kennedy 
          would answer, "It depends. Are you my alternative?'' It was the beginning 
          of 20 years on the lecture circuit.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
          her autobiography, Kennedy said, "A lot of people think I'm crazy. Maybe 
          you do too, but I never stopped to wonder why I'm not like other people. 
          The mystery to me is why more people aren't like me.''</font></P>
<P align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
It's 
          no mystery. It's tough to put your beliefs into action -- to take that 
          bath every day. And it's impossible to do it when women's stories still 
          get less ink. Or when women's actions are considered crazy instead of 
          acknowledging that the situations that spurred Flo Kennedy's activism 
          are the crazy part. Turn on the water and jump in the tub.
