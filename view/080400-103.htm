We began the last decade with a Bush in the White House, and we may continue in this one with another in the same place, a possibility that illustrates the sadly circular nature of recent history. Perhaps worse than that - for the older Bush, if a limited man of the upperclass right, did have a few virtues, while his son is a man of no apparent quality or achievements. Worse, too, in that what it seemed permissible to hope for under the father seems remote indeed should the son be elected.
<P>The father at least spoke of a better ordered world, and some of his policies contributed toward it. The son, by contrast, speaks only of a dangerous planet against which America must be protected, whether by radars and missiles or by hard-faced trade negotiators.
<P>Ten years ago it was reasonable to look forward to a degree of nuclear disarmament sufficient to keep proliferation in check, to a resolution of Middle Eastern conflicts, to progress in Africa, to democratic evolution in Russia and, more broadly, to a consensus among the better-off and more powerful states that would make all international problems easier to deal with than they had been.
<P>No doubt these hopes underestimated the obdurate nature of these problems and no doubt, too, that the instruments of policy, whether the choice was aid, intervention, sanction or mediation, were overestimated. There is no question that the efforts that were made, by the United States under President   Clinton and by other countries, were very flawed.
<P>The collapse of the Camp David talks, on the one hand, and the inexorable rise of national missile defence, on the other, frame the grand failure of the last decade. If Saddam had been brought down and a democratic Iraq had emerged - not so much of a forlorn hope as the cynics say - the resulting momentum might have encompassed an early settlement between Israelis and Palestinians. If an early settlement had been achieved in any case, it might have led to changes that would have undermined Saddam.
<P>Neither chain developed. In part it was bad luck, in part lack of determination, in part lack of balance. Who knows whether a United States that had been consistently more even-handed, and more sustained in its application to the problem, might not have been able to pull off Camp David, by inducing the Israelis to give more and the Palestinians to take less? If so, even at this late stage, a new regional chemistry might have begun to work.
<P>Saddam's survival is not the only reason that the idea of invulnerability to missile attack again took root in American politics. But, together with North Korea's manoeuvres, it reinforced such tendencies. The connection between enemies who can't be bested and who may soon possess weapons of mass destruction, interventions that don't come off, mediations that fail and force-field fantasies at home is evident. It is not so much that missile defence will work, as that the entrenched American belief   in the power of technology makes it potent politically, in a way it could never physically be as an actual system.
<P>The Republicans contributed to the failures of the two Clinton administrations but they can hardly be blamed for them. What they can be blamed for is seizing on those failures, at home and abroad, and turning them into the foundations of their policies for the future. At home, Clinton failed to reverse the American trend toward greater inequality of income. As with social democrats in other countries, his emphasis on education and opportunity, and even on health, ended up benefiting the middle class more than the truly disadvantaged.
<P>The Republicans would row back on what Clinton achieved. Sprinkling Latinos, blacks and single mothers around to dramatise a new rhetoric of inclusion does not alter the fact that the Republican emphasis on decentralising social policy puts power into the hands of local elites who, it has been persistently demonstrated, act largely in their own interests.
<P>The Republican party would be the worst party, for instance, to deal with the triangular conflict between Latinos and African-Americans in the older urban centres, starved of income and industry, and the largely white and middle-class population of the suburbs and the new "edge cities". Not far from the convention centre where the Republicans are meeting, in the Puerto Rican areas of north Philadelphia, two thirds of the children are growing up in households earning less than $15,500 a year, according to figures in Mike Davis's illuminating new book about Latino politics.
<P>Little has been heard about what the Republicans would do about that, even though protest marchers have tried to raise the issue. Because of the wall in their minds between the United States and the rest of the world, even the rest of America, Republicans would be equally ill-equipped to deal with the challenge of a future in which political choices in, for example, Mexico or Venezuela, will affect the mood and the demands of people of Latin American background in US cities. Foreign policy and domestic policy could be mingled in novel ways as such connections develop.
<P>But it is in foreign policy that a second Bush era is most to be feared. A Republican administration would not regard Clinton's failures abroad as a reason to try again but, in general, as a reason not to try at all. There may be exceptions to this, especially in the Middle East, and allowance must be made for the steadying influence of power and state department expertise. But America under the Republicans would be much less ready to engage, to take risks and to make sacri fices than it has been under Clinton, and since it has been very imperfectly ready to do so under the Democrats, that is saying something. Those who now recount, some of them with misguided glee, the ways in which American and western policies have gone wrong - how sanctions have killed children or how military intervention has led to more ethnic cleansing or how UN supervised elections have been subverted - might soon pine for the days when American action in international emergencies was at least a possibility.
<P>The Republicans may be shifting a little. But they still remain the major party most committed to low state spending, to limited social programmes, to strategies that lead to greater disparity in income and quality of life for Americans, and, abroad, to policies emphasising defence and protection over aid, cooperation and working through the United Nations. In both home and foreign policy the Republican style is the same - a camouflage of inclusionist rhetoric over the reality of vested interest. In America itself, the security of the advantaged classes over the security of the whole society, and, abroad, the security of one nation set far too high over the security of other nations. The Democrats are hardly free of such tendencies but a Republican administration might well entrench them. The awful festival of humbug just concluded in Philadelphia bodes ill for America and the world.
