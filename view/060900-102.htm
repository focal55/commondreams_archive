A few decades of social activism can dull a person's capacity to be surprised. I came to the United Nations this week to help welcome women from around the world to the latest UN review of our condition, but I didn't expect to learn much. And the opening ceremony was the familiar sea of colorful clothing and smiling, singing faces of every shade.
<P>
<P>The posters, banners, fliers, and demonstrations all seemed to echo women's needs and the themes that had excited me in the 1970s and had led me to become goodwill ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, in 1994.
<P>
<P>But as I talked with women who had traveled thousands of miles for this gathering and women who had walked over from around the corner, I began to see something new. The whole context has changed.
<P>
<P>Women are now on the world's agenda. The controversy that surrounds everything we do is proof. Some 25 years ago, abuses such as bride-burning, female genital mutilation, human trafficking, forced marriage, and ordinary domestic violence used to be shrugged off as unavoidable, as cultural traditions, as private matters, or as too widespread to try to stop. No more.
<P>
<P>Violence against women is now condemned rightly as the violation of human rights that it has always been. Even sexual harassment is so unacceptable in the United States today that young women find it hard to believe my tales of what life used to be like for women here, especially in the music business.
<P>
<P>This is not to say that the abuses have ended. On the contrary. Our very real gains have produced a strong backlash by patriarchal and fundamentalist forces worldwide, whose perks we are challenging. Debate rages over women's demands that governments honor the commitments they made five years ago at the World Conference on Women in Beijing - for equality in the workplace, in access to education, medical care, and legal and social rights, and in decision-making. The struggle is on display for all to see in New York this week, where a few countries are trying to turn back the clock.
<P>
<P>But reality has set in. No one speaks now of economic development without speaking of women, because investing in women and girls has proved to be the fastest boost for every indicator of progress.
<P>
<P>Visiting Vietnam with UNICEF, I met some poor women who had used tiny loans from a micro-credit program to raise rabbits to sell. The income let them add protein to their children's diet of rice, gave them some autonomy and self-esteem, and was a lift for their whole community.
<P>
<P>Every year of schooling for a girl is correlated to better health for her and her whole family, better care for her environment, a higher family income, and more market activity, which means community growth. Sometimes we forget that women are linked to every aspect of society, as I sang this week in the song ''Bread and Roses,'' by Mimi Farina and James Oppenheim: ''As we go marching, marching, we battle too for men.''
<P>
<P>In 25 years of work, women have raised the consciousness of politicians and the media worldwide. We have connected to one another across lines of culture, race, income, and language so that activist women anywhere now know they are not alone in their struggle.
<P>
<P>Legions of young women are in New York with us, and while we may see the world's 3 billion people under 25 chiefly as the future, for them the future is now. They must have the education, health care, and rights today that will let them make responsible choices about work, childbearing, and caring for each other tomorrow. Women are not only on the agenda, we have changed the agenda so that it has no boundaries of age or place. This is something really new.
<P>
<P>What we have to do now is make the promises of Beijing a reality. We must reinforce the good work that UN agencies such as UNICEF are doing for women and children worldwide, and we must reaffirm the US commitment to international aid programs. How else will we dare to call ourselves the leaders of the world?
<P>
<P>Women are going to reshape the planet during this century. The only question is how quickly it will happen. I expect to be surprised again soon.
