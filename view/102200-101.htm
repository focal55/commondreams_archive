Twenty years ago, the state and national attitude toward the death
penalty was overwhelmingly favorable. Victims' rights groups,
prosecutorial associations, peace-officer unions and conservative law
professors all held that rehabilitation was a flop and criminals must be
punished to the max. This was after state Sen. George Deukmejian had
collected legislative support to restore the death penalty in California,
following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that there were conditions under
which capital punishment could be lawfully applied. By 1986, support for
the ultimate penalty reached an all-time high.
<p>That support is falling. In fact, as one expert puts it, "For 20
years, no one would touch the thing. Now, among the public, and
particularly, among the politicians, opposition has almost become
respectable."
<p>What has changed? The poll numbers, for one thing. As of this year,
popular support for the penalty has dropped dramatically. According to a
January poll by the Public Policy Institute of California, this state's
population is split on the issue, with 47% opposing and 49% supporting
the death penalty. A July Field poll found support in California dropping
from 85% to 63% since the penalty's reintroduction. "That's a major hit
for us," says Mike Farrell, founder and head of Death Penalty Focus, an
anti-death-penalty group. More impressive is that, according to the same
poll, three of four Californians now question the punishment's fairness
and would support a moratorium until DNA testing and other forms of
review could be done. Even 62% of polled Republicans agreed to the
moratorium proposal.
<p>Fairness is the key issue behind the change of heart on the death
penalty. Twenty years ago, the country had just been through a decade of
lurid serial killings, beginning with Charles Manson. The overall crime
rate was rapidly rising. The death penalty was the sine qua non of the
tough-on-crime movement, and Hollywood responded with a series of movies
featuring freelance executioners, who, as portrayed by Charles Bronson
and Clint Eastwood, never killed the wrong guy. Soon, most Americans, in
and out of law enforcement, seemed to feel that the legal system also
knew a murderer whenever it tried one. In California, it was hard to get
elected to statewide office, or in the case of Chief Justice Rose Bird
and two of her colleagues, to continue to hold office unless you heartily
supported the supreme penalty.
<p>Nowadays, though, whether the death penalty is humane or moral is less
an issue than whether it's fairly administered, something rarely
considered in the Dirty Harry era. Ironically, the long-growing, popular
distrust of government that was, along with tougher penalties, widely
associated with the conservatism of the Ronald Reagan era seems linked to
the new doubts about the death penalty. If you can't trust the government
to run Amtrak at a profit, how can you trust courts to truly ascertain
guilt in every capital case?
<p>Although California has, with more than 560 condemned individuals, the
largest death-row population in the nation, the real breakthroughs in the
reassessment of the death penalty began elsewhere. Particularly important
was a landmark Northwestern University study in 1998. The study revealed
the inconsistent, not to say occasionally sloppy, jurisprudence
widespread in capital-crime convictions in Illinois. One man, Anthony
Porter, had spent 15 years on death row before his innocence was proved
by the efforts, in part, of journalism students. Thirteen death-penalty
convictions had been overturned in 20 years, compared with 12 people
executed, a ratio that strongly suggested there was something wrong with
how the defendants had been convicted. These findings helped persuade the
state's GOP governor, George Ryan, to declare a two-year fact-finding
moratorium on executions over the objections of the Illinois legislature.
<p>Last month, a New York Times survey again questioned, in a comparison
of death-penalty versus non-death-penalty states, whether the punishment
even deterred crime. Meanwhile, DNA testing has become generally accepted
as conclusive in identifying suspects. According to one federal report,
28 rape convictions have been overturned since DNA tests came into use.
<p>So far, there has been no movement in the California Legislature to
seek a moratorium on executions. But Gov. Gray Davis, perhaps the state's
most pro-death-penalty elected Democrat, recently signed into law a bill,
by state Sen. John Burton, that permits DNA testing on behalf of
convicted criminals.
<p>Perhaps the most newsworthy event in the movement to stop executions
until the system can be thoroughly reviewed was Texas Gov. George W.
Bush's 30-day stay of the execution of convicted killer Ricky McGinn.
Bush previously had signed 131 death warrants, giving each case about 15
minutes of consideration, according to one news account. Although McGinn
was executed, Bush's campaign-season clemency showed that even on the
Republican side, judicial killing is losing its appeal.
<p>In his conclusions to the Northwestern study, Attorney Leigh B. Bienen
argued that "The quality of justice in the trial and appeal cases in
Illinois is of a deplorably low standard." California's death-row
defenders contend that the state's court system is fair when
administering the punishment. But even if this were true, the federal
appeal process has been recently encumbered with a law that forbids
review of cases.
<p>Meanwhile, as tales of corrupt judges, sleeping defense attorneys,
technicality-based appeal denials and barricaded avenues of appeal pile
up, according to one expert, "More and more people are going to look at
this and say 'Hey, this is troubling.' "
<p>That should mean trouble for California's 23-year-old death penalty.
