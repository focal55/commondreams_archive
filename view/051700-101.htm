The
                attack began after Matt Drudge published the
                email addresses of 300 &quot;media stars and
                campaign insiders&quot; accidentally disclosed by
                error when campaign worker Karen Dunn failed to
                send them as blind copies.                
<p>With
                his usual precision, Matt Drudge wrote that
                &quot;Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign released
                the e-mail addresses&quot; and that &quot;a
                software glitch nearly crippled the campaign's
                e-mail alert system.&quot; </p>
<p>According
                to Drudge, the email glitch was a
                &quot;nightmare&quot; for the Clinton campaign.
                People are outraged and the Hillary campaign is
                in big trouble, Matt scowled darkly, producing
                one anonymous outraged source. </p>
<p>After
                Drudge's story, however, the list was posted in
                freerepublic.com, a Conservative forum. The
                Clinton contacts are now receiving tons of hate
                mail and other mail bomb nasty tricks. I queried
                the 300 names last night (thereby adding one more
                unsolicited message to their misery) and am now
                receiving replies. </p>

                newshawk Pierre Bourque <a
                href="mailto:pierre@achilles.net">pierre@achilles.net</a> reported
                &quot;being bombarded by emails from just about
                every wacko political voice on the
                continent.&quot; </p>
<p>WABC's
                talk radio host Lynn Samuels <a
                href="mailto:lynnsamuels@hotmail.com">lynnsamuels@hotmail.com</a> told me: </p>
<p>&quot;I
                was signed up for 120 email news letters. I have
                received five or six confirmations from an
                x-rated porn post card site for dirty cards I
                have allegedly sent to heaven only knows who. I
                also have gotten 50 or 60 nasty anti-Clinton
                messages from the from nuts. </p>
<p>&quot;I
                was not mad at Hillary's campaign. it was just a
                dumb mistake. Drudge was the one who made it a
                real pain in the neck by making the list
                accessible to the nut element. It is an annoyance
                so far, not a tragedy. </p>
<p>&quot;Check
                out freerepublic.com and see their plans for
                spamming us all and totally screwing up our
                email. They are the culprits.&quot; </p>
<p>I
                inspected the forum and found messages
                threatening or reporting email attacks and urging
                others to do the same, with instructions on
                technique. In two messages, the list has been
                cleaned up for easy email spamming. </p>
<p>The
                freerepublic.com forum is filled with full-text
                articles from national and local media. A
                disclaimer calls this &quot;fair use.&quot; I
                guess it's all fair use and free speech --
                publishing the e-mail addresses, running rotten
                tricks -- but it smacks of terrorism to me. The
                love bug was a Third World college prank. What
                happens when professionals decide to bring down a
                political opponent's campaign structure at a
                crucial point, say just before a major debate or
                mass event? </p>
<p>Ponder
                this, concerned Internet viewers. </p>

                off here at Hillary Media Stars Central, we have

<p>&gt;Hello:
                I do not cover Hillary Clinton or the issues that
                you care about. </p>
<p>I'm
                not trying to tell you anything. I'm doing a
                column on it and asking for your comments. This
                makes you even more interesting for the case at
                hand. I've received some great replies to my
                poll, but this is the best yet! You're not even
                on the Hillary beat. And you are receiving her
                adrenalin alerts. Then you get on the goonball
                firing line. Next people like me are asking you
                how you feel about this. </p>
<p>You
                can see how this is going to look at
                http://cafecancun.com/hillary.htm Give me about
                an hour or so to get this up. </p>
<p>&gt;Would
                you please be so kind as to take my off your
                email lists? </p>
<p>No
                problem. Just let me know if you want to be
                informed when the piece is published, as you are
                now in it. Many thanks for the help. Absolutely
                beyond great. My point exactly. </p>

<p>More
                things to ponder. Why am I not interested in
                these issues? Did I receive a form letter? Of
                course. Is this all a Turing test? We'll talk
                about that in the next installment of The Journal of the Absurd.
