Trailing 
          in the polls and struggling to counter George W. Bush's "new kind of 
          Republican'' appeal, Al Gore has chosen a novel approach to the vice 
          presidential selection process. He has tapped as his running mate a 
          man who is the closest thing the Democratic Party has to a Republican.
        
<P align="left">This 
          is not to say that Connecticut U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman is a right-wing 
          fanatic, an evil player or some sort of fifth columnist sneaking into 
          the Democratic fold. No, not at all. Joe Lieberman is a principled man 
          who has shown some courage over the years, displayed an admirable commitment 
          to his Orthodox Jewish faith and earned a reputation as a thoughtful 
          legislator.</P>
<P align="left">But 
          he is a conservative.</P>
<P align="left">In 
          12 years in the Senate, Lieberman has compiled a record that places 
          him well to the right of his own party, and even to the right of moderate 
          Republicans. He has supported every aspect of Wall Street's free trade 
          agenda. He backs Star Wars nuclear missile initiatives. He votes to 
          spend more on the military and less on social welfare programs. He beats 
          the drum for media morality in rhythm with former Reagan appointee William 
          Bennett. And he backs tuition vouchers that would funnel taxpayer dollars 
          to private schools.</P>
<P align="left">Lieberman's 
          ratings from progressive groups that monitor Congress have frequently 
          been dismal. In 1993, the Council for a Livable World, which backs arms 
          control, gave him a rating of 15 percent -- the worst for a Senate Democrat. 
          In 1997, his rating from the AFL-CIO on votes of concern to working 
          people was just 29 percent -- less than half that of some Republicans.</P>
<P align="left">Lieberman 
          does not always rate that poorly on votes of concern to progressives. 
          And on some issues, such as abortion rights, he is a champion.</P>
<P align="left">But 
          as chair of the Democratic Leadership Council, a corporate-funded group 
          that seeks to make the Democratic Party even more slavishly pro-business, 
          Lieberman has been in the forefront of efforts to blur differences between 
          the Democratic and Republican parties. And he has succeeded to such 
          an extent that, in his first U.S. Senate campaign, he ran with the support 
          of conservative columnist William F. Buckley.</P>
<P align="left">Gore's 
          selection of Lieberman is being hailed as a bold move by the usual coterie 
          of pundits and politicos who put style ahead of substance. That's because, 
          in 1998, the Connecticut senator criticized Bill Clinton's affair with 
          Monica Lewinsky as "immoral.'' In the end, however, Lieberman backed 
          Clinton throughout the president's impeachment fight -- unlike U.S. 
          Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., who never engaged in preachy moralizing, 
          but did recognize the significance of the constitutional questions that 
          were in play.</P>
<P align="left">Lieberman 
          is a "bold'' pick only from a political standpoint. Selecting Lieberman 
          signals that Gore is unconcerned by complaints from progressives, trade 
          unionists and disenchanted voters about the Democratic Party's drift 
          to the right.</P>
<P align="left">At 
          a time when, in key states such as California and Wisconsin, Green Party 
          candidate Ralph Nader is drawing unprecedented support from traditional 
          Democrats, the selection of Lieberman indicates that Gore remains more 
          concerned about appealing to centrist "swing'' voters than to Democrats 
          who might be lost to Nader.</P>
<P align="left">Terry 
          Fritter, a good union man who works at Madison's Oscar Mayer plant, 
          puts it well when he says, "Picking Lieberman plays right into Nader's 
          hands. I just can't figure out why Gore didn't go with Feingold.''</P>
<P align="left">Good 
          question.</P>
<P align="left">If 
          Gore was looking for someone with a reputation for ethics, Feingold 
          would have been a far stronger choice -- especially considering the 
          national reputation that Feingold has acquired as one-half of the McCain-Feingold 
          campaign finance reform team. In addition, Feingold has a solid record 
          with trade unionists, environmentalists and human rights activists -- 
          precisely the people the Gore campaign is losing to Nader.</P>
<P align="left">
If 
          Al Gore had wanted to energize his campaign and put it back on the winning 
          track, he would have picked Russ Feingold. Instead, he picked a decent 
          conservative who, ultimately, brings less to the Democratic ticket than 
          the lamentable Dick Cheney did to the Republicans.
