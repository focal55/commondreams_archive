One year after NATO's bombs   devastated Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic remains firmly entrenched as the   nation's leader. Although he was previously prevented from seeking another   term, a move by the Serbian-controlled parliament earlier this month resulted in a constitutional amendment   allowing Milosevic to run for re-election in January 2001.
<P>
     I was told at a recent international conference in Belgrade that there is   widespread opposition to Milosevic in Yugoslavia. So how can he be confident he   would win a popular election?
<P>
     The bombing, the economic sanctions and Milosevic's war crimes indictment   just weeks before the peace agreement all serve to perpetuate his power. It is   the Serbian people who are being held hostage by NATO's misguided and failed   policy of punishment politics.
<P>
     In 1992, to facilitate the secession of Slovenia, Croatia and later Bosnia   and Kosovo from Yugoslavia, the United States pushed the U.N. Security Council   to impose economic sanctions, a total blockade of the country. Enforced by   military means, the sanctions blockade was policed by the U.S. Navy and its   NATO allies who patrolled the Adriatic Sea and the Danube River, stopping all   vessels possibly bound for Yugoslavia. Air traffic to and from Yugoslavia was   blocked by NATO jets, and a 1995 bombing campaign in Bosnia ended with the   Dayton Accords. The United States has continued to prevent Yugoslavia from   receiving new credit and loans.
<P>
     The 78-day bombing campaign last year was followed by the occupation of   Kosovo, new sanctions and an oil embargo against Yugoslavia. The United States   recently renewed these sanctions, and the European Union tightened trade   sanctions in April.
<P>
     Although responsible for an estimated $4 billion worth of damage to the   infrastructure of Yugoslavia, the West has refused to provide economic   assistance for reconstruction as long as Milosevic remains in power.
<P>
     Yet Milosevic holds a tight reign while his people suffer. Roughly one-third   of the labor force remains unemployed and the United Nations estimates that   about two-thirds of the population lives in poverty. Production levels are way   down, there is no exportation of goods and Yugoslavia is cut off from most   international markets. Credit cards are no longer available to the people. They   cannot send money abroad, and the airport looks deserted. Dozens of bridges and   hundreds of apartments remain damaged by the bombs.
<P>
     Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright made it clear that the United   States would only agree to lift the sanctions if free elections are held. A   recent public opinion poll showed that although two-thirds of Serbs want   political change, 40 percent of eligible voters don't know which party to vote   for in the local and federal elections scheduled later this year.
<P>
     Although life was tough before the sanctions, it has worsened since. Many   Serbs blame the West for the sanctions, as well as the bombing. The indictment   of Milosevic just before the peace accord was signed effectively prevented any   possibility he might step down as part of the agreement. His best chance to   avoid prosecution for war crimes is by staying in power.
<P>
     As the Bay of Pigs tightened Castro's hold on power in Cuba, so did the NATO   bombing solidify nationalist sentiments in favor of the government in   Yugoslavia. And like the U.S. economic blockade of Cuba failed in its goal of   overthrowing Castro, the sanctions against Yugoslavia have failed to unseat   Milosevic. An overthrow requires a strong, organized internal opposition, which   doesn't exist in Yugoslavia, or in Cuba. The sanctions have failed in their   goals and have only punished the people. The West should rethink its policies   in both of these countries.
<P>
