<p>For Americans watching TV news, March began in typical fashion. When five
people were shot on the first day of the month in a town near Pittsburgh,
cable networks swiftly jumped into action. They devoted hour after hour to
the tragedy -- giving viewers plenty of live footage from helicopters,
interviews with terrified eyewitnesses and grim official briefings.
Correspondents functioned much like schizoid ghouls.

	
<p>The television industry is good at deploring bloodshed -- while milking it
to boost ratings. But the hypocrisy only begins there.

	
<p>On the last day of February, the shocking news was that a 6-year-old boy
in Michigan killed a classmate. How would a little boy get the impression
that pointing a gun at someone and pulling the trigger is appropriate
behavior? Not exactly a tough question.

	
<p>But it's too tough for the nation's up-to-the-minute TV journalists --
especially when their jobs involve playing dumb.

	
<p>By now, news programming on television is fully part of this country's
entertainment industry, in more ways than one. The networks that bring us
news are also producing and airing large quantities of TV dramas and
feature movies filled with violence. The offerings frequently dramatize
gunplay but rarely begin to convey the suffering that results from a bullet
tearing through a human body.

	
<p>Media owners don't need to pay for clever dialogue or thoughtful plots
when murder and mayhem are central to the script. Gun-toting stars --
resorting to firearms when all else fails -- are standard on small and big
screens. And even if bloody film extravaganzas don't do well at the box
office in the United States, they're ideal for export: With no need for
adept translation or cross-cultural understanding, movies that rely on
violence tend to make huge profits overseas.

	
<p>Meanwhile, on network news and public affairs programs, the regular
pundits who argue about "gun control" would not dream of advocating for
much tighter control of -- or less spending for -- the big guns deployed by
the Pentagon. And when U.S. missiles or other weapons are being fired in
anger, American advocates of nonviolence (if they're mentioned at all) are
apt to be derided as wimps or naive fools who lack superpower resolve.

	
<p>Does the routine fare on television really affect human behavior? Well, if
it doesn't, the advertising industry is wasting billions of dollars every
season. But of course, those who pay top dollar for commercials understand
full well that kids -- and yes, the rest of us -- are influenced by what's
glamorized on television.

	
<p>"TV and motion picture guns create powerful, unforgettable images that
have had a measurable impact on the shooting world," Guns & Ammo magazine
reported in 1985. Entertainment media -- particularly movies -- have
"significantly influenced America's fascination with guns," according to
Tom Diaz, senior analyst at the Violence Policy Center based in Washington,
D.C.

	
<p>Diaz cites numerous gun-industry sources while documenting that when
specific models of firearms have appeared in hit movies and TV shows, the
sales of those weapons have skyrocketed. An article in American Rifleman
noted that Model 29 of Smith & Wesson's .44 Magnum revolver "enjoyed a
massive burst of popularity in the 1970s when it was featured in 'Dirty
Harry.'"

	
<p>In his 1999 book "Making a Killing: The Business of Guns in America," Diaz
points to "the example set when popular idols use guns to solve disputes or
even just to get their way in an otherwise uncooperative world." He adds:
"It seems fatuous to suppose that such depictions, no matter how
commonplace they are today, have no effect on the attitudes or behavior of
those who, for whatever reason, see movie and television stars as their
role models."

	
<p>Defenders of the media status quo may assert that on-screen dramas do not
affect what people do in the real world. But such claims are flimsy. "It is
well known that the promoters of consumer products from cigarettes and
alcoholic beverages to sneakers and automobiles believe there is an
effect," Diaz writes. "They angle fiercely (and spend a great deal of
money) to 'place' their product for even seconds of exposure in movies or
television shows."

	
<p>The next time TV anchors want to lament the consequences of gun
proliferation, they might try taking the matter up with the executives who
run the networks.
