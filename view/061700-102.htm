BOSTON-There have been questions all 
along about the depth and seriousness of George W. Bush. They have 
been brought into sharp focus now by 
a surprising issue: the way the death 
penalty is administered in Texas. In 
his comments on that subject Governor Bush has defined himself, unforgettably, as shallow and callous.

<p> In his five years as governor of 
Texas, the state has executed 131 
prisoners -- far more than any other 
state. Mr. Bush has lately granted a 
stay of execution for the first time, 
for a DNA test.

<p> In answer to questions about that 
record, Governor Bush has repeatedly said that he has no qualms. "I'm 
confident," he said last February, 
"that every person that has been put 
to death in Texas under my watch 
has been guilty of the crime charged, 
and has had full access to the 
courts."

<p> That defense of the record ignores 
many notorious examples of unfairness in Texas death penalty cases. 
Lawyers have been under the influence of cocaine during the trial, or 
been drunk or asleep. One court dismissed a complaint about a lawyer 
who slept through a trial with the 
comment that courts are not "obligated to either constantly monitor trial 
counsel's wakefulness or endeavor to 
wake counsel should he fall asleep."  

<p> This past week The Chicago Tribune published a compelling report on 
an investigation of all 131 death 
cases in Governor Bush's time. It 
made chilling reading.

<p> In one-third of those cases, the 
report showed, the lawyer who represented the death penalty defendant 
at trial or on appeal had been or was 
later disbarred or otherwise sanctioned. In 40 cases the lawyers presented no evidence at all or only one 
witness at the sentencing phase of 
the trial. 

<p> In 29 cases, the prosecution used 
testimony from a psychiatrist who -- 
based on a hypothetical question 
about the defendant's past -- predicted he would commit future violence. Most of those psychiatrists 
testified without having examined 
the defendant: a practice condemned professionally as unethical.

<p> Other witnesses included one who 
was temporarily released from a 
psychiatric ward to testify, a pathologist who had admitted faking autopsies and a judge who had been reprimanded for lying about his credentials. 

<p> Asked about the Tribune study, 
Governor Bush said, "We've adequately answered innocence or 
guilt" in every case. The defendants, 
he said, "had full access to a fair 
trial."

<p> There are two ways of understanding that comment. Either Governor 
Bush was contemptuous of the facts 
or, on a matter of life and death, he 
did not care.

<p> At the heart of the problem is the 
Texas way of providing lawyers for 
defendants too poor to hire their own, 
as most are in death cases. There is 
no state system. Judges assign lawyers -- often lawyers who have contributed to their election campaigns.

<p> "The State of Texas is a national 
embarrassment in the area of indigent legal services," a committee of 
the State Bar of Texas says in a 
report just approved. Again, Governor Bush has shown no concern 
about this reality. He vetoed a bill, 
passed by the legislature, that would 
have let Texas counties set up a 
limited public defender program for 
the poor.

<p> Capital punishment, long favored 
by a majority of Americans, has 
become a national issue again because of concern about the fairness 
of its administration. Gov. George 
Ryan of Illinois, a Republican, imposed a moratorium on executions in 
that state after 13 men on death row 
were shown to be innocent. Pat Robertson and other conservatives have 
called for a national moratorium. 

<p> The most complete study ever 
done of the death penalty process, by 
Prof. James S. Liebman and others 
at Columbia University, was published the other day. It showed that 
two-thirds of death convictions or 
sentences were upset on appeal for 
such reasons as incompetent defense 
lawyers or prosecutors who bent the 
rules.

<p> To all this George Bush is seemingly indifferent. Or perhaps not entirely. If he were not running for 
president, it is doubtful that he would 
just now have granted his first stay 
of execution. Next week Gary Graham, convicted of murder on the 
testimony of a single witness who 
said she saw him at night from 30 to 
40 feet away, is due to be executed. 
Will Governor Bush care?
