Let's give up some applause for Dick Cheney for affirming in deed,
if not words, that homosexuality is perfectly consistent with traditional
family values. The decision for a Republican candidate for the vice
presidency to have an avowed homosexual at his side through virtually
every hour of his campaign is a bit risky. It means taking on the forces
of intolerance on the right wing of his party, a wing that at one time
included Cheney and, more prominently, his wife.
<p>However, now that Cheney has granted his lesbian daughter a major role
in his campaign, is it not time for the candidate to distance himself
from a Republican platform that would deny equal rights protection to all
homosexuals? Evidently homosexuals can be reliable workers, and it should
be illegal to discriminate against folks like Mary Cheney simply because
of their sexual orientation.
<p>"I think of her as sort of my aide-de-camp," candidate Cheney said in
paying tribute to his daughter Mary in an interview last week with the
New York Times: "She keeps all the paper flow coming to me; everything
sort of funnels through her. More than that, she knows me. She has no
qualms about telling me when she thinks I'm wrong, or when I need to do
something. Mary will always come in and lay it right on me. My experience
over the years is that's invaluable in a campaign. Everybody wants a good
relationship with the candidate--not everybody will level with you. Mary
levels with you."
<p>One would accept such excellent skills to be valuable to any employer
not biased by prejudice against gays. Yet anti-discriminatory laws are
needed precisely because not all employers have had the opportunity to
learn from their own offspring that homosexuals are indeed normal people.
<p>Given that Mary Cheney is proving so valuable in the campaign, would
Cheney, the person who'd be next in line to become commander in chief of
the armed forces if George Bush wins, still stick to his oft-expressed
view that homosexuals not be allowed to serve in the military? Would his
daughter be more inclined than heterosexuals in the military to undermine
morale by acting in indecorous ways?
<p>The Republican platform declares that homosexuality is "incompatible"
with military service and even stands "united" with the Boy Scouts in
that organization's avowed policy of excluding gays. Does Dick Cheney
believe that the Girl Scouts are amiss in not following the example of
the Boy Scouts, and would he be in favor of excluding his own daughter
from playing a role in that organization?
<p>These questions are not intended to be cute or to pull the candidate's
chain. They go directly to the hypocrisy in which we treat homosexuals as
dangerous freaks unless we happen to be friends with, or related to, one.
<p>Ignorance is the essential ingredient in hate. Dick Cheney probably
didn't know his daughter was gay when he compiled one of the most
viscously anti-gay voting records in Congress. He was one of only 13
representatives in 1988 who voted against funding for AIDS testing and
research at a time when that was conveniently thought to be an
exclusively gay disease, and one of only 29 that same year to vote
against a Hate Crimes Statistics Act.
<p>Perhaps he would vote differently now that his daughter, whose
judgment he trusts in all important matters, has determined that she is
indeed a homosexual. Should a woman of such sound thought and strong
moral principles not be the best judge of her essential sexual nature? Or
should we continue to be guided by the bigotry of legislators and
religious proselytizers? It is still against the law in Texas to perform
homosexual acts; does Mary Cheney have to retreat to Colorado to legally
make love?
<p>Yes, it would be best if such decisions could be left in the private
realm, as the Cheneys now ask in refusing to discuss their daughter's
sexuality. But it's too late for such niceties because the hate-mongers
and their respectable allies in the Republican Party have for decades
exploited homosexuality as a hot political issue. It is they who have
thwarted every legislative effort to grant to homosexuals the same rights
afforded all other citizens.
<p>One can understand why Mary Cheney does not now want to become a
poster woman for gay rights. But she is, by her father's witness, living
proof that being gay is perfectly compatible with leading a moral,
public-spirited and fully enriched family values life. She is a role
model that even the political right might be forced to respect.
