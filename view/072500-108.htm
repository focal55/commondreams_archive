PHILADELPHIA 
              -- Rebecca Ewing can't figure out what the Republican National Committee 
              was thinking when it decided to hold the party's 2000 convention 
              in Philadelphia. "It's surprising that they're coming to Philadelphia, 
              really surprising. I guess they didn't know that people here are 
              this organized -- and this angry,'' says the volunteer with one 
              of America's most remarkable activist groups, ACT-UP Philadelphia.
<P>Philly 
              ACT-UP is one of dozens of groups busily organizing to greet the 
              July 31-Aug. 3 GOP gathering with what promises to be some of the 
              most energized convention protests since Democrats gathered in Chicago 
              in 1968. Marches backed by labor unions, anti-poverty campaigners, 
              death penalty foes and supporters of national health care promise 
              to bring thousands of activists into the streets of Philadelphia, 
              and police fear that direct-action protests next week could rival 
              last fall's protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle.
<P>In 
              fact, Philly ACT-UP played a role in organizing both the Seattle 
              protests and this spring's A16 protests in Washington against the 
              World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. And now, amazingly 
              to the Philadelphia activists, the Grand Old Party is coming to 
              Philly ACT-UP's hometown.
<P>Texas 
              Gov. George W. Bush and his Republican minions -- a group that includes 
              the GOP presidential candidate's pal "Tommy T,'' Wisconsin Gov. 
              Tommy Thompson -- have little experience with the sort of in-your-face 
              activism that Philly ACT-UP has perfected. The 12-year-old, all-volunteer 
              organization focuses on local, national and international concerns 
              in an all-fronts battle to guarantee that governments and corporations 
              put AIDS research and care ahead of profits.
<P>It's 
              "Gore Zaps'' -- raucous protests at Al Gore's Democratic primary 
              campaign stops -- forced the vice president to address U.S. policies 
              on distribution of AIDS drugs in Africa. This spring, Philly ACT-UP 
              brought the single largest contingent to the A16 protests in Washington, 
              and early in July it dispatched a delegation of eight activists 
              to organize protests at the international AIDS conference in South 
              Africa.
<P>"Philly 
              ACT-UP rocks,'' says Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's 
              Global Trade Watch. Wallach worked with the Philadelphia group to 
              help organize the Seattle protests; and Global Trade Watch and Philly 
              ACT-UP were close allies in the struggle against the Wall Street-sponsored 
              "NAFTA for Africa'' trade bill. "I wish every city had a group this 
              committed -- and this creative,'' Wallach says of Philly ACT-UP.
<P>In 
              coming days, that commitment and creativity will be directed toward 
              upsetting George W. Bush's coronation. ACT-UP will bring major contingents 
              to a July 31 March for Economic Human Rights being organized by 
              the Kensington Welfare Rights Union and to a July 29 Ad Hoc Committee 
              to Defend Health Care march being organized by health care professionals 
              under the banner: "For Our Patients, Not for Profit.''
<P>These 
              are just two of the dozens of marches, rallies and direct-action 
              protests designed to challenge the policies of Republicans, which 
              will be summed up in a platform drafted by Tommy Thompson and a 
              committee of party bigs. Though it is thick with feel-good rhetoric, 
              the Thompson platform maintains the militant right-wing economic 
              and social policies that have lost the party the last two presidential 
              elections.
<P>And 
              Philly ACT-UP and other groups want to make sure Republicans know 
              that, while those policies may be popular with the party's corporate 
              givers, they don't have much appeal on the streets of Philadelphia.
<P>To 
              make sure the crowds in the streets know what they're up against, 
              ACT-UP members are setting up teach-ins for dozens of local drug 
              and alcohol recovery, AIDS service and gay and lesbian youth groups. 
              "We're going to the people who have never shown up for a demonstration,'' 
              Ewing says of the group's intensive grass-roots organizing. "We 
              provide them with background on the issues, talk about how to demonstrate 
              and about why it matters to be there.''
<P>
In 
              addition to marching, expect Philly ACT-UP to "zap'' Republicans 
              with high-profile interruptions of the politics of complacency. 
              "We won't let them rest easy,'' says Ewing, whose group invites 
              prospective members to "come kick butt with us.''
