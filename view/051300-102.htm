GETTYSBURG, Pa. - The great Civil  War battle fought here has been over for  more than 135 years. But the Gettysburg  battlefield is about to change profoundly -  and to get even more bloody. 
<P>In the next several years, along with the  exhibits on the weapons of the battle, the  personalities who led it and the sharpshooters who fought it, Gettysburg and the rest of  the Civil War battle sites are going to discuss a subject that they almost entirely suppress: slavery. 
<P>Abraham Lincoln, whose brief battlefield commemorative delivered here is perhaps the best-known  speech in the English language, may have fought the  Civil War on the pretext of preserving the Union -  but he recognized that all Americans knew slavery  &quot;was somehow the cause of war.&quot; But from Vicksburg  in Mississippi to Manassas in Virginia, the Civil War  battlefields have managed to avoid the unavoidable  for generations, assembling displays and interpretive  programs that focus on the conduct of the war but  not its cause. 
<P>That's about to change, thanks to Rep. Jesse L.  Jackson Jr., a Chicago Democrat who inserted language into an appropriations bill requiring the National Park Service to confront slavery directly at the  Civil War sites. 
<P>The willingness to address sharpshooting but not  slavery at the battlefields is an example of the way  American history, a chronicle of the struggle to establish and expand human rights, has become antiseptic  in the telling. But Jackson, son of a civil-rights activist  and member of the House Appropriations Committee, has been visiting Civil War sites, wondering how  slavery had been bleached from the battles.
<P>When he confronted Park Service guides, he was  told that including slavery in the displays would require nothing less than an act of Congress. Within  months, Jackson delivered that act. 
<P>Earlier this week, in its struggle to comply with the  Jackson provision, the Park Service gathered scores  of battlefield officials and guides in Ford's Theater in  Washington and invited Jackson to lecture them.  (&quot;There's more to Gettysburg than Pickett's Charge,&quot;  he said.) The Park Service also assembled a group of  distinguished historians to conduct a seminar on the  nature and significance of slavery and to prepare battlefield interpreters for what Ira Berlin of  the University of Maryland called the task  of &quot;integrating the history of slavery into  history's sacred grounds.&quot;
<P>That will take some doing. Although  Berlin argued in his remarks that &quot;American history cannot be understood without  the institution of slavery,&quot; the Civil War  sites have been slow to change. A report  from a conference of battlefield managers  held two years ago in Nashville found that the Park Service approaches battlefields  the way veterans do when they visit the battle sites of  their youth. &quot;Like the returning veterans, we focus  our interpretation on the experience of soldiers.&quot;
<P>That's certainly true at Gettysburg. &quot;We have had  a tendency to concentrate mostly on the military tactics and battles themselves,&quot; said John Latschar, the  Gettysburg superintendent. &quot;We can appeal to a  whole lot more people and provide a whole lot better  understanding of what the battles are all about, if we  put these battles into context and describe why they  were fought.&quot;
<P>Gettysburg hasn't yet adjusted its museum programs. But Latschar says ranger programs this summer will emphasize the causes of the war, the meaning of the Gettysburg Address, the life of the common soldier and the impact on the home front when  the breadwinners left to fight. &quot;We need to put a human face on these soldiers,&quot; said Latschar. &quot;The time  is right.&quot;
<P>Meanwhile, the Park Service will hold a two-week  seminar for &quot;front-line National Park Service interpreters from Civil War sites&quot; designed to broaden the  exhibits and programs and to examine the social and  economic context of the conflict - not only slavery,  but also industrialization, demographics and the  broad sweep of Western history.
<P>Not that there's unanimous support for this approach. At the Ford's Theater seminar, a Park Service interpreter asked what right Jackson, who is not  a historian, had to impose his views on the historians  who do work for the government. Jackson said that  the newly passed act of Congress represented &quot;the  will of the people.&quot; He added: &quot;An act of Congress  created your job.&quot;
