Everywhere we turn, new technologies for communication have us 
surrounded. The online sensations of just a few years ago are now ancient 
cyber-history, and the process continues to accelerate. The computer on 
most desks seemed to be cutting-edge when it arrived -- but now is already 
on the verge of obsolescence.

<p>When we decide that yesterday's breakthrough purchase has become 
today's outmoded albatross, we may gripe about the hassle and expense of 
upgrading to new systems. Sometimes, no doubt, we buy more for reasons of 
consumer vanity than practical functionality.

<p>But the common determination to keep up with the (Digital) Joneses 
isn't mere status-seeking. As the Internet continues to gain momentum, 
we're apt to believe -- for good reasons -- that we must not be left 
behind. In professional and financial realms, those who lack access to the 
latest in techno-communication are likely to find themselves at a distinct 
disadvantage.

<p>Wild as the last few years of computerized innovation may have 
seemed, the floodgates of products have only begun to open. Quickly 
multiplying, a wide range of permutations are available, blending such 
formerly separate entities as PCs, televisions, radios, CDs, videos, 
pagers, fax machines and cell phones.

<p>Each day, news reports and advertisements trumpet the latest 
glories of cyberspace. Certainly, large numbers of people are benefiting 
from the swift correspondence and vast informational storehouse provided by 
e-mail and the World Wide Web. Americans are indebted to new media 
technologies -- but also, increasingly, in debt.

<p>The costs of new high-tech products -- and related offerings such 
as online service, broadband connections, cable television and satellite TV 
-- all add up. For the average household budget, those kinds of expenses 
scarcely existed a decade or two ago. Today, they're likely to amount to 
thousands of dollars per year.

<p>The cycle feeds itself. The more we get, the more uses we're apt 
to see for what we don't (yet) have. Constantly, the new media stoke the 
fires of consuming desire. The spiffiest, most heavily promoted and most 
trafficked websites encourage us to avail ourselves of marvels like 
streaming video, web TV and countless other latest things. All we've got to 
do is keep wanting and keep buying.

<p>This pattern, according to routine media coverage, is marvelous 
progress -- to be fueled and applauded. The customary hype is filled with 
gee-whiz wonder. But we should be asking whether this business-driven 
avalanche of consumer technology products is a major factor in spiraling 
personal finance woes.

<p>At a time when pundits constantly tell us that "the economy" is 
robust, the cash flow in plenty of homes is actually worse than ever. 
"Bingeing on a seemingly endless stream of easy credit, America's middle 
class is spending more and saving less than ever before," the Wall Street 
Journal reported on Sept. 28. "And yet in many cases, the inevitable 
hangover takes years to develop, precisely, say some in the credit 
industry, because it's so easy these days to postpone the reckoning simply 
by borrowing more."

<p>In late September, the Commerce Department announced another drop 
of the savings rate in the United States -- to the lowest level since 1959, 
when the agency began to collect such data. "With spending outpacing 
income, the amount of after-tax income left over after spending fell to a 
negative 0.4 percent," said a news dispatch from Reuters.

<p>An economist at Wells Fargo Bank commented: "One concern I have is 
that consumers are highly leveraged, and when the economy slows and 
interest rates spike some day, it's going to really hurt consumers."

<p>As communications technologies keep proliferating, the direct 
costs are just a fraction of the added burden on households. Pervasive in 
many lives, the new media are great at urging us to spend money on an 
ever-increasing array of glitz.

<p>A new-media industry analyst sounded gleeful on CNN the other day 
when he explained that computers will become more and more like 
televisions, and vice versa. It is a huckster's vision of technological 
heaven. What it does for -- and to -- most of us is another matter.
