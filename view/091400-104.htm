President Clinton is back from Colombia. His decision to waive 
              conditions imposed by Congress on his $1.3 billion Colombian aid 
              package was an admission of the human rights disaster in Colombia 
              and U.S. diplomatic bankruptcy. The Colombian government has failed 
              to comply with six of the seven human rights criteria Congress demanded. 
              Yet hundreds of millions of dollars will start flowing to the army 
              anyway.
            
<p>The waiver was necessary because, like every Colombian government 
              since the '50s, President Andr&eacute;s Pastrana's administration 
              is unable to make its generals obey the Colombian constitution and 
              disengage from their paramilitary allies. Nevertheless, as a 
            White House official told an AP reporter recently, "You don't hold 
            up the major objective to achieve the minor." The U.S. government's 
            priority objective, explained Bryan Hittle of the White House Office 
            of National Drug Control Policy, was to "get the aid flowing" to help 
            Colombian authorities stop guerrilla violence that interferes with 
            U.S. fumigation of drug crops. Clinton's waiver has achieved that 
            priority. 
            
<p>
            
            Most Colombians do not buy Clinton's "counternarcotics" objective. 
              They believe the United States has embarked on a long-term strategy 
              to defeat the guerrillas and impose a "Pax Americana" along the 
              lines of the 10 years of U.S.-supported carnage in El Salvador. 
              Today in Putumayo, a major coca-growing area in southern Colombia, 
              U.S. special forces are training Colombian troops who will soon 
              spearhead an offensive to drive the FARC guerrillas out of their 
              southern stronghold and make the coca fields safe for aerial fumigation. 
              Two hundred thousand peasant farmers and coca pickers also live 
              in Putumayo. They will be caught in the crossfire. The guerrillas 
              are arming the farmers to defend themselves from anticipated attacks 
              by a local paramilitary force, 800 strong, which competes with the 
              FARC for control of the drug crops. The paramilitaries, whose luxurious 
              headquarters are located in a villa a five-minute drive from the 
              local army base, are reportedly paying farmers to inform on those 
              planning resistance. Putumayo is gearing up for civil war. The U.N. 
              High Commissioner for Refugees has alerted Ecuador, which shares 
              a border with the region, to prepare to receive 30,000 to 40,000 
              refugees when the fighting and the assassinations begin.</p>
<p>Clinton's visit put the presidential seal on "Plan Colombia," which 
              mixes the incompatible aims of counterinsurgency warfare and economic 
              development. Conceived by the Colombian government to raise funds 
              from drug-consuming countries for alternative development, Plan 
              Colombia was then co-opted by the White House and State Department. 
              The redrafted "made-in-the-U.S.A." version has provided the rationale 
              for military aid and permitted the United States to enter the war 
              on the FARC under the cover of the war on drugs.</p>
<p>The plan has been less successful in its second objective: to gain 
              international backing and financial support for U.S.-Colombian policy. 
              The international community is unenthusiastic about investing in 
              development schemes that one European diplomat recently described 
              as "cleaning up the mess that Americans will make." Among EU members, 
              only Spain and Britain are on board, and in the Western hemisphere, 
              only Argentina's support can be counted on. Colombia's Andean neighbors 
              are scared. They are militarizing their borders and buying arms 
              they cannot afford to try to protect themselves from Plan Colombia's 
              fallout.</p>
<p>Ironically, for a politician as driven as Clinton to enhance the 
              image of his presidency, Plan Colombia risks leaving a stain on 
              his legacy and presents a poisoned chalice to his successor. Far 
              from helping Colombia "strengthen its democracy," as Clinton claims, 
              his policies have done the opposite. Military aid has strengthened 
              guerrilla hardliners and convinced the elites they need not worry 
              about the economic and social reforms necessary for peace. The Pentagon's 
              alliance with an army that retains its links with paramilitary thugs 
              has encouraged the expansion of the their alliance. While the U.S. 
              Embassy cites statistics about the number of Colombian soldiers 
              who have passed U.S.-sponsored "human rights" courses, Colombian 
              civilians are being terrorized, driven into exile and slaughtered 
              with impunity. </p>
<p>However appalling the methods of the FARC guerrillas, it is not 
              left-wing terrorism, but the rapid rise in the political power of 
              the extreme right and the military heft of the paramilitaries that 
              now present the greatest risk to the elected Colombian government. 
              Only Washington has the political clout with the Colombian military 
              to insist that the generals cease fraternizing with assassins, order 
              their forces to arrest paramilitary leaders and begin protecting 
              civilians from their savagery. Alarmingly, Washington appears to 
              be moving in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>According to recent reports in the media, the DEA offered to subsidize 
              notorious paramilitary leader Carlos Casta&ntilde;o in return for 
              his pledge to combat drug traffickers. This has renewed suspicions 
              that, unbeknownst to the U.S. Congress and Colombian government, 
              U.S. intelligence is involved in covert operations in Colombia's 
              civil war. The story, as revealed by Casta&ntilde;o on national 
              Colombian television in July, was confirmed the next day by an ex-DEA 
              agent, who told the Miami Herald he acted as translator at meetings 
              between U.S. operatives, Colombian narcos and members of Casta&ntilde;o's 
              paramilitaries where U.S. government support for Casta&ntilde;o 
              was discussed. </p>
<p>The Clinton administration claims the allegations are "a fantasy." 
              Yet the State Department has refused to include Casta&ntilde;o's 
              paramilitary group, United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, on its 
              official list of terrorist organizations; the Justice Department 
              incomprehensibly has failed to demand Casta&ntilde;o's extradition, 
              even after he publicly admitted five months ago that 70 percent 
              of his funding comes from drugs. These disturbing facts have fueled 
              Colombian fears that, as in Nicaragua and El Salvador a decade ago, 
              the U.S. government has made a strategic counterinsurgency alliance 
              with drug-trafficking killers to defeat the FARC. Colombians also 
              say it is inconceivable the army would collude so blatantly with 
              the paramilitaries without at least tacit U.S. approval. Their conviction 
              has been reinforced by Clinton's signature on the human rights waiver.</p>
<p>After Clinton grafted military aid onto Plan Colombia, a coalition 
              representing the 37 Colombian human rights and humanitarian organizations--the 
              people whose collaboration is crucial for the Plan's development 
              component--rejected any funding from the U.S. aid package. Citing 
              "ethical and political difficulties in receiving aid from this program," 
              they told Clinton his money was tainted. The NGO leaders, representing 
              the spectrum of the Colombian peace movement, say his policies will 
              wreck the peace process, escalate an unwinnable civil war and risk 
              driving Colombian drugs, refugees and violence over Colombia's borders. 
              They have asked European leaders, who will meet this month in Bogot&aacute; 
              to finalize their response to Plan Colombia, to withhold their support 
              and become actively involved in the urgent search for alternatives. 
            </p>
<p>This is a message that needs to be heard loud and clear by both 
              Gore and Bush. Their advisers should start paying attention to this 
              major foreign policy crisis shaping up in the Southern Hemisphere. 
              They need to listen to other Colombian voices--the burgeoning exile 
              community would be a good place to start--and, in concert with regional 
              and international allies and the active involvement of Colombian 
              civil society leaders, begin the search for saner alternatives. 
              There is still time--but barely--to protect the next administration 
              from being dragged into a long-term, multi-billion-dollar quagmire 
              and embroiled in an uncontainable regional war.</p>
