<p>The news media, always prone to navel gazing, grows more obsessed with itself every day. The scrutiny of “new media” is just the latest form of this neurosis.
<p>THE SIGNS OF THIS obsession are everywhere. The imminent launch of Kurt Andersen and Michael Hirshschorn’s “Powerful Media” Web site is being covered with the awed, hushed tones of an Apollo moon launch. The perfectly nice, but profoundly unexciting Jim Romesko is profiled at length in trendy New York Magazine, for no apparent reason aside from the fact that his popular Web site helps journalists keep au courant with the doings and undoings of other journalists. 
<p>C-SPAN is filled with panel after panel assessing the value or potential danger of the most recent threat to the sanctity of news. First it came from Rush Limbaugh and Talk Radio; next came Matt Drudge and what we all agreed to call “cybergossip.” Next came 24-7 cable-TV with its never-ending, sex and slash-driven news cycle. Now the problem has become more generalized — and perhaps more ubiquitous. It’s called “new media,” and nobody knows quite what it is, but everyone in what is now called “old media” is scared by it.
<p>Whether it turns out to be a new dawn or an impending apocalypse, there’s no getting away from it anymore. AOL/TimeWarner can black out mighty Disney/ABC until such time as the other guy gets even nastier. Newsweek holds its biggest story of the decade but ends up releasing it on the Internet two days later. All the major media companies are betting big on the Net to deliver profits well beyond what they have enjoyed in the past, be it in broadcast bandwidths or through cable and satellite TV, but not one of them can explain just how these profits are going to materialize. 
       
<p>YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR ONLINE
<p>But with a few significant exceptions, most of the information or “content” one receives on the Internet is a lot closer to the “eighty percent accurate” that Matt Drudge warned about than the always trustworthy yours truly. It has become a new cliche of new media that “people won’t pay for content,” but this comes into conflict with an older but certainly no less accurate cliche that in life, you generally get what you pay for. Much of the content provided by “new media” where content is low person on the totem poll when it comes to justifying investments to venture capitalists is iffy at best. Recall that this is a medium where one of its most respected publications hires journalists who lick door-knobs.   
<p>It’s time to bring the quality of “content” in line with the incredible pace of technological advance in a way that honors our values but adapts to the new world. 
<p>I went to a conference recently, sponsored by Chiat and Screaming Media where new and old media types attempted to hash these issues out. While the debates were surprisingly lively, the results were pretty much as one would have expected. New Media types spoke of the value of the “guide on the side” vs. “the sage on the stage.” They argued for “listening” vs. “preaching.” They denied any responsibility for ‘gatekeeping’ and placed their trust, they said, in allowing the marketplace to develop its own sanctions against untrustworthy sources.
<p>The “old media” types did not like what they heard. CNN president Richard Kaplan and Brill Media Guy Steve Brill ganged up on APB Online COO and co-founder Mark Sauter for linking his site to a government list of alleged convicted pedophiles without taking any responsibility for ascertaining the truth of the accusations himself. (“It’s the government,” retorted Sorter in his own defense. “The government!” quipped moderator and TV journalist John Hockenberry. That’s who killed the Rosenbergs.”)
<p>Dan Rather made a fair point upon which almost all agreed when he noted that while the interactivity and customization of new media was an “undeniable plus,” what we sacrificed was the notion of a “national hearth” that three network television news programs had once offered. Yes, but television producer Phil Rosenthal made the undeniable point, that hearths aside, “television isn’t very good.” Rarely does anyone get up from watching two hours of TV and say, ‘Boy was that rewarding. Boy was that fulfilling.” The explosion in media technology-from broadcast quality video cameras to streaming media of all kinds on the net-will open up the media to new voices and visions to a degree unseen since the invention of the printing press. Much of it undoubtedly will be crap, but to those with the time and ability to search out the best, resources and rewards will be equally rich and unprecedented.   
<p>As an old media type who makes much of my living in new media, this is a time to be both frightened and excited. What else can we do but jump into the water and dogpaddle as best as we can. The world is changing too fast to countenance our doubts and disclaimers. It’s time to bring the quality of “content” in line with the incredible pace of technological advance in a way that honors our values but adapts to the new world. The danger is turning out to be less that Matt Drudge will infect the rest of the media-though — he has — but that the giants who already own everything and are taking control of the Internet will shut down the revolution before it can fulfill its creative promise. It’s a hell of challenge, but no less of an opportunity. Just try imagining the last few centuries without the printing press.
