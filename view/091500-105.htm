President Clinton's renewed efforts to revive the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations focussed attention  once again on what is conventionally held
to be the key sticking point in the talks: the future of Jerusalem.

<p>But for many Palestinians this focus on Jerusalem suggests that other
issues equally vital to a just peace are being neglected, or worse, may
have been quietly settled on Israel's terms. Most prominent among these is
the right of return for Palestinian refugees. It is to draw attention to
this issue that thousands of Palestinians and their allies are rallying in
Washington DC on September 16.

<p>When Israel was created, 800,000 Palestinians fled or were deliberately
forced from their homes. Over four hundred towns and villages were
destroyed or depopulated, and tens of thousands of houses, stores, farms
and other property were taken over by Israel. Today there are 3.7 million
Palestinians registered by the UN as refugees, including survivors and
their children. Over one million of them are spread among 59 refugee camps
in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and Gaza. 

The refugees' right to return has long been recognized by the
international community: the UN General Assembly has reaffirmed resolution
194 every year since 1948, stating that, "refugees wishing to return to
their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to
do so at the earliest practicable date." Those who choose not to return
are to be given compensation. The US voted for this resolution every year
until 1993. Since that time, the Clinton administration has consistently
tried to take the Palestinian issue out of the hands of the UN, and put it
into the Israeli-Palestinian boxing ring of "direct negotiations," where
might counts for everything and right for nothing.

<p>Israel has consistently rejected the right of return, arguing that it
bears no responsibility for the fate of the refugees, and that any
substantial return would dilute the "Jewish character" of the state. But,
this essentially racist reasoning should not be acceptable in the twenty
first century. 

<p>Israel is only able to remain a "democracy" with non-Jews as second class
citizens as long as Jews can always outvote the non-Jews. As the number of
Palestinians grows (and it is growing fast), Israel will inevitably face
the choice between genuine democracy or becoming a fully-fledged apartheid
"democracy."  It is in order to maintain the Jewish majority that
left-wing Zionists so fervently support the creation of a separate
Palestinian state, and right-wing governments never dared to annex most of
the occupied West Bank, with all its inconvenient non-Jewish population.

<p>But preventing Palestinian refugees from returning home will not long
postpone the day when Palestinians and Israelis are equal in number
between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. And if it was ever
viable, partition--the creation of two states, with the Israeli state,
inevitably dominant--is even less so today. Yasir Arafat and his cronies
have a vested interest in creating a "state" which they can rule, but for
many Palestinians, such a state is increasingly unappealing. The price
that not even Yasir Arafat can get away with paying to have this state is
giving up the right of return. The Palestinian and Israeli positions seem
irreconcilable, but they are only so within the narrow US and
Israeli-defined parameters of the "peace process."

<p>In the long run, I am convinced, a single state for Israelis and
Palestinians, is the only just and viable solution. As Eqbal Ahmed pointed
out, we would not have supported the creation of independent black states
in Mississippi and Alabama in lieu of civil rights, so why should such a
solution be any more palatable in Palestine?

<p>The worst nightmare of some Israelis is a mass return of refugees that
would sweep them away. But whether genuine fear, or reckless
scaremongering, this is not what the right of return means. There is, for
example, plenty of room for a substantial number of Palestinians to return
to their homes in the mostly Arab-populated north of the country, and many
refugees, lucky enough not to be in camps will likely choose to stay where
they are and accept compensation. But it must be their choice. 

<p>Israelis who believe that return would be apocalyptic conveniently forget
that there are already more than one million Palestinians living as
peaceful and productive citizens in Israel--albeit with second class
status. Imagine what their contribution would be if they were equal, and
the existential conflict between the two peoples ended in a way that both
peoples considered just. 

<p>The worst nightmare for Palestinians is that a final deal will consign
millions of them to a bleak future of permanent exile in camps and
countries where they are not welcome. 

<p>Israel's strength and high standard of living has been bought at the cost
of the futures of millions of Palestinians in the same way that the
comfort of apartheid South Africa's whites was bought for the misery of
its blacks. It is past time to end this unjust equation in Palestine and
to bring the refugees home.

Chicago-based community service organization), is a speaker at the
Palestinian Refugee Return  Rally on September 16 in Washington DC. He is
