<P>

     During the past few months, I have been astonished at the number of my friends and neighbors who have confessed their first choice for president is actually Ralph Nader. They really, really want to vote for him, but . . . what?
<P>
     But for the risk to abortion rights. The logic goes that if Nader draws Gore votes, Bush will win. Then Bush will appoint judges who will roll back the clock and prevent many generations of young women from the right to make decisions about their own bodies.
<P>
     Would that it were so simple. As others have pointed out, trusting Gore to hold the line on this particular issue is somewhat optimistic, given his early track record against women's right to choose. Assuming that Bush would have a field day with the Supreme Court is somewhat pessimistic, given the political costs associated with such nominations.
<P>
     Fundamentally, of course, the anti-Nader argument rests on being able to put our trust in Gore's word, which is wildly optimistic, given the Clinton/Gore administration's track record on keeping promises on health care, gay rights and the environment. Even so, the fearful voter could be right. A Bush rollback of abortion rights conceivably could happen.
<P>
     I sympathize with this fear. As a Campfire leader, PTA president and soccer mom, I have thoroughly relished parenting. If I hadn't had a safe, legal abortion at age 22, I would not be enjoying the education, career, travel and middle-class lifestyle that often come with choosing if and when to have children. I am deeply grateful to the women and men who fought so hard for my right to make that choice.
<P>
     But abortion rights are not the only human rights. No one can deny that both Gore and Bush represent big business as usual. Big business as usual is exploiting and killing thousands of children around the globe. Big business as usual is criminalizing and killing youths of color here in Seattle. Big business as usual is brainwashing and branding the 47,000 children held captive in Seattle schools.
<P>
     In fact, big business as usual sees children not so much as wanted, but as absolutely necessary . . . to fight their wars, to make their products under miserable, dangerous working conditions, to spend money they don't have to buy absurd, overpriced products. Why? To generate truly obscene levels of profits.
<P>
     Unfortunately, both Gore and Bush actively promote the agenda of corporate globalization and privatization of the public sector, the system that is ruining children's lives. A vote for either ultimately is a vote against human rights for children. 
<P>
      Losing abortion rights would be heart-wrenching. My daughters should have the same rights I had. But I have come to the heretical conclusion that there are things even worse than losing abortion rights, and the current war against children in the name of profit is one of them.
<P>
     If half the people who think Nader would be the best president actually vote for him, we will grow a serious movement that will not only protect abortion rights, but will also move toward human rights for all children, at home and around the globe.
<P>
     The current corporate war on children is much bigger than even the battle for abortion rights. Don't let your passion for freedom of choice rob you of your freedom to choose.
