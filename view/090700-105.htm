It is an irony of history that the United States, which provided the first example of the concept of the separation of church and state to the world, would be hosting an interfaith conference at the U.N. on the role of the world's religions and peace, while at the same time finds its own presidential campaign dominated by the politics of personal religion.
<P>
 How is it that the world learned so much from us and we so little from them? When did we forget what our founders already knew?
<P>
The founders of this country really were trying to establish a new model of governance that sought, on the one hand, to allow all its inhabitants the freedom of religion while, on the other hand, to prevent the state from establishing any sort of official religion for the country. The principle of the constitutional separation between church and state was a radical idea back in Revolutionary times. 
<P>
Apparently it still is, given the fact that time and again over the past 200-plus years, various groups of people have attempted to re-inject religion into the political system in one way or another, seeking to impose the views of one faith, or one denomination of a particular faith, on everyone.
<P>
In our day, we wrestle with this problem as it pertains to so many hot topics - abortion, birth control, homosexuality, divorce, end-of-life matters - issues about which there rightly should be a spiritually based discussion. Still, for some, because of their presumed (and assumed) claim to knowing God's will, the temptation is great to short-circuit the necessary discussion and meeting of minds by legislating a solution. However, to do so, regardless of how well-intentioned the motives, is to curtail other citizens' freedom of religion and to impose the views and values of one faith group on everyone else.
<P>
Our candidates for elected office, from the presidential contenders down, are making a great deal of their personal religious commitments. While we ought to take comfort from the fact that so many potential office-holders are spiritually grounded, because it cannot but improve their decision-making, nonetheless this public parading of faith is also cause for concern because it raises the expectation - and the apprehension - that the line between church and state may be breached once they are elected. 
<P>
It is one thing to have one's spiritual values inform one's decision-making process in conjunction with other people; it is quite another to assert one's religious views through the political process.
<P>
As we grapple with the issue of the role of religion in politics domestically, the rest of the world seems to be marching to the beat of a different drummer. Beginning with a convocation at the U.N. last week, and continuing on with various working sessions at the U.N. and elsewhere in New York, the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders is bringing together over 1,000 religious leaders from around the world. 
<P>
That the power of politics is able to prevail over religion is evident in China's ability to block the appearance of Tibet's Dalai Lama; that religion has power all its own is evident from the fact that representatives of over 15 major faith groups (including Tibetan Buddhists) are sitting together around a common table to discuss the positive role humanity's spiritual traditions can play in resolving conflicts around the world. Regardless of the results of this gathering, as a symbol of all that our faiths ought to be, it is very inspiring.
<P>
Humanity's problem with regards to religion has been twofold historically. First, that although we have numerous ways of perceiving the divine and countless ways of commemorating the spiritual aspect of life, we have chosen to ignore the fact that this sense of connection with the divine is something we share in common as human beings. Instead, proponents of our various religions traditionally have claimed that their particular faith is the truest path. But our perceptions of the divine ought to be cumulative, not exclusive. 
<P>
Second, that religion and politics have never mixed well. The truth of a faith's perception of divine justice and mercy is never demonstrated through the sword or the gun. Nonetheless, it is apparent from history that the combination of political power and religious zeal is potent, and all too often has resulted in discrimination, violence, oppression and terrible slaughter on a large scale.
<P>
What these religious leaders gathered at the U.N. seem at least to be willing to discuss is, despite the doctrinal differences that set one religious group apart from another, that all religions and spiritual traditions share common values and all can play an important role in repairing our world - if they choose to work together on the basis of those shared values. 
<P>
So, ironically, while some of the world's religious and spiritual leaders are gathered to talk about how their faiths can work together for the larger political good of all - a concept rooted in the American experience - our domestic political scene is being inundated by candidates and an approach to issues that would return us to those less-than-thrilling days of yesteryear, a time and place from which much of the rest of the world is still trying to escape.
