Evidence has surfaced to confirm my opinion that, judging from his views on sport-utility vehicles, Rush Limbaugh may in fact be a big, fat idiot as Al Franken claimed in the book of that title.
<P>

   I often listen to Limbaugh as I'm driving. The other day, he was going on and on about just what could be the mysterious cause of these high gas prices. He was doing his best to figure it out.
<P>

   I looked around. Passing me was one of those Lincolns that get about 10 miles a gallon. Behind me was a Ford the size of a Winnebago. To the right, what looked like a Mack truck was gaining ground on something resembling a Sherman tank.
<P>

   Out of the blue I had a wild hunch that those high gas prices might be connected to something we conservatives call supply and demand. I solved the mystery with one phone call to the Oil Price Information Service.
<P>

   ``Here's one analogy I like to use,'' said Scott Berhang, an analyst with the Lakewood, N.J.-based firm. ``If you're driving one of these Chevy Suburbans, it consumes about 42 gallons every time you fill it up. That's a barrel of oil for every fillup. One of the factors causing prices to spike higher and higher is that there are more and more of these cars on the road. They're gas guzzlers.''
<P>

   The more SUVs we buy, the higher gas prices will go, said Berhang. But Rush says all Americans should buy SUVs if they want to be safe, according to an issue of the Limbaugh Letter sent to me by a fan, a ``dittohead.'' Limbaugh's theory, in other words, is that we can all drive huge SUVs and still have dollar-a-gallon gas.
<P>

   Idiotic? You decide.
<P>

   Limbaugh himself is not an idiot. In fact, he's a very bright guy, but he has what we in the journalism business call a conflict of interest. He does something a real journalist would get fired for: He says things for money. The man who has made himself a national spokesman for conservatism is also the national spokesman for a cleaning fluid, for a company that sells gold coins from a Spanish galleon and for virtually anyone else who will pay him.
<P>

   It's like that old joke about the man who asks a woman if she would go to bed with him for $10 million. She says yes. So he asks if she will go to bed with him for $10.
<P>

   ``What do you take me for?'' she asks indignantly.
<P>

   ``We've already established that,'' he replies. ``We're just debating the price.''
<P>

   Limbaugh himself worries about this. In his book ``The Rush Limbaugh Story,'' Newsday writer Paul Colford notes that as far back as 1985, Limbaugh was aware that doing commercials was hurting his credibility. Colford quotes Limbaugh as saying, ``I wanted to hold on to my credibility and my believability. And I didn't want any of that to be watered down, nor did I want to be perceived as a huckster.''
<P>

   Note the conflict: He wanted to be a huckster; he just didn't want to be <I>perceived </I>as one.
<P>

   The liberals are only too happy to portray Limbaugh as the spokesman for America's conservatives. Unfortunately, he has defined conservatism as a sort of general loutishness. The SUV question is typical. I'd wager that the average commuter hates these things. But Limbaugh has managed to convince the dittoheads that there is something uniquely conservative about badly engineered, dangerous vehicles that waste gas.
<P>

   The same phenomenon exists with other issues, drugs for example. Any thinking conservative -- William F. Buckley comes to mind -- would argue that if adults can legally smoke cigarettes, then they should be able to legally smoke marijuana. Limbaugh, however, has managed to convince several million dittoheads that there is something intrinsically conservative about tobacco, which kills 400,000 Americans a year, but not about marijuana, which kills almost none. Virtually every day he carries a piece of tobacco industry propaganda.
<P>

   And then there was the curious matter of Limbaugh's support of George W. Bush's primary bid. Colford notes in his book that Limbaugh told a Playboy interviewer that he made it a practice not to get involved in primaries. ``After the party and the people have chosen the candidates, then it's a different ballgame,'' Limbaugh said.
<P>

   Yet this year he went out of his way to portray a true conservative, John McCain, as some sort of liberal while urging the dittoheads to vote for Bush.
<P>

   Was Bush really the superior candidate? Limbaugh said so. But he also says stain remover can remove dried ink from shirts.
<P>
