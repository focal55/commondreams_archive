Last week he was an environmentalist. Now he's a health care reformer. Who knows what rewriting of 
reality is yet to come?

<p> George W. Bush's first speech on 
health care was delivered in Cleveland on Tuesday.

<p> "We will promote individual 
choice," he said. "We will rely on 
private insurance. But make no mistake: In my administration, low-income Americans will have access to 
high-quality health care."

<p> That very morning The Times was 
out with a page-one article by Adam 
Clymer that began as follows:

<p> "Texas has had one of the nation's 
worst public health records for decades. More than a quarter of its 
residents have no health insurance. 
The Mexican border is a hotbed of 
contagion. The state ranks near the 
top in the nation in rates of AIDS, 
diabetes, tuberculosis and teenage 
pregnancy, and near the bottom in 
immunizations, mammograms and 
access to physicians.

<p> "But since George W. Bush became 
governor in 1995, he has not made 
health a priority, his aides acknowledge. He has never made a speech on 
the subject, his press office says. His 
administration opposed a patients' 
bill of rights in 1995 before grudgingly 
accepting one in 1997, and fought unsuccessfully to limit access to the new 
federal Children's Health Insurance 
Program in 1999."  

<p> The rest of Mr. Clymer's article 
was just as devastating. Governor 
Bush may be lip-synching the language of reform as he seeks to impress independent and Democratic 
voters, but the reality in Texas is 
tragic. According to a report by the 
state comptroller's office in 1998, 
"Health conditions in the Texas-Mexico border are among the worst 
in the U.S., so distressful that reports 
on health conditions suggest a remote country in need of medical missionaries, not a part of Texas."

<p> Texas has been notoriously backward when it comes to health care. 
But if George W. Bush was at all 
concerned about that, he didn't let on. 
His choice for state health commissioner, Dr. William R. Archer III, 
would likely make a real health care 
reformer ill. Example: Texas may 
be at the bottom of the national heap 
in terms of health insurance coverage, but that's no big deal to Dr. 
Archer.

<p> Mr. Clymer wrote: "Almost alone 
among health experts in Texas, Dr. 
Archer minimizes the importance of 
the low rate of health insurance, a 
protection that two-fifths of the 
state's poor children lack. In an interview, he said he thought that while 
'eventually we have to insure everybody,' he believed the uninsured 
were still getting care."

<p> Well, sure. Some do. They get sick 
and show up at hospital emergency 
rooms. Of course, some wait too long.

<p> Dr. Archer's easy acceptance of 
this wretched method of delivering 
health care mirrors that of Governor 
Bush. Referring to a hypothetical 
uninsured mother of two, the governor said in a television interview last 
month: "She's got accessibility, in 
my state at least, to health care in 
emergency rooms and clinics."

<p> He admitted that wasn't the "most 
affordable" or "the smartest way to 
run a health system." But it was, you 
know, access.

<p> Answering a question about health 
care on a Fox News program in 
January, the governor said: "You go 
to emergency rooms in my state. . . . 
They're full of people. They're full of 
people. There's access."

<p> Mr. Bush said affordable insurance was his health care goal, his 
"mission," but he saw the crowded 
emergency rooms in Texas as proof 
that his constituents already had access to health care.

<p> This is not good. The governor 
appears to be clueless about health 
care, both unaware and unconcerned.

<p> In February, during a campaign 
appearance in Florida, Mr. Bush was 
questioned by a woman who wanted 
to know what he might do about the 
fact that her health insurance did not 
fully cover the needs of her son, who 
had a chronic, life-threatening illness.

<p> According to The Times's Frank 
Bruni, Mr. Bush seemed "stumped" 
by the query. "He sang the praises of 
medical savings accounts," wrote 
Mr. Bruni, "then acknowledged that 
it was too late for the woman to start 
one and that he really had no specific 
remedy for her."

<p> Mr. Bush told the woman: "I'm 
sorry. I wish I could wave a wand."
