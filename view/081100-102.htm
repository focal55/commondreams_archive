``Reprehensible,'' says Ralph Hoar, director of the Safety Forum, a research firm that investigates product defects, about the responses by Bridgestone/Firestone and the federal government to the recent epidemic of SUV and light truck accidents associated with defective tires.
<P>

  It is hard to understand why tires that were recalled and replaced almost a year ago in other countries, including Venezuela, Colombia and Saudi Arabia, still were sold in the United States. If there was enough information for Firestone to act elsewhere, there was enough to act here.
<P>

   Where were the U.S. government's watchdogs? The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the agency only can respond to consumer complaints. Consequently tire replacements in other countries would never flash across its radar screen. In fact the U.S. government waited until May to open an investigation, and then only after a Houston television station aired a news story on the number of accidents involving the rollover of Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone tires.
<P>
LAWYERS KNEW OF A LINK
<P>

   After the broadcast complaints to NHSTA shot up. There now are about 270 complaints with 46 associated fatalities. Last month Ford told the agency it knew of 500 potential cases. 
<P>

   But lawyers across the country knew of tread-separation cases linked to rollovers. Research group Public Citizen say more than 100 lawsuits involving the Firestone tires have been filed since 1992. Some have been settled and the records ``sealed'' with no responsibility assumed by the courts or manufacturers to disclose this information to the ``watchdog.''
<P>

   Even today the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is saying that it would take months to complete an investigation that would support mandating a recall. Therefore, it's pleased with Firestone's ``voluntary'' action. This is incredible.
<P>

   How many deaths need to occur before the federal government says, ``Stop''? Does the data need to be ironclad to issue a warning to consumers? Prior to last week, the federal government would only tell consumers there was an ``ongoing'' investigation.
<P>

   It is unfortunate, but predictable that a company will try to hide defects to protect its bottom line. But when a coverup may result in human death and injury, the company should be held not only to civil sanctions, but criminal sanctions, too.
<P>

   The practice of sealing court records as part of a settlement must be reviewed and revised, especially where there is reason to believe a product defect has a role in causing death and serious injury; and such information should be released to the federal agency evaluating the product's safety.
<P>
BUYERS SKIP THE FINE PRINT
<P>

   How many deaths could have been prevented if these accidents had been officially investigated five years ago? There is no answer to that question. There is not even a clear answer -- at least in the public forum -- to the question: What is causing the problem: the tire, the Explorer or both?
<P>

   Drivers buy SUVs for the sense of safety that comes with a big, high-above-the-ground vehicle. Few read the fine print about rollover risks. Few salesmen pitch reasons not to buy the expensive, popular vehicles.
<P>

   This case must be a catalyst to change the current system of tracking product defects to provide protection sooner and more effectively. It's a public-health issue. Laws need to be written to prevent the sealing of court cases involving public safety, and federal agencies need to be empowered with staff, budget and policy to be proactive.
<P>

   Companies must be held criminally liable if they knowingly have put the public's health at risk. There will be plenty of Explorers sitting in driveways over the next few months. Let them serve as a reminder of the work that needs to be done.
<P>
