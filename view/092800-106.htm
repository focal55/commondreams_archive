Eager to oust Slobodan Milosevic from power, the U.S. government 
has funneled millions of dollars to media projects in Yugoslavia. A lot of 
hypocrisy is involved. And we might wish for some kind of reciprocity.

         <p>"Charges of Chinese influence-buying in the 1996 U.S. presidential 
campaign caused a political storm in Washington that has yet to fully 
abate," the Washington Post noted recently. "By some measures, however, 
that episode pales by comparison to American political interference in 
Serbia." The announced tab for aid to foes of Milosevic during the 
just-ended fiscal year was $25 million. For the next year, the budget is 
$41.5 million.

         <p>We're told that the cash from the U.S. Treasury is necessary 
because unfair obstacles block opposition candidates as they try to 
communicate with the Yugoslav public. "The largest share of that money goes 
toward 'civil society' programs, such as those that support independent 
media," the Post reported. The newspaper added: "U.S. officials say they 
are seeking only to level the playing field."

         <p>What if other nations adopted a similar approach to help level the 
playing field for candidates here in the United States? After all, the 
terrain for campaigns is severely skewed by access to big money and mass 
media. For anyone who isn't wearing blinders or rose-colored glasses, the 
need to un-tilt the U.S. playing field should be obvious.

         <p>Truly anti-establishment candidates are up against a huge 
imbalance of media power if they challenge the bastions of clout along 
Pennsylvania Avenue and Wall Street. If democracy is going to exist in 
reality as well as in rhetoric, there's no time like the present to demand 
fundamental change.

         <p>For starters, in the United States, independent media are in dire 
need of assistance during the final weeks of the 2000 presidential 
campaign. How about a quick infusion of money to this country's small and 
badly underfunded non-corporate political magazines and community radio 
stations? At a minimum, several million dollars would be appropriate.

         <p>In October, major networks will be airing the prime-time series of 
debates between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Just the two of them. Those 
debates are being financed by firms like Anheuser-Busch. The beer company 
is paying $550,000 as a funder of the historic Bush-Gore encounters.

         <p>Maybe there's a government somewhere -- or perhaps a brewery in a 
foreign land -- that could spare half a million bucks for an independent 
series of U.S. presidential debates that would include Ralph Nader.

         <p>America's top politicians and news executives might resent that 
sort of intervention. With some winks and nods from high media places, the 
U.S. government has been good at demanding that other nations do as we say, 
not as we do.

         <p>During the last few weeks, the political intervention in 
Yugoslavia could hardly be more flagrant. According to the New York Times, 
money from Washington and European allies has gone to anti-Milosevic 
campaigners "sometimes in direct aid, sometimes in indirect aid like 
computers and broadcasting equipment, and sometimes in suitcases of cash 
carried across the border."

         <p>In the interests of decreasing the tilt of the media playing field 
in the USA, we should ponder how to generate a comparable influx of aid for 
our independent media outlets. Computers are often in short supply. 
Broadcasting equipment is much needed. And suitcases of cash would always 
be appreciated.

         <p>Facing the kind of shortfalls that have caused countless 
periodicals to fold, many editors of independent publications know all too 
well that freedom of the press is circumscribed -- as a practical matter -- 
by the extent of financial backing. Media conglomerates are apt to post 
enormous profits while small outlets struggle to survive. In effect, for 
the most part, our society's censorship comes not from governmental 
hostility but from financial pressure.

         <p>In a Sept. 20 news dispatch from Belgrade, the New York Times 
described a far different situation: "Independent journalists and 
broadcasters here have been told by American aid officials 'not to worry 
about how much they're spending now,' that plenty more is in the pipeline, 
said one knowledgeable aid worker."

         <p>For some candidates in Yugoslavia, the largess from abroad has 
also been generous, the Times explained. "There is little effort to 
disguise the fact that Western money pays for much of the polling, 
advertising, printing and other costs of the opposition political campaign 
-- one way, to be sure, to give opposition leaders a better chance to get 
their message across in a quasi-authoritarian system where television in 
particular is in the firm hands of the government."

         <p>Here, television is not in the firm hands of the government -- 
it's in the firm hands of corporations. You may see Ralph Nader on TV once 
in a while, but compared to Bush and Gore he's a stranger to the airwaves. 
Officials in foreign capitals who want to follow Washington's example might 
consider sending a few million dollars to Nader, pronto.
