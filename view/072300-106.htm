NEW YORK<wbr> - Shyness, once viewed as becoming in some people, is today being
cast as a prevalent medical problem. Thankfully, shy people can receive
relief in the form of a pill called Paxil. The medicine is an old drug
being applied to a novel disease called "social anxiety disorder." Both
the disease and the drug are largely the innovation of the drug's
manufacturer and its Madison Avenue advertising agency.
<p>In the past, medical professionals wouldn't dare to prescribe a
powerful psychotropic drug like Paxil to treat the benign personality
traits portrayed in the drug's advertisements. Instead, medication was
reserved for the few people who met rigid criteria defining serious
mental illnesses. Yet, the race is on to develop pills that will satisfy
social needs, a pursuit that often blurs the line separating treatment of
purely clinical conditions from the medical manipulation of social
stigmas.
<p>Definitions of illness and health no longer belong strictly to the
white-coated realm of pure science. They also are social, cultural and
economic phenomena. Madison Avenue executives are hard at work recasting
bothersome physical traits with memorable names and deceivingly broad
descriptions to expand potential markets for dozens of new medications.
<p>Four years ago, the disease "overactive bladder" barely existed in
medical textbooks. Now everyone knows there's a drug to stop those
annoying trips to the bathroom. Every man who has problems during sexual
relations has an organic etiology called "erectile dysfunction." Allergy
medications are being peddled for a wide variety of sniffles that go well
beyond clinical definitions of hay fever. In the case of all these
afflictions, while a select group of people will certainly benefit from
treatment, the aim of advertising executives is to stretch the clinical
definitions to expand the market for new drugs and convince millions of
new consumers that they're affected with a condition that requires
medication.
<p>When drug companies and advertising executives connect, the bounty can
be enormous. In Colorado, legislation is being proposed that would
mandate that obesity be considered a "disease." The bill, mirroring
legislative efforts in other states, would make prevention of portliness
and its treatment a matter of state policy. Classifying obesity as a
disease sets the stage for reimbursement for two new and expensive
fat-busting drugs by private and public health insurance. It also makes
it easier for people to talk about their weight in the language of
victims and seek out the expensive medications. Doctors expect
prescriptions for anti-obesity medication to grow exponentially if these
legislative efforts succeed.
<p>Physicians and pharmaceutical firms used to abide by the distinction
between being sick and not feeling your best. If you were sick, they were
there to help. If other things weren't going too well, you just had to
learn to live with them. Today, many doctors are privately and publicly
complaining that the pendulum has swung too far, with too many pills
being prescribed for too many soft diagnoses.
<p>In a study published recently in the Journal of the American Medical
Assn., researchers reported that the use of certain psychotropic drugs
such as Ritalin in 2- and 4-year-olds doubled and even tripled during the
last decade. The study gave no reasons for the increase, but experts say
frustrated parents, agitated day-care workers and 10-minute pediatric
visits all contribute to quick pharmacological fixes for emotional and
behavioral problems.
<p>Powerful drugs were previously reserved for children with genuine
brain disease. Now it's commonplace for them to be labeled with a
"hyperactivity" disorder requiring medication. The best-selling book
"Listening to Prozac" helped fuel this boom in 1993, injecting the phrase
"cosmetic pharmacology" into the vernacular and breaking the conceptual
groundwork for advocates of Ritalin. Even the diseases themselves have
undergone some creative updates. "Attention deficit disorder" and
"hyperactive disorder" were formerly known as "minimal brain damage." The
pharmaceutical companies, to accommodate marketing goals, changed the
names.
<p>These efforts have helped get 4 million extra-lively, fidgety and
easily distractible kids on Ritalin and 2.5 million on antidepressants.
Ironically, in a country where every child from preschool onward can
recite antidrug catechisms, millions of children are legally drugged with
a substance so similar to cocaine that, according to one medical journal,
"It takes a chemist to tell the difference." As with social phobia, the
research and marketing of attention deficit disorder, an affliction that
barely registered in the professional literature a decade ago,
illustrates how certain normal traits can be recast as medical symptoms
with the right mix of modern medicine and savvy marketing. The rest of
the world, it should be noted, has yet to acquire the American taste for
Ritalin. Today, America consumes 90% of the drug produced.
<p>Probably the most important medical development of the 20th century
was that economics replaced curiosity as the driving force behind
research. Cashing in on the real and imaginary health anxieties of
Americans is a lucrative business. Drug firms make the right noises about
responsible use of their products, but their sales reps are in doctors'
offices every day, pitching the products.
<p>Individual pleasure has its natural and indispensable place, even in
medicine, but like a powerful engine, it has to be integrated with the
rest of the social machinery. Doctors must be willing to differentiate
between the demands of a generation of affluent self-medicators and those
with real medical needs. It is madness to make self-satisfaction an end
in itself, to which everything else must be sacrificed.
