Paul Conover and I met Michael 
Farmer during basic training at Fort 
Dix, N.J., in the mid-1960's. Conover 
and I were friends from Montclair. 
Farmer was a kid from Atlantic City, 
a 17-year-old who mumbled so badly 
you could never be sure what he was 
saying. He was big and good-looking, 
but the first impression was that he 
wasn't too swift.

<p> One night Farmer came over to our 
barracks -- uninvited -- while Conover and I, who were a couple of years 
older and light years cooler, were 
sitting on the floor, spit-shining our 
combat boots. Very tentatively and 
very politely, Farmer asked if he 
could join us.

<p> I told him to get lost. Farmer must 
not have understood because he 
promptly sat down, took off his boots 
and, over the next few minutes, 
proved to my satisfaction that he was 
as dumb as he sounded.

<p> First he told us he had <I>joined</I> the 
Army. Conover grinned and rolled his 
eyes. Then Farmer said he was in 
love with a girl in Atlantic City and 
planned to marry her. I shook my 
head. This was not a person worth 
spending time with. As a draftee, all I 
wanted was for my  hair to grow back 
and to be reunited with that gleaming 
symbol of freedom and the good life, 
my Thunderbird.

<p> But Conover liked Farmer and told 
him to come back the next night.

<p> "He mumbles," I said.

<p> But Conover said, "Ah, he's all 
right."

<p> So Farmer came back, night after 
night, to smoke cigarettes, listen to 
Motown music, mumble about his 
girlfriend and polish boots. To my 
chagrin, I started to like him, though I 
still needed a translator to understand him. For the longest time I 
thought his girlfriend's name was 
Merlin. It was Marilyn.

<p> Farmer and Conover became very 
close. Eventually both of them were 
sent to Vietnam. I got lucky and was 
sent to Korea, which was no walk in 
the park. But it wasn't Vietnam.

<p> The impact of the war on Conover 
and Farmer was strange. When 
Farmer came back, he seemed more 
sure of himself, more open and fun-loving, less insecure. He and Marilyn 
were married.

<p> Conover, the most happy-go-lucky 
guy I had ever known, was a wreck. 
He was  nervous. Jumpy. Some nights 
he would drink like a fiend. The cheerful optimism that had once defined his 
personality was gone.

<p> He wouldn't really talk about Vietnam. All I ever heard him say was, 
"Didn't know I could get so scared."

<p> Then the unthinkable happened. 
Farmer, who had enlisted for four 
years and was still in the service, got 
orders to go back to Vietnam. We told 
him not to go. Call your congressman, 
we said. Fight this thing. But Farmer 
didn't know how.

<p> It's not hard to guess what happened. Farmer's second tour lasted 
only a few months. I was in the back 
of my father's upholstery shop one 
afternoon when Conover walked in.

<p> "Farmer didn't make it," he said. 
And then he started crying.

<p> A year passed. I got a job with a 
newspaper. Conover got married. Other buddies got killed in the war, which 
began to look like it might go on forever. My sister's boyfriend got shot.

<p> I didn't realize it, but Conover's 
struggle was winding down. He wouldn't make it, either. I never got the 
story straight. All I know is that he got 
his hands on a gun, and one night he 
waited in a car outside his house for 
his wife to come home. When she 
showed up he shot her dead. Then he 
killed himself.

<p> Sunday was the 25th anniversary of 
the end of the war, which I cannot 
think about without thinking of Farmer and Conover. Neither had a clue 
about the politics or the history or the 
egos that sucked them up like dust 
from a carpet and consigned them to 
their pointless fate. Vietnam was a 
fool's errand, and the young and the 
ignorant went to their doom by the 
tens of thousands.

<p> When David Brinkley, appalled by 
the carnage, asked Lyndon Johnson 
why he didn't just pull out of Vietnam, 
thus saving  many lives, Johnson replied, "I'm not going to be the first 
American president to lose a war."

<p> A couple of years ago I visited the 
Vietnam Memorial in Washington. I 
found Farmer's name, and then, not 
thinking, looked for Conover's. Of 
course, it wasn't there. But his short 
life and that of his wife, whose name I 
don't know, were wasted by Vietnam 
just a surely as the lives of those 
58,000 other Americans listed on that 
bitter wall.
