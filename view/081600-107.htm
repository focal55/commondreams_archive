<P>

The tragic accident that left a Russian submarine with 116 aboard on the bottom of the ocean is symbolic of the state of the Russian military.<P>

   The cause of Saturday's accident, which occurred during military exercises, remains unclear -- whether by a collision, as the Russian military first claimed, or by an on-board explosion. There remains the possibility of radioactivity leaks into the ocean, though the military has been dismissing concerns.<P>

   Although the 6-year-old sub is one of nation's newest, troubles are hardly surprising. The Russian military has been a disaster waiting to happen. Like the Kursk, it has sunk -- under the pressure of political chaos and the weight of a disintegrating economy.<P>

   The  Russian military's collapse has been utter and dramatic. It puts into perspective the assertions by the Republicans and their presidential candidate, George W. Bush, that the Clinton administration has presided over the American military's decline over the past decade. Those claims are ludicrous.<P>

   The Russian military, says Dr. Walter Parchomenko, director of International Security Studies at the Joint Military Intelligence College in Washington, D.C., is in a ``state of deep crisis.'' It has virtually stopped producing modern weapons and military equipment, he says, and ``the combat readiness of the armed forces, with few exceptions, has continued to deteriorate.''<P>

   Forty percent of Russian helicopters are inoperative; Russian pilots get one-tenth the flying time of their NATO counterparts. Russia's fleet of nuclear-powered subs, which once numbered 120 in Soviet times, is down to about 40. And there's no money to repair and maintain those still afloat.<P>

   The military brass has acknowledged that only one in five draftees shows up, and 40 percent of those can't do basic physical tasks -- a reflection of the declining state of Russian health. And those who  serve, Parchomenko says, are often ``homeless, unpaid, hungry, humiliated, brutalized and angry.'' The grinding war in Chechnya, a toll borne by poorly trained recruits, is compiling problems of morale. <P>

   By one estimate, annual defense spending in Russia has dropped 90 percent from its Soviet high of $260 billion, to about $30 billion. Compare that with the $290 billion defense budget that Congress just approved for 2001. It <I>is </I>down about $125 billion, in inflation-adjusted dollars, from the splurge in spending under President Reagan, but it's still equal to spending in 1979, the height of the Cold War.<P>

   U.S. defense spending now eats up 54 percent of all discretionary federal spending -- those areas, from education and parks to foreign aid and NASA, not covered by entitlements and the national debt. Competing to prove they're not soft on defense, both Clinton and the Republicans have been reflexively throwing dollars at the military -- and adding billions in pork-barrel spending that the Pentagon didn't even request.<P>

   It's not just the amount of spending that's troubling. The defense budget continues to be tilted toward new weapons programs ``to fight World War III against a non-existent enemy,'' says Christopher Hellman, budget analyst for the Center for Defense Information, a research institute in Washington. The skewed priorities undercut the nation's ability to fund adequately an all-volunteer military and to respond sufficiently to rising threats, like terrorism, in a quickly changing world. <P>

   ``Nothing has changed,'' says Hellman of the latest defense budget. ``Not a single major weapons program has been eliminated, or even seen its funding substantially reduced.''<P>

   Accidents happen at sea; submarines are dangerous work. But the tragedy unfolding in the Barents Sea points to a decaying Russian military. <P>

   No other foe came close to Russia's military capacity. One decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, America is in an arms race -- with itself.<BR>
