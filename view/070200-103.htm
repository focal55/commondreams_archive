We all have favourites. At the moment, mine are  Frasier,  Ally McBeal and Sheryl Crow, but Roosevelt, Bob Dylan and J.D. Salinger have figured in the past. Like most Britons, I like things American. I love its generosity, scale and vitality. I feel I know America.
<P>But now for the 'but'. Americans may speak the same language and share some of the same cultural roots as we British, but it is a foreign country. Not only that, it is a foreign country that follows Lord Acton's famous dictum more wholeheartedly than we ever guess. Moreover, it does not have friends; rather, it has interests that abide and which it pursues with calculated aggression. And since the end of the Cold War, it has become the world's hegemonic power with a capacity to ensure that its   interests are secured more completely than ever before. At various times over the last 50 years, both the British Left and Right have had spasms of suspicion - on the Left bordering on paranoia - over American ambitions but in the main Britain has kept its head. Whatever the drawbacks of this unbalanced relationship, we have needed the US to sustain peace and a liberal, capitalist order in Europe - and we have been lucky to have had an essentially benevolent master.
<P>Yet today, even these suspicions of the US at the political margins have evaporated. But the paradox is that this is just the moment when we should be on our guard most. Examples grow by the week of a new arrogance and swagger in the US's relations with the rest of the world that signal an end to its former liberal benevolence.
<P>Last week, for example, we saw the Americans lay claim to the authorship of the human genome project, notwithstanding the essential contribution of British scientists. Later, CBS broadcast a news report suggesting that British streets were less safe than American streets. No matter that this judgment could only be (partially) justified by ignoring US homicide rates. British protests and sensibilities can be ignored; after all, what power do we have?
<P>So it goes on. Hollywood has continued to rewrite the Second World War, so that the heroism of British submariners or escapees from Colditz has been recast as the heroism of Americans. What matters is not truth, but box-office receipts, a cause to which the Motion Picture Association's lobbying power has been dedicated in a fashion that makes the National Rifle Association look tame. American production values are high, but the notion that the monopoly position of US films in Europe is the result solely of their greater creativity is risible. This is the consequence of 50 years of sustained effort to gain control of distribution and marketing structures, in which the MPA has made sure that the US government has been enlisted as a partner.
<P>It is a similar story everywhere you look. In defence, the US refuses to sign the anti-proliferation treaty and now advocates the extraordinary national missile defence system, which will involve subverting the anti-ballistic missile treaties. In finance, it refuses collaboration over international financial regulation in the wake of the Asia crisis. It continues to assert its jurisdiction over other countries in drug enforcement. There is no let-up in the long-standing hawkishness over US trade interests.
<P>Of course, the US has every right to look after its interests; nor is it surprising that its world view and culture are America-centred. It is just that America has more importance than any other state because of its sheer, raw power, so that globalisation has, in effect, become a vehicle for the expansion of US standards, systems and values to the rest of the world. The US is not always in control of the process; the world's capital markets, essentially directed from Wall Street, are perfectly capable of exercising their freedoms to sell US financial assets, and US multinationals export blue-collar jobs from American industrial heartlands with abandon.
<P>But this misses the deeper point. In this game, US corporations and investment banks are treating the rest of the world as extensions of the US; they are moving assets and finance ever more confidently around what Henry Kissinger openly calls the US imperium.
<P>We could more relaxed about this if the challenge to core British and European values were not so great. For Americanisation does not only mean the ownership and domination of many of our productive assets in the service of another country's ambitions and welfare, it means the more subtle colonisation of our imagination. In the realm of political ideas, British conceptions of Left and Right have been redefined by Americans, regardless of their very different civilisation.
<P>For example, there has been a longstanding British tradition that part of the role of the criminal justice system is rehabilitation as well as punishment and deterrence; that has now been overwhelmed by the much harsher American view that what matters, above all, is prison and punishment. Education, health and welfare policy are all being recast around the American experience, even though the context and attitudes to society are vastly different.
<P>The French have always seen this challenge more vividly than the British. Jose Bove, the French farmer currently on trial for despoiling a McDonald's, is but the latest in a long line of histrionic French protesters against Americanisation who the British have tended to patronise.
<P>Instead, Britain has an opposite tradition of flirting with becoming America's fifty-first state, now discussed in the guise of joining Nafta (North American Free Trade Agreement) Crazily, officials from the International Trade Commission visited Britain earlier this year to examine the case for British membership, which would mean withdrawing from the EU. In the increasingly dark world of conservative US politics, there is even talk of establishing a world English-speaking union, naturally under the leadership of the US.
<P>Geography and values, however, intrude. Whether it's religion, capital punishment, race or even manners, the US is a country apart. For a long period during and after the New Deal, a broadly liberal consensus sympathetic to Europe governed the US, which disguised the underlying gulf. But over the last two decades, that consensus has vanished and the US has become a more conservative, harsher and individualistic country - and its political and corporate leaders have become unapologetic about putting America first.
<P>British Eurosceptics make great play of the threat to British sovereignty posed by the EU. The greater threat is from the other side of the Atlantic.
