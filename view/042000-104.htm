AMERICA'S MOST SKILLED inflation fighter may have finally met his match -- 

CEOs of high-tech companies, who receive billion-dollar stock-option 

compensation packages even though their companies post no profits.

<P>  For more than a decade, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has 

guided our economy through both the political and theoretical currents that 

have threatened unprecedented economic expansion. This has included attacks 

on the inflationary impact of government-ordered 5 percent per annum 

increases of the minimum wage and his surprising silence on the often 

triple-digit increases in executive-compensation packages.	 

</P>

<P>  While providing the theoretical anti-inflation underpinnings to 

Republican-led opposition to a nickel an hour per month increase in the 

minimum wage, the Federal Reserve has refused to examine the potential 

inflationary effect of billion-dollar New Economy stock compensation 

packages for CEOs -- usually not tied to company profits or real 

productivity.	 

</P>

<P>  For example, despite government studies on the alleged inflationary 

effect of modest wage increases for 20 million minimum-wage workers, the 

Federal Reserve 

has refused to commission any studies on the potential inflationary impact 

of excessive compensation packages of CEOs.	 

</P>

<P>  On April 2, a New York Times-commissioned study of 60 New Economy CEOs 

demonstrated the continued indifference of the Federal Reserve toward the 

``trickle down'' inflationary impact of excessive executive compensation 

packages.	 

These 60 chief executives alone appear to have received in excess of five 

times 

more in increases over the past three years than 20 million minimum- and 

near-minimum wage workers received in total during the same time period. 

(These CEOs received average increases of $1.2 billion.)	 

</P>

<P>  The inflationary effect of these pay pack 

ages may be far greater than increasing the federal minimum wage by 50 

percent, to almost $8 an hour from $5.15 an hour.	 

The $75 billion secured by these 60 CEOs may be just the tip of the 

executive-

pay iceberg. Most of the Fortune 1000 and New Economy chief executives are 

taking similar pay increases at an even greater cost to the U.S. economy. 

And it is a rare CEO who (in order to protect the legitimacy of his triple 

digit compensation increase) does not provide similarly large increases for 

most, if not all, of top management.	 

</P>

<P>  These escalating executive increases can have a destabilizing effect on 

the distribution and availability of necessary goods. Recent examples are: 

the million-dollar, three-bedroom Silicon Valley homes that even a 

$100,000-a-year Stanford University professor cannot afford; the refusal of 

many qualified teachers and police officers to seek work in areas lacking 

affordable housing, and; the growing number of Silicon Valley homeless who 

have full-time jobs.	 

</P>

<P>  Compounding this social destabilization caused by excessive and unevenly 

distributed compensation, is the inefficient cost-

cutting many CEOs engage in to justify their compensation increases, such as 

layoffs or terminating health benefits.	 

</P>

<P>  These inflationary costs, which in aggregate may exceed $500 billion, may 

be mild relative to what might occur if labor union 

leaders replicated this behavior. Imagine the inflationary impact should the 

ordinary worker, including police officers, teachers, secretaries and 

skilled tradesmen, seek triple, or even double digit wage increases.	 

</P>

<P>  And it defies human nature to believe that cost-cutting and large-scale 

layoffs -- allegedly necessary for global competitiveness -- can be 

effective once 95 percent of the workers recognize that they alone, not 

their leaders, must pay the price.	 

</P>

<P>  Most likely, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, whose political acumen 

is often as extraordinary as his wisdom and luck, will not be found wanting 

and will make available the evidence demonstrating the link between 

excessive compensation and future inflation.	 

</P>

<P>Perhaps such evidence, combined with freezes on executive compensation, will 

reduce the need for future Federal Reserve interest rate increases that help 

fuel inflationary homeownership costs and limit small business expansion.
