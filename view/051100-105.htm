<p>After the "Love Bug" virus struck millions of computer hard drives, many
news outlets attributed the magnitude of the damage to overwhelming
reliance on the same type of software. Suddenly, in the digital world,
steep downsides of technical conformity were obvious. But such concerns
should also extend to the shortage of variety in media content.

	<p>Reporting on the worst virus attack in PC history, Time blamed "the perils
of living in a monoculture." The newsmagazine explained: "Security experts
have long warned that Microsoft software is so widely used and so
genetically interconnected that it qualifies as a monoculture -- that is,
the sort of homogeneous ecosystem that makes as little sense in the
business world as it does in the biological."

	<p>The practical benefits of diversity suggest a question that's long
overdue: What's the sense of monoculture in mass media?

	<p>On land where clear-cutting has occurred, the rows of trees that stand are
apt to resemble toothpicks -- especially when compared to the intricate and
diverse vegetation of natural forests. And if we take a close look at the
country's main news sources, the undermining of media ecology is all too
evident.

	<p>Right now, cash crops dominate the media terrain. Little diversity takes
root. Erosion of public discourse is chronic, with monotonous and
stultifying results. The harvest of news and public affairs is akin to
waxed vegetables: shiny and dependable, yet lacking in flavor or nutrients.

	<p>What's in short supply? The actual experiences, perspectives and voices of
some people. They may not have the income to qualify as middle class. They
may be immigrants facing obstacles because of their race, religion or
accent. They might be homeless, malnourished, unschooled or stuck in
low-wage jobs. Across the media expanses, where do they fit in? Who
advocates for them, or addresses their concerns, with consistent focus and
fervor?

	<p>Cable TV was supposed to rescue us from the limits of broadcast
television. But if you click through basic cable and beyond, you may feel
like a hiker wandering around vast acreage of an artificial timber farm.

	<p>Take "Larry King Live." (Please.) Most nights, insipid would be too kind
an adjective. Along with featuring countless celebs who are mostly famous
for being famous, the nightly CNN show has pioneered bringing in big-name
journalists from other news outlets to share their purported wisdom. They
know how to perform in a TV studio. But their roots in down-to-earth
America are usually so shallow that it seems a major rainstorm would just
about wash them away.

	<p>In the absence of a healthy media environment, our society is prone to
vitriol that eludes direct challenge. For example, Don Imus -- ranked by
Time as one of "the 25 most influential Americans" -- delights in spewing
out a fetid brew of ersatz cleverness on his national radio program,
whether at the expense of blacks, gays, women or people with amputated
limbs. Simulcast on MSNBC television, "Imus in the Morning" is an audio
horror show that often denigrates because of skin color, sexual orientation
or gender. (See the online journal www.tompaine.com for extensive
documentation.)

	<p>Rather than recoiling at the invective from Imus and his crew, dozens of
prominent journalists continue to embrace it. Program regulars include
CNN's Jeff Greenfield and Judy Woodruff, CBS's Dan Rather and Bob
Schieffer, NBC's Tom Brokaw and Tim Russert, and Cokie Roberts of ABC and
National Public Radio. High-status print reporters don't hang back, either,
as exemplified by such avid participants in the Imus show as Newsweek's
Howard Fineman and Jonathan Alter, and syndicated New York Times columnists
Frank Rich and Thomas Friedman.

	<p>Typically, when critics denounce the wise-guy racism and other assorted
viciousness that accompanies Imus in the morning, they're tagged as rigid
ideologues. In Greenfield's words -- spoken during a softball CNN interview
he conducted with his longtime pal Imus three months ago -- "political
correctness is the enemy."

	<p>The antidote to such poisonous drivel would be a healthy media environment
that promotes the ethics of anti-racism, anti-sexism and anti-homophobia on
an ongoing basis. Demagogue quipsters like Imus and his colleagues have it
easy because their corporate bosses refuse to give much airtime to those
who are ready, willing and able to support the kind of human solidarity
that Imus works to undermine. For now, bigotry breeds in media monoculture.
