When the last George Bush left the White House, the unemployment rate was 
nearly twice as high as it is now and the typical household's income was 
$4,400 less, adjusting for inflation. Before you're ready to put his son 
George W. in the White House, check out where Texas leads the nation, and 
where it lags.

<p>Texas is No. 1 in air pollution and No. 2 in people without health insurance. 
Nearly one out of four Texans is uninsured.

<p>Debater Bush took credit for the Texas Patient Bill of Rights. Governor Bush 
tried to block it.

<p>Texas is No. 1 in toxic releases to the environment and No. 1 in toxic 
chemical accidents. Bush likes voluntary pollution controls and wants to keep 
studying global warming, rather than do anything about it.

<p>Texas is No. 6 in poverty and No. 44 in homeownership; 34 states have lower 
unemployment rates.

<p>Texas is No. 1 in prison population and No. 38 in college enrollment. It's 
No. 1 in executions. In January, the pro-death penalty Republican governor of 
Illinois issued a moratorium on executions because the system was "fraught 
with error and has innumerable opportunities for innocent people to be 
executed."

<p>A new report, reviewing hundreds of cases, says the death penalty in Texas is 
riddled with racial bias, incompetent defense lawyers and prosecutorial 
misconduct, including falsifying evidence. Bush doesn't think there's a 
problem.

<p>Bush pushed for legislation allowing Texans to carry concealed handguns--even 
into churches and hospitals. A Los Angeles Times investigation found that 
"since the law took effect, the state has licensed hundreds of people with 
prior criminal convictions--including rape and armed robbery--and histories 
of violence, psychological disorders and drug or alcohol problems." More than 
3,000 other licensees have since been arrested, including for murder.

<p>NRA Vice President Kayne Robinson has said that in Bush, "We'll have a 
President...where we work out of their office." The federal assault weapons 
ban is up for reauthorization during the next president's term.

<p>Bush's record as a businessman is nothing to be proud of. As Texas 
journalists Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose show in their funny, informative book, 
"Shrub," Bush had a habit of losing other people's money in the oil business 
while walking away with money himself.

<p>Bush made his really big money thanks to corporate welfare for the Texas 
Rangers baseball team. Bush and 70 other investors paid $83 million to buy 
the team. Bush put up $640,000. Ivins and Dubose write, "The team increased 
its book value from $83 million to $138 million by convincing the city of 
Arlington there would be no more baseball unless local taxpayers sprang for a 
new stadium."

<p>The people of Arlington got a higher sales tax. Bush got rich. In 1998, he 
cashed in his share of the team for $15.4 million, an amount 24 times higher 
than his initial investment.

<p>Bush and his wife made $1.6 million in income last year. He's got a big stake 
in his big tax cut. According to Citizens for Tax Justice, Bush's tax plans 
would provide an average tax cut of $42 to the bottom fifth of Americans and 
an average $46,072 to the top 1 percent group the Bushes are in. There's 
nothing fuzzy about that scuzzy math.

<p>Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition is counting on Bush to appoint judges to 
the Supreme Court who will support a rightwing agenda like Clarence Thomas 
and Antonin Scalia, Bush's favorite justices. Remember, Supreme Court 
appointments are for life.

<p>Bush's running mate, multimillionaire oilman Dick Cheney, has done an even 
better job at pretending he's a "compassionate conservative" than Bush has. 
While in Congress, Cheney often voted to the right of conservative hardliners 
like Newt Gingrich.

<p>Cheney consistently voted against environmental legislation, including the 
Safe Drinking Water Act and the Superfund program to clean up toxic waste. He 
voted against the most commonsense gun control, including the banning of 
armor-piercing ammunition. He was one of only four votes against banning 
plastic guns that can evade metal detectors. He voted against abortion even 
to save the life of the mother. He voted against Head Start and the 
Meals-on-Wheels program for seniors.

<p>Look closely before you leap with Bush and Cheney.
