With the full U.S. Senate 
        poised to take up the billion-dollar aid package for Colombia recently 
        approved by the Appropriations Committee (a $1.7 billion version passed 
        the House in March), the time is ripe to assess the credibility of the 
        bill's principal salesman, President Andr&eacute;s Pastrana.
      
<p>It's a tough sell -- or at 
        least it should be. Human rights groups have documented the Colombian 
        armed forces' depridations for decades. Even in recent years, as the number 
        of union leaders, peasant organizers, crusading journalists, peace activists, 
        human rights investigators and government prosecutors murdered by the 
        army has plummeted, Human Rights Watch (HRW), Amnesty International, the 
        U.N. and even the State Department have reported that right-wing paramilitary 
        death squads linked to the army have taken up the slack. They are killing 
        in record numbers the very people army intelligence has long targeted. 
        </p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Colombian military 
        should not get a clean bill of health until it severs its ties to paramilitaries,&quot; 
        argues Jos&eacute; Miguel Vivanco, executive director of HRW's Americas 
        Division. &quot;U.S. assistance should not be provided either to those 
        who directly commit human rights abuses or to those who effectively contract 
        others to carry out abuses on their behalf and with their assistance.&quot;
<p>Because sales is not the most 
        honorable profession, smart people who are looking to buy a used car -- 
        but don't know a gasket from a spark plug -- bring along a knowledgeable 
        friend. That friend will ask tough questions and follow up on evasive 
        answers. He or she will look under the hood and put that vehicle through 
        a demanding test drive. 
<p>Members of Congress and big-shot 
        journalists with scant experience in Colombia need to bring a knowledgeable 
        friend when they question Pastrana. Otherwise, they won't have a clue 
        whether he is telling the truth or selling a lie.
<p>On the April 15 edition of 
        the CNN show <i>Evans, Novak, Hunt &amp; Shields</i>, Al Hunt asked Pastrana 
        about the accuracy of the latest HRW report, &quot;The Ties that Bind,&quot;which 
        asserts that half of the army's 18 brigades feature links between military 
        intelligence, the paramilitary and hired killers.
<p>Pastrana replied, &quot;No, 
        I don't say that it's correct because sometimes it's not absolutely correct. 
        But we have been investigating, and I think if you see the figure four 
        years ago, three years ago, the people that were linked with the paramilitaries, 
        according to Human Rights and even according to the militaries and the 
        attorney's office in Colombia, were about 1,500 men. Today, it's not more 
        than 50, 60 men that were accused of having links with the paramilitaries. 
        So we're working very hard on that.&quot;
<p>Hunt, a lame moderate who 
        plays a liberal on CNN, did not have a buddy along. One who could have 
        helped is Robin Kirk, a careful, experienced researcher for HRW. Via email, 
        I got her responses to Pastrana's statements.
<p>&quot;I have not seen any 
        reports that show a dramatic decrease in the number of military officers 
        linked to support for paramilitary groups,&quot; she wrote. &quot;In Colombia, 
        a common tactic of the government is always to cite vague and unconfirmable 
        'statistics' that are very general. That is why we nailed it down to at 
        least nine out of eighteen brigades, three of which operate in Colombia's 
        largest cities. When you use specifics, it is clear that this relationship 
        continues and is met with, at the very least, tolerance by the armed forces. 
        I can give several concrete examples of high-ranking officers who government 
        investigators have tied to work with paramilitary groups, who remain on 
        active duty and have been promoted.&quot;
<p>Pastrana told Hunt that &quot;we 
        proposed a reform inside our militaries in Colombia to really reform our 
        institution, because legally, according to the law in Colombia, you cannot 
        seize or throw away of the military any military before they're 50 years 
        in the military. So that's why we're going to reform the army.&quot;
<p>Kirk's response: &quot;What 
        he is referring to is a proposal we and other groups have put forward. 
        It is to purge the military of officers against whom there is credible 
        evidence of human rights abuses. The police have this ability, and have 
        used it effectively to clean up their ranks. But the military refuses 
        to get rid of these killers NOT because they can't (with one executive 
        order, Pastrana could get rid of them all) but because they won't. Pastrana 
        himself has signed orders cashiering several generals BEFORE this spurious 
        50-year limit -- which is a crock, by the way -- and he should do it much 
        more often. The reason he doesn't is probably because he risks a military 
        mutiny if he does -- precisely because they tacitly support the alliance 
        with [the paramilitaries] and shield the officers involved.&quot;
<p>Hunt, without a buddy along, 
        bought the used car. He praised the salesman as &quot;an extraordinarily 
        courageous and determined man&quot; who &quot;may well be the last best 
        hope for any chance of peace.&quot; So in the name of peace, Hunt will 
        support massive military aid to an army that collaborates with murderous 
        paramilitaries, refuses to subject itself to the rule of law <i>and</i> 
        is hostile to the peace process! 
<p>Bear in mind that Hunt is 
        far better informed than most viewers, as he had read HRW's latest report 
        and talked to skeptical policy experts. If Pastrana sold him, what chance 
        did defenseless viewers have? That show was, in effect, an infomercial. 
        If CNN cares one whit about its reputation and obligation to viewers, 
        it will get Pastrana back in the studio and subject him to cross-examination 
        by informed experts, such as Kirk and Vivanco of HRW and Carlos Salinas 
        of Amnesty International.
<p>A few months ago Pastrana 
        pulled the wool so far over Mike Wallace's eyes that the December 5 &lt;60 
        Minutes&gt; puff profile, which implicitly endorsed military aid, contained 
        not one word about the army-paramilitary alliance. CBS left viewers with 
        the impression no such alliance existed. 
<p>In a portion of his interview 
        with Pastrana that didn't make the <i>60 Minutes</i> final cut, Wallace 
        did in fact ask the president a series of questions about the links, eliciting 
        dubious answers that satisfied the interrogator. (The unedited, 80-minute 
        Wallace-Pastrana dialogue aired several times on C-SPAN last December.) 
        For example, Wallace asked, &quot;Does the army and the paramilitaries 
        ever go after the guerrillas together?&quot;
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Pastrana replied. 
        &quot;I don't think so. Really, I don't think so.&quot; 
<p>I asked Kirk about that. She 
        said Pastrana's &quot;own Attorney General contradicts him&quot; and directed 
        me to HRW's report &quot;The Ties that Bind.&quot; One passage states:
<p>&quot;In 1997, 1998, and 1999, 
        a thorough Colombian government investigation collected compelling evidence 
        that Army officers worked intimately with paramilitaries under the command 
        of Carlos Casta&ntilde;o [who, I might add, is regarded by the U.S. Drug 
        Enforcement Agency as a &quot;major drug trafficker&quot;]. They shared 
        intelligence, planned and carried out joint operations, provided weapons 
        and munitions, supported with helicopters and medical aid, and coordinated 
        on a day to day basis. Some of the officers involved remain on active 
        duty and in command of troops. . . . 
<p>&quot;Colombia's civilian 
        investigative agencies, in particular the Attorney General's office, are 
        capable of sophisticated and hard-hitting investigations. However, many 
        investigators assigned to cases that implicate the Army and paramilitaries 
        have been forced to resign or to flee Colombia.&quot;
<p>U.S. congressional and journalistic 
        investigators have no such fear, and the lesson for them is clear: Before 
        you buy anything from Pastrana, be sure to bring along some knowledgeable 
        friends. And take a long hard look under the hood.
