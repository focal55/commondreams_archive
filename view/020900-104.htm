<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In truly Orwellian fashion, University of Texas at Austin officials have tried to paint UT student activists' attempt to promote spirited political debate as an attack on free speech.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

When the director of the LBJ Library announced that he had advised Henry Kissinger to cancel his planned Feb. 1 lecture, we were
accused by UT's chancellor and president of "threatening to endanger public safety" through the use of "immoral" tactics. These
charges are, quite frankly, silly as the failure of these officials to give evidence of the threat or even specify the nature of the
danger reveals. Not surprisingly, our invitation to the officials for a public debate about the issues has been rejected.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

We have helped organize dozens of political protests and forums in Austin in the past two years, none of which has been violent;
this one would have been no different. We did not plan to suppress anyone's speech. Instead, we wanted to engage in free speech by
distributing literature that highlighted Kissinger's crimes and by talking to people at the event.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

More important, we wanted Kissinger to speak, and in fact speak more than he usually does in response to tough questions about his
role in the subversion of democracy and violations of international law around the world. We wanted to ask him what he said to Gen.
Suharto in a meeting two days before the Indonesian dictator used U.S.-supplied weapons to begin the genocide in East Timor in 1975.
Why did he work so hard to undermine the democratically elected government of Chile in the 1970s? How does he feel knowing that
hundreds of thousands of Cambodians died in the "secret" war he planned there in 1969?
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

We planned to do what citizens in a democracy have a right and a moral obligation to do -- hold someone who made policy accountable
for his decisions. Free speech does not mean a free ride for policy-makers who support dictators, genocide and illegal wars.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Charges that we restricted Kissinger's speech are ludicrous. It was LBJ Library officials who cut off his opportunity to speak using
manufactured fears of threats to public safety. Furthermore, Kissinger is not lacking in opportunities to speak, especially through
the mass media.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Political dissidents do not get the ongoing opportunities to be heard at great length that Kissinger enjoys. That is why we use
face-to-face discussion, civil disobedience and protest, strategies that have won many of the civil rights we now take for granted.
Such protests are much admired by people in power -- in theory, and so long as they are comfortably in the past. But if we use
peaceful protest effectively in the present, it is likely that police violence will be unleashed, as it was against nonviolent
protesters in Seattle.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

We take seriously the role of a university, not simply to tolerate political discourse but to promote it actively. For democracy to
be meaningful, political discourse must be critical of powerful people and institutions. The late Supreme Court Justice William
Brennan said it best in a landmark free-speech case: Such debate must be "uninhibited, robust and wide-open and may well include
vehement, caustic and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The UT administration has shown that it is ready to fabricate charges in order to demonize dissent, a dangerous sign.
