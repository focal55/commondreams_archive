The attacks on Ralph 
Nader's presidential 
candidacy, on the 
Green Party ticket, 
stir memories that 
stretch back two decades. In 1980, after abandoning the 
Republican primaries, I ran for 
president as an independent candidate. The arguments lodged against 
me then were almost identical to 
those now being waged against Mr. 
Nader. 

<p> When polls taken in the spring of 
1980 showed my support in the range 
of 25 percent, I was promptly labeled 
a "spoiler," driven more by personal ego than conviction. Critics 
charged that my candidacy deprived voters of the opportunity to 
make a clear choice between the 
right-wing conservatism of Ronald 
Reagan and the far more moderate 
incumbent, Jimmy Carter.

<p> My counterargument, based on 
the advice of Erasmus, was simply 
this: When confronted with a choice 
between two evils, do not choose. I 
felt that a systemic problem in our 
political process could only be addressed by taking a new direction.

<p>  Call it the third way. The electoral 
system monopolized and controlled 
by the two majority parties was 
then, and continues to be,  irretrievably broken. More important, the 
two-party system is not constitutionally ordained. 

<p> Our founding fathers worried 
about the effect of party dissension 
on our democracy. James Madison 
wrote that factional strife would obscure a vision of the common good. 
And George Washington warned 
about "the baneful effects of the 
spirit of party." 

<p> The "domination of one faction 
over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension," he said, "is in itself a frightful 
despotism."

<p> The postwar history of divided 
government, with control of the 
White House in the hands of one 
party and control of Congress in the 
other, has all too often been a prescription for gridlock. 

<p>  But internal divisions within the 
major parties have also contributed 
to government disarray. Moderate 
and right-wing Republicans  are in 
strong disagreement, and their inability to be a cohesive political 
force hurts, rather than strengthens, 
the democratic process.

<p>  Dissonance and acrimony have 
disillusioned the voting public. In 
1996, more than 100 million adults 
did not bother to vote in the presidential election, according to the 
Federal Election Commission. And 
President Clinton was chosen by less 
than a majority of the votes cast.

<p> Yes, it is unlikely that Mr. Nader 
will become president. But why 
shouldn't his views be heard? 

<p> Mr. Nader advances issues that 
the major parties are unwilling to 
even broach. For instance, the 
Green Party has advocated "instant-runoff" voting. Under this sensible system, voters cast ballots for 
their first-, second- and third-choice 
candidates. 

<p> If no candidate receives a majority of first-place votes, the top two 
candidates are entered into an instant runoff -- and the second- and 
third-place votes are counted. The 
election would thereby produce a 
winner who wins a  true majority of 
votes. Mary Robinson was elected 
president of Ireland in this fashion, 
as was Ken Livingstone, the mayor 
of London.

<p> Ralph Nader should not simply be 
dismissed as a "spoiler." His candidacy could raise issues and propose 
solutions that may  elevate the political dialogue.   
<p>Most important, his 
candidacy offers the healthy prospect that  millions of voters who now 
feel disenfranchised will become active, interested and involved citizens.
