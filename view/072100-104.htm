<P>   ``TRUST US. We are the government.'' That's what the FBI and other 
federal law enforcement agencies are asking the American public to do 
when they seek to assure us that no one's privacy is being violated 
by its new online wiretapping system.	 
</P>
<P>  The system, aptly if chillingly dubbed Carnivore by the FBI 
itself, forces Internet Service Providers to attach a black box to 
their networks -- essentially a powerful computer running specialized 
software -- through which all their subscribers' communications 
traffic flows.	 
</P>
<P>  With all due respect to the FBI, the American Civil Liberties 
Union is not prepared to take the giant leap of faith that the FBI 
will only look at or capture the small set of communications to which 
they are entitled under a court order. We are determined to discover 
what exactly is being devoured by Carnivore and how the information 
is being used by federal law enforcement agencies.	 
</P>
<P>  To do so, last week we filed a first-of-its-
kind request under the Freedom of Information Act asking the FBI to 
disclose the computer source code and other technical details about 
Carnivore and its predecessors, Omnivore and Etherpeek. Our request 
seeks all agency records, including ``letters, correspondence, tape 
recordings, data, memoranda, computer source and object code, 
technical manuals and technical specifications.''	 
</P>
<P>  It is our belief that only through careful 
examination of Carnivore's computer code -- the set of instructions 
for a program -- can the public determine whether the e-
mail privacy of millions of innocent people is being violated. But 
the outlook isn't good.	 
</P>
<P>Many in the Internet industry and Congress have said that they are 
disturbed by reports of Carnivore because it has the potential to 
eavesdrop on all customers' digital communications, from e-mail and 
instant messages to online banking and Web surfing. The ISPs have 
also emphasized that Carnivore is unnecessary since they can and have 
been providing law enforcement with the targeted communications for 
which they have an order. There is no need for a dragnet when you can 
zero in on a target.	 
</P>
<P>  In traditional wiretaps, the government is required to 
``minimize'' its interception of nonincriminating -- or innocent 
communications. But Carnivore does just the opposite by scanning 
through tens of millions of e-mails from innocent Internet users as 
well as the targeted suspect.	 
</P>
<P>  It is as though the FBI suddenly believes it has the right and 
legal authority to send agents into the post office to rip open each 
and every mailbag and search for one specific letter. To use another 
analogy, Carnivore is like the telephone company being forced to give 
the FBI access to all the calls on its network when it only has 
permission to seek the calls for one subscriber.	 
</P>
<P>  The discovery of the Carnivore system has put a media spotlight on 
efforts by law enforcement officials to expand the government's 
snooping abilities in the electronic age. It used to be, of course, 
that most of the information people wanted to keep private was stored 
in their home and government officials had to obtain a warrant to 
search the property. And to the extent that anyone else gained access 
to a person's most private information, it was 
difficult to store and tougher to collate.	 
</P>
<P>  In today's electronic age, however, an invasion of personal 
privacy is only a point and click away, which the American public 
seems to recognize all too well. A Wall Street Journal poll conducted 
at the end of the last year indicated that Americans were more 
concerned in the new millennium about loss of personal privacy than 
things like terrorism, crime or even the economy.	 
In some ways, the government is listening. Just this week, John 
Podesta, the White House chief of staff, delivered a major policy 
address on electronic privacy that included two potentially 
promising, although limited, legislative proposals for tightening the 
rules on electronic wiretaps. But the speech was long on rhetoric and 
short on action. The administration should have announced a 
suspension of the use of Carnivore. And the president could have 
issued an executive order requiring federal law enforcement agencies 
under his command to adhere to the stricter standards he is proposing 
be enacted into law.	 
</P>
<P>  Those steps would have represented significant advances in 
protecting privacy. Instead, the administration offered legislative 
proposals that are probably doomed to failure since Congress has 
little time left before it recesses for the fall elections. Even 
though it has tried to persuade the American public that it cares 
about cyberprivacy, the Clinton administration's failure to take 
decisive action has proven that the old axiom ``watch what we do, not 
what we say'' applies all too well. The ACLU continues to reject the 
government's ``trust us'' attitude and will work with the next 
administration and Congress to protect the privacy of all Americans 
by ensuring that these latest black-box snooping efforts are banned 
outright.
