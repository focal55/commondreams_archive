WITHIN DAYS, thousands of youthful protesters will crowd the narrow 
streets of Prague, a city known for its beauty, charm and 
sophistication. They are there to protest policies of the 
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which are holding their 
annual meeting this week in the Czech Republic.
<P> Predictably, the media will automatically describe -- and discredit 
</P>
<P>--these activists as ``anti-global'' protesters. But nothing could 
be further from the truth. They are, in fact, the first truly global 
generation for whom world trade and transnational culture are already 
facts of life. What concerns them are the consequences and casualties 
of rapid and unregulated globalization.	 
</P>
<P> We should listen to their message, for what they advocate reflects 
some of America's most cherished ideals.	 
</P>
<P> Their goals are quite clear: to protect people and the planet from 
the galloping momentum of globalization. To that end, they seek to 
protect workers from unfair wages and labor conditions, and to 
safeguard a disintegrating environment.	 
</P>
<P>  Yes, they accuse the IMF/World Bank of undemocratic practices and 
of creating great disparities in wealth around the world. But they 
are not against global trade, nor are they protectionists. Rather, 
they are worried about unregulated free trade. They promote fair 
trade -- a global economy that lifts up all people rather than just 
the wealthy nations.	 
</P>
<P>This is the first genuinely global protest in world history. The 
last time the young demonstrated across the globe was 1968. Then, 
demonstrations that took place in Paris, Mexico, the United States 
and dozens of other countries addressed the domestic or foreign 
policies of individual nations. Today's protesters, coming from all 
parts of the world, are as global as the institutions they oppose.	 
</P>
<P> Spearheading the protests are Central and Eastern European 
Bankwatch, a watchdog group that accuses the IMF and World Bank of 
usury, and INPEG, an East European coalition of Earth Firsters and 
peaceful anarchists.	 
</P>
<P> Joining them will be labor unions, Mexican Zapatistas, Tibetan 
monks, New Zealand Maori tribes, Friends of the Earth International, 
Jubilee 2000 (which advocates debt relief for developing nations), 
Fifty Years is Enough (which protests the secretive nature of 
financial global institutions.	 
</P>
<P>  Next Tuesday, activists will march 
through Prague in a ``day of action.'' Versions of this protest will 
be held in the United States and elsewhere. Leading up to this event 
will be a ``counter summit'' on development policy, a cultural 
festival and workshops on nonviolence -- to which nearly all of them 
are deeply committed.	 
</P>
<P> In hindsight, such a movement was inevitable. With the collapse of 
communism, multinational corporations gained access to new markets. 
Like children in a candy store, some grew giddy at the prospects of 
new resources and workers.	 
</P>
<P> As the gulf between rich and poor nations widened during the '90s, 
it was only a question of time before the have-nots and their 
first-world supporters would demand greater equality, debt relief, 
fair trade, improved labor conditions and protections for the 
environment. The IMF and World Bank, global lenders to the poor -- 
but elected by nobody and accountable to no one -- have turned into 
the institutional symbols of ``unfair'' globalization.	 
</P>
<P> Concerned about such global injustices, Czech President Vaclav 
Havel, a playwright and human rights activist, has ex 
tended a warm welcome to the protesters. Having criticized global 
disparities in wealth, Havel has invited protesters to meet him in 
the Presidential Palace to discuss the problems caused by 
globalization. The mayor of Prague has offered the city's soccer 
stadium as a campground for the protesters.	 
Havel has rightly noted that ``globalization by itself is morally 
neutral. It can be good or bad, depending on the kind of content we 
give to it.'' The spread of human rights, as he points out, is just 
one example of the extremely positive role that globalization has 
played. But Havel -- a leading critic of communism -- has also 
expressed strong reservations about unregulated global trade.	 
Not everyone in Prague is as eager to welcome protesters as is Havel. 
Some 11,000 police, whose leaders were trained by the Washington, 
D.C., Police Department, will be backed by 5,000 soldiers. To prevent 
indoor organizing, the Czech Interior Ministry is closing all 
theaters and schools.	 
</P>
<P>  Also on hand is the FBI's new ``legal 
attache' office in Prague. Its ostensible purpose is to expand 
``cooperative law-enforcement efforts and information sharing'' with 
the Czech Republic. But many activists rightly question -- as should 
the American public -- why the FBI has set up shop in Prague. Some 
organizers -- with considerable historical evidence on their side -- 
accuse the FBI of seeking to infiltrate and spy upon American protest 
groups.	 
</P>
<P>Prague is just a beginning. The events that rocked Seattle last 
November have unleashed a wave of protest from Washington to 
Argentina to Taiwan. As ideas about human rights, environmental 
sustainability, fair labor standards and economic equity circle the 
world, protests will no longer just target nations, but also the 
financial institutions that are shaping the future of our global 
economy and society.	 
</P>
<P> President Havel has pleaded with the media to pay attention to the 
substance of the protest rather than the spectacle.	 
</P>
<P> Whether anyone heeds his plea, however, depends on their ability to 
understand the historical nature of this global event. It is this: A 
new generation is struggling to ensure that the emerging global 
society will be governed by democratic and egalitarian values -- 
surely a great tribute to our country's most hallowed ideals. Listen 
carefully, they deserve to be heard.
