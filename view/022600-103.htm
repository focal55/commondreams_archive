<p>PARIS - An average person in France 
could not help but be familiar with the case of Betty 
Lou Beets, the Texas woman who was executed  on 
Thursday for killing her fifth husband. Her story, 
with particular attention to her assertion that she 
was abused by her father and husbands, has been on 
the front page of many newspapers here.

<p>The French also know about  Odell Barnes, also 
of Texas, who is scheduled to be executed March 1, 
and who has been the subject of  several articles by 
journalists and editorial writers here  contemplating 
whether he is innocent. A few months ago, thousands 
of Parisians took to the streets in support of another 
American inmate: Mumia Abu Jamal, a former 
Black Panther convicted of murder.

<p> The United States may have become accustomed 
 to the revival of the death penalty, but much of 
Western Europe is appalled by it. While executions 
get little notice in American newspapers anymore, 
the United States' willingness to put prisoners to 
death is often scrutinized here.

<p>  In fact, there is  so much political mileage to be 
gotten from criticizing the executions that a candidate for Paris mayor recently went all the way to 
Texas to meet with Mr. Barnes.

<p>     Many Europeans find it a contradiction that the 
United States claims to be a leader in protecting 
human rights when it executed more than 75 people 
last year. Since the 1976 Supreme Court ruling that 
allowed the reinstitution of executions, 38 states have 
adopted a death penalty.

<p>     To many French citizens, deploring the rise in 
executions in the United States is no different from 
taking a stand against Serbian attacks on Kosovo or 
the Russian bombardment of Chechnya. All European Union  countries either ban the death penalty or 
long ago placed a moratorium on its use.

<p>     "For us, what the Americans are doing is completely incomprehensible, that such an advanced 
country can be involved in such an act of barbarism," 
said Henry Leclerc, the president of the Human 
Rights League in Paris, "No European country does 
this. No advanced country does this. America is doing 
it along with countries like China and Russia and 
other countries that have terrible human rights 
records. To us, it looks the same as if the Americans 
were endorsing torture or slavery." 

<p> France gave up the guillotine in 1981, after long 
and heated debate, even though polls showed that the 
majority of the French still favored executions. But 
the numbers have changed significantly since then. A 
recent poll indicated that only 46 percent still favored 
the death penalty. 

<p>  France's neighbors feel much the same. Last 
year, the European Union announced that it would 
submit a resolution to the United Nations Human 
Rights Commission calling for an end to the death 
penalty. The move was seen as a criticism of the 
United States, though it was not mentioned by name.

<p> In Italy, sentiment against the death penalty 
runs particularly strong. More than two million people have signed a petition calling for the death 
penalty to be abolished worldwide.   
<p>The Colosseum is 
illuminated in gold whenever a death sentence is 
commuted anywhere around the world.

<p> One of Italy's leading clothes manufacturers, 
United Benetton, has been running an ad campaign 
with photographs of American inmates on death row 
in seven states. The "We, on death row" ads have 
caused a uproar in the United States. Sears, Roebuck 
& Company says it will stop sales of Benetton USA 
apparel, and Missouri officials have sued the company, saying those who  photographed the inmates 
misrepresented what they were doing.

<p>  Some French rights activists believe that Mr. 
Barnes may have been framed for the murder of a 
friend. Jack Lang, who on Thursday declared his 
candidacy for Paris mayor, made news recently 
when he traveled to Texas to see Mr. Barnes.

<p> Patrick Baudouin, the president of the International League of Human Rights, pointed out that 
France also takes other countries to task for sentencing prisoners to death. But he said the outrage 
reserved for America was special.

<p>  "We think of America as being in our camp -- a 
democracy that defends liberty and human rights," 
he said. "Of the countries we consider in our camp, it 
is the only one that goes on with the death penalty."

<p> He says he is well aware that Americans are not 
listening to European opinion on the matter.

<p>"We know that when we have a press conference 
here, it does not do a lot," Mr. Baudouin said. "But 15 
years ago, no one would have guessed the Berlin Wall 
was coming down. You keep pressing ahead. We are 
in an age of globalization, and sometimes our American friends have a lesson to teach us, and maybe 
sometime we have a lesson to teach them."
