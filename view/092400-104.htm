If Ralph Nader is excluded from the presidential debates, many
issues important to millions of Americans will get little or no attention
during the corporate sponsored face-offs between the two major party
candidates. For example:
<p>The U.S. has 2 million people in jail, the result of a drug policy
that endangers cops and innocent bystanders in a Wild-West strategy of
knocking down doors and screaming, "Police! Freeze!" Even conservatives
have called for some form of drug decriminalization. If Nader isn't
there, the two major party nominees are not likely to touch this "third
rail" issue.
<p>In a country where mentally retarded teenagers have been executed, a
journalism class at Northwestern University conclusively proved the
innocence of death row prisoners, leading to the inmates' freedom. The
Republican governor of Illinois was moved to declare a moratorium on the
death penalty. Al Gore and George W. Bush appear to have a consensus:
"Let's make really, really sure that they're guilty before we kill them."
Without Nader present, don't look for much disagreement on this important
matter during the debates.
<p>The "don't ask, don't tell" policy in the military isn't working. More
gay military personnel have been discharged since the inception of this
policy than before its adoption. Nader believes in equal rights for gays
in every way these protections are extended to all other
Americans--including civil unions. This important position will get no
airing during the debates between the two major party candidates if Nader
isn't there.
<p>For those who oppose the World Trade Organization, the China trade
deal and striker replacement laws, the debates will be a sterile rehash
of the doctrine that holds all trade to be good and "don't sweat the
sweatshops." If Nader's not there, a robust airing of the other side of
trade issues (worker safety, child labor abuse, factory pollution in
Third World countries) won't be heard.
<p>This year's debates will be thin fare without a discussion of
single-payer national health insurance. No matter that 44 million
Americans now live with the anxiety of being wiped out by a major
illness. Single-payer health insurance is unlikely to come up in the
debates at all if Nader isn't there.
<p>The major party candidates have raised 80% more money in this election
cycle than during the same period four years ago. Nader wants campaigns
publicly funded, an idea that would remove the big private and corporate
checkbooks from electoral politics and free candidates to advocate
positions rather than waste time dialing for dollars. Good idea? Don't
look for a vigorous examination of public financing if Nader isn't there.
<p>A review of Nader's positions makes clear the long road he and his
Green Party supporters must travel. Nader's lifelong assault on corporate
power is all the debate sponsors need to know. He is not welcome to share
the stage in a show paid for by Anheuser-Busch, US Airways and AT&T.
<p>A vigorous progressive voice is being silenced with what appears to be
the quiet approval of the TV networks and most of the media. No stranger
to Big Business, major media seem bent on marginalizing the only man in
the race who wants more teeth in regulatory agencies, more enforcement of
antitrust laws, total unqualified guarantees of all constitutional rights
for gays, illegal immigrants and other minorities, more respect for
privacy protections and due process, an end to the commercialization of
children, fewer nonviolent offenders in jail and trade policies that
protect powerless people here and around the world.
<p>Instead of giving the American people a chance to hear this principled
voice, some in the media attempt to redirect our gaze by waving Nader's
stock portfolio. "Aha! Nader made a profit!" A liberal with plumbing is a
hypocrite.
<p>No one took Jesse Ventura seriously until he appeared in gubernatorial
debates in Minnesota. Those of us who support Nader for president don't
want him to become the latest worthy man to be victimized by the adage,
"You can't get on Broadway unless you've been on Broadway."
<p>A Zogby Poll released last week found 61% of those polled want Nader
on the debate stage. Unlike the major party candidates, Ralph Nader is
doing what the people say they want all our candidates to do: forswear
soft money and obey the rules that limit campaign contributions to $2,000
per person.
<p>Because he is not a billionaire, because he obeys the law, the
nation's most powerful private voice for justice, the man who
revolutionized auto safety design, opened up government secrets by
forcing the establishment of the Freedom of Information Act, blew
whistles on faulty products 35 years before the current
Bridgestone/Firestone tragedy, the man who inspired millions of young
people to become active citizens is being shut out of the Great White Way
of presidential politics.
<p>Proud Americans of all political stripes should bang their spoons to
ensure that Nader gets on the Broadway of this campaign--the three
debates sponsored by the debate commission. It could make a big
difference. Ask Jesse Ventura.
