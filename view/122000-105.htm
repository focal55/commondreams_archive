The UN and the US are about to pass up their best chance to halt the 
bloodshed in Israel-Palestine. The UN needs to increase its role, but the US 
is forcing it to scale back. Rather than deploying an armed protection force 
with a defined political mission, the UN is being limited to an unarmed 
observer team whose goals are far from clear. Such proposals misdiagnose the 
problem and may even make matters worse.

<p>The current conflict is a political crisis not a security crisis. But Israel 
and the US persist in framing the situation as street riots rather than as an 
uprising against foreign occupation. This is like the Chinese government 
which still views the Tiananmen Square massacre as a case of poor crowd 
control--a few tanks with faulty brakes and some students that got in the 
way. 

<p>The Palestinians want their land back. They are sending a clear message that 
the peace process must be based on long-established principles of 
international law, but the US is not listening. Fearful of losing its 
monopoly on Middle East diplomacy, the US is watering down the international 
peacekeepers proposals. Only with hands untied can the UN address the 
fundamental political causes of the recent explosion. 

<p>The Oslo process is dead. It promised an end to the occupation. Instead it 
produced 50,000 new settlers and 1,000 more Palestinian homes bulldozed. It 
pledged a sovereign Palestinian state but left all infrastructure 
(electricity, telecommunications, gas, water) in Israeli hands. The Oslo 
formula provided land in pieces not land for peace. The Palestinian state it 
proposed was an archipelago with no free internal passage and surrounded by a 
sea of Israeli settlements, bypass roads and military checkpoints. Its no 
surprise the Camp David talks collapsed. The Palestinians demanded their home 
back, and Israel offered rooms for rent with police stationed in every 
hallway. 

<p>The Israelis want and deserve security. But to get it they must establish 
clear and just borders. Expanding settlements make that impossible. Each new 
settler planted in Palestinian territory requires Israel to deploy a fleet of 
soldiers around him, pulling the Israeli army further and further away from 
their own land. To increase security for all, the UN must help implement 
Israels withdrawal to its 1967 borders. That means an international force 
with teeth and a clear political mandate.

<p>The Israeli government must end the economic inducements for settlers to move 
into the Palestinian territories. These inducements violate international law 
as well as the Oslo agreements in which Israel agreed to freeze settlements. 
Last year, the Israeli organization Peace Now released a poll indicating that 
53% of West Bank settlers had moved to the occupied territories for 
non-ideological reasons: cheap housing, great views and income tax rebates. 
Nearly 34% of the settlers were prepared to evacuate in return for reasonable 
compensation. The UN and the US must facilitate this withdrawal. 

<p>The case of Hebron is informative. Over 2000 Israeli soldiers guard 400 
militant settlers planted in the center of this Palestinian town. In 1994, an 
Israeli settler killed 29 Palestinians. By 1997, tensions had mounted again 
and the UN deployed an observer team in Hebron. Unarmed and lacking a clear 
mission, this UN team has submitted numerous reports but done little else. 
The settlement continues to grow, and in the last two months at least 19 
Palestinians have died in Hebron. Two weeks ago it was reported that Hebron 
settlers opened fire on the convoy of Mary Robinson, UN High Commissioner for 
Human Rights.

<p>The Palestinians do not need observers, they need protectors. Had the UN sent 
only observers to East Timor, those massacres would still be occurring. 
Israel is in flagrant violation of international law. The settlements are 
expanding and the killing is accelerating. With the crime still in progress, 
the UN must dispatch a cops not photographers to the scene.
