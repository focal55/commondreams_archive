NEW YORK 
   -    I sat down on Thursday and reread our Rwanda report from beginning to end, and I thought to myself what an odyssey of pain this has been. Pain at what we saw, pain at what we heard, pain at what we learned.
<P>
 It's impossible to undertake a study of this kind without shattering emotional consequence. It's true what people say: You never quite see the world the same way again.<P>
 But it's not just emotional. It's intellectual. The conclusions we came to were pretty shocking. They may not have been revelatory (Rwanda has been talked of and written of a great deal) but the inescapable conclusions distressed all of us greatly.<P>
 We repudiate the position of the government of France, the position that asserts that they had no responsibility. They were closer in every way to the Habyarimana regime than any other government; they could have stopped the genocide before it began. They knew exactly what was happening.<P>
 Worse, under the cover of Op&eacute;ration Turquoise, which had a limited humanitarian dimension, they facilitated the exodus of a huge number of g&eacute;nocidaires, thereby ushering in the larger Great Lakes catastrophe.<P>
 They even engaged in the shipment of arms throughout the genocide and after. There is almost no redemptive feature to the conduct of the government of France.<P>
 The role of the United States at the Security Council, in determinedly blocking a more effective UN intervention force throughout the genocide, is an almost incomprehensible scar of shame on American foreign policy.<P>
 The United States, too, knew exactly what was going on. It's simply beyond belief that because of Somalia, hundreds of thousands of Rwandans needlessly lost their lives. I want to say, as a personal observation, I don't know how Madeline Albright lives with it.<P>
 We do, however, know how the Canadian general Romero Dallaire lives with it. He doesn't. In many ways, he's a broken man. But our panel absolutely endorses General Dallaire's submission that with a sufficient UN force, he could have stopped the genocide completely, or at the very least saved hundreds of thousands of lives. If there is one exemplary human being in all of this, it's General Dallaire.<P>
 And I want to make the additional point: When the Western nations wanted to get troops into Rwanda quickly, it could be done in the flash of an eye. Witness the evacuation of foreign nationals; witness the astonishing rapidity with which Op&eacute;ration Turquoise was assembled.<P>
 The government of Belgium has a great deal to atone for. Its panic in the face of the death of its 10 peacekeepers turned into an inglorious effort to throttle United Nations involvement. Very sad, really, because before that the Belgians had played an honorable role.<P>
 As to the UN Secretariat, a directive was sent from headquarters in New York to General Dallaire indicating that the UN forces could, if absolutely necessary, exceed their mandate in one solitary circumstance: the evacuation of foreign nationals. We, the panel, viewed the directive with incredulity. It was a shocking double standard. No such directive was ever issued on behalf of the rescue of Rwandans.<P>
 Everyone responsible, in one respect or another, has at least apologized, with the exception of the government of France and the Catholic Church. We specifically name the Catholic Church because its involvement with President Juv&eacute;nal Habyarimana before the genocide, and the involvement of some of is leaders during the genocide, was entirely unforgivable.<P>
 The reverberations of the genocide continue to be felt throughout the Great Lakes, and here again the so-called international community has behaved inexplicably. The failure to disarm the refugee camps, once the g&eacute;nocidaires had crossed into the then Zaire, was not only politically and morally incomprehensible, it led inexorably to the quagmire with which the world is now confronted.<P>
 As always, violence begets violence, madness begets madness. We, the panel, sadly came to the conclusion that the Rwanda Patriotic Front during the civil war of 1990 to '94, and then the forces of the present Rwandan government during the refugee crisis post-genocide, committed grave abuses of human rights. The abuses are intolerable and unacceptable. But history tells us that the potential for those abuses will never end until the g&eacute;nocidaires are disarmed and Rwanda's borders are secure.<P>
 Rwanda is a state struggling with demons. It is remarkable how well it is doing despite a genocide just six years ago. It deserves massive assistance from the rest of the world, particularly from those countries who betrayed Rwanda when it needed the world most.<P>
 That is why, among our many recommendations, the proposal for reparations seems to us to have particular cogency. If the secretary-general of the United Nations can find the formula, and we believe that to be possible, then the international community will have come some small way to restoring its tattered moral core.
<P>
 <i>Mr. Lewis, a former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations, was appointed by the Organization of African Unity to an International Panel of Eminent Personalities to Investigate the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda and the Surrounding Events. This comment has been adapted by the International Herald Tribune from his opening statement when the panel's report was presented at UN headquarters on Friday.</i>
