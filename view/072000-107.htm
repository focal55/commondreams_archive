HISTORY IS full of surprises. Just when you think the past is safely 
behind you, some inquisitive soul discovers yet a few more pieces of 
paper that recasts how you look at our nation's history.	 

<P>  Consider our country's Capitol. Next time you visit Washington, 
D.C., gaze up at the bronze statue perched on top of the dome. It is 
called ``Freedom.'' Yet few admiring visitors know that 12 slaves not 
only cast the statue, but also devised a method for hoisting it up to 
its present pinnacle. Nor do most visitors know that some 400 slaves 
also built the Capitol Building and the White House as well.	 
</P>
<P>  The legacy of slavery, which has so profoundly affected our 
society and culture, is still being revealed.	 
</P>
<P>  Historians have long known that the slave trade flourished in the 
nation's capital until 1865. But they knew few details about the 
slaves who worked in Washington, D.C.	 
</P>
<P>  While researching the 200th anniversary of the White House and the 
Capitol, Edward Hotaling, a local Washington-based television 
reporter, unearthed pay slips dating from 1792 to 1800 in the 
archives of the Treasury Department. Each pay slip bears the name of 
the plantation owner, as well as the $5-monthly wage paid for the 
work of his slave.	 
</P>
<P>  Now, two centuries after George Washington established the 
nation's capital, lawmakers and historians are trying to decide 
how to publicly acknowledge the fact that slaves, whose names are 
still not known, and who were never paid, constructed the nation's 
most distinguished architectural symbols of freedom.	 
</P>
<P>  The revelation of this new evidence has inspired two African 
America members of Congress, Reps. J.C Watts, R-Okla., and John 
Lewis, D-Ga., to launch a campaign to create some kind of memorial to 
the slaves who built the nation's Capitol. Said Lewis, ``We need to 
find a fitting and lasting memorial for these men in the building 
they built. It is strange and very sad that the men who laid the 
foundation of the best-known symbol of our democracy were denied the 
right to participate in our democracy.''	 
</P>
<P>  Together, Watts and Lewis, erstwhile ideological adversaries, have 
called upon Congress to form a task force to examine the 
contributions of these unpaid slaves and recommend what type of 
permanent exhibition of memorial should mark their accomplishments.	 
</P>
<P>  Too few Americans realize that slaves not only built the South, 
but also created the wealth of the North, too. The crime of slavery, 
moreover, has created a national wound that has never healed. The 
more we acknowledge the heinous reality of the past, the more we will 
understand why the legacy of slavery still haunts us today.
