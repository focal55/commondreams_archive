<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1962, at age 13, I too was a Cuban-American child who was kept in the United States without my parents. Only recently I learned that my parents, like Elian Gonzalez's father, were victims of a major political battle between the United States and Cuba and not fully free to to determine my sister's future and my own.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the early '60s, my sister, age 11, and I were among 14,000 Cuban children sent unaccompanied by parents to the United States in an operation similar to the Kindertransports that rescued German Jewish children from Nazi-occupied countries in the 1930s. We Cuban children were part of Operation Pedro Pan. The Central Intelligence Agency files regarding this operation continue to be classified as national security secrets.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maria De Los Angeles Torres, a former Pedro Pan child, was denied government files researching her new book, ''In the Land of Mirrors: Cuban Exile Politics in the United States,''  in which she states that Operation Pedro Pan was part of a State Department-CIA plan.  The origins of the operation are still open to speculation, but it is clear that US-backed propaganda frightened Cuban parents into thinking that the Castro  government was going to take their children away and send them to the Soviet Union for indoctrination, she wrote.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Half of us - 7,000 children - never saw our parents again. Had we remained in Cuba, the argument went, Castro would have taken us from our parents to farm schools to pick tomatoes, make us good communists, and force us to study in the Soviet Union. My sister and I were separated  from our parents for a year and a half, and ended up picking plums in  California to earn a little extra money.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cuban-American arguments claim Elian faces no future if he is returned to Cuba, the reason his mother risked her life and died for Elian to be free in the United States. When I first saw Elian's image appear on television  running away from the cameras in Miami, I ached for the way he was being used and wanted to cry out: Leave the boy alone! He just lost his mother!</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was eerie to hear those same arguments that were used to justify sending my sister and me and 14,000 other Cuban children of Pedro Pan to the States  without our parents.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I constantly feel the emotional pain of my own many losses as I follow  the daily news and I fear for Elian. Even now, I still feel foreign in this country where I hold citizenship, even though both my sister and I are highly educated, successful people. I remember clearly the loss of my parents for that long year and a half, a time of great fear and  anxiety that can never be fully healed. There were my great losses: the Spanish language, the Cuban soil, my warm extended family, and my national identity as tied to the place where I was born. I could lay blame for my sense of loss on Fidel Castro, or on the John Kennedy administration, both of whom used us Pedro Pan children as political capital during the Cold War. But that doesn't heal the enduring pain.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a mother and new grandmother, I hope to be able to continue to love my daughter and grandchild close at hand and not far away.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This political theater that passes for news is not about Elian Gonzalez, but about Little Havana against La Habana. I see the Cuban government exploiting Elian Gonzalez's absence as thousands of women wave his image with Cuban flags. Indignant Cuban-Americans in Miami also wave Cuban flags, holding on to Elian's fate as if they could recapture the Cuba they left so many years ago if the boy could stay in the land of the free.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both the Cuban-American community and US politicians concerned with their own imminent elections are reacting to the Cuban government's spectacle, not to concerns for Elian's personal fate.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have one question for the Cuban-American community and for all Americans: If almost 40 years ago we 14,000 children were sent to this country ostensibly so that our parents could determine our fate, why doesn't Elian's father get to determine his son's fate?  Elian Gonzalez has incurred great losses  that will require an entire lifetime to mourn. Why not allow him to begin to deal with those losses in the arms of his father and grandmothers?</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a US citizen, I would like to see politicians from both parties stop using children as political fodder. As in Elian's case and mine, such political theater obscures the obvious failure of the United States and Cuban governments to redefine US-Cuban relations.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Caring citizens must demand that leaders stop the 40-year practice of using Cuban children as proxies in their fight and start exploring ways to normalize relations between Cuba and the United States.</font>
