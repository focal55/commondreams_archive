<p>A specter is haunting cyberspace -- the specter of e-vandalism.

	
<p>Media alarms have been loud recently: Electronic commerce is under siege.
A virtual crime wave threatens to wreak havoc on the World Wide Web. Any
site is vulnerable, no matter how big.

	
<p>Let's not bother to shed tears for the likes of E*Trade, Amazon.com and
Buy.com. Sympathy seems misplaced for massive outfits that are blights on
the Web as they strip-mall every pixel in reach. And I can't summon much
empathy for the targeted website run by the Time Warner subsidiary CNN, a
cable giant with millions of viewers every day.

	
<p>But at the same time, even when electronic attacks occur against corporate
sites with little or no socially redeeming value, I won't cheer for
cyber-saboteurs. Efforts to censor or block communication are odious --
whether based in government offices, corporate suites or secret hacker
locations.What we need is not less but more speech: and especially more
diverse speech.

	
<p>Predictably, officials in Washington responded feverishly as FBI
anti-hacking squads moved into action. The aggrieved firms were mostly huge
players in e-commerce and mass media, accustomed to always reaching large
numbers of people. So, the cyber-disruptions were egregious. "We are
committed in every way to tracking down those who are responsible,"
Attorney General Janet Reno told a news conference.

	
<p>Top law enforcers are eager to catch the culprits who interfere with the
communication systems of well-capitalized enterprises. But there is no
search for clues as to why millions of Americans are excluded from big
media if they happen to be poor. What about their right to be widely heard
-- via TV, radio, major print outlets or heavily trafficked websites?

	
<p>The muzzling of voices that lack corporate backing is so routine that we
do not expect to hear them in the first place. And no official in
Washington declares a commitment to "tracking down those who are
responsible." We don't see any investigative units rushing to probe the
constraints on the freedom of low-income people to be heard.

	
<p>If it's going to provide nutrients for the flowering of democracy, speech
can't be bottled up. In this country, just about everyone has freedom of
speech, at least in a narrow sense. But what about freedom to be heard?

	
<p>Tacit censorship is especially bad for those who live inside the nation's
jails and prisons. As a practical matter, the nearly 2 million people
behind bars in this country rarely have direct access to the public's eyes
or ears. We don't expect to see them exercising their First Amendment
rights on television or hear them expressing their views on the radio, or
see their websites for that matter. Yet America's prisoners have freedom of
speech -- they can always talk to the walls.

	
<p>"The most beautiful thing in the world is freedom of speech," the Greek
philosopher Diogenes remarked about 24 centuries ago. He neglected to
mention freedom to be heard.

	
<p>In the here and now, theoretical assurances about freedom of speech are
presumed to suffice. Politicians mouth the requisite platitudes. Generally,
we nod in agreement or nod off in boredom.

	
<p>Facing the wrath of corporate America and government agencies, the
insurgent hackers now making headlines are living dangerously. Their slight
interference with the rights of corporations to be widely heard is a
definite no-no. Too bad we haven't been able to summon such outrage against
the social order's continual interference with the rights of poor people to
be heard by the public.

	
<p>In effect, a price tag is dangling from the First Amendment. Those with
deep pockets enjoy its full freedoms in news media. Those with empty
pockets are pretty much beside the point; the constant blocking they face
creates no headlines and sparks no vows of remedial action from
Washington's movers and shakers. Just another typical day in the media
neighborhood.

	
<p>"The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor
to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread," the
writer Anatole France commented a century ago. Today, the media terrain
offers a similar kind of equity.
