The violence in Jerusalem, Gaza, and the West Bank could make you weep - with various emotions.
<P>
<P>There is, of course, the grief one feels for those killed or hurt.
<P>
<P>There is the choking rage at the initiating provocation by Ariel Sharon, whose foray into the disputed acreage last week was a breathtaking act of political narcissism.
<P>
<P>There is an acute worry for the many thousands of ordinary Palestinians whose burdened lives have once again been yoked to the blind fury of their most hate-wounded fighters.
<P>
<P>There is frustration at the righteous posturing of world leaders and commentators who so easily fall back on the bigoted mental construct that reviles intensely the religious feelings of Jews and Muslims alike, as if religion itself is the problem.
<P>
<P>And, equally, there is the feeling of bitter shame at what we human beings can do in the name of God.
<P>
<P>But who is a writer at work in the safe detachment of a Boston study to offer up reactions to this latest round of Middle East mayhem? Such observations can seem to be another judging insult to those whose lives are at risk in the neighborhoods of the Old City or on the streets of Nablus. But Jerusalem is unlike Belgrade or Belfast. The holy city and its environs root the imaginations of many of us, not just mythically or even religiously.
<P>
<P>Precisely because of its character as a contested city, organized around an apparently impossible argument, Jerusalem has become the test of a broad human resolve to live differently on this planet. Its collapse into violence represents not merely the tragedy of Zion, to adapt Bernard Avishai's phrase, but a savage blow to widely held hopes that peace can be more than an impossible dream.
<P>
<P>It can worsen matters on the bloodied ground to treat it as symbolic; there is nothing symbolic about blood in the gutters. Before Jerusalem is anything else, it is a place like any other, where men, women, and children want, first, to live without fear of being blown up.
<P>
<P>That Jerusalem  has a transcendent significance to those same men, women and children is what makes it dangerous. That it has such significance across the world must not overwhelm the simple reality of those who live there. That said, simple reality also includes the broader meanings that make us not only want to weep, but, even now, to imagine new possibilities of peace.
<P>
<P>Last summer at Camp David, Yasser Arafat made a foolish mistake in ignoring Ehud Barak's willingness to entertain new approaches to sovereignty over the contested holy site in the heart of Jerusalem. For an Israeli leader to have offered such an opening could seem an astounding display of political courage. At the very least, it showed how far the peace process had come. But Barak's readiness to discuss arrangements involving international control over the Temple Mount/Noble Sanctuary reflected more than his own vision.
<P>
<P>Many Israelis have come to see the obsolescence of univocal territorial claims over space that is sacred to Jews and Muslims alike. Barak's courage consisted in speaking for them.
<P>
<P>Arafat's insistence on complete and absolute Palestinian sovereignty over the Temple Mount/Noble Sanctuary, a narrow national claim which could be seen to violate even Islamic meanings which are themselves transnational, not only shut down Camp David, but it relieved the pressure on those in Israel who, in fact, see things with equal narrowness. Arafat not only left Barak out on the limb to which Sharon has taken a saw: Arafat provided the saw. The Palestinian people, and perhaps Israel's own Arab population, are now paying the price for Arafat's intransigence.
<P>
<P>When the violence stops, much will have been lost, and extreme voices from both sides will be heard above all others. But the fact will remain that Israel has now openly begun to consider once unthinkable ideas for resolving the Jerusalem conundrum, and surely most Israelis will understand more urgently than ever the necessity for moving to that resolution.
<P>
<P>One can only hope that Palestinians, too, will have come to such a view. Violence will have shown itself again as the dead end it is. Exclusive claims to ground that, by definition, can never be possessed exclusively will be revealed as obstacles to every hope.
<P>
<P>The blood spilled is gone forever, and the loved ones laid to rest will be a permanent source of grief. But grief is a cry not only for what is lost, but for what remains. Grief, too, can show the way to peace.
