SO CONGRESSWOMAN Loretta Sanchez, D-Garden Grove, was finally forced to move 
her Tuesday night fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion because Democratic 
Party bigwigs were afraid the Hefner connection would sully their image. 
Isn't this all a little silly? And just a wee bit hypocritical, too?
<P>  The Demos don't seem to blanche and cover their mortal souls with fig 
leaves when they hold $50,000-a-plate fund-raising dinners with CEOs of 
companies that bar unions from their hotels, pollute rivers, build bombs, 
use sex to sell anything from toothpaste to tractors, or create movies that 
glorify teenage lust and/or sickening doses of violence and mayhem. We don't 
see either party quivering in their boots when lobbyists of every stripe 
wine and dine them, schmoozing members of Congress into frequently voting 
against the public good and for the corporate good.	 
</P>
<P>  Where are the horrified gasps and overly sober statements of concern when 
our armed forces are dispatched to every corner of the globe to protect the interests of Big Oil (the Middle East) and 
Big Banana (Central America)? Neither of the major political parties gets 
terrifically animated when it's revealed that some 44 million people are 
living without health insurance in this great nation of ours. But, lo and 
behold, open the doors of the Playboy Mansion and suddenly there's a very 
grave issue of global magnitude.	 
</P>
<P>  And what exactly was the problem? Hugh Hefner's pocketbook has opened 
freely to help fill the coffers of Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore 
</P>
<P>--the pipe-
smoking hedonist reportedly has contributed some $1,500 to Gore's campaign.	 
</P>
<P>  Not exactly a donation that will sew up the election for the Dems, but 
enough to raise the eyebrows of the pundits on CNN's ``Crossfire'' and 
preachers from Bob Jones University. Plenty of other groups have used the 
mansion for their fund-raisers, including such politically correct 
organizations as the National Women's Political Caucus, the Hollywood 
Women's Political Committee and Rock the Vote. Clearly, there must be 
something more alluring 
about Hefner's pad than simply the potential sighting of big breasts and 
curvaceous bottoms.	 
</P>
<P>  So why all the alarm? Obviously, there's the Clinton factor -- Gore and 
his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, are doing their darndest to scrub 
the taint of Clinton's sexual fiascoes from the image of their party. And 
Hefner's parties are not exactly the right ingredient to help in that 
effort. But, come on, isn't Playboy magazine and its attendant industries an 
accepted part of American culture by now? Doesn't every schoolboy in America 
have a secret part of their heart dedicated to the titillating pages of 
Hefner's rag? Hasn't Hugh presented some of the best fiction of this nation 
in his pages and hasn't he consistently fought for the sacred privileges of 
the First Amendment?	 
</P>
<P>What's the big deal? Sex.	 
</P>
<P>  That's the big deal. This is the national bugaboo which dare not speak 
its name. From Nathaniel Hawthorne's ``Scarlet Letter'' to the liaisons of 
Marilyn and JFK to Monica and Bill frolicking in the 
Oval Office, sexuality has been America's fiercest enemy. It's our own 
carnal appetites that terrify us. And our appetites are fed continuously by 
the advertising and entertainment businesses, businesses which will cross 
any boundary to market and sell their products. The Republicans hinted at it 
with their squeaky-clean convention and their refusal to even discuss the 
sexual orientation of Mary Cheney, Dick Cheney's openly gay 31-year-old 
daughter. Now with their treatment of Congresswoman Sanchez, the Dems have 
made it official: sex has been barred from the national agenda.	 
</P>
<P>  But they'd better watch out: as Hugh Hefner knows so well (he should, 
he's been making a good living at it for almost 50 years), when the mystery, 
confusion and beauty of sexuality are denied their natural and rightful 
place in the national psyche, they have a curious way of becoming the focus 
of attention, whether we like it or not.
