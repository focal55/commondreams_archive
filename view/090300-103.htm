Holding up a map of Southeast Asia, the government of Panama last week sent U.S. officials the diplomatic equivalent of "Hell, no, we won't go." Any way you looked at the map, signposts pointed to a quagmire in the southern hemisphere. 
<P>
   In nearby Colombia, President Clinton and a bipartisan entourage of 35 U.S. officials were not amused by this rebuff. They had wanted to use the Central American nation as a staging area to fight Marxist-backed narcotics-trafficking in Colombia. 
<P>
   There they were in Cartagena -- all set for lights, camera and action -- when Panama pulled the plug. Right behind Panama was Venezuela, whose president, Hugo Chavez, said such intervention, albeit at Colombia's behest, "could lead us to a Vietnamization of the whole Amazon region." 
<P>
   Not at all, said Clinton. "This is not Vietnam," he insisted, "nor is it Yankee imperialism." Republicans and Democrats in his entourage agreed. 
<P>
   As the politicians once more scrutinize the definition of "is," here's what to expect now that the Washingtonians are safely back in their brownstones thousands of miles from Bogota. 
<P>
   Americans, through Plan Colombia and congressional approval of a $1.3 billion aid package, have just entered Colombia's 40-year-old civil war and have done so with no exit in sight. (See Vietnam.) 
<P>
   That strategic oversight combines with a bizarre anti-human-rights arrangement that undermines whatever good intentions are behind the war on narco-trafficking. Blood will be on <i>Democratic</i> and <i>Republican</i> hands long after the Clinton administration expires. 
<P>
  Panamanians can see what's coming. And Panama's president has a good memory. 
<P>
   Not only does the Colombian initiative evoke the Vietnam quagmire, but a military escalation in the region would, as Panamanians insist, represent regressive, rather than progressive, policy. Nations bordering Colombia want diplomacy and dialogue to end the civil war, not just the drug war. 
<P>
   In Colombia it's difficult to tell guerrillas from drug traffickers because sometimes they inhabit the same body. Sometimes the drug lords use civilians as shields, the way the Vietcong did. It's pure folly to trust the Colombian military, recipient of 60 helicopters from Uncle Sam, to not target civilians given its record thus far. 
<P>
   At the same time the Central American region moves toward further democratization, this buildup in foreign aid and materiel -- virtually certain to be followed by more advisers and possibly deployments -- tilts things in the wrong direction. This is Vietnam and Nicaragua all rolled into one. 
<P>
   In Reagan's presidency, when $1 million daily went to El Salvador and Thomas Pickering was U.S. ambassador there, it was a Republican administration and a Democratic Congress. Now there's a Democratic president and Republican Congress. And Pickering, promoted to under secretary of state, oversees U.S. policy supportive of Colombian President Andres Pastrana's $7.5 billion Plan Colombia. 
<P>
   In Reagan's day, U.S. funds went to fight leftist guerrillas in Nicaragua. Under Clinton, money goes to fight Marxist-backed coca-growers in Colombia. It took the diplomacy of the Contadora nations, not just military might, to get peace in Central America. It may take such an alliance, not the prescribed foreign military aid, to bring peace to Colombia. 
<P>
   But where there's drugs and money, there's the potential for wrong. In the Iran-contra scandal of the Reagan administration, some Americans took part in drugs-for-arms-for-hostages schemes. Here's what has happened already with Colombia. 
<P>
   In July, a federal judge sentenced Col. James Hiett, former commander of the U.S. military's anti-drug operation in Colombia, to five months in prison for trying to launder $25,000 in cash from his wife's heroin and cocaine operation. The U.S. Embassy in Bogota was used as a point of transfer. 
<P>
   Also consider: The U.S. aid package, including helicopters and military "advisers," comes just as Republicans have blamed Clinton for stretching military commitments too far. Yet, GOP support for Plan Colombia stretches things further over time. 
<P>
   But that's OK because, as House Speaker Dennis Hastert said, it's necessary. The Illinois Republican said last week in Colombia, "For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we can't afford to let this fail." 
<P>
   Here's how else Congress will spin this venture: The Colombian aid package is a supplement to a military construction bill that would, conceivably, improve conditions for U.S. troops domestically. 
<P>
   Supporters of Plan Colombia insist this won't be a U.S. military operation but that story won't hold up for long. Colombian rebels vowed to oppose  "U.S. aggression." <i>The Miami Herald</i> last week reported that U.S. Brig. Gen. Keith Martin of the Southern Command will oversee the military aspects of the Colombian package. 
<P>
   This won't be a tidy operation by a longshot. 
<P>
