<p>SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. - They sat around a table last weekend - the cleareyed, lesbian carpenter, the dabbler in Old Order Mennonite life, the passionate young woodsman, the urban child of divorce, the cautious, fascinated family of four - and asked themselves: Are these the people I want in my utopia?
<P>
<P>It was not an idle question. Two months from now, a core group of members plans to break ground on Meadowdance, an ambitious and, they hope, long-term experiment in community living.<P>
<P>As its members quit their jobs in other communities and prepare to move to a stunning hillside in Plainfield, in north-central Vermont, Meadowdance's founders must convince skeptics that the ''intentional community'' they propose is different from the unstructured communes that frequently self-destructed in the 1960s and 1970s.<P>
<P>Still driven by the same idealistic notions - at Meadowdance it's ''a child-centered, egalitarian community that welcomes human diversity, ecological sensibility, mutual learning, and joy'' - today's utopian visionaries are well aware of attempts that failed, and resolved to build their worlds more carefully.<P>
<P>So, stomping the snow from their boots, a stream of people attracted by <a href="http://www.meadowdance.org/">Meadowdance's Web site</a> came to a house in this Burlington suburb for a process that is part first date, part college admission, and part job interview. The mutual selectivity shows how far the movement has come since the 1960s, said Laird Schaub, executive secretary of the Fellowship for Intentional Communities, who likes to say that new communities, like new restaurants, usually don't live to see their second birthdays. 
<P>
<P>''There were communities that started out, `Hey, y'all come, you're welcome,''' said Diana Christian, editor of Communities magazine. ''I tell new communities: You can't afford to do that. Choose people as carefully as if you're going to marry them.''<P>
<P>On a recent weekend, the courting featured quantities of ''organic'' macaroni and cheese, an introduction to the power drill, and extensive powers of visualization. At present, Meadowdance is a plan, not a place; Plainfield's Planning Commission could still block the building plans, forcing  members to push off their move-in date by a year.<P>
<P>The 17 adults and children who have committed to the idea have $140,000 in cash assets and an option to buy the $240,000, 165-acre parcel of land in Plainfield.<P>
<P>They also have a fledgling software testing firm whose income, they hope, will help pay for construction of a $500,000 community building, members' food and health care, and - down the road - contribute toward college tuition for children.<P>
<P>Income will not be shared, but members will be required to allot an amount of time to work for the community. Although prospective members will not pay to join Meadowdance, those seeking admission will undergo a ''financial evaluation that must tell the community whether or not it can afford to take on a person,'' according to the group's Web site.<P>
<P>Among its nine adult founders are Sue and John Morris, ages 52 and 33, a long-haired couple fond of contra dancing. Sue Morris describes herself as the collective's ''house grandmother.'' <P>
<P>The founders would like to start with 20 adults and add a few people every year to a peak of 75. But with 70 interested visitors and e-mail correspondents contacting the 3-year-old project, Sue Morris confesses to being exhausted by the stream of people eager to be accepted by the community.  One woman, intrigued with the concept presented on the Web site, drove from Connecticut to meet the Morrises and was so astounded by their appearance that she blurted out, ''Oh, my God, they're hippies.''<P>
<P>Most of the time, visitors who are not ready to join the group opt out gracefully. In newer communities that are actively recruiting members, the task of marketing the idea and meeting interested parties can be overwhelming. One community, Dancing Rabbit in Missouri, had 150 visitors last year and accepted 10 new members. Christian's magazine has coined the term ''seeker fatigue.''<P>
<P>Sue Morris, sitting barefoot on a couch, said she tries to take the comings and goings philosophically.<P>
<P>''One person said to me last night, `I want something more austere. This is too middle-class for me,''' Morris said. ''In general, I don't feel hurt about people who don't want to be in this community, unless,'' she added, ''they're someone I really like.''<P>
<P>The tables turn as soon as would-be members declare their intention to become either a provisional ''seeker'' who would live at Meadowdance for four to six weeks while exploring membership, or a fully committed ''founding member'' whom the core group would accept or reject after several weeks.<P>
<P>By the end of the weekend, Jeff McKenzie asked to be considered a founding member and climbed back onto a bus for a long ride back to Gasport.  An amiable 45-year-old with a close-cropped beard, McKenzie is no stranger to communal living. He once wore the straw hat and suspenders of the Old Order Mennonites, only to leave when he finally understood that the sect he had joined believed that only 100 families from Scottsville, Ky., would be admitted to heaven. <P>
<P>More recently, he journeyed to California to join a 10-month Peace Walk, but left, disillusioned, after five days with a group of raucous twentysomethings.<P>
<P>McKenzie's search for ''a sense of family'' is remarkably systematic: In his bag is a letter of introduction detailing his financial status, work history, and lack of ''special dietary requirements.''<P>
<P>Although he is still interested in pursuing membership in Meadowdance, McKenzie is also planning to visit Twin Oaks, a venerable Virginia community founded in 1967, and East Wind in Missouri, where members have shared profits from producing hammocks and sandals since 1976. Failing those, he's interested in Sandhill Farm, an eight-person collective in Rutledge, Mo., that hopes to add four members; Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage, also in Rutledge, a group of 19 who build their houses ''using alternative techniques such as straw bale and cob''; and Acorn Community, an income-sharing group of 16, seven miles from Twin Oaks in Virginia.<P>
<P>Quests like McKenzie's have become more sophisticated in recent years, as information about the communities became centralized. The new edition of the Fellowship for Intentional Communities' directory will list 625 groups, up from 325 in 1990 and 540 in 1995.<P>
<P>Meanwhile, more people are looking for an alternative to ''nuclear family life in the suburbs and commuting to and from a job that they may or may not be interested in,'' as Christian put it. With a surge of interest, especially from older people whose children have left home, said the fellowship's Schaub, communities that may have had vacancies 10 years ago are filling up. <P>
<P>So both seekers and communities are learning to be specific about what they are looking for. On the fellowship's Web site, one prospective member posted a desire for landscapes that are ''curvy, not rectilinear,'' and another requested ''the purposeful absence of domestic animals and pet animals.'' One group looking for new members advertised itself as ''clothing-optional,'' with plans for ''a hot tub, yurt, and a self-healing center.'' <P>
<P>And many lay out fine gradations of ecological purity, spiritual principles, or independence from the US monetary system. ''Although we like nature, we are not necessarily into getting off the grid and outdoor toilets (been there and done that),'' reads one posting.<P>
<P>Experience - some of it bitter - has pushed forward the science of what makes utopian visions succeed, said Donald Pitzer of the University of Southern Indiana's Center for Communal Studies. A wave of academic scholarship has sprung up based on the American communal experience, he said.<P>
<P>''What you have is a group of people who are much more educated in what's happened in the past,'' said Pitzer. <P>
<P>But when John Morris recently led a small group of visitors through thigh-high snow to the hilltop where Meadowdance proposes to build, nobody was talking about the past. With his ragged Cornell ski team jacket vivid against the snow, Morris showed them where founders hope to build their community building, grow apple trees, and tap a sugarbush for maple syrup.<P>
<P>Serena Torry, a 25-year-old from Western Massachusetts who dreams of breaking ground on her own organic farm, looked out at Spruce Mountain and felt some of her skepticism about Meadowdance's finances drift away. <P>
<P>''Do you notice how ever since I got here I'm saying, `Now what are we doing?''' she said, laughing and emphasizing the ''we.''<P>
<P>At the end of the weekend, two men - McKenzie and 25-year-old Chris Chaisson - had asked to be considered founding members. Three adults asked to be seekers:Anna Flynn, a 20-year-old who wants to start a ''free school'' like the one her father helped found in Massachusetts; Bob Carlson, 46, who saw power struggles sink a commune he helped found in the 1970s; and Carlson's wife, Franny Huberman, 27, who hesitates to uproot their two young children from Gould Farm, a service-based community in Monterey, Mass.<P>
<P>''I'm not the type of person who necessarily easily makes a leap of faith,'' Huberman said.<P>
<P>For John Morris, like the rest of the founders, doubt is an old enemy. <P>
<P>''It's difficult to say it's going to work because I know it will,'' he said. ''But that's all I can say.''<P>
