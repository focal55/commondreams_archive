It is a reasonably safe bet that come November Vice President Al Gore or
Texas Gov. George W. Bush will be elected president of the United States.
<p>But here is an even safer bet: If Americans see their choice as being limited
to Democrat Gore and Republican Bush, most of them won't vote.</p>
<p>Indeed, if the fall campaign plays out as nothing more than Bush vs. Gore, a
dangerous decline in democracy will accelerate to crisis level.</p>
<p>In 1996, only 48 percent of eligible voters bothered to cast ballots in the
dismal race between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole -- the lowest rate of
participation in more than 70 years.</p>
<p>In 1998, only 36 percent of eligible voters expressed their sentiments in the
critical elections for the Congress that would decide whether to impeach
Clinton, go to war in Kosovo and approve most-favored-nation trading status for
China.</p>
<p>This troubling trend is studied by academics, pundits and pollsters. But it
can be explained with simple logic: As the Democratic and Republican parties
have abandoned principle and ideology in pursuit of campaign money, they have
blurred their messages sufficiently to prove true George Wallace's long-ago
dismissal of the two major parties: &quot;There's not a dime's worth of
difference between them.''</p>
<p>While party apologists struggle to distinguish their nominees, citizens have
learned to see through the smoke screen. Most Americans look at the stilted,
uninspired, ill-defined &quot;choices'' presented to them on Election Day and
say, &quot;Why bother?''</p>
<p>How do we end the malaise that has settled upon American democracy? Short of
fundamental campaign finance reforms -- the &quot;bridge too far'' for most
Democratic and Republican politicians -- there is only one step that could be
taken this <i>year </i>to energize the electoral process. The Commission on
Presidential Debates can, and should, open up the three presidential debates
that are planned for October.</p>
<p>As it stands now, the commission wants to limit participation in the debates.
That's no surprise, since the commission is an illicit entity created by former
chairmen of the Democratic and Republican parties and funded by the same
corporate special interests that have warped the messages of those parties. But
Americans needn't accept the arbitrary constraints that the commission seeks to
place on their democracy.</p>
<p>The commission wants to exclude any candidate who is not polling at least 15
percent of vote early in the fall. That's an absurdly high standard -- so
absurd, in fact, that if it had been applied in the primary season, U.S. Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., would have been barred from participating in debates
before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.</p>
<p>The only reasonable standard for debate participation should be a two-fold
requirement: First, a contender must qualify for a place on a sufficient number
of state ballots to win the 270 electoral votes needed to become president.
Second, that contender should be polling at least 5 percent, since that is the
support level required to qualify for federal matching funds.</p>
<p>No doubt, Bush and Gore will meet those standards. But, with any luck, the
Green Party's Ralph Nader, the Reform Party's Pat Buchanan and perhaps even a
Libertarian would qualify. The presence of alternative candidates would give the
debate depth and force the two major candidates to begin to distinguish
themselves.</p>
<p>At this point in the process, a real debate is the only hope for a real
election in which faith in democracy is restored by the participation of a
majority of eligible American voters.
