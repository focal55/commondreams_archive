<b><font size="5">W</font></b>hen 
        talking on your cell phone, the short antenna next to your head emits 
        microwave radiation that passes through your skull and as much as an inch 
        into 
      
your brain, exposing your cerebellum to a dose of radiation that is close 
        to the same wavelength (frequency) produced by your microwave to cook 
        bacon, only at an intensity about 1,000 times lower. 
      
<P>This should concern the world's 300 million cell phone users, 83 million 
        of whom live in the United States. Recent animal experiments and epidemiological 
        studies indicate that the microwave radiation emitted by cell phones may 
        damage brain cell DNA and increase the risk of cancer. However, like the 
        threats to public health posed by sewage sludge, carcinogenic cosmetics 
        and agricultural pesticides, the federal agencies charged with safeguarding 
        public health seem more attuned to the needs of the industries they regulate. 
      
<P>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) realizes that questions about 
        the safety of cell phones remain unanswered. A "Consumer Update on Mobile 
        Phones" on the agency's Web page reads: "It is well known that high levels 
        of radio frequency radiation can produce biological damage through heating 
        effects (this is how your microwave is able to cook food). However, it 
        is not known whether ... lower levels of radiofrequency radiation like 
        that produced by cell phones might cause adverse health effects as well." 
        (A note on semantics: The cellular industry and the FDA eschew use of 
        the word "microwave," preferring the ameliorative term "radiofrequency 
        radiation.") 
      
<P>The FDA acknowledges that experiments have shown that microwave radiation 
        could cause cancer in laboratory animals, but the agency has chosen to 
        ignore them. In the past year, however, thanks to a flurry of media reports, 
        the public has begun to take notice. 
      
<P>Like other public health controversies, this one has become a scientific 
        showdown between industry-sponsored and independent researchers, with 
        the federal government, in this case the FDA, straddling the fence--loath 
        to offend either the telecommunications industry or the powerful politicians 
        whose campaigns the industry helps fund. But when it comes to cell phones, 
        there is a confusing twist. 
      
<P><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">L</font></b>ast 
        year, the potential dangers of cell phones made a splash when George Carlo, 
        who for six years had coordinated $25 million of cell phone research funded 
        by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), went public 
        with some unpublished research suggesting that cell phones were not as 
        safe as previously thought. In one CTIA-funded study, researchers at Integrated 
        Laboratory Systems in North Carolina found that microwave radiation from 
        mobile phones damaged the chromosomes of blood cells called lymphocytes 
        after 24 hours of exposure. And a CTIA epidemiological study found a link 
        between cell phones and neurocytoma, a rare type of brain cancer. (The 
        average length of phone use in this study was less than three years, which 
        is significant since the technology is relatively new and any long-term 
        effects on humans have yet to show up.) 
      
<P>Some of the most troubling, and thorough, research on the effects of 
        microwave radiation has taken place at the University of Washington. Henry 
        Lai, a bioengineering professor there, found that rats exposed to one 
        hour of low-level microwave radiation suffered from both long-term and 
        short-term memory loss. Because rat brains are very different from human 
        brains, it is difficult to extrapolate from one to the other. But, Lai 
        says, the research "suggests that the microwave radiation caused a change 
        inside the brain, and that the same type of change might also affect humans 
        in a different way." 
      
<P>More troubling to Lai was his research finding that exposure to low-level 
        microwave radiation caused the DNA in rat brain cells to break up. Since 
        the DNA of rats and humans is so similar, the radiation emitted by cellular 
        phones is also likely to damage the DNA of human brain cells. Such DNA 
        breakage is serious, Lai says, because "the cell may not be able to repair 
        the breakage correctly and then you are talking about mutation, and mutations 
        can lead to cancer. And in extreme cases, the cell may die from the damage." 
      
<P>However, research funded by the CTIA failed to discover any DNA damage, 
        according to Carlo. "Radiofrequency radiation does not break DNA," he 
        says. "That is a huge finding." 
      
<P>This is strongly disputed by Lai, who in a long letter to Microwave News, 
        which for 20 years has been covering the debate over the health effects 
        of nonionizing radiation, slams the CTIA-funded research procedures. "[The 
        CTIA research] program is a disgrace to the American research establishment," 
        Lai wrote. "It has shown a consistent pattern of chaotic corruption and 
        deception. ... Until we have an independent and reliable research program 
        free from any control from the industry, the global impacts of cellular 
        phone use will be assessed by 'post-market surveillance'-- in other words, 
        by whatever effects may occur among users of these devices." 
      
<P>Lai, who does not use cell phones, told In These Times, "The vindication 
        of the cell phone is still a long way off." 
      
<P>Carlo's critics in the scientific community question his motives. They 
        note that his research agenda has always been skewed toward finding results 
        that will please industry and that he went public with his troubling--and 
        unpublished--data only after his funding from the CTIA ran out, raising 
        the question of whether his recent hue and cry was a ploy to drum up more 
        business. "I have dealt with [the CTIA research program] all the years 
        it was in existence and it was not what I would call a straightforward 
        research program in any way, shape or form," says Louis Slesin, editor 
        of Microwave News. 
      
<P>What's needed, Slesin says, is a well-funded independent research effort 
        with special emphasis on studies in which animals are exposed to low levels 
        of cellular phone radiation over their lifetimes. 
      
<P>In 1997, the FDA asked Carlo to conduct such research, but no studies 
        were done and the FDA did not follow up. "The FDA has not been willing 
        to make a case for doing the research," Slesin says. "Basically it has 
        allowed the industry to police itself and to set the agenda, and that 
        has been a mistake because we have gotten nothing done." 
      
<P>That trend continues. The FDA announced last October its intent to collaborate 
        with the CTIA on future research, following up on two very limited areas 
        of concern raised by the group's previous research. But again, the research 
        will be done by the CTIA, and the FDA will have only a nonsupervisory 
        role. 
      
<P><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">I</font></b>n the 
        wake of last year's negative publicity, the FDA did send a letter to the 
        National Toxicology Program, a government research agency in North Carolina, 
        asking it to conduct microwave experiments on animals over their lifetimes. 
        The petition is currently being considered. The FDA's request was apparently 
        prompted by an Australian experiment, funded by the national telephone 
        company, which discovered that rats exposed to low levels of microwave 
        radiation like that emitted by cell phones had a rate of blood cancer 
        twice as large as that of the control group. 
      
<P>There are other disturbing indications that microwave radiation from 
        cell phones may not be as benign as previously thought. Researchers at 
        Virginia Commonwealth University discovered that cancer cells proliferate 
        when exposed to microwave radiation like that emitted by cell phones. 
        And research on humans at Bristol University in England discovered that 
        20 to 30 minutes of exposure to mobile phone radiation adversely affected 
        the functioning of the visual cortex, the area of the brain that processes 
        sight. 
      
<P>The National Cancer Institute is finishing an epidemiological study of 
        brain cancer and cell phone use that should be released within the year. 
        But since cancer can take years to develop and cell phones have not been 
        widely used for very long, the impact of cell phones on human health may 
        not be readily apparent for years to come. Nonetheless, a recent Swedish 
        epidemiological study discovered that cell phone users were 2.5 times 
        more likely to have tumors in the brain lobes next to their "phone ears." 
        (Because of the small size of the sample, the results, while suggestive, 
        are not statistically significant.) 
      
<P>The only laboratory research in the United States presently conducted 
        on the effects of microwave radiation is being carried out by cell-phone 
        manufacturer Motorola. In 1998, the company broke ranks with the CTIA 
        and openly criticized its research program. "We have lost five critical 
        years, and money can't buy those years back," said Q. Balzano, director 
        of Motorola's Electromagnetic Research Laboratory in Fort Lauderdale, 
        Florida, in an interview with Microwave News. Slesin adds that Motorola 
        realizes that if cell phones are proven to be a health hazard, it will 
        need to have good scientific data to protect itself from future lawsuits. 
      
<P>In the meantime, consumers can protect themselves by, ironically enough, 
        turning to the FDA Web site. The FDA emphasizes that "the scientific data 
        do not demonstrate that mobile phones are harmful." On the other hand, 
        there is almost no independent research to show that mobile phones are 
        not harmful, and a load of studies that raise questions. Understanding 
        this, the FDA advises consumers "concerned about avoiding even potential 
        risks" to minimize their exposure to cell phone radiation. For example, 
        you could "consider holding lengthy conversations on conventional phones" 
        and limit cell phone use to short calls. If you use a cell phone a lot 
        in the car, you can get a phone that has the antenna outside the car. 
        Finally, cell phone users can wear a headset with a remote antennae to 
        "a mobile phone carried at the waist." Whether you want microwave radiation 
        penetrating that area is another question.
