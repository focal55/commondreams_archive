<p>On Friday, the U.S. Air Force will launch an interceptor from Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific to knock a single dummy warhead fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California out of the sky, at about 144 miles above the earth and travelling at a speed of 12,000 miles per hour. It will do so, not under simulated conditions of battle but with full knowledge of every move and counter-move the single target intends to take — as if it had been given the opposing team’s playbook months in advance. If the hit is successful, and most likely even if it isn’t, Bill Clinton will likely give a “limited green light” to begin work on a national missile defense system.
<p>WHY WOULD CLINTON give a go-ahead even in the event of failure in a test to highly choreographed it makes the Bolshoi ballet look like a punk rock mosh pit? The decision, you see, has precious little to do with defense and everything to do with politics. 
       
<p>SHAMEFUL AND DANGEROUS
       
<p>Of all the shameful acts Bill Clinton has committed since becoming president in 1992, none is quite as galling as his administration’s decision to roll over and play dead before the defense industry’s missile defense campaign. 
       Oh I haven’t forgotten about “that woman, Miss Lewinsky.” But that was private Clinton, not public Clinton - a fact that saved his presidency in the end. Personally, I don’t find anything terribly shameful (or unusual) about lying about adultery. But purposefully endangering the nation, deliberately destroying decades of arms control progress, and knowingly wasting tens of billions of dollars all because he does not want the hassle of opposing the Republicans on a program so desperately desired by their patrons in the weapons-building business - this is a political crime of the highest order.
       
<p>MONEY AND POLITICS   
  
<p>The case for a national missile defense has always been driven exclusively by money and politics, rather than any kind of hard-headed analysis, as Frances FitzGerald clearly demonstrates in her magisterial history of the program, “Way Out There in the Blue: Reagan, Star Wars and the End of the Cold War,” FitzGerald reminds us that in 1983, when Reagan, whose hard-line anti-Soviet policies had by then given rise to the largest antinuclear movement in cold war history, personally - and almost in secret - wrote an insert to a routine defense speech. Reagan called on the scientific community to turn its great talents to the cause of world peace and to give us a means of rendering nuclear weapons “impotent and obsolete.” He did so because he knew that ever since 1946, opinion polls had demonstrated that most Americans share the misimpression that scientists could easily develop a defense against nuclear missiles if would only they put their minds to it. Indeed, in most surveys, voters seemed to think we already had a defense. 
       
<p>CORPORATE WELFARE
       
<p>This fundamental lack of understanding has allowed a spending program to mushroom that has so far proven to be the most generous form of welfare ever devised for wealthy corporations. Despite its abject failure to achieve anything of note in terms of solving the myriad technological (to say nothing of political and diplomatic) problems involved in creating a missile defense that would make Americans any safer, the program has grown like one of those mutant monsters in a cheap Japanese horror movie: It has become unkillable.   
<p>Too many powerful people have a vested interest in keeping it going regardless of its success. And while the Pentagon has repeatedly been proven to have faked results and created phony tests hoping to make them easier to pass than any conventional missile launch, these revelations have done nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of the program’s backers. 
       
<p>NOTHING TO SHOW
<p>In its campaign to see the program continued regardless of its results, the Pentagon has frequently done its best to silence critics by removing their right to see the classified data needed to analyze it. The defense industry spent tens of millions to finance think tanks and public relations campaigns designed to drown out the honest assessments of expert opinions and to build up the coffers of Congressmen who could be counted upon to approve its funding regardless of progress. The result so far has been the most expensive government research program in human history with essentially nothing to show for it. Seventeen years and $60 billion later, we still can’t hit a bullet with another bullet in space - when the other side is using routine decoys and countermeasures.
       
<p>A WORLD AT RISK   
 
<p>Seventeen years and $60 billion later, we still can’t hit a bullet with another bullet in space. 

<p>What we can do, however, and are likely to do - even with the Clinton administration’s limited, $30 billion plus plan - is to endanger our own security. Beginning work on the planned system requires a unilateral interpretation of the U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that will infuriate Moscow and require concessions in many other areas. The Russians may go along, ultimately, if we buy them off, because their missile program is so big they can be assured that we will never be able to defend ourselves against it with any confidence. But what about the Chinese? While Clinton administration officials are speaking exclusively about a system that can defend us against the launch of a missile by so-called rogue nations that right now do not have the proper technology to do so, it turns out that the system is perfectly poised to defend against the small delivery system the Chinese currently employ. 
<p>The Clinton administration seems to think it can convince the Chinese not to begin an arms race necessary to retain its deterrent against the United States because its intentions are pure. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Walter B. Slocombe admitted to a reporter, “We don’t deny to the Chinese that the system has some capability against Chinese missiles, but that is not what it is designed to do.” And once China increases the size of its nuclear force, then so, in all likelihood, will India. Next, like clockwork, will come Pakistan. Does anyone really think the United States will be safer after inspiring another nuclear arms race on the Indian subcontinent? Will Taiwan feel safer once China increases its nuclear forces?
       
<p>COWARDICE AND COMMON SENSE
<p>And just who are the enemies here anyway? North Korea is currently making up with South Korea and Iraq is believed to be decades away from having the necessary nuclear delivery technology. Much more frightening is the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, which are easy to deliver, and which the United States refuses to join the rest of the world in helping to contain - owing to the fears of the Republican right about intrusive inspections. 
<p>The really sad part of this is that virtually everyone in the administration connected to this decision should know better. The missile defense system in question cannot protect Americans but it can make us far more insecure. But the politics are such that all the passion is on one side and it’s the same side as all the money. In such a fight, with so cowardly a president, common sense just doesn’t have a chance.
