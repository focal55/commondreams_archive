<p>The most consequential surprise of the presidential race thus far is not the rise of John McCain, but the bipartisan craze to eliminate the national debt.</P>
<P>This damaging fad has taken off like the Hula-Hoop. No one even mentioned it until a year ago. Now the consensus is so ingrained that Jay Rockefeller, one of the Senate's most thoughtful liberals, felt compelled to tell me the other day (before discussing modest ways to extend health coverage) that of course he was for it. </P>
<P>What's going on? As always in politics, it's a mix of the silly and the serious. The silly case for debt payoff insists that debt per se is harmful, an immoral way to stick the kids with our bills. But that's nonsense: an economy that grows (as ours does) while debt remains steady is like a family whose rising income makes it easier to carry the mortgage.</P>
<P>The real case for eliminating the debt runs as follows. Interest on that debt, at more than $200 billion a year, is one of the federal government's biggest expenses. Trimming and eventually eliminating the debt would thus free up enormous room in the budget for new needs or contingencies.</P>
<P>Since the baby boomers' costly retirement lies ahead, it's only prudent, this argument runs, to put government finances in as strong a position as possible. At the same time, paying down debt adds to national savings and investment; this boosts economic growth.</P>
<P>These are good goals, but they're not the only good goals imaginable. Because there's something else you can do with surpluses. You can cut debt or slash taxes, yes. But you can also -- gasp! -- boost spending. Amazingly, in an age of unprecedented bounty, the center of political gravity has drifted so far to the right that advocates of new spending are cast as some radical fringe (unless, of course, we're talking about defense, which both parties want to lift to levels that will soon match Cold War heights -- without a Cold War).</P>
<P>Yet even with his modest "investments," President Clinton is pushing federal spending down toward 17 percent of GDP, the lowest in in 50 years, and far below the 22 percent it was under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.</P>
<P>This fact is not well understood, even in Washington. Conservatives don't realize they should declare victory. Democrats don't realize they can prove they're not big spenders anymore. Confusion reigns.</P>
<P>With 44 million Americans lacking health insurance, wretched urban schools and millions of full-time workers living in poverty, for example, it's hard to believe that the Jay Rockefellers of the world really want to pay down debt rather than throw some money at these problems. But in a world of divided government, debt reduction is everybody's second best option.</P>
<P>For Democrats, the debt rallying cry inoculates them against the big-spending charge while blocking GOP tax cuts. For Republicans, it stops the surplus from being spent on Democratic ideas that voters might find they like. And since debt reduction polls well, and has some positive economic results, second best doesn't seem so bad.</P>
<P>Unless, that is, you think we have a chance to use today's bounty to address the woes noted above. Bill Bradley may have been an imperfect voice for this agenda, but once he exits the race, as seems almost certain in a few weeks, there will be no voice at all.</P>
<P>Al Gore won't let himself be branded a liberal. George Bush's compassion doesn't extend much beyond rhetoric. And McCain's plan for the surplus, as the press will eventually have to notice, reflects his intent to privatize Social Security, plus the absence (thus far) of any affirmative domestic agenda.</P>
<P>It's ironic. All the talk these days is about Republicans imploding. The truth, as the debt-reduction craze proves, is that it's the left that is in trouble, so much so that no one even sees that it has disappeared.</P>
