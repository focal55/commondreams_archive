George W. Bush looked like he had heartburn
every time Al Gore brought it up in
the presidential debate. "Ninety-five percent
of all seniors would get no help whatsoever
under my opponent's plan for the first four or
five years," said Gore. Bush really couldn't
respond, because it was true.

<p>If you can't understand what Mr. Bush plans to
do about prescription drugs for senior
citizens, it's not your fault. No one can tell
for sure what the co-payments, deductibles, or
value of the package would be to most seniors.
Indeed, it is not even clear that private
insurance companies or HMOs, who are expected
to provide the prescription drug benefit in
the Bush plan, would be willing to do so.

<p>Mr. Gore's plan is more straightforward, but
has its own flaws. It would pay half the
cost of prescription drugs up to $2000
beginning in 2002, rising to $5000 (with
Medicare paying $2500) in 2008. Premiums would
be $300 a year, rising to $600, with subsidies
for both premiums and co-payments for the poor.
It would also pay for all drug costs once a
senior citizen spends $4000 for the year.

<p>The problem with the Gore plan is not that it
costs too much-- a nation facing a $4.6
trillion federal budget surplus over the next
decade can certainly afford to spend seven
percent of this money to provide a benefit that
senior citizens need and deserve. It's just
that they deserve a lot more.

<p>The Gore campaign gives an example of an
elderly widow with an annual prescription
drug bill of $7,320. Under his plan, she would
end up paying $4000 and Medicare would pick
up $3,320.

<p>This $4,000 could still be a very high burden.
The majority of widows over 65 have annual
incomes of less than $12,000. Although the
poorest would be eligible for subsidies,
many others would not. A lot of people would
still find themselves, as the political
campaign ads are now saying, choosing between
food and medicine.

<p>Worse still, the proposed benefit will be
rapidly eroded by rising drug prices.
And even at the outset, this coverage is much
worse than that what most working people
have now. Most people see this as unfair, and
for good reason. The purpose of Medicare is
to provide health insurance for people when
they are retired (or disabled). This is exactly
the time when you really need full coverage,
because your health care costs have risen, and
your income is reduced.

<p>In a race where both major party candidates are
awash in special interest money, much has been
made of the philosophical differences between
the candidates, especially on this issue. There
is certainly some truth to this: the Gore plan
builds, however inadequately, on the concept of
universal social insurance embodied in Medicare.
Social insurance means that everyone pitches in
when they are young, healthy and working; and
everyone is entitled to benefits, regardless of
income, when they are not.

<p>By contrast, the Bush plan creates a welfare benefit for the
elderly poor-- which would make it much more
vulnerable to future attacks-- and attempts to
privatize the insurance provided to the rest of
the elderly population. This would certainly be
a step backward.

<p>But philosophy won't pay the bill at the
pharmacy, and neither will the Gore plan. The
problem is that until now prescription drug
policy has been subject to the veto of the
pharmaceutical companies, which do not want the
federal government to use its buying power to
lower prices. Mr. Gore admitted this during the
debate.

<p>Of course there is one candidate in the race
who is proposing a much simpler, comprehensive
solution to the problem of prescription drugs.
It borrows from the experience of other high-
income countries, who spend just over half of
what we do per person on health care, and cover
all of their citizens. This solution--
universal national health insurance-- is also
the one favored by most Americans when they are
polled about it.

<p>That candidate is Ralph Nader,
and not surprisingly he is also not on the take
from the insurance or pharmaceutical companies.
But Nader has been excluded from the debates,
despite the fact that he is on the ballot in 44
states (including Washington, DC). And the
press has largely avoided reporting on his
candidacy, even though they frequently report
on candidates with similar or even lower
standing in the polls-- for example, during the
Republican and Democratic primary elections.

<p>A limited, truncated form of democracy produces
a narrow set of choices for the electorate, and
often self-defeating reforms. This year's
premier political issue, prescription drug
coverage for the elderly, is a prime
illustration of this problem.
