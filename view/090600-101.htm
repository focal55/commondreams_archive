FOUR YEARS AGO, when Californians were about to vote on Proposition 
215, the medical marijuana initiative, opponents predicted that if 
seriously ill patients were allowed to use marijuana, recreational 
use among young people would increase. Drug czar Barry McCaffrey 
warned: ``Teens stop using drugs when they become aware of the risks 
involved. Sending them the wrong message that marijuana is medicine 
will cause drug use to skyrocket.`	 

<P>  Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services released 
its annual National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. As a Californian 
and mother of a 16-year-old boy, I read with keen interest the data 
on teenage use of marijuana.	 
</P>
<P>  Here's what I learned. In 1999, just under 8 percent of the 
nation's 12- to 17-year-
olds used marijuana regularly. In California, the percentage was 
identical. Despite the legalization of marijuana for medical purposes 
in the Golden State, in each subsequent year California teenagers 
have ranked about average compared to the rest of the country.	 
</P>
<P> In 1997, the year after the initiative passed, almost 7 percent of 
California teenagers used marijuana regularly, compared with nearly 9 
percent nationwide. And in 1998, there was not much difference, with 
just over 7 percent of California's 12- to 17-year-olds using 
marijuana regularly, compared with 8 percent of the nation's 
teenagers.	 
</P>
<P>  As it turns out, the sky did not fall, and the predicted spike in 
marijuana use among teenagers never materialized. But Californians 
would never know it, because we're not supposed to.	 
</P>
<P>  In 1997, immediately after the passage of the medical marijuana 
initiative, a study was commissioned by the federal govern
ment's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to 
demonstrate the (presumably negative) implications of Proposition 
215. But the results of that study indicated that although marijuana 
use rose among high school students in other parts of the country, 
use actually leveled off in California after passage of the 
initiative.	 
</P>
<P>  The report was suppressed, and according to its author, Professor 
Rodney Skager of the UCLA Graduate School of Education, ``I wonder if 
(the report) will ever see the light of day. Two years have passed 
since delivery of the first draft. People in the sponsoring agency 
undoubtedly fear the consequences of release of the data. The 
findings are politically incorrect because federal propaganda about 
the medical marijuana initiative insisted that passage would send the 
wrong message to young people.''	 
</P>
<P>Indeed, young people are getting all kinds of ``wrong messages'' about 
marijuana. And many are confused, which is not surprising. As high 
school civics teachers lecture about democracy, students are 
witnessing a thwarting of ``the will of the people'' in the name of 
protecting them.	 
</P>
<P>  Last week, the Supreme Court weighed in. By a 7-to-1 vote, the 
court responded to an ``emergency'' request by the Department of 
Justice to prohibit the Oakland Cannabis Buyer's Cooperative from 
distributing marijuana to its (fewer than 20) medical necessity 
patients who are extremely, even terminally ill.	 
</P>
<P>  Evidently, the Clinton administration pursuaded most Supreme Court 
justices that medicinal use by the sick and dying will result in 
compromising our ability to enforce our drug laws and 
marijuana-is-evil posture. The one dissenting voice was that of 
Justice John Paul Stevens, who said the 
government ``has failed to demonstrate that the denial of necessary 
medicine to seriously ill and dying patients will advance the public 
interest or that the failure to enjoin the distribution of such 
medicine will impair the orderly enforcement of federal criminal 
statutes.''	 
</P>
<P>Justice Stevens is right. If the statistics collected by our 
government tell us anything, it is that there is no relationship 
whatsoever between providing medicine to sick people and erosion of 
our ability to enforce our drug laws.	 
</P>
<P>  Last year alone, some 700,000 individuals were arrested on 
marijuana charges (87 percent for simple possession) -- more than any 
other year in our history, and more than any other country in the 
world. As for 
``the public interest,'' marijuana use in the general population 
remained constant last year, if not in decline.	 
</P>
<P>  If any messages have been sent to young people, they are that our 
system of government does not reflect voters' decisions when those 
decisions are inconsistent with federal dogma. The reality is that 
medical marijuana, this small step toward rational drug policy, has 
not resulted in increased teenage use or in fewer arrests in the 
general population. What surely has increased among young people is 
cynicism and mistrust of our government's drug policy.
