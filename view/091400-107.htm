U.S. 
              Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., came to Madison last Sunday to tell 
              progressives they should get excited about electing Al Gore president.            
<P align="left">It 
              was a tough sell.</P>
<P align="left">Frank, 
              one of the most identifiable liberal Democrats in the country, has 
              emerged as the leading Democratic critic of Ralph Nader's Green 
              Party challenge to Gore. Like a number of Wisconsin liberals, he 
              fears Nader's candidacy could draw enough progressive votes away 
              from the Democratic column to tip the election to Republican George 
              W. Bush.</P>
<P align="left">Frank 
              makes the argument passionately, but he undermines himself when 
              he claims Gore's positions are actually better than Nader's. From 
              any progressive perspective, that's a laughable assertion. On labor 
              rights, the environment, equal access to justice, gay and lesbian 
              rights, the death penalty, military spending, international intervention 
              and, above all, on the question of corporate influence over American 
              politics, Nader's stances are monumentally superior to those advocated 
              by Gore.</P>
<P align="left">The 
              more intriguing argument advanced by Frank was this: that the Democratic 
              Party, bad as it may be, is the only truly viable vehicle for progressives. 
              Here, he has some ground to stand on, since it cannot be denied 
              that most of organized labor, most major environmental groups, most 
              African-American and Latino voters, and progressives such as Paul 
              Wellstone, Jesse Jackson Jr., Tom Hayden, Tammy Baldwin and Dennis 
              Kucinich seem to be committed to stay the Democratic course. Whether 
              these groups and individuals are right to do so, their adherence 
              to the Democratic line makes it difficult to determine where a new 
              party of the left will build a base from which to compete for power.</P>
<P align="left">Frank 
              argues that progressives in general, and Nader backers in particular, 
              ought to move into the Democratic Party and take it over. "Join 
              us! Help us!'' he said to Nader supporters.</P>
<P align="left">The 
              problem with Frank's argument for entryism is that the Democratic 
              Party has not proven particularly welcoming to progressives, even 
              when they play by the rules and present it with an opportunity to 
              win. Witness the treatment of the Rev. Jesse Jackson who, after 
              running a far better race for the presidency in 1988 than did Al 
              Gore, was never given serious consideration for the vice presidency 
              in 1992.</P>
<P align="left">Better 
              yet, consider the circumstance of Ed Garvey in 1998. After years 
              of working harder than just about anyone else in Wisconsin to bring 
              progressives into the Democratic Party, Garvey won the gubernatorial 
              nomination with overwhelming support from across the state. Yet, 
              though he was standing proudly on the Democratic platform in a race 
              against conservative Republican Tommy Thompson, Garvey was abandoned 
              by top Democratic givers and provided with only tepid support from 
              many leaders of organized labor.</P>
<P align="left">The 
              fact that Garvey ran better than past Democratic nominees for governor 
              only rubbed salt in the wound -- emphasizing to rank-and-file labor, 
              farm and peace and social justice community activists that even 
              when they play by the rules and produce a strong candidate, they 
              cannot necessarily count on the party establishment.</P>
<P align="left">The 
              Garvey lesson lingers in Wisconsin. It is no wonder that some of 
              the 1998 Democratic nominee's ablest backers are this year supporting 
              Nader, or simply sitting out the presidential race. It is no wonder 
              that Garvey, though he remains a Democrat, has joined Jesse Jackson 
              Jr., Russ Feingold and other sincere progressives in advocating 
              for the Green's inclusion in the debates -- a position Garvey will 
              advance Wednesday when he appears at Nader's Orpheum Theatre rally 
              in Madison.</P>
<P align="left">
If 
              Barney Frank and other Democratic leaders want progressives to see 
              the Democratic Party as a natural political home, they have to offer 
              more than an invitation. They have to make real the promise that 
              progressives who pour their human energy into the Democratic Party 
              will not see their efforts trumped by the powerful economic interests 
              that use their resources to warp the party's message. For progressives, 
              that is, and should be, the true test of whether they want to identify 
              as Democrats.
