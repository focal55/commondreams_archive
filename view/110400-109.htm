Leaning across the coach-class aisle of his flight from Washington 
              to Boston, where 12,000 people would rally to protest his exclusion 
              from the first presidential debate, Ralph Nader mused, "If I hadn't 
              run, what would there be for the left to talk about in this election?&quot;
<p>One need not wear Green colors to acknowledge that the Green Party 
            nominee for president makes a good point. Love Nader or hate him, 
            support his candidacy as an inspired challenge to politics as usual 
            or oppose it as a vain and dangerous fool's mission, but, please, 
            don't deny the impact of this campaign on progressives. For the first 
            time in more than 50 years, the left is fully engaged in an intense, 
            issue-driven, tactically sophisticated dialogue about how to get the 
            most out of the electoral process. 
            
<p> In the thick of the debate, especially when Al Gore backers label Naderites 
              na•ve cogs in a right-wing Republican machine--or when the Naderites 
              counter by decrying their detractors as na•ve cogs in a right-wing 
              Democratic machine--the whole endeavor can seem unsettling. And 
              it is. The dialogue over how to approach this year's presidential 
              election is shaking up the left, rousing it from a long neglected 
              and frequently dysfunctional relationship with electoral politics. 
              Where exactly the Gore-Nader tug-of-war will land the great, ill-defined 
              mass of progressive voters on the American political landscape remains 
              to be seen. But there is good reason to believe, whatever the count 
              on November 7, that the left will end this year in a better place 
              than where it stood prior to the 2000 campaign. </p>
<p>There's even the possibility that this discourse will lead American 
              progressives toward an understanding of the prospects for a politically 
              savvy electoral strategy that mirrors the sophisticated approach 
              of European, Indian, Australian, Canadian and Mexican activists. 
              At the very least, Nader has succeeded in forcing progressives to 
              think anew about how and why they will cast their ballots this fall. 
            </p>
<p>Without Nader, the 2000 election campaign would have been the most 
              dismal presidential competition for American progressives since 
              Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison faced off in a 1888 campaign 
              so hideously devoid of idealism that it spawned the Populist movement. 
              Yes, in a no-Nader context, the overwhelming majority of progressives 
              would have cast grudging ballots for Gore. But what would there 
              have been to say about those votes except perhaps that, once more, 
              in the contest between voting and not voting, the lessons of fourth-grade 
              civics teachers won out? And, perhaps, that they kept the smirking 
              Texas executioner out of the Oval Office.</p>
<p> Now, whether they are planning to vote for Gore or Nader, or whether 
              they are still agonizing over the choice, progressives are talking 
              about this election campaign. Endlessly. Energetically. And fruitfully. 
              The initial success of the Nader candidacy--measured by summer poll 
              results that put the Greens' strength near 10 percent in several 
              key states--made real the question of whether it was nobler to cast 
              a ballot for the best candidate and the better politics that might 
              follow, or to lend a vote to the inferior candidate with the clearest 
              shot at defeating the really dangerous contender. "Never in my life 
              have I had so many discussions with so many people I generally agree 
              with about how to vote in a November election," says Ed Garvey, 
              a labor lawyer who was the 1998 Democratic nominee for governor 
              of Wisconsin. "People really are thinking about where to go this 
              year; they're weighing the choices, asking themselves where to compromise, 
              where to stand firm." </p>
<p>Garvey, who like many Democrats is also a longtime Nader admirer, 
              is one of the people doing the agonizing. He appeared at a huge 
              Madison rally organized by the Greens and asked the cheering crowd 
              to imagine what a better nation this would be with Nader as president. 
              After he delivered his impassioned speech, however, Garvey confided 
              that if the contest between Gore and Bush remains close in his crucial 
              swing state, he'll probably cast his ballot for the vice president. 
              "It's hard," Garvey says. "Do you follow your heart or do you do 
              what you think has to be done to prevent right-wingers from taking 
              charge of everything?"</p>
<p> Yes, 
              it is hard. The Nader challenge has inspired some of the most bitter 
              internal disputes the left has seen in decades. Old "Nader's raiders" 
              such as former Rep. Toby Moffett (D-Connecticut) are campaigning 
              against their mentor. Lifelong Democrats such as former Texas Agriculture 
              Commissioner Jim Hightower have torn up their membership cards and 
              jumped to the Greens. Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank and other 
              Democrats have engaged in ugly and unwarranted attempts to portray 
              Nader as insensitive to the concerns of women, gays and lesbians 
              and racial minorities. At the same time, Greens have tossed brickbats 
              at Gore's pragmatic union supporters, dismissing them as Democratic 
              Party stooges who would abandon the Seattle coalition for an empty 
              promise of access to the Oval Office--or perhaps a night in the 
              Lincoln bedroom. </p>
<p>So intense has the internal conflict on the left grown that, in 
              Boston on the night of the first presidential debate, Ironworkers 
              gathered outside the hall to cheer Gore clashed with students, there 
              to demand Nader's inclusion. "I don't know if I've ever seen so 
              many people who agree on so many issues so divided over a single 
              election," says Mel King, a former Democratic legislator who ran 
              a "Rainbow Coalition" race for mayor of Boston and now is campaigning 
              for Nader. "People are more worked up about Nader-versus-Gore than 
              anything in years." </p>
<p>Terrible, terrible, terrible gripe the cautious minders of an almost 
              always too-cautious left. They worry about "wasted" energy and "wasted" 
              votes. They fret about the damage the dissing discourse will do 
              to a broad constituency that, when it disagrees, in the words of 
              New Party founder Joel Rogers, can mirror the worst excesses of 
              "hungry people fighting over food." </p>
<p>But I see nothing terrible in this discourse. On the contrary, 
              I think it's terrific.</p>
<p> Nader's challenge has demanded that progressives take electoral 
              politics as seriously as do their comrades in other lands--and, 
              perhaps more importantly, as seriously as do their domestic foes 
              on the corporate and religious right. Finally, progressives are 
              asking the right question: How do I use my vote, my energy, my talent, 
              my influence, my resources to achieve the most left-wing result 
              possible? </p>
<p>That the answers will differ is not merely understandable but necessary. 
              To achieve the most left-wing result that is possible in Kansas, 
              for instance, may require progressive populists to cast their ballots 
              in Republican primaries for moderate state school board candidates--if 
              only because they want their children to be taught evolution. To 
              achieve the most left-wing result that is possible in this year's 
              New York Senate race, trade unionists from Buffalo to the Bronx 
              will eschew the Democratic line and cast their ballots for Hillary 
              Clinton on the line of the Working Families Party--theorizing that 
              because New York allows the fusion of votes from different parties, 
              Clinton will read the results and know that she could not have won 
              without the votes of people who object to the Democratic Party's 
              rightward drift. To achieve the most left-wing result that is possible 
              in several Vermont state legislative districts this fall, local 
              activists will cast their ballots for candidates of the newly chartered 
              Vermont Progressive Party--which should win more seats in a state 
              legislature this year than any left party since the Minnesota Farmer-Labor 
              and Wisconsin Progressive parties folded their third-party efforts 
              in the '40s. </p>
<p>And what of the presidential race? Again, the pursuit of that most 
              left-wing result will take voters in myriad directions. In the District 
              of Columbia, where a Democratic victory is only slightly less certain 
              than that of the Assads in Damascus, progressives will cast their 
              ballots for Nader--in hopes that the D.C. Statehood/Green Party 
              alliance will displace the Republicans as Washington's No. 2 party. 
              In Alaska, where Gore is about as competitive as, well, Nader, progressives 
              will take a serious shot at pushing the Greens into second place.</p>
<p> In other states, it gets harder. But, for those who would like 
              to see the left become a more serious player in American electoral 
              politics, hard is good. If we recognize that it is unlikely either 
              the Democrats or the Greens are going away after November 7, then 
              the task of determining the issues and the circumstances that might 
              lead a voter to break with the Democrats--or to stick with them--is 
              healthy for progressives who have been on the losing end of a dysfunctional 
              relationship with the Democratic Party pretty much since the day 
              FDR died.</p>
<p> For the first time in decades, the term "tactical voting" is being 
              given its proper place in the language of the American left. Progressive 
              voters are actually checking poll figures, not to figure out which 
              of the evils is ahead, but rather to determine whether they can 
              safely cast a ballot for the good. These are people who would not 
              risk handing the White House to Bush, but who hope to be able to 
              cast a Green vote as a warning to Gore and Democratic Party leaders 
              that there is indeed a constituency that stands to the left of the 
              Democratic Leadership Council. </p>
<p>The point at which any particular progressive voter decides to 
              embrace or abandon the lesser evil is not the point. What matters 
              is that the Nader candidacy has opened dialogues--both internal 
              and external--about the wisdom and potential for tactical voting. 
              This, as they say in China and at Billy Bragg concerts, is a great 
              leap forward.</p>
<p> If there is a single constant in left electoral work internationally, 
              it is an understanding of the value and the power of tactical voting. 
              Indeed, before the 1997 British election that dispatched the Conservative 
              Party from power after 18 years of Margaret Thatcher and John Major, 
              the watchword of the left was "tactical." The week before the election, 
              Britain's <i>New Statesman</i> magazine published a chart suggesting 
              the best vote that its lefty readers could cast in each of more 
              than 600 local contests for Parliament. The strategy involved backing 
              the strongest contenders against the Conservatives from a list that 
              included candidates of Labor and the smaller Liberal Democrat, Welsh 
              and Scottish nationalist parties. The strategy worked--not only 
              were the Tories defeated, but voters elected the largest Labor and 
              Liberal Democrat blocs since the end of World War II. </p>
<p>In more recent European Parliament elections, the tactical approach 
              has expanded to include instructions to vote for Greens and left-wing 
              offshoots of the Labor Party, with considerable success. In the 
              recent London mayoral election, which put Labor renegade Ken Livingstone 
              in the mayor's chair and Greens in a number of key positions, tactical 
              voting was raised to something of an art form by creative new coalitions 
              of traditional Labor voters, Greens and independent leftists.</p>
<p> In France, where a two-tier election system makes it possible 
              to cast a first vote based on ideology and a second vote for practicality, 
              leftists for generations have used tactical voting as a tool to 
              pressure the Socialist Party to move left. In the last rounds of 
              presidential and parliamentary elections, for instance, the millions 
              of first-round votes for Green, Communist and Trotskyist candidates--yes, 
              Trotskyists actually do top the million-vote mark in France--clearly 
              signaled to the Socialists that they needed to move left. And they 
              did, implementing a 35-hour work week and challenging the cautious 
              "third-way" philosophy advanced by Britain's Tony Blair and Germany's 
              Gerhard Schršder.</p>
<p> Similar stories of strategic alliances, careful plotting and--dare 
              we say it?--success can be found around the world. Such tales are 
              especially common in Scandinavia, where Social Democratic and purer 
              "Third Left" parties compare, contrast, compete and, at times, come 
              together--as in Finland, where the Left Alliance Party, which could 
              reasonably be referred to as "Naderite," recently entered the government 
              as a junior coalition partner. </p>
<p>Of course, tactical voting is only one hammer that can be extracted 
              from the toolbox of electoral strategies that could be employed 
              by progressives who are determined to alter the political landscape--internationally 
              and domestically. The variety of approaches is actually rather well 
              illustrated by the tentative, yet clearly hopeful steps taken this 
              year by New York's Working Families Party as it makes real the promise 
              of fusion, Vermont's Progressive Party as it forges a genuine third 
              force, and the Greens, who have chosen not to run candidates against 
              progressive Democrats while at the same time mounting needed races 
              against New Democrats such as California Sen. Dianne Feinstein--who 
              faces a spirited challenge from Global Exchange's Medea Benjamin. 
            </p>
<p>Is it possible that the American left might eventually develop 
              the structures, institutions and--most critically--the instincts 
              required to move in and out of the Democratic Party, to cast tactical 
              votes, build complex alliances and, ultimately, create an alternative 
              politics that is bigger than the Democratic Party, or even the Green 
              Party? Can the rare accomplishment of Vermont Rep. Bernie Sanders, 
              who has proved that it is possible to force the Democrats to play 
              nice with an independent socialist, be replicated in states where 
              voters outnumber dairy cows?</p>
<p> It is easy to suggest that America's absurd and constricting winner-take-all 
              electoral system renders comparison with other countries useless. 
              It is even easier to claim that the American left lacks the electoral 
              traditions, the organizational strength and the communications infrastructure 
              that has enabled progressive forces in other lands to forge effective 
              electoral strategies. It is easiest of all to question whether there 
              even is a left in America--and to state with puffed-up certainty 
              that, even if such a team can be identified, its players could never 
              be expected to agree long enough to take the field of political 
              battle and make a difference.</p>
<p> Dismissing the left's prospects--electoral or otherwise--is a 
              national pastime in this country. But I seem to recall that, exactly 
              a year ago, I heard questions about whether it made any sense to 
              try and pull together demonstrations outside the Seattle sessions 
              of a trade group that even some well-read leftists could not identify. 
              Last fall's anti-WTO protests proved that a diverse coalition of 
              progressives could take a page from their international allies and 
              mount a powerful challenge not only to corporate power, but to the 
              naysayers within the left's own ranks. And the great Nader-Gore 
              debate suggests the possibility that--far from destroying itself--the 
              broad American left may finally be prepared to steal a page from 
              the electoral playbook of its international comrades. </p>
<p>Sen. Paul Wellstone, the Minnesota Democrat who backs Gore but 
              eschews criticism of Nader, knows better than perhaps anyone else 
              on the American left the challenge and the potential of a more engaged 
              and tactically savvy left politics. Not long ago, I sat with Wellstone 
              in a room full of progressives who agreed on every issue, but who 
              were almost evenly divided on the Nader-versus-Gore question. The 
              dialogue between Wellstone and his friends was thrilling--filled 
              with the intensity, mutual respect and hope that is so often missing 
              from activist discussions. </p>
<p>"I really do believe it's important that Gore beat Bush," Wellstone 
              said to me as we were walking out of the room. "But I want to tell 
              you something: It's just as important that we capture the energy 
              of this dialogue that we've got going on the left and turn it into 
              something. November 7 is important because it's Election Day, but 
              November 8 may be even more important for progressives. On November 
              8, no matter what happens, we've got to take all these questions 
              and arguments, all this energy that's being poured into beating 
              Bush with Gore and into building an alternative with Nader, and 
              turn it into something."</p>
<p> Wellstone is right to see reason for hope in the electoral turbulence 
              that has gripped the left this fall. Ralph Nader has stirred the 
              pot. He has forced progressives to begin to come to grips with the 
              question of how they will engage with the electoral process. And, 
              no matter how they answer that question, the nature of their engagement 
              will be more sophisticated, more nuanced and more significant than 
              it has been since the days when no one questioned whether there 
              was a left in America. </p>
