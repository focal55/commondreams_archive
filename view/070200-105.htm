The noble American ideal of civil rights for all suffered a great blow. Despite the best aspirations of the majority of Americans, the U.S. Supreme Court has permitted a leading public organization to continue judging people on the basis of such extraneous factors as sexual orientation.

<p>The court has decided that the Boy Scouts of America may maintain its discriminatory policy against homosexuals who wish to be scout leaders. The court&#39;s reasoning that the scouts is not a public association fails the common-sense test; when an association reaches such a size and influence that government turns to it as a partner for public schools, that entity can no longer claim to be a truly private association.</p>
<p>The BSA, however, claims the benefits of being both public and private without accepting all the concomitant responsibilities. This case involved James Dale, an assistant scoutmaster removed from the Boy Scouts nine years ago when organizational leaders discovered that he had announced that he was gay. Mr. Dale sued for reinstatement. The New Jersey State Supreme Court unanimously held that the BSA constituted a &quot;place of public accommodation&quot; and that it was therefore not permitted to discriminate against Dale.</p>
<p>That ruling conflicted with an unrelated 1998 decision in the scouts&#39; favor by the California Supreme Court, which held that the organization was not a business and was therefore free to exclude gays.</p>
<p>The court&#39;s decision that the BSA is exempt is all the more disappointing when we consider that the Boy Scouts&#39; mission is to promote model citizenship and integrity. The Boy Scouts of America could be a powerful symbol of all that America is and what it aspires to be. Membership in scouting numbers almost 1.5 million individuals. The Boy Scouts tell the public that any boy is welcome to join. The BSA clearly falls short of that standard in practice.</p>
<p>It does its members and its famous &quot;be prepared&quot; motto a disservice by discriminating. Excluding individuals solely on the basis of sexual orientation sets an example that does not prepare scouts for our diverse world. As the New Jersey Supreme Court unanimously recognized, the exclusionary anti-gay leadership policy the Boy Scouts now so vigorously defend falls outside the scope of any association or expressive freedom protected by the First Amendment. The danger posed by that decision is that some other efforts to halt discrimination may be checkmated by an assertion of associational autonomy.</p>
<p>We in the Reform Jewish movement are not blind to the attributes of scouting. Indeed, many of our congregations sponsor or are affiliated with a local Boy Scout troop. Still, the BSA&#39;s discriminatory policies are in conflict with our most fundamental values. The Jewish principle of upholding human rights and the dignity of human beings has its sources in the idea that all human beings are created - b&#39;tselem elohim - in the image of God.</p>
<p>If the divine is found in the souls of all God&#39;s children, gay, lesbian and straight, then surely any discrimination on this basis is repugnant to this central tenet shared by so many faiths. Our sympathy and support are extended to those who continue the struggle to fight prejudice based on superficialities.</p>
