LOS ANGELES - A voice from the podium drifts into the corridors of Upper Concourse C 
of the Staples Center. I don't know who's speaking, but it doesn't 
matter. The message is familiar, flowing nonstop like a skein of 
smoke through the building.	 

<P>  ``In the Democratic Party,'' the voice booms, preacher-like, ``the 
door is always open!'' 	 
</P>
<P>  I can hear the delegates go wild. 	 
</P>
<P>  Yes! Yes! 	 
</P>
<P>  I have slipped by security to get up here. I don't belong. I need 
a Special Pass, which I have come to understand is the currency and 
clearest symbol of status at this convention. The right pass. The 
right invitation. The right credential. Up here by the luxury suites, 
the colorful rectangles of cardboard hang in plastic sheaths around 
the pearled and linen-collared necks of everyone I see. The thickest 
sheaths draw the most admiring looks. 	 
</P>
<P>  I stop at one of the suites and ask a security guard who's inside. 
(There is a glaring absence of signage.) AT&T? Microsoft? American 
Airlines? Mirage Hotels? I had read that at least 23 corporations 
have made large contributions to both the Republican and Democratic 
conventions (indicating either cynicism or confusion about their 
ideology). 	 
</P>
<P>  I tell the security guard I'm interested as a citizen and a 
Democrat which of my elected officials is fraternizing with which 
major donors. It's not like these schmooze-sessions are in someone's 
private home. They're here at the official party convention, 
supported in part by my tax dollars.	 
</P>
<P>  ``I'm not allowed to say who's inside,'' the guard says. 	 
</P>
<P>    I move on, passing Larry King, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, 
Patrick Kennedy, Ann Richards. Each is talking to people I don't 
recognize. CEOs, lobbyists, plain old rich people -- they're all up 
here. This is where their convention is, not down on the floor with 
the union reps and school teachers and other delegates casting 
predetermined votes for the predetermined candidate.	 
</P>
<P>I think about what Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Mr. Campaign 
Finance Reform, said a few days earlier.	 
</P>
<P>  ``What we are seeing on television are not the real party 
conventions,'' he said. ``The main show is behind closed doors at 
big-dollar, soft-money fund-raisers. And those big-money 
contributions, make no mistake, are setting the agenda for the 
American Congress and for the United States as a whole.''	 
</P>
<P>  At the end of the corridor, by the VIP escalator, I'm turned away 
from the Arena Club, reserved for the most generous among the six 
tiers of donors. (The ``Chairman's Circle,'' for example, is those 
who have contributed $500,000 or more.) No luck either at the Grand 
Reserve room, where Southwestern Bell Association is hosting a 
gathering. (Members of Congress who want to stop by need only walk a 
few steps; their own exclusive lounge is across the hall.) 	 
``It's not just the size of the national feast,'' I hear from the 
podium, ``but how many people we can fit around the table!''	 
</P>
<P>  Yes! Yes!	 
</P>
<P>  I stop at the City View Terrace, an outdoor restaurant midway down 
the concourse. The Democratic Party is serving up oysters on the 
half-shell and skewers of steak to those with a blue invitation. I 
can't enter, but I can see through the glass doors to the outside. I 
notice for the first time that the 14-foot-high chain-
link fence I pass through every morning to enter the Staples Center 
extends the entire perimeter of the center, creating 
an island in the middle of downtown.	 
</P>
<P>``The people on the street,'' the voice from the podium continues, ``the 
people I talk with, they understand the values of the Democratic 
Party!''	 
</P>
<P>      On my way out, I stop at Frank and Bev's hotdog stand on the 
main level. I ask a cashier how much she made per hour. ``Our bosses 
told us not to comment,'' she said. She glanced over her shoulder, 
her voice dropping. ``You ought to meet me outside. Yoo-eee. I could 
tell you.''	 
</P>
<P>  I cadge an invitation to a party honoring Democratic party 
chairman Ed Rendell at the Sky Bar in the Mondrian Hotel in West 
Hollywood. This is the center of cool. Willowy women in short dresses 
and bare, tanned legs. Men in creamy summer suits. A spotlight 
projects the logos of sponsors America Online, grassroots.com and UPS 
onto the side of the hotel. I see Sean Penn in a dim alcove among 
other attractive people sipping stemmed drinks.	 
</P>
<P>  Now Rendell will be associated with Cool and Beautiful. And major 
donors will feel ``serviced,'' as the political people say.	 
</P>
<P>  ``People will give to be seen,'' says Rob McCord, an investment 
banker from Boston who says he had raised $60,000 for Gore. ``Or 
because it's a business associate who's asking and they need to 
cultivate that person. Or to hedge bets: Whichever side wins, they 
want to be on record as being a supporter.''	 
</P>
<P>    As I leave, I hear a voice saying, ``If 
someone's going to own the politicians, it might as well be us.''	 
</P>
<P>  Down the street, Clinton's major fundraiser, Terry McAuliffe, is 
leaving yet another party at the Sunset Club, a place so exclusive 
there's no sign outside. Advocates for campaign-finance reform are 
picketing. McAuliffe surprises the picketers by stopping to talk.	 
``Do you think I want to be here fund-
raising when I've got four kids?'' he says. He's charming, and when 
he heads for his limo, the protesters ask him to autograph a placard 
that reads, ``McAuliffe -- corporate pimp.'' He laughs as he signs.	 
</P>
<P>  The protesters see campaign-finance reform as a human rights 
issue, even a civil rights issue. How can we have a democracy, they 
ask, when elections have given way to pledge drives? How is the 
present system -- which allows those with the most money access to 
those with the most power -- much different from the one that kept 
blacks from voting? In the 18 months ending June 30, the Democrats 
have collected $118.6 million in unregulated soft-money donations. 
The Republicans have raised $137 million. Nine of 10 contributors are 
white. Eight of 10 are male.	 
</P>
<P>    ``There's passive acceptance of the established rules,'' says 
Jason Mark of Global Exchange, which organized the protest outside 
the Sunset Club. ``Even the young people I talk to just shrug and 
say, `That's how the game is played.' ''	 
It's now midnight. I don't have a limo and can't find a cab. I hop a 
city bus heading for downtown. There's a man in combat fatigues 
holding six plastic grocery bags stuffed with who knows what. Along 
the way we pick up a twentysomething woman with bleached hair held 
off her face with a rhinestone headband. She's wearing a thin cotton 
dress that's too loose for her and black strappy heels. She asks the 
driver where she can catch a bus to Pasadena. A Latino man in a 
McDonald's uniform boards. As we pull farther from the limo crowd at 
the Sky Bar, I think of something I heard earlier.	 
``We're people who ride the bus,'' a 
voice from the podium had said. ``They (the Republicans) have never 
ridden the bus!''	 
</P>
<P>  As I look at the McDonald's man, I think of something else I 
heard. People who live in mostly white and affluent Century City have 
donated an average of $900 per resident to a political party. 
Residents of mostly Latino and poor South Central have contributed an 
average of 97 cents. It's no leap to figure out why it's so difficult 
to get legislators to increase the minimum wage. Or why, despite 
rampant gun violence in places like South Central, there are still 
such absurdly lax gun-control laws.	 
</P>
<P>  I keep wondering why there's so little outrage about the influence 
wealthy people and big business have on our government. I hear people 
say they're all for campaign-finance reform but their main issue is 
racism, or the environment, or health care. But don't they see? 
Unless they get big money out of politics, they'll never get far on 
their other issues.	 
</P>
<P>  And I keep hearing we can't change the system because donating 
money is protected under our First Amendment right of free speech. 
Are they kidding? Here's what I learned this week: Big money 
prohibits free speech. Unless you pony up the money to get into the 
Arena Club and the Sky Bar. Unless you're connected enough to score a 
meeting in the corridor of Concourse C.	 
</P>
<P>``Inclusion is what defines the Democratic Party!'' 	 
</P>
<P>  I hear the voice in my head as I walk through downtown toward my 
hotel. Two homeless men are hunkered inside cardboard boxes for the 
night. The words from the podium, the endless stream, have never 
struck me as so false and hollow and numbingly familiar. I wonder how 
I, or anyone, ever found them to be enough.	 
</P>
