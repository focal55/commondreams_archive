THE CLOSER we look, the fuzzier it gets. The recounts, whether by 
machine or by hand, whether done in hours or days, deliver different totals 
than the original vote. But how do we know that the recounts are themselves 
correct? Would a recount of the recount suffice to settle the score -- perhaps 
best two out of three?
<P>  The problem is simple, even if the solution is not: The vote was closer 
than can be counted without ruling out the possibility of statistically 
significant error. We have no way to see clearly enough to see who won. The 
system, mechanical voting machines and computers notwithstanding, is a human 
one. As such, it is open to error, malfeasance and interpretation. In other 
words, it is only relatively accurate.
</P>
<P>  Government, politics and contemporary life seem to have finally caught up 
with mathematics, science and art. Moving into the 21st century, we are caught 
in the vortex of post-post modernism, a situation predicted early in the last 
century. Einstein's Theory of Relativity states that measurement depends on 
the relative position of the measurer and changes accordingly. Heisenberg's 
Uncertainty Principle tells us that the act of taking measurement irrevocably 
changes the reality of that being measured.
</P>
<P>  The ecology of edges, looking through microscopes, telescopes or digital 
scans, predicts the same result as we are seeing in the nightly news from 
Florida. What appears as distinct and objective to the naked eye, say black 
and white, turns out to be a small point of black and one of white with a vast 
middle of gray moving in either direction.
</P>
<P>  Artists have been making art about this throughout modernism. The 
pointillists, the impressionists, mid-20th century artists like Mark Rothko, 
the op-artists, the current practitioners like Chuck Close, have all 
demonstrated for us that the world looks categorically different from up close 
than it does from far away.
</P>
<P>  We don't need to be statisticians or mathematicians to understand that 
numbers only model the universe. They approximate what we call reality, but 
they can't replicate it. With the hype of virtual reality swirling all around 
us, it's hard to see where the numbers stop and our real reality begins.
</P>
<P>  The fact is that we will never know who we elected the 43rd president of 
the United States. It is simply impossible to tell given the blunt instrument 
of the ballot box by which the issue must be measured.
</P>
<P>  Introspective artists, scientists and philosophers have queasily learned to 
live with cosmic uncertainty, the disconnect between what can be known and 
what must be lived. They have long understood that what you see might not be 
what you get, and vice versa. They know that technology can produce sublime 
beauty just as surely as it can create horrible destruction. But it cannot in 
and of itself create meaning.
</P>
<P>  We will just have to live with what it means to have elected "Either/Or" 
for president of the United States. The man who will be inaugurated in January 
may be, or may not be, the man actually elected to the post. We will have to 
live with the fact that the president is unknown.
</P>
<P>  If we can remember to remember for the next four years that this president, 
Mr. Assumed President, is a stand-in, maybe he will serve to remind us how 
much of what we take as reality is itself only an approximation. To make it 
real, we ourselves have to supply the meaning. To make meaning we have to live 
as if life counted.
