The issues that boiled into mass protest outside the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle just short of a year ago did not emerge from thin air. Concerns about the effects of globalization were nothing new to the developing world. Such fears dominated, for example, the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen back in 1995. The clear conclusion there was that development requires more than economic growth. Some features of globalization are simply unacceptable in their social and environmental costs. 
<p>
Despite this widespread awareness, however, there still is little indication that the goals and values governing global institutions are moving toward greater social responsibility. In education, investment and environmental conservation, the incentives have morphed into improving the options of the profit-maximizing individual. The investor has become much more important than the worker. A second global Social Summit last summer concluded that the major challenge of our time is to reinstate the citizen at the center of public life. 
<p>
The "invisible hand" of the market cannot imagine a decent society for all people, or work in a consistent fashion to attain it. Only human beings with a strong sense of the public good can do that. 
<p>
The 1995 Social Summit had marked a watershed in international thinking. Following years when financial institutions and many government leaders had narrowly focused their attention on economic growth and stabilization, 117 heads of state or government committed themselves "to creating an economic, political, social, cultural and legal environment" for social development.
<p>
The task was to be accomplished by new approaches to financing social development and dealing with one of the major constraints for many countries in Africa and Latin America: the debt burden. The Social Summit also called for democracy and development to be more responsive to women's interests and concerns, and stressed the need to promote people-centered sustainable development.
<p>
But are the proposed reforms really creating an enabling environment for social development? We have just completed an assessment of what has been achieved in several key areas of policy and institutional reform. 
<p>
What emerges is a fairly disturbing picture of initiatives that remain more at the level of rhetoric than implementation; and patterns of economic growth, liberalization and equality that continue to obstruct progress. Furthermore, the political pressures that are necessary for promoting social development appear relatively weak, as do the institutions that might mobilize and distribute resources more effectively.
<p>
This situation partly reflects the conditions that prevailed just before and immediately after the Social Summit: the triumph of neoliberalism, the unprecedentedly high economic growth in Asian economies, the signs of recovery in Africa and Latin America. All these tended to obviate the need for drastic reform. 
<p>
The experience of the latter half of the 1990s - in particular, the financial crisis that gripped Asia and again threatened Latin America, coupled with heightened poverty and inequality - revealed that several of the assumptions underpinning development strategy at the time of the Social Summit were seriously flawed or overly optimistic.
<p>
While the necessity for social protection has increased, resources allocated for this purpose are actually shrinking as a result of declining aid, cuts in government spending and tax avoidance. Continuing pressures to downsize and control spending have imposed limits on a renewed role for the state.
<p>
Can actors other than the state play a key role? There have been signs that big business is taking steps in this direction, projecting itself as socially and environmentally responsible. It should, however, be recognized that there are limits to the extent to which corporate social responsibility can be enhanced through voluntary initiatives and partnerships, as opposed to stronger forms of regulation and civil society pressure. 
<p>
Nevertheless, there are signs that the ideological climate for rethinking development policy is more favorable than it has been for years. Some new perspectives are gaining force. Human rights and "rights-based" development - emphasizing the primacy of human-rights law and people's ability to strengthen their claims on the state - are on the agenda.
<p>
What is evident is that globalization faces a crisis of legitimacy - and even the dominant international finance and trade organizations are beginning to question their own prescriptions and models, and to consider some of the critical elements of the Social Summit agenda.
