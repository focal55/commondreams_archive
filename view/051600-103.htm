EUGENE, Ore. -- When Phil 
 Knight, the 
chief executive of Nike, 
withdrew a 
promised 
$30 million donation to the University 
of Oregon last month, his announcement had the tone of an angry parent. 
He chastised the university for joining 
the Worker Rights Consortium, a 
group that monitors conditions in factories that make clothing with college 
logos. He accused the university of 
"inserting itself into the new global 
economy where I make my living" 
and doing so "on the wrong side, fumbling a teachable moment."

<p> Mr. Knight, an Oregon graduate, 
was angry that the university had 
joined this consortium rather than the 
Fair Labor Association, a group that 
includes as members the same industries that have profited from sweatshop conditions in their production 
plants. The Worker Rights Consortium is based on the premise that 
work conditions will not be changed by 
codes and monitors that come from 
industry, but by involvement of workers, through collective bargaining 
with management.

<p> In joining the 
consortium, the 
University of Oregon pledged to use 
its influence to improve conditions at 
factories producing clothes with 
the university logo. Mr. Knight, accusing his alma mater of shredding its 
"bonds of trust" with him, seemed 
offended that it had not asked his 
permission.

<p>   The university's decision was not 
made lightly. In March, a referendum 
sponsored by the student government 
yielded a three-fourths majority vote 
in support of membership. A committee accountable to the the university 
president, David B. Frohnmayer, and 
made up of students, faculty, administrators and alumni, voted unanimously the same month in favor of joining. 
Then the University Senate, composed 
of faculty and students, passed a resolution calling for membership. It was 
only after all these steps that President Frohnmayer signed the university into membership.

<p>  Mr. Knight's  punitive reaction really questions the autonomy  of the university itself. If the voice of one alumnus held more weight 
than a year of university-wide deliberation, what role would 
there be for shared 
governance on campus? If donations 
from corporate 
America depended 
on toeing a corporate 
line, the university 
would be better off without the money.

<p>  The goal of students across the 
country who are organizing around 
sweatshop issues is to create widespread change in an industry where 
insufficient wages and mandatory 
overtime are common. In many third 
world and American apparel factories,  there have been reports of intimidation of workers who try to 
speak out. And because it is easy for 
these factories to cut and run, vanishing across national borders and abandoning workers, many people  are hesitant to organize unions or demand a 
living wage.

<p> The Worker Rights Consortium and 
the student anti-sweatshop campaign 
challenge companies like Nike not 
only to let the public know the conditions in apparel factories, but to begin 
long-term change.   
<p>

<p> Will the debate about sweatshop 
conditions move beyond the specifics 
of monitoring and toward establishing 
the right to organize? Phil Knight's 
withdrawal of money from the University of Oregon sends the signal that his 
company is resisting a move in that 
direction.
