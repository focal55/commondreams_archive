There's no place to hide when one makes a commitment and it backfires. 
<P>
	That's the view some have of those of us who supported Ralph Nader. 
<P>
	I'm not looking for a hiding place, because I don't think it has backfired. But some folks think so, including three who called or e-mailed me the day after the election. 
<P>
	"Your support of Nader," they said in so many words that weren't always kind, might have "resulted in the election of a president you despise. How could you do it?" 
<P>
	I should clarify. I don't despise George Bush. I sympathize with him for allowing himself to be pushed into a situation for which he is eminently unqualified. What I despise is his political party, which, like the Democratic Party, is in my view fully corrupt. The Republicans have managed to carry corruption to an even lower level, ignoring the needy while working to widen the gap between the very rich and the poor. 
<P>
	Those idealistic enough to have faith in a just democracy were caught between the proverbial rock and hard place this November. I experienced discomfort at home. My wife was bitter over my role in supporting Nader, as we agreed a Bush presidency would be disastrous for a just society. She was mad enough at my constant support for Nader that she moved into the guest bedroom for the night after the TV networks first called Florida for Bush. 
<P>
	"Don't you see what you Naderites have done?" she shouted. 
<P>
	In her view and mine, an Al Gore presidency would not be as damaging to the individual and the democratic process as that of Bush. Still, a Democratic victory would persist in ransoming democracy to those big-money donors whose contributions to both candidates assure them of getting what they want in government policy no matter which party wins. That is why the Nader candidacy gave me an option other than the choice between "two evils." 
<P>
	Most of the voting population -- brainwashed by incessant, repetitive and expensive TV advertising -- disagrees with the "two evils" view as too simplistic, even if true. I say most, because votes for Nader, while small in the overall picture, were enough to prevent either of the major party candidates from getting a majority. 
<P>
	Should we be frightened by a Bush presidency? No more than we were by the terms of office of others who carried the Republican standard into the White House in recent decades: Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew, Ronald Reagan with George Bush, then Bush with Dan Quayle. (Hold on just a moment. As I recall those presidents and VPs of my adult life, I remember the deviousness of Nixon/Agnew, the elder Bush heading the CIA -- viewed as the U.S. terrorist organization by those beyond our shores -- and the shallow intellects of Reagan and Quayle. Maybe there is reason to be paranoid about the junior Bush.) 
<P>
	Still, I reassure my wife: We made it past what I call the earlier rogue's gallery, so why not with a new Bush resident of the White House? 
<P>
	The secret is not to just prayerfully float past these next four years. Our cue must be from a priority of the Nader effort too often overlooked: correcting an electoral process gone haywire. 
<P>
	None of his supporters -- least of all Nader himself -- felt the goal was to win the election. The target was to build awareness, a recognition by the public that the electorate is cheated when the same two parties restrict us to a pair of figureheads. They may vary in a few ways, but their hands are tied by the same major donors who buy them on the campaign trail, then blackmail them once in office. 
<P>
	The Green Party ticket Nader headed has environmental value. But his task, and that of all who want to cleanse our election process, must move ahead under a broader banner: campaign finance reform. That means publicly-financed elections that allow no individual donations to candidates. It also means no use of a candidate's personal fortune, like the obscene millions a Democrat used to win office in New Jersey. It can turn for guidance to a pair of elder statesmen who pioneered the modern independent effort: Rep. John Anderson and Sen. Eugene McCarthy. 
<P>
	My view may sound harsh to some. But it is nonpartisan, as what I criticize is a tragic flaw of both major parties. They can be salvaged. But only if bribery no longer is equated by the courts as free speech. 
<P>
	And only if there is room for more parties to enter the fray, allowing the electorate to hear the whole story in debates no longer limited to two. 
<P>
<P>
