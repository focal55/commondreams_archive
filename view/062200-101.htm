The great American reporter Seymour Hersh is at war  with the American military over his report in <I>The  New Yorker</I> that one of its most  lauded generals, now a member of  President Bill Clinton's Cabinet,  ordered his troops to fire on retreating Iraqis on the eve of the Gulf War ceasefire in 1991.
<p> Barry McCaffrey, commander of  the 24th Infantry Division, has denied accusations such as the machine-gunning of 350 disarmed  Iraqi prisoners.  "Why are we shooting at these people when they are  not shooting at us?" says one of his  men on a tape quoted by Hersh. "It's murder," says another.</p>
<p> The allegations against McCaffrey suggest he was a bad apple.  But the enduring secret of the 1991 Gulf  War was that it was not a war at all,  rather an epic act of homicide.   A great deal of propaganda has  been devoted to covering up this  truth and promoting the precision  of so-called smart weapons, as if  war has finally become a science.</p>
<p> The bombing of the Al-Amiriya  bunker in Baghdad in February 1991, incinerating more than 300  people,  mostly women and children, was immediately blamed on  Saddam Hussein.  The bunker, we  were told, was a "military facility".</p>
<p>Although the lie was exposed by several reporters, the taint of "Iraqi  reporting restrictions" remained.   Britain's Independent Television  News said it was censoring its  report because the material was  "too distressing".</p>
<p> Six months later,  the unedited CNN and World Television News "feeds" of footage of  the bunker were obtained by the  <I>Columbia Journalism Review</I>. "They showed scenes of incredible  carnage," wrote the reporter who viewed them.  "Rescue workers  were collapsing in grief, vomiting  from the stench, dropping blackened corpses."</p>
<p> The atrocity was passed over quickly, and the "coverage" returned to its main theme of a sanitised, scientific war. Unknown to reporters corralled in Saudi  Arabia, less than 7 per cent of the  weapons used in the Gulf War were  "smart";  most were old-fashioned  "dump" bombs.  Seventy per cent  of the 88,500 tonnes dropped on  Iraq and Kuwait - the equivalent  of more than seven Hiroshimas -  hit no military targets and fell in populated areas.</p>
<p>Paul Roberts, one of the few journalists to escape the "pool" system, travelled with Bedouins. "I experienced bombing in Cambodia, but it was nothing like that ..." he said.  "There were three  waves every night.  After 20 minutes of this carpet bombing there would be a silence and you would hear a screaming of children and people. [The survivors] were walking  around like zombies."</p>
<p> This was never published in the mainstream media, nor was the overwhelming evidence that - as in Vietnam and last year in Serbia  and Kosovo - civilians were not  mistakenly killed, but targeted. Cluster bombs, still killing and  maiming children in Kosovo, are, as  the label says, "anti-personnel".</p>
<p>As the ceasefire was being negotiated with Iraq, columns of retreating other nationalities who had been trapped in Kuwait, mostly  guest workers, were attacked by  American carrier-based aircraft.  They used cluster bombs and  napalm B, the type that sticks to the  skin while continuing to burn. Returning pilots bragged about a  "duck shoot" and a "turkey shoot". Others likened it to "shooting fish  in a barrel".</p>
<p> Unknown to journalists in the  pool system, in the two days before  the ceasefire (when the McCaffrey  atrocities allegedly happened),  American armoured bulldozers were deployed, mostly at night, burying  Iraqis alive in their trenches.</p>
<p> Six months later, the New York  <I>Newsday</I> reported that three brigades of the 1st Mechanised Infantry  Division used snow ploughs  mounted on tanks and combat  earthmovers to bury thousands of  Iraqi soldiers - some still alive -  in more than 110 kilometres of  trenches.</p>
<p> A brigade commander,  Colonel Anthony Moreno, said:   "For all I know, we could have  killed thousands." To my knowledge, the only  images of this shown in the West  included a few fleeting pictures on  the BBC.</p>
<p> The policy of the American commander, General Norman Schwarzkopf, was that Iraqi dead were not to be counted.  One of his senior officers boasted: "This is the first war in modern times where every screwdriver, every nail, is accounted for."</p>
<p> As for human beings, he added:  "I don't think anybody is going to  be able to come up with an  accurate count for the Iraqi dead." </p>
<p>The London <I>Independent</I> rejoiced in the "miraculously light  casualties".  In the US, there was  some attempt to root out the truth.  However, this was confined to very  few newspapers, such as <I>Newsday</I>, and samizdat publications such as <I>Z</I> magazine, which publishes Noam Chomsky.</p>
<p>Shortly before Christmas 1991 the Medical Educational Trust in London published a comprehensive study of casualties. Up to 250,000 men, women and children  were killed or died as a direct result of the American-led attack on Iraq.  A one-sided slaughter.</p>
<p> In evidence before the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee,  the major international relief  agencies reported that 1.8million  people had been made homeless,  and Iraq's electricity, water, sewerage, communications, health, agriculture and industrial infrastructure had been "substantially  destroyed", producing "conditions  for famine and epidemics".</p>
<p> Most of this was not reported, or was  tucked away.  In the most covered war in history, almost everybody had missed the story.</p>
<p> It is hardly surprising that, in the nine years since, the death of half a million children due to economic sanctions, and the continuing bombing of populated areas in Iraq by American and British aircraft, are not news. "The thought that the state is punishing so many innocent people," wrote  playwright Arthur Miller, "is intolerable.  And so the evidence has to be internally denied."</p>
