      <p>A FRAIL, grey-haired great-grandmother
 will be taken from her cell on Texas's death
 row next Thursday to a chamber where onlookers
 will see her strapped to a stretcher and
 injected with $86 (&#163;53) worth of lethal
 chemicals.  
      <P>Three days after her 63rd
 birthday, Betty Lou Beets looks likely to
 become the oldest inmate - and only the
 second woman - to be executed in Texas since
 the re-institution of the death penalty
 in 1976.  <P>She will also be the 120th
 person to be executed on the watch of George
 W. Bush, the Texas Governor, who has set
 a record pace in disposing of those incarcerated
 on death row. In the midst of the campaign
 for the Republican presidential nomination,
 Mr Bush finds himself assailed by the anti-death
 penalty lobby, which says that he is in
 danger of presiding over a miscarriage of
 justice. Beets claims she was a battered
 wife. <P>At her trial in 1985 Beets was
 portrayed as a Black Widow, a cold-blooded
 killer who had shot dead two husbands to
 claim their life insurance. It had appeared
 originally that her fifth husband, Jimmy
 Beets, had drowned while out in his boat
 on a lake.  <P>Two years later, however,
 acting on a tip-off, investigators found
 the fireman's decomposing body in a sleeping
 bag buried in the grounds of Beets's mobile
 home in Gun Barrel City. <P>They also found
 the body of Beets's fourth husband, Doyle
 Wayne Barker, under the patio. Both had
 gunshot wounds to the head and the jury
 returned  guilty verdicts. <P>But there
 is a more complicated version of the story.
 The jury rejected Beets's claim that her
 son, Robert Branson, had killed her husband
 during an argument and that she had helped
 to bury the body because he was on probation.
  <P>It also rejected the defence's insistence
 that there was no evidence that she fired
 the gun and it was not to know that Beets
 subsequently would not be tried with the
 murder of her fourth husband, whose death
 was used to show a pattern of spousal homicide.
 <P>However, those fighting to save Beets's
 life say that the crucial factor is that
 the court was not told about her background.
 In a letter to Mr Bush appealing for a stay
 of execution, Amnesty and the National Coalition
 Against Domestic Violence say that Beets
 has hearing problems and is mentally handicapped,
 that she was raised by a violent and alcoholic
 father and a mentally ill mother and went
 through a succession of abusive marriages.
 <P>She was married first at 15, became a
 mother a year later and was a grandmother
 at 30. All along the way, but particularly
 in the last two marriages, she was battered.
 Even if she killed her husband, the argument
 runs, she should be spared death because
 she had suffered provocation. In an interview
 this week, Beets said that she could not
 remember the killing, which she said took
 place after a quarrel while she was getting
 ready for  her bath. <P>"We started arguing,
 and after that I really don't remember much
 of what happened except that my son came
 in and [Jimmy] started in on him. And he
 had already gotten a gun."  <P>Juley Fulcher,
 of the National Coalition, said: "Texas
 failed to protect Betty Lou Beets when she
 was being beaten by an abusive spouse. It
 will be a terrible miscarriage of justice
 if she is executed."  <P>Those clamouring
 for clemency have been joined by Sister
 Helen Prejean, whose non-fiction book about
 a man on death row, <I>Dead Man Walking</I>,
 was turned into a film. They point out that
 in five other states the sentences of battered
 women have been commuted. During the six
 years that Mr Bush has been Governor, his
 state has far exceeded any other in executing
 its prisoners. Just one sentence has been
 commuted, that of a man  who was conclusively
 shown to have been in a different state
 at the time of the crime of which he had
 been convicted. <P>There has been increased
 debate about the death penalty after a decision
 by the right-wing Governor of Illinois to
 halt all executions in his state, because
 13 people scheduled to die had turned out
 to be innocent. <P> They included three
 accused who were exonerated after a student
 project showed that other men were guilty.
 At least one innocent man is believed to
 have died there. <P>This week President
 Clinton said that Governors should "look
 very closely" at their death penalty systems
 to make sure that innocent people were not
 executed.<P><A NAME="story2"><FONT SIZE=4></FONT></A><P><TABLE

 <LI>George W. Bush, right, has made Texas
 the execution capital of America. The state
 is responsible for 206 of the 600-odd executions
 since the death penalty was re-instituted
 in the US in 1976. In his six years in office,
 119 inmates have died.  <P>He says the clemency
 process is the "fail safe" and he can  tell
 the parole board that a case may be worth
 another look. It can commute a death sentence,
 but has done so only once during Mr Bush's
 governorship.
