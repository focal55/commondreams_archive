            FORT MYERS, FLA. -- You can forget most of what you've heard and seen 
            on CNN regarding the situation in Florida. As someone who has been 
            in both northern and southern parts of the state for 12 of the past 
            20 days, I can tell you that the carefully crafted rhetoric of the 
            spin doctors who parade before the cameras does not do justice to 
            the vitriol on the ground. 
            <P>People here are bitterly angry at a host of injustices, and the 
              volatility level is rising. Indeed, with the Florida Legislature 
              preparing for a special session designed to trump the U.S. Supreme 
              Court should it rule in favor of Vice President Al Gore, the words 
              "a pending revolution" may not be hyperbolic. Because, if the overwhelmingly 
              Republican Legislature appoints Bush electors in the face of an 
              unprecedented number of voting irregularities -- some certainly 
              fraudulent, others mere oversights -- there is no telling what will 
              happen in this state.</P>
            <P>Florida has a long-standing tradition of deep polarization that's 
              engendered hatred between rich and poor, black, white and Hispanic, 
              Southerners and Northerners, and Republicans and Democrats. Florida 
              is a "right to work" state where, on average, blue-collar employees 
              earn some $4,000 less annually than unionized workers in other states. 
              Florida also leads the nation in gated communities, where impoverished 
              or poorly paid service workers seethe in anger at the Midas-like 
              wealth of their employers. </P>
            <P>In fact, much of the state has the feel of a Third World dictatorship: 
              Inside the gates are ornately decorated mansions surrounded by well-manicured 
              golf courses and gardens that ease the tensions of the good life. 
              Outside, an underclass of poor or middle-income people vie for the 
              table scraps of the new economy and for the privilege of perhaps 
              rising to the top alongside their betters.</P>
            <P>Class and racial conflict fuels the current presidential conflagration 
              in Florida, but you won't hear about that on CNN. That network and 
              other major media outlets are too busy tracking the latest spin 
              from hired guns to show you the aspirations and the conflicts among 
              real people. Yet, those aspirations and the opposition they've inspired 
              are the reason the state could precipitate a constitutional crisis 
              in the next two weeks.</P>
            <P>At the center of Florida's class and race conflict is Gov. Jeb 
              Bush. He successfully resisted Ward Connerly's attempts to place 
              a referendum on affirmative action on the November ballot. This 
              maneuver managed to save his brother the embarrassment of running 
              on a ballot that contained an anti-affirmative-action petition, 
              something that the Bush clan feared would galvanize the minority 
              vote and all but give Gore the state of Florida.</P>
            <P>But Jeb Bush could not ignore the insistent calls from middle-class 
              and poor whites to neutralize if not destroy affirmative action. 
              Although it had failed to truly level the playing field, affirmative 
              action in Florida had given a number of minority contractors and 
              small businesses enough work to threaten the traditional class structure. 
              Blacks and Hispanics were creeping up the income ladder, embarrassing 
              the cracker class with their fancy automobiles and memberships at 
              private clubs. Something had to be done.</P>
            <P>Enter Jeb Bush and his One Florida plan. Saying that it "transcended 
              affirmative action," Bush signed an executive order banning discrimination 
              on the basis of race and gender in Florida and guaranteeing the 
              top 20 percent of high school graduates a college education, regardless 
              of standardized test results. But the calculated effect of One Florida 
              was to moderate anti-Bush feeling among some Hispanics, primarily 
              Cubans, and to further divide the state's already fragile minority 
              coalition.</P>
            <P>African-Americans publicly vowed revenge. As part of an unprecedented 
              $10 million national voter registration campaign waged by the NAACP, 
              Florida blacks went to the polls in droves. In fact, nearly 70 percent 
              more black Floridians cast ballots this year than in 1996 --in real 
              numbers, a whopping 363,000 more. Estimates are that 29 percent 
              of Gore's votes in Florida came from African-Americans, as opposed 
              to 19 percent in the rest of the nation. This was supposed to be 
              the black community's payback to Jeb Bush.</P>
            <P>But on Election Day, how many of those votes were counted? In Wakulla 
              County, Highway Patrol troopers were stationed outside voting precincts 
              with lights flashing, intimidating and ticketing black voters, some 
              of whom were too afraid to vote. In overwhelmingly black Volusia 
              County, officials say a mysterious number of votes for Gore disappeared 
              from the totals and may not have been included in the final count. 
              African-American citizens in Duval, Palm Beach, Broward and Hillsborough 
              counties also say they were intimidated. National NAACP officials 
              have called for a federal investigation and are suing state officials.</P>
            <P>Add to this the shocking intimidation of election officials in 
              Miami-Dade County, numerous undercounts, illegal ballot handling 
              by Republicans, and it begins to look as if the election was engineered. 
              This is why Democratic officials on the ground in Florida are incensed, 
              perhaps more than Gore operatives: They know who voted in their 
              counties, they've done the numbers themselves, and they say the 
              figures don't add up.</P>
            <P>Partisanship makes it difficult to assess the truth. But imagine, 
              if you will, reading an account of this very same election in some 
              Third World nation. How many of us would believe such an election 
              to be a fair and accurate reflection of the will of the people? 
              Not many.</P>
