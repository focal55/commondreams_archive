MY POLITICAL BELIEFS are woven into childhood memories. I remember 
hearing stories about being rolled along in a stroller at political 
demonstrations and going to see Jesse Jackson speak in Pittsburgh 
when he ran for president in 1988 -- he bought me an ice cream.
<P>When I was 12, I went to the local headquarters of the 
Democratic Party and called people to make sure they voted. Those I 
called thought it was a joke, because I was so young. But in my 
family, you can't be apathetic about politics. It was a given that I 
would register as a Democrat. In my family, the joke goes,``Being a 
person of color in the Republican Party is like being a deer in the 
National Rifle Association.''	 
</P>
<P>I never understood how deeply ingrained this idea had become until 
I finally ventured out of Berkeley's liberal cocoon and interned in 
Washington, D.C., last summer. I had to confront my own prejudices 
when I realized that I was afraid to tell my mom I had made friends 
with Republicans. It's funny -- some people upset their parents by 
piercing an obscure body part. I thought I would upset my parents by 
spending Saturday night with people who had conservative views on 
welfare and affirmative action.	 
</P>
<P>  Becoming friends with young Republicans in D.C., however, didn't 
change my views. But sometimes someone would make a derogatory 
comment about Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer from California, or 
complain that those ``black-power writers'' like Toni Morrison and 
Alice Walker were replacing Shakespeare and Chaucer as mandatory 
school reading. I would just stare down at my french fries and try 
not to laugh or yell. But I can't look the other way when it comes to 
my first vote.	 
</P>
<P>  For years, I've waited to finally vote in a presidential election. 
But, now that I can, I don't feel the excitement that I always 
anticipated: I'm more worried than anything else. The prospect of 
George W. Bush as the leader of the free world is downright 
frightening. 	 
</P>
<P>  As a young person, I strongly disagree with Bush's reforms to the 
juvenile justice system in Texas, such as lowering the age at which a 
minor can be tried as an adult to 14. I have friends and relatives 
who have been in juvenile facilities, and I've seen it do much more 
harm than good. 	 
</P>
<P>  As a person of color, I am appalled by Dick Cheney's 1986 vote 
against a House resolution calling for the South African government 
to free Nelson Mandela.	 
</P>
<P>  As a woman, I believe a Bush/Cheney administration would threaten 
my reproductive 
rights. I am 19, an age where I see a lot of my peers getting 
pregnant and dropping out of school. If I am ever in that situation, 
I want the power to decide if I will become a parent. If Bush becomes 
our next president, I will lose the freedom to be who I am. 	 

<P><I>Belia Mayeno-Choy, 19, a student at Vista College in Berkeley, is a reporter and producer for Youth Radio.</I>
