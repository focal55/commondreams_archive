 Yesterday's release of 
the National Park 
Service plan for a 
"prescribed burn" in 
New Mexico -- the 
fire that went awry 
and destroyed homes and businesses 
in Los Alamos --  has added to calls 
for a re-evaluation of the service's 
fire policies. But some of these exhortations, coming from  the timber 
industry's supporters in Congress, 
look more like opportunism than considered criticism of what went wrong 
in this fire.

<p>  For those who want more commercial logging of America's national forests, the Los Alamos tragedy 
plays into a stance that is already 
well rehearsed: that more logging 
can "reduce the risk of catastrophic 
wildfires." It is an argument that 
doesn't hold up.

<p>  While Senator Larry Craig, an Idaho Republican, and his allies in the 
timber industry talk about "thinning 
underbrush," the real interest of the 
industry is in gaining access to the 
last remaining mature forests on 
federal lands.

<p> In April 1999, the General Accounting Office issued a report that raised 
serious questions about the use of 
timber sales as a tool of fire management.   
It noted that "most of the trees 
that need to be removed to reduce 
accumulated fuels are small in diameter" -- the very trees that have 
"little or no commercial value."

<p> As it offers timber for sale to loggers, the Forest Service tends to 
"focus on areas with high-value commercial timber rather than on areas 
with high fire hazards," the report 
said. Its sales include "more large, 
commercially valuable trees" than 
are necessary to reduce the so-called 
accumulated fuels (in other words, 
the trees that are most likely to burn 
in a forest fire).

<p>  The Forest Service typically keeps 
about 90 percent of the revenue from 
these timber sales. The money has 
helped  finance both the agency's 
budget and its preparations for more 
 commercial logging. Meanwhile,  the 
logging industry gets rich on cheap 
timber, and pro-timber members of 
Congress receive millions in campaign contributions as an incentive 
to keep this system going. Taxpayers 
take an enormous loss. 

<p>   The truth is that timber sales are 
causing catastrophic wildfires on national forests, not alleviating them. 
The Sierra Nevada Ecosystem 
Project Report, issued in 1996 by the 
federal government, found that "timber harvest, through its effects on 
forest structure, local microclimate 
and fuel accumulation, has increased 
fire severity more than any other 
recent human activity." The reason 
goes back to the same conflict that 
the G.A.O. found: loggers want the 
big trees, not the little ones that act 
as fuel in forest fires.

<p> After a "thinning" timber sale, a 
forest has far fewer of the large 
trees, which are naturally fire-resistant because of their thick bark; indeed, many of these trees are centuries old and have already survived 
many fires. Without them, there is 
less shade. The forest is drier and 
hotter, making the remaining, smaller trees more susceptible to burning. 
 After logging, forests also have accumulations of flammable debris 
known as "slash piles" --  unsalable 
branches and limbs left by logging 
crews.


<p>  In 1994, Jack Ward Thomas, then 
chief of the Forest Service, said in 
congressional testimony that fires 
don't hurt the forest itself. Even fires 
that kill many trees "in an area from 
which you do not expect to extract 
timber" might be "perfectly acceptable," he said. He gave the example 
of Yellowstone National Park. "It 
burns up; it burns hot, and the system that's associated with it comes 
back," he said. 

<p>   After several decades of federal 
management that suppressed fires 
-- with timber sales in mind -- some 
forests on federal lands have actually become more flammable, since 
they have been deprived of fire's 
important natural role of clearing 
brush under the big trees and returning nutrients to the soil.

<p>  Controlled burning has been used 
successfully for over a decade to 
reintroduce fire into forest ecosystems. The National Park Service reports that fewer than 1 percent of 
controlled burns result in "escapes" 
-- fires that cross their predesigned 
boundaries. Even then, people and 
property are almost never hurt.

<p>   This does not excuse any carelessness, of course, that may have led to 
the New Mexico fire, which clearly 
did escape, and tragically so.   
<p>But it 
would be an even  bigger tragedy if 
we allowed the timber industry's allies in Congress to continue destroying our national forests under the 
self-serving guise of fire management. Ultimately, our public forests 
will be safe only when Congress 
passes legislation to end the timber 
sales within them.
