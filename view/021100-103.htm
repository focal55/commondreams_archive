<p>For the last year we have watched the U.S. government's attempt to apply
anti-monopoly laws to the business practices of Microsoft. Ever since the
Sherman Antitrust Act was passed a century ago, it has been widely accepted
that domination of a market by a private corporation can be bad for business,
bad for consumers and bad for the nation.
<P>
   The same is true in politics, yet the Department of Justice gives the
Republican-Democrat duopoly a free ride. The problem is that, unlike
corporations that are regulated by government, the Democrats and Republicans
themselves make up the political laws and regulations. The fox is guarding the
hen house. Two recent examples demonstrate this.
<P>

   Last month the Commission on Presidential Debates established criteria for
who would be permitted to participate in televised presidential debates this
fall. Who controls the commission? Why, the Democrats and Republicans. Not
surprisingly, the criteria established are so severe that the only minor party
or independent presidential candidate who might have qualified in the last 60
years was George Wallace in 1968.
<P>
   The CPD would require candidates to have at least 15 percent of the vote in
five national polls a week before a debate. Ross Perot would not have
qualified in 1992 despite ultimately winning 19 percent after he was included
in the debates. Neither would John Anderson, independent presidential
candidate in 1980. Using this criterion, Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota would
have been barred from participating in their televised gubernatorial debates.
<P>
   The CPD would have us believe the debates are not about serious discussion
regarding our country's future by credible candidates, but only about choosing
between candidates who can win. Yet Jesse Ventura's poll numbers did not rise
until voters could contrast him with his competition via Minnesota's televised
debates.
<P>
   It's not only minor party or independent candidates who are excluded by the
monopoly practices of the Democrats and Republicans. Sometimes their political
machines try to eat one of their own. Thus, we had the recent attempt by the
Republican Party of New York, which supports George Bush, to bar John McCain
from the New York state ballot. Because New York is our third-largest state
and an important prize for any candidate, the brazen practices of these
Republicans could have affected the right of Republican voters all across the
country to nominate their presidential candidate. It took a federal lawsuit
and popular pressure for the Bush forces in New York to back down.
<P>
   It doesn't end there. Next year the politicians will collude to use
redistricting--the decennial practice of re-drawing legislative district
lines--to guarantee themselves safe seats and subsequent re-election. Behind
closed doors, the incumbent politicians will use increasingly sophisticated
computer technology and data to handpick their voters before the voters have a
chance to pick them. Even campaign-finance reform won't be able to crack the
fortress created by these political monopolies.
<P>
   Who is being hurt by all this? The voters, that's who. Because it results
in voters--political consumers--having less and less choice at the ballot box.
Voters are being denied opportunities even to hear other candidates' ideas and
policies.
<P>
   Monopoly politics prevails in state after state, where safe,
non-competitive districts, uncontested races and unbeatable incumbents are
becoming the rule. Lacking sufficient choice, voters are becoming increasingly
alienated and turning out to the polls in fewer and fewer numbers.
<P>
   Monopoly politics is no way to run our elections. The government regulates
big business, but who will regulate the monopoly practices of the Republicrats
who run the government?
<P>
