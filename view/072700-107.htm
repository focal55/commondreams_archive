SO WHO IS SURPRISED? Who on Earth -- barring CNN and an increasingly 
desperate President Clinton -- really thought they could turn the 
pumpkin of the Oslo agreement into a golden carriage of peace?	 

<P>  What folly prompted Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to accept 
that agreement seven years ago, a treaty without guarantees, which 
promised no statehood, no end to Jewish settlements, no return of 
Palestinian refugees and -- most important of all -- no capital in 
Jerusalem?	 
</P>
<P>  The carriage may have looked good on the White House lawn in 1993, 
with its ``historic'' handshake between Arafat and Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin. But it had no wheels.	 
</P>
<P>  Seven years ago, it was all about trust -- technicolor trust -- 
the ``peace of the brave,'' the euphoria of two old enemies, the sons 
of Abraham making friends. But everything they should have been 
talking about -- Jerusalem, settlers, refugees, statehood -- was 
postponed for three years.	 
</P>
<P>And such was the nature of this lopsided, hopelessly unfair 
agreement, that the deadlines slipped away and only now have the 
antagonists confronted reality: Oslo doesn't work.	 
</P>
<P>  Just look at what it originally said. The Oslo Declaration of 
Principles said that ``it is understood that . . . final status 
negotiations will lead to the implementation of Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338.''	 
</P>
<P>  These 1967 and 1973 resolutions called for the withdrawal of 
Israeli forces from Arab territories seized in the 1967 war and the 
security of all states in the area.	 
</P>
<P>  But Oslo allowed the Israelis to renegotiate Resolution 242, to 
decide which bits of occupied territory it would give back -- the 
garbage tip of Gaza, for example -- and which parts it would keep: 
Jerusalem and most of the settlements.	 
</P>
<P>  And by Tuesday Clinton was reduced to changing the very terms of 
Oslo, announcing only that the negotiations were ``based'' on 242 and 
338.	 
</P>
<P>  Arafat must have realized that the end had come when U.S. 
Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright made her preposterous offer of ``a sense of 
sovereignty'' over the Muslim religious sites of Jerusalem.	 
</P>
<P>  So much for statehood. So much for an Israeli withdrawal from 
occupied East Jerusalem. So much for a halt to settlement building.	 
</P>
<P>  Yitzhak Rabin died for his peace treaty with the Palestinians but 
Arafat is not the stuff of which martyrs are made. He knows what 
happened to Irish revolutionary Michael Collins after a one-sided 
``peace.''	 
</P>
<P>  Yet what can Arafat tell his people now? Seven years ago, I drove 
the bypass roads that Israel was building to prevent Palestinians 
reaching Jerusalem.	 
</P>
<P>  ``Arafat's Road to Ruin'' was the paper's headline to my story. 
Israel's friends exploded in rage. What cynicism. What bias. Did we 
not realize that Oslo represented the best chance for peace?	 
</P>
<P>  Sadly, the story of that winding road was all too accurate. It ran 
out, Tuesday, at Camp David.	 
</P>
<P>  Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak wouldn't give up Jerusalem. He 
wouldn't abandon the settlements. Arafat would not 
make the ``concession'' -- read capitulation -- of ceding Israeli 
control over Jerusalem.	 
</P>
<P>  So the sons of Abraham acknowledged what so many Israelis and 
Palestinians knew all along: that Oslo didn't work.	 
</P>
<P>  Clinton predictably saw fit to praise the stronger of the two 
parties -- he spoke of Barak's ``courage, vision,'' etc. -- but 
merely referred to Arafat's ``commitment.''	 
</P>
<P>  So much for America's role as the ``honest broker'' of the Middle 
East peace.	 
</P>
<P>  Offered virtual sovereignty to secure virtual peace, the 
Palestinian leadership -- corrupt and effete and undemocratic -- 
preferred failure to humiliation.	 
</P>
<P>  Now they are supposed to talk it all through again by 
mid-September. And Clinton says they must avoid ``unilateral action'' 
</P>
<P>--he meant a declaration of statehood by Arafat.	 
</P>
<P>  Have no doubt, it may be all Arafat has left to offer 
Palestinians. Virtual statehood, that is.
