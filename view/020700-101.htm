<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TWENTY YEARS AGO, when Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wisc.) was championing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibited U.S. companies from bribing their way to sales in foreign countries, many large U.S. corporations were outraged and opposed. Unfair, they cried  other Western countries allow foreign bribes (in fact, such bribes were deductible in some countries), and that will take business away from U.S. firms.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. Proxmire would then challenge them to cite any examples in which U.S. companies lost contracts overseas because a European or Japanese company bribed its way to a deal. Tellingly, U.S. companies could not supply the senator with any evidence.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the anti-bribery law was rarely enforced by the Justice Department, the act established a standard of business practices based on merits instead of money. U.S. businesses managed to survive, while the pressure rose on the European nations to pass legislation that would outlaw such bribes as well.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year 34 countries agreed to an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development anti-bribery convention that makes the bribery of foreign officials a criminal offense. The United States exerted an upward pull on the process by not joining the race to the bottom of the legal barrel.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These laws are still largely lip service. Their enforcement is not a high priority, and naturally evidence is hard to obtain for prosecution. But lip service is a start, and it encourages action.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And, according to the business-oriented Transparency International, which, on Jan. 20, 2000, issued an unprecedented Bribe Payers Survey, action is indeed needed. Peter Eigen, TI's chair, introduced the survey with these words:
</font>
<p>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The scale of bribe-paying by international corporations in the developing countries of the world is massive. Actions by the majority of governments of the leading industrial countries to curb international corruption are modest. The results include growing poverty in poor countries, persistent undermining of the institutions of democracy, and mounting distortions in fair international commerce."</font></blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The survey itself was quite ingenious. It was based on 779 lengthy interviews with business leaders in 14 mostly third world countries, including Indonesia, India, Argentina, Brazil, Morocco, Nigeria, and South Africa. Many of those interviewed represented major companies. Others were executives at accounting and law firms and members of chambers of commerce.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the more interesting questions are those relating to perceptions of bribes being paid by the 19 leading export companies  mostly in the industrialized West  to third world countries.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those interviewed were asked to rank the export companies by how likely they would bribe to win or retain business. The United States did not fare that well, ranking ninth, below Sweden, Australia, Canada, Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Belgium; it tied with Germany.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The survey showed that the industries more likely to bribe  or be extorted to bribe by senior public officials  were, in order of corruption levels, (1) public works contracts and construction, (2) arms and defense industry, (3) power (including petroleum and energy), (4) industry (including mining), (5) health care, (6) telecommunications (equipment and services), (7) civilian aerospace, (8) banking and finance, and (9) agriculture. 
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To illustrate how much more work needs to be done by international companies, TI's interviews found that most of these executives either had not heard of or were only dimly aware of the OECD anti-bribery convention. Their companies were likewise lagging behind in their compliance plans.
