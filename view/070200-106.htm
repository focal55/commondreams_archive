On bandstands around the country 
this Fourth of July, politicians will offer heartfelt homilies 
about ``the greatest nation on Earth,'' the United States.
<P> As flags wave in the background, we will tell ourselves a 
story of the great march of progress the United States has led 
around the world.	 
</P>
<P> On the day we mark our independence from 
an old empire, we will talk about the fight for freedom, past 
and future.	 
</P>
<P> The rhetoric is designed to make Americans 
feel good about America, but I've always felt uneasy with the 
Fourth, a holiday allegedly full of a reflective humility yet 
one that is reflexively self-congratulatory.	 
</P>
<P> This year, 
the talk of the greatest of nations will ring more hollow to 
me than ever, because it's become impossible to ignore some 
painful truths about the United States: The humility is false. 
The claim of greatness is actually self-deception. The progress 
has not always been so progressive. The march often has been 
over the broken bodies of victims whose cries we refuse to hear. 
And the freedom we claim for ourselves we are too often reluctant 
to grant to others.	 
</P>
<P> On this Fourth, I will be forced to 
face a conclusion I have long wanted to avoid: We are the empire, 
soon to be judged by history the way all empires have been judged, 
as cruel and self-aggrandizing. If we want to escape that judgment, 
we as citizens of the empire cannot wait for our leaders or 
the wealthy to lead us, for theirs is the path to power, not 
greatness.	 
</P>
<P> This Fourth of July, I believe that citizens 
of the United States have to commit the ultimate act of patriotism: 
We must stop being Americans.	 
</P>
<P> By that I don't mean we must 
give up on the truly noble ideals associated with the United 
States. Nor do I mean we must turn our backs on the many accomplishments 
of the people of this country. Nor must we turn our backs on 
each other. Instead, we must tell the truth about what being 
an American has come to mean, and we must find a way to rethink 
and reshape who we are. We are too busy congratulating ourselves; 
we need to be questioning ourselves.	 
</P>
<P> Such talk may sound 
strange, especially coming at a time of great triumphalism in 
the United States. Across the globe our military, political 
and economic power is respected or feared, or both. But two 
questions nag: Would a nation that is truly great want to hoard 
such power? And how do we use that power? The answers require 
honest self-reflection about the gap between the values we tell 
ourselves we hold and the values reflected in our actions, at 
home and abroad. Such honesty means realizing that unchallenged 
power and enormous privilege can block us from seeing ourselves 
and our role in the world clearly.	 
</P>
<P> Some recent vignettes 
from my life help explain my distress:	 
</P>
<P> --  At a political 
event, I was holding a sign that explained that the economic 
embargo on Iraq has killed 1 million innocent civilians and 
asked how many deaths will it take for the United States to 
abandon our failed policy. A man, an American, walked by, pondered, 
and said, ``I don't know --  how about 2 million?''	 
</P>
<P> -- The wealthy American CEO of an Internet company joked at a 
meeting with employees about his new sport utility vehicle, 
the biggest on the market. ``I bought it,'' he laughed, ``because 
it gets the worst gas mileage.''	 
</P>
<P> --  A woman from East 
Timor described to an American audience the beauty of the Timorese 
countryside but explained that there is no spot left in her 
country that does not conjure memories of massacres at the hands 
of the Indonesian invaders. ``Do you understand that they have 
been killing us for more than 20 years with American weapons, 
with American support?'' she asked.	 
</P>
<P> --  While walking with 
a 3-year-old one chilly winter morning, we passed a man sleeping 
in a doorway. ``Why is that man sleeping outside?'' the child 
asked. I had no answer, only another question: Would I have 
noticed the man if not for the child's question?	 
</P>
<P> Who are we Americans? Who are we to the Iraqi mother who watches her 
child die in her arms because there is no clean water or adequate 
food or medicine in her town because of our embargo? Who are 
we when we slowly choke the planet to death because of self-indulgent 
consumption that most people around the world find grotesque? 
Who are we to the survivors in East Timor, rebuilding their 
lives as they mourn loved ones dead from American weapons, all 
because we didn't want to disturb profitable business dealings 
with the conquering Indonesians? Who are we when we step over 
our brothers and sisters on the street, their pain invisible 
to us?	 
</P>
<P> What does it mean to be an American in the age of 
American empire? Can we tell ourselves the truth about that? 
Is there a mirror that can hold the enormity of that image? 
And if we do dare to look, where do we go from there?	 
</P>
<P> The politicians and the wealthy are not going to dismantle the empire 
on their own. It is unlikely they will wake up one morning and 
suddenly discover a long-misplaced conscience. And if they magically 
did, the institutions and systems in which they work would not 
go away. We should expect those with power in the powerful institutions 
to continue to concentrate even more power in even fewer hands. 
The rest of us --  the vast majority of Americans --  face the 
challenge of forcing change, of making ``American'' mean something 
more than callousness, greed, smugness, orgiastic levels of 
consumption, disregard for the suffering of others and a willingness 
to kill to protect our privilege and power.	 
</P>
<P> Make no mistake: 
That is what ``American'' means to much of the rest of the world. 
But it need not always mean that. Change is possible. We can 
start by refusing to repeat the misleading story about our greatness 
and benevolence. We can stop being loyal citizens of the empire.	 
</P>
<P> The task is not as difficult as it may seem, in part because 
a portion of the story we tell ourselves is true: We do live 
in one of the freest societies that has ever existed. We can 
speak with little fear of retribution. We can organize. We can 
act.	 
</P>
<P> This Fourth of July, we can challenge the holiday's 
empty rhetoric. When the politicians talk about being the greatest 
nation on Earth, we can stand up and question the arrogance 
of such a claim. When they talk about the American commitment 
to peace, we can ask why the United States leads the world in 
weapons sales and routinely conducts military operations outside 
international law. When they talk about the booming economy, 
we can ask who benefits from the stock market and financial 
speculation, and who is left behind. Most important, when they 
tell us that being an American means being loyal to the empire, 
we can stand up and say, ``Enough --  I will be an American 
no longer.'' Then we can step onto the long road to redefining 
ourselves.	 
</P>
<P> We have to challenge our own privilege, question 
our own consumption, ask on whose backs our comfort is built. 
We have to realize that the things we have won have come with 
a price, that what we have taken has costs for others, now and 
for future generations. If we do that with commitment and compassion, 
it may well turn out we stop worrying about what it means to 
be an American and start concentrating on what it means to be 
a human being.
