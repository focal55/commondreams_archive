<p>America has come a long way since the political revolution of
1968, when Madison's Midge Miller and New York's Allard Lowenstein hatched a
scheme that would depose a sitting president, reshape the Democratic Party and
bring a generation of young activists into an electoral process that had until
then seemed too closed and corrupt to bother with.</p>
<p>Miller and Lowenstein were part of a small band of anti-Vietnam War activists
who believed it was possible to challenge President Lyndon Johnson on the issue
in that year's Democratic primaries. They convinced then U.S. Sen. Eugene
McCarthy, D-Minn., to make the run and by the end of March, just a few days
before the Wisconsin primary, Johnson was out.</p>
<p>Thirty-two years later, Midge Miller is still active in Madison, organizing
forums and campaigns with an energy that is daunting to people half her age. But
Allard Lowenstein is long gone -- murdered 20 years ago this month by a deranged
man whose gunshots robbed this country of one of its most dynamic political
leaders.</p>
<p>A measure of the loss America suffered with the death of Lowenstein was in
evidence last week, when some of his friends organized a tribute to the man
whose leadership was critical to the civil rights, anti-war, international
solidarity and gay liberation movements of the 1960s and 1970s. The memorial
event drew an overflow crowd to one of the largest gathering rooms at the
Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill. More than 200 people, including
some of the most prominent Democrats in the current Congress -- not to mention a
few progressive Republicans -- showed up.</p>
<p>Everyone in the room, it seemed, had a story about how Lowenstein, a man who
literally demanded that young people commit themselves to a life of activism,
had fundamentally changed their life.</p>
<p>For instance, former U.S. Sen. Don Riegle explained that Lowenstein "had some
considerable bearing on my decision to change parties.'' Elected to the House as
a Republican from Flint, Mich., in the 1960s, Riegle's office adjoined that of
Lowenstein, who served one term as a Democrat from New York. The two men shared
a commitment to the anti-war movement and to civil rights, and Lowenstein
convinced Riegle that those causes could be better served within the Democratic
Party. Riegle switched in the early 1970s and was eventually elected to the
Senate as a Democrat.</p>
<p>Former U.S. Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., got to know Lowenstein when she
served as a member of the Student Senate at the University of Minnesota in the
late 1950s and early 1960s. Lowenstein, who was passionate about ending
colonialism in Africa, drew her into the anti-apartheid movement in the days
before®MD-IT¯ Nelson Mandela was jailed. "He had a knack for focusing in on
issues that no one else was paying attention to and getting people to understand
that these were vital struggles,'' Schroeder said. "That just shows you the
energy and the passion of the man.''</p>
<p>Musing about how aghast Lowenstein would respond to conservative Republican
George W. Bush campaigning as a "reformer,'' Schroeder said, "I would have loved
to see Al's face when George W. Bush, this Texas oil-money candidate, started
talking about how he's for campaign finance reform, about how he's a reformer.
Al wouldn't have allowed him to get away with it. Al would have called the
lighting down on that one.''</p>
<p>One after another, people testified to the impact that Lowenstein had on
their lives, and to the activist path his memory commands them to follow even
now. U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., reflected about how he worked on
Lowenstein's first congressional campaign. Washington lawyer Abbe Lowell -- the
man who grilled Ken Starr during the House impeachment hearings -- recalled
organizing an anti-war rally on Long Island in 1967 and inviting Lowenstein to
speak.</p>
<p>"I remember his voice to this day -- calling us to do more with our lives, to
do better,'' Lowell said. "For me -- as it was for a lot of people in my
generation -- Al Lowenstein represented the reason I left a little place called
Westbury on Long Island and ended up in a place called the Rayburn Building.''</p>
<p>As she listened to the testaments to her fallen comrade, Pat Schroeder noted
that, in a time when Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates is considered a role
model: "We don't need another Bill Gates, we need more Al Lowensteins. We really
need to remember that this civilization needs a lot more Al Lowensteins.''</p>
<p>Al Lowenstein would, no doubt, have been honored by that sentiment. But he
wouldn't have allowed the praise to deflect him from saying, "OK, now let's get
to work. There's a campaign to get started, a rally to organize, a petition to
be passed, a world to win.''
