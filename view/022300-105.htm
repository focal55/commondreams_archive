<p>Would an individual who believes the nation's drug laws are
unconstitutional and should be repealed be appointed to head the

Drug Enforcement Agency?
<p>No way.
<p>Would the United States Senate confirm an individual with these
views to be the nation's chief drug law enforcement official?
<p>Absolutely not.
<p>Then, what in the world is Bradley Smith's name doing pending in
the Senate for confirmation to serve as a Commissioner on the

Federal Election Commission (FEC).
<p>Mr. Smith - who has stated that the nation's campaign finance
laws are unconstitutional and should be repealed - was nominated

by President Clinton to serve on the FEC, the agency responsible

for enforcing the nation's campaign finance laws.
<p>That's the same President Clinton who is a "self-proclaimed"
supporter of campaign finance laws and campaign finance reform.
<p>The Smith nomination was dictated by Senate Republican Majority
Leader Trent Lott and Senator Mitch McConnell, the leading Senate

defenders of the corrupt campaign finance status quo in Washington,

and Smith's two leading advocates for the Commission job.
<p>The President lamely explained his nomination of Smith, a fierce
opponent of campaign finance laws, by saying he was just following

custom to cede to the other major party the ability to name three

of the six FEC Commissioners. In fact, however, when the

Republicans held the White House, President Reagan had no problem

rejecting a FEC nominee of the Democrats that he found to be

objectionable.
<p>So what are the potential consequences of Clinton's campaign
finance betrayal if the Senate proceeds to confirm Smith to serve

on the Commission?
<p>Well, here is what Mr. Smith has said about the nation's
campaign finance laws: "The most sensible reform is a simple
one:

repeal of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA )."
<p>And here is what Mr. Smith's "reform" would accomplish: repeal
of the ban on corporate contributions to presidential and

congressional candidates, repeal of the ban on labor union

contributions to federal candidates, and repeal of the limits on

contributions from individuals and PACs to federal candidates.
<p>Mr. Smith's "reform" would also repeal the system for financing
our presidential elections, the ban on officeholders and candidates

pocketing campaign contributions for their personal use, the ban on

cash contributions of more than $100, and various other provisions

enacted to protect the integrity of our democracy.
<p>Mr. Smith has also stated that the federal campaign finance law,
known as the FECA, is "... profoundly undemocratic and profoundly

at odds with the First Amendment."
<p>Mr. Smith publicly rejects the Supreme Court's corruption
rationale, which has been at the heart of numerous Supreme Court

decisions upholding the constitutionality of campaign finance

contribution limits and prohibitions.
<p>According to Smith, "Money's alleged corrupting effects are far
from proven."
<p>Mr. Smith's view that the FECA, and its contribution limits and
prohibitions, are unconstitutional directly conflicts with the

Supreme Court's position.
<p>Just last month, for example, the Supreme Court reaffirmed in
Nixon v. Shrink Missouri PAC that individual contribution limits

are constitutional.
<p>The Court cited "the prevention of corruption and the appearance
of corruption" as the basis for its decision, the same rationale

that Smith dismisses, and rejected Smith's view that campaign

contributions represent protected free speech.
<p>Justice Souter writing for six of the nine Justices, including
Chief Justice Rehnquist, stated, "Leave the perception of

impropriety unanswered and the cynical assumption that large donors

call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take

part in democratic governance."
<p>Mr. Smith, it goes without saying, is entitled to hold and
express whatever views and philosophy he may have about campaign

finance laws.
<p>It should also go without saying, however, that the American
people are entitled to have law enforcement officials who believe

in the validity and constitutionality of the laws they are

statutorily responsible for enforcing, and who do not view these

laws with total disdain and hostility.
<p>"The Washington Post" noted in a June 6, 1999 editorial that
Smith's premises "are contrary to the founding premises of the

commission on which he would

serve. He simply does not believe in the federal election law."
<p>The New York Times wrote in a July 13, 1999 editorial that
Smith's stated positions "make plain that his agenda as a

commission member would be a further dismantling of reasonable

campaign limits intended to curb the corrupting influence of big

money rather than serious enforcement of current campaign finance

laws."
<p>Mr. Smith is the ultimate symbol of a breakdown in law
enforcement when it comes to the nation's campaign finance laws.

His confirmation to be an FEC Commissioner would be an insult to

the American people.
<p>United States Senators should not allow this to happen.

Wertheimer is the president of Democracy 21.</i>
