<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MANCHESTER, N.H. -- A few days before the high-stakes New Hampshire
presidential vote, Paul Wellstone and I were careening across the first-primary
state on our way to another of the dozens of campaign pep rallies where the
Minnesota senator waved the flag for Bill Bradley's moderately insurgent
Democratic presidential candidacy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No one campaigned harder for Bradley in Iowa and New Hampshire than Wellstone.
No one -- including Bradley -- campaigned more effectively. And no one seemed to
enjoy the political fray more than did Wellstone, who had to ditch his own
presidential hopes because of a bad back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As our Jeep rolled into Manchester, Wellstone and I got to talking about the
big "what if.'' What if his back hadn't been so bad? What if he could have
mounted a serious campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At first, Wellstone was resistant. He didn't want to take the focus off
Bradley, and he certainly didn't want to take the discussion to the logical
conclusion: that, in every sense, he would have been a better challenger to Al
Gore than Bradley has been.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Wellstone's natural exuberance soon took over, and he admitted, "I
wouldn't mind being in some of these debates.''</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What issue would Wellstone have brought to the debates that Bradley and Vice
President Gore have failed to address?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Seattle!'' says the Minnesota senator, employing the city name that has
become a universal shorthand for opposition to corporate-driven "globalization''
of the economy and the "free trade'' agenda of dark economic alchemists who
would have us all eating genetically modified foods produced by multinational
corporations that jump from country to country in order to depress wages, avoid
regulation and otherwise undermine community and civil society.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wellstone understands what Bradley and the other major candidates do not:
that the issues raised during last fall's World Trade Organization sessions in
Seattle matter a lot more than the minutiae that has tended to define Democratic
and Republican presidential debates this year.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In late November and early December, the Seattle gathering of trade ministers
and their minions was disrupted by tens of thousands of trade unionists,
farmers, safe-food activists, environmentalists and others who objected to the
WTO's efforts to eliminate the ability of the United States and other nations to
control corporations. Polls show that close to 60 percent of Americans share the
concerns of the protesters in Seattle about "free trade'' policies designed to
benefit corporations while cutting wages, gutting environmental protections and
forcing farmers off the land.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, none of the major presidential candidates has even mentioned Seattle --
let alone the issues that came into focus there: corporate responsibility,
deindustrialization, the collapse of family farming, food safety, environmental
decay, the ongoing attack on public services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the two months after marches, rallies, teach-ins and riots in Seattle
exposed the depth of America's discomfort with free trade, most of this
country's political "leaders'' have worked to sweep the issues back under the
table. But Wellstone says that is a fool's mission, as the American people are
not going to stop asking tough questions about corporate misbehavior and the
government policies that permit it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A lot of what was captured in Seattle -- the questions about the changing
face of the global economy -- is not going away,'' says Wellstone. "These are
issues that are going to have to be addressed. They can't be avoided forever.''</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eventually, says Wellstone, the coalitions that came together to challenge
the corporate agenda in Seattle will develop into a powerful political movement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A hundred years ago, the challenge was to civilize the national economy.
There were powerful interests working to maintain the status quo -- as there are
today. But a great populist and progressive movement sprang up, and that
movement gave us anti-trust laws and safe food regulations, child labor laws,
the 40-hour work week and so many of the other policies we take for granted
today,'' says Wellstone. "Now what you have is another transformation -- a
transition to a global economy. Now, the demand is to civilize the global
economy. And, just as it was at the start of the last century, that demand is
coming from the people. It is only a matter of time before the political leaders
have to respond.''</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lack of a response this year is frustrating, however. Despite Wellstone's
close alliance with him, Bradley remains firmly ensconced on the wrong side of
the trade debate. He may actually be worse than Gore on the issue. And, of
course, Republican front-runners George W. Bush and John McCain are pathetic
apologists for the economic agenda of the corporate special interests.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So there is no debate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And Wellstone's absence from the platform is severely missed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What of the fall? No coupling of the major-party front-runners would yield a
serious dialogue on these issues -- Gore vs. McCain is no better than McCain vs.
Bradley is no better than Bush vs. Bradley is no better than Gore vs. Bush. So
the two out of three voters who are troubled by the direction of the United
States on global economic issues have little choice but to look to the margins.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Former Republican Pat Buchanan, who is seeking the Reform Party nod, has
developed into an able critic of the free trade agenda, and his criticisms of
corporate greed and irresponsibility are trenchant and well delivered. Yet
Buchanan rates so low in the polls as of now that organizers of this fall's
presidential debates will have little problem keeping him off the stage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumer activist Ralph Nader, who is preparing a run for the presidency on
the Green ticket, offers the U.S. trade agenda and the broader crisis created by
an economy that is regulated only by the corporations that control it. Nader's
long record of activism on consumer and economic issues has given him a genuine
following across the United States. As one of the most broadly respected figures
in the country, he might have the name recognition and the following to force
his way into the debates, but Nader has yet to prove himself as a serious
candidate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All of this leaves us with the reality of presidential politics that are
devoid of serious discussion regarding a seminal issue, and with the very real
prospect that it may remain so through this most critical election year.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oddly enough, the one prominent political figure operating at the national
level who really does seem to be listening to the complaints of the public in
the post-Seattle era is the one person who won't be involved in any fall
presidential campaign debates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">William Jefferson Clinton, the soon-to-be ex-president, has been the most
militantly pro-free trade chief executive in the nation's history. He pushed the
North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement of Trade and
Tariffs through Congress, brought the WTO session to the United States and now
is jetting around the world to attend gatherings of the planet's corporate
overlords.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, unlike the Gore-Bradley-McCain-Bush axis, Clinton is starting to ask
serious questions about whether the process of corporations-can-do-no-wrong
globalization has, perhaps, gone too far.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last month, Clinton
delivered a speech that displayed a startling awareness of the post-Seattle
shift in public sentiment regarding trade and economic issues. "Those who heard
a wake-up call in Seattle got the right message,'' said Clinton. "I do not agree
with those who view with contempt these new forces seeking to be heard in the
global dialogue.''</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clinton said it was wrong for corporate elites and their political pawns to
view trade unions, environmental groups and other activist organizations as
nuisances. Rather, he suggested, the free trade agenda will be truly successful
only when it has addressed concerns about the effect of a changing global
economy on worker rights, environmental protections and consumer safety.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Don't get Clinton wrong; he's still wrong on most trade and economic issues.
But at least he recognizes that, in a democracy, voices of broad-based dissent
deserve not just a hearing but a response that seeks to incorporate their
legitimate concerns into national policy-making.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clinton is a perfectly imperfect player. But at least on issues of trade and
economics he understands that U.S. policy is out of touch with U.S. public
sentiment, which is more than can be said for Bradley, Gore, McCain and Bush.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the 2000 presidential campaign proceeds, it is possible that Clinton will
push his candidate, Gore, to adopt more reasonable positions, just as Wellstone
may get his candidate, Bradley, to hear the wake-up call from Seattle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until that happens, however, the most important issue of the 2000
presidential campaign will be debated by everyone <i>but </i>the major
candidates for president.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That's not just an undemocratic circumstance, it's an unreasonable
circumstance. And until it is rectified -- until trade and economic issues are
at the center of the debate -- the 2000 presidential campaign will serve as
nothing so much as a reminder of how very badly warped our political system has
become.</font></p>
