This weekend, Hilary Rodham Clinton became the first First Lady to ever run for office, setting her sights on a U.S. Senate seat out of New York. Right now NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani is nine points ahead of
HRC in the polls, but many New Yorkers aren't terribly enthusiastic about either choice. Our
Mayor’s prickly personality just won’t translate to
the backroom dealmaking of the Senate. Hilary’s flaw
is far more obvious. “It Takes a Village” Clinton is
no New Yorker—for one, she’s barely broken in her
Yankees cap. But this carpetbagger may be just what
New York needs. 
<br>
<br>

When it comes to dealing with poor New Yorkers,
homeless New Yorkers, black and Latino and immigrant
New Yorkers, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani may just qualify
as the Meanest Man in New York. His constant bullying
of those less powerful than he ought to disqualify him
from higher office.
<br>
<br>


Mayor Giuliani has a consistent policy on issues like
homelessness: do everything possible to avoid solving
the underlying problem. "Streets do not exist in
civilized societies for the purpose of people sleeping
there," the Mayor said recently. "Bedrooms are for
sleeping." Yet, in a city where the average one
bedroom apartment costs over a thousand dollars per
month, the mayor has cut the housing budget for
homeless New Yorkers by 74 percent—despite a city
budget surplus. Mayor Mean has suggested housing the
homeless in empty public hospital beds (which could
compromise the health of patients), and, most
recently, taking children away from homeless parents
who refuse to work.
<br>
<br>


Even more shortsighted than the homelessness policies
are the Giuliani administration’s positions on
workfare. I reported on a case in 1996 where the
administration was trying to get a 19 year-old boy to
drop out of high school in order to do workfare. He
had stayed home from school one year to take care of
his dying grandmother, the woman who raised him on
public assistance. (No, this was not a mistake. When a
judge ruled resoundingly against the Giuliani
administration, the administration appealed!)
<br>
<br>


Giuliani prides himself on inspiring law and order,
though the decline in New York’s crime began before he
took office. But when police officers commit a crime,
the Mayor turns a blind eye.  With every controversial
police force case--from the sodomy of Haitian
immigrant Abner Louima to the 42 shots fired at the
unarmed, now deceased Guinean immigrant Amadou Diallo,
to the killing of Gary Busch, a mentally ill man in an
Orthodox Jewish neighborhood--Mayor Giuliani has
rushed to defend the police first, without urging that
the department get to the bottom of the cases. Yet he
had little to say when one of New York’s finest
confessed to the brutal attack on Louima.<br>
<br>



Finally, Mayor Mean sure can hold a grudge. He refused
to meet with the city’s top black elected official,
Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields, for 11
months—until the Diallo shooting made a reconciliation
politically expedient.  <br>
<br>



Has Mayor Giuliani done good for New York? Yes, for
some New Yorkers, especially wealthy ones. Those who
did not, in large part, vote for him—the poor, and
blacks and Latinos—he has ignored, even punished. The
true test of a politician is not whether he can govern
those who put him in power. It’s whether he can serve
everyone in his community, even those with whom he has
differences. Mayor Giuliani has failed that test in
New York City. Why give him a chance to fail in the
U.S. Senate, on behalf of the state?
