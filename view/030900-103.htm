        tons of tear gas and pepper spray munitions Seattle police used on demonstrators 
        and bystanders alike at the anti-WTO demonstrations last December contained 
        chemicals implicated in lung problems, eye damage and even death. Contrary 
        to conventional wisdom, the effects of these chemical weapons are not 
        always confined to 15 or so minutes of intense pain and incapacitation. 
        According to manufacturers' documents, military research and medical literature, 
        each of these agents carries short- and long-term health risks; various 
        formulations contain potential carcinogens. 
      
<P>Tear gas and pepper spray cause health problems even when used within 
        guidelines on healthy people. But in Seattle, as elsewhere, law enforcement 
        violated manufacturers' warnings and inevitably sprayed vulnerable populations 
        such as people with diabetes, asthma, allergies or heart problems, as 
        well as pregnant women, children and the elderly. "It was like a war zone," 
        says Russell Sparks, a student from Bellingham, Washington, who helped 
        block a Seattle intersection on December 1. "The police rolled up in humvees, 
        and I heard the clink, clink of cops jogging toward us. Within seconds 
        the area was filled with gas and the air was pure white all around. I 
        coughed and coughed. I felt like I was on fire, my friend and I both became 
        hysterical. He fell down. A middle-aged man near me passed out, eyes open, 
        shaking, dry heaving, twitching in the shoulders. A woman passed out face 
        down. I tried to help but my eyes were burning and I was screaming for 
        medical help." 
      
<P>Three days later, Sparks still felt "serious flu symptoms, phlegmy, tired, 
        fatigued, problems with eyes focusing, burning, slightly nauseous. I felt 
        like it went into every pore." He wasn't alone. The persistence and severity 
        of symptoms widely reported by demonstrators and hapless bystanders gave 
        rise to speculation that some "mystery gas" had been used. Rumors of nerve 
        gas spread like a toxic cloud across the Internet. 
      
<P>The truth is that tear gas and pepper spray alone can cause temporary 
        blindness, respiratory problems, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue and disorientation. 
        Symptoms may linger for days in otherwise healthy individuals. Out of 
        187 North Carolina corrections officers exposed to pepper spray under 
        controlled conditions for training purposes, according to Duke University 
        Medical Center study, eight had symptoms persisting for more than a week, 
        including eye problems, chest problems, headaches and disorientation. 
      
<P>More seriously, reports by the Army and in prestigious medical journals 
        have warned of respiratory arrest, pulmonary edema, and acute elevations 
        in blood pressure associated with risk of stroke and heart attack. Military 
        and industrial sources also point to the possibility of cancer, birth 
        defects and DNA damage from these chemical weapons. 
      
<P><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">W</font></b>hile 
        tear gas and pepper spray are banned from use in war by an international 
        treaty, domestic use is legal and nearly ubiquitous in the United States. 
        The advantages of these "non-lethal" technologies, police say, include 
        fewer deaths and serious injuries to officers and suspects, a more benign 
        image for departments and less litigation. Currently, more than 90 percent 
        of the country's police departments issue pepper spray to their officers, 
        according to the Justice Department, and many departments store tear gas 
        for use in crowd control or riot situations. 
      
<P>Despite widespread use, none of the agents sold for police purposes is 
        monitored, tested or regulated by any government agency for consistency, 
        purity, toxicity or even efficacy. Dr. Howard Hu, a Harvard University 
        epidemiologist, says that the extent of ill effects from these chemicals 
        is unknowable since there have been no rigorous, independent follow-up 
        studies on exposed populations. Little has changed since 1989, when Hu 
        wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association, "There is an 
        ongoing need for investigation into the full toxicological potential of 
        tear gas chemicals and renewed debate on whether their use can be condoned 
        under any circumstances." 
      
<P>Because they are treated as weapons, police-grade products "fall between 
        regulatory cracks," says Raymond Downs, program manager in science and 
        technology at the National Institute for Justice. "Police are at the mercy 
        of manufacturers," Downs adds, in that they have to rely solely on makers' 
        claims for the safety of the chemical weapons themselves and for the wide 
        variety of solvents and propellants routinely added to turn the active 
        ingredients into aerosols. 
      
<P>Those claims may not be all that reliable. In a 1995 report, the Army 
        warned that "manufacturer literature ... is often misleading, incomplete 
        or inaccurate," and in some cases "manufacturers refuse to disclose the 
        components of [their] products." Indeed, Def-Tec, one of the country's 
        largest suppliers, declines to release information on concentration of 
        pepper and tearing chemicals in its dozen products deployed in Seattle. 
        It also won't disclose which solvents or propellants were incorporated, 
        except to refer to three generic product-safety data sheets that the Seattle 
        police are required by law to release. 
      
<P>When it comes to health aspects of any of the chemical weapons, used 
        either singly or in combination, Downs notes, "there is almost no independent 
        research going on." "They all spin the data," adds one federal official. 
        "One manufacturer will say the other's is toxic, but mine is just fine." 
      
<P>Zarc International, which makes only pepper spray products, charges in 
        its literature that the tear gases its competitors make promote cancer 
        and cause allergic reaction and eye injuries. Def-Tec, a division of Armor 
        Holdings, which manufactures both pepper spray and tear gas, denies any 
        safety problems. "We know of tens of thousands of times that these have 
        been deployed without any incident," says Dave Dubay, director of research 
        for the Casper, Wyoming-based company. 
      
<P>It is not just manufacturers' data that have been called into question, 
        but also the federal government's. After the FBI endorsed pepper spray 
        in 1987 as an "official chemical agent," it was added to the arsenals 
        of most police agencies and largely replaced tear gas. At the FBI, the 
        Johnny Appleseed of pepper spray was special agent Thomas Ward, director 
        of the Quantico Firearms Training Unit and the bureau's chief expert on 
        pepper spray. Ward, who supervised, approved and guaranteed the chemical 
        weapon's quality and safety for the FBI, also wrote the main bureau study 
        cited by law enforcement agencies to defend its use. He promoted pepper 
        spray in a widely disseminated official FBI training infomercial. Then, 
        in February 1996, Ward pled guilty to a felony for accepting a $57,500 
        kickback from Luckey Police Products, the country's second largest manufacturer 
        of pepper spray, whose weapons Ward had touted as an FBI trainer as far 
        back as the mid-'80s. 
      
<P><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">W</font></b>hile 
        police rely on manufacturers for safety assurances, the public relies 
        on police to define when use of chemicals weapons is a safe, appropriate 
        response. The International Association of Chiefs of Police issues "use 
        of force" recommendations for various weapons, but individual departments 
        around the country set their own guidelines and enforce them with varying 
        degrees of rigor. 
      
<P>Seattle police, for example, are authorized to use chemical weapons against 
        people engaged in peaceful civil disobedience. Boston police can only 
        use pepper spray in self-defense against a violent physical assault or 
        when an officer trying to make an arrest is in danger of being injured 
        or losing custody of the suspect. In the case of passive resistance, says 
        Gary Eblan, defensive tactics instructor at the Boston Police Academy, 
        "We would have four officers lift and take the subject to a holding area 
        or wagon." Washington, D.C. may face crowd control situations similar 
        to those in Seattle when demonstrators descend on the nation's capital 
        in April for meetings of the IMF and World Bank. The Metropolitan Police 
        Department is training 1,400 officers for crowd control and stocking up 
        on chemical weapons and rubber bullets. Planning is underway to coordinate 
        response with several federal agencies, including the FBI, U.S. Park Police, 
        U.S. Capitol Police, Secret Service, U.S. Marshals and Federal Emergency 
        Management Agency. The Metro Police Department refused to release its 
        written guidelines for "use of force." 
      
<P>Police guidelines and manufacturers' standards inevitably vanish in thick 
        air under real life conditions. When deploying chemical weapons on crowds, 
        police have no practical way to monitor those sprayed, to screen out people 
        with risk factors, or to avoid bystanders. Nor can they quickly decontaminate 
        those affected. "Responsible police have a saying: 'When you spray them, 
        you own them,' " Downs says. "There is a requirement for aftercare. You 
        need to make sure if they need medical attention, they get it. In the 
        military, if a few limp away, we may not care. In the civilian world, 
        aftercare is essential." 
      
<P>Manufacturers also warn against deploying chemical weapons in closed 
        spaces--a warning notoriously violated, with fatal consequences, by U.S. 
        law enforcement in the Waco, Texas siege of the Branch Davidians. The 
        American Civil Liberties Union and other groups have documented numerous 
        instances in which pepper spray was used by police as a form of "street 
        justice" to mete out pain and punish unruly or uppity suspects after they 
        already had been subdued. U.S. prison guards routinely use chemical weapons 
        to perform "cell extractions." 
      
<P>Excessive exposure--both accidental and intentional-- is another problem. 
        An internal report by Def-Tec cautions that more than a single, one-second 
        burst of pepper spray "obviously would be an overexposure, which may cause 
        added health risks." And manufacturers recommend that police hold the 
        spray at least several feet from a subject's face to avoid eye damage. 
      
<P>Yet videotape clearly shows instances in Seattle in which police held 
        aerosol cans within inches of the faces of seated protesters and sprayed 
        them repeatedly or in long bursts. "My impression was that most Seattle 
        police officers handled themselves with some restraint, but some didn't," 
        says Larry Gossett, a member of the King County Council. "We got too many 
        reports from people handled in a brutal way for all of them to be false." 
      
<P>An additional risk in situations such as Seattle--where police admitted 
        spraying crowds with multiple chemicals--is that "there has been no research 
        on the synergistic effects," Downs says. Maryland-based Zarc International 
        charges that "mixing [pepper spray] and other chemical agents such as 
        [tear gas] ... can prove to be harmful or even fatal in real-life situations." 
        The probability of adverse side effects is only exacerbated by the addition 
        of solvents and propellants--some of which are themselves toxic or carcinogenic--to 
        the active ingredients to turn them into effective aerosol weapons. 
      
<P>Despite the dangers and drawbacks of tear gas and pepper spray, most 
        critics are careful to differentiate between one-on-one use by a disciplined, 
        trained officer who is physically threatened and wide dispersal on large 
        and varied crowd of generally peaceful protesters. When judiciously used, 
        chemical agents can immediately incapacitate a belligerent suspect with 
        far less risk of permanent or serious damage than a bullet or a baton 
        blow. "If an officer is faced with a situation in which his life is at 
        stake, it makes sense to respond in a way that will leave both people 
        alive," says Lew Pepper, a physician at the Boston University School of 
        Public Health. "But there is no justification for use of toxic and potentially 
        cancer-causing agents for crowd control for civil disobedience. There 
        are better ways to deal with political speech." 
      
<P>There are also better ways to serve and protect the public than to deploy 
        inadequately tested, unregulated chemical weapons. Unless there is independent 
        research establishing that these weapons are reasonably safe, and until 
        there is credible oversight of police practices and manufacturers' claims, 
        the public has no way to assess how much risk it is accepting in the name 
        of law and order. n Terry J. Allen can be reached at tallen@igc.org. Support
