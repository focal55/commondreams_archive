AMERICA, these days, seems more interested in who will win a million 
dollars on ``Survivor'' than who will be our country's next 
president.
<P>  One of them is clearly more entertaining television -- who wants 
to watch the vice president's dull daughter talk about her dull dad? 
</P>
<P>--but they're really the same show. There's not much difference 
between Rich's alliance and the political system, even down to the 
apathetic voter who doesn't care enough to do what is sensible.	 
</P>
<P>  On TV's ratings-monster island, things got nasty a few weeks ago. 
With the truly lazy and annoying people already gone, it was time for 
the primaries. Just as in April, the best people for the job came in 
second. As the Republicans dismissed John McCain, the Rich party said 
goodbye to Gretchen -- an early favorite to win, a hard worker, a 
genuinely good person, and even a military veteran. She found it 
incredible that she was voted out so early. But any popularity 
contest can be turned around, if the other side fights dirty enough.	 
</P>
<P>  The next week the Rich party played Democrat and got rid of Greg 
</P>
<P>--also nice, hard-working and very smart in an unassuming (Bill 
Bradley) kind of way.	 
</P>
<P>  This is where we viewers were hoping someone could stop the evil 
before it was too late. The problem was Sean.	 
</P>
<P>In real life, I'm guessing he's not a registered voter. On the island, 
he didn't want to decide whom he likes and dislikes, so he voted 
alphabetically. Not only did he insist on adhering to this ridiculous 
system, he let it be known one week that his next victim would be 
Jenna.	 
</P>
<P>  Jenna is the Ralph Nader of this story. She's everything that's 
good and pure. She 
did her share of the work without complaint. She loves her kids. She 
tried to organize an alternative party to stop the Riches. Amazingly, 
her upstart little party looked like it had a shot. Kelly, a young 
woman who had been voting with Rich, realized maybe she'd been allied 
with the wrong group and decided to follow her 
heart instead of the party line.	 
</P>
<P>  But the plan unraveled because Sean was too stupid to realize how 
important his vote was. The Rich alliance knew his vote plus their 
four would be enough, so they voted off Jenna.	 
</P>
<P>  Then the main political party proceeded to get rid of all the nice 
little people who 
weren't on their side. Kind of like the politics in America.	 
While the island of ``Survivor'' has only one party and America has 
two major ones, it all boils down to the same thing.	 
</P>
<P>In my home state of Minnesota in 1998, when the incumbent Republican 
governor decided not to run, the Democrats put up the grandson of a 
famous politician (Hubert H. Humphrey III) while the Republicans 
offered the mayor of St. Paul (Norm Coleman). The voters, tired of 
bickering partisan politics-as-usual, surprised the world by electing 
Jesse Ventura of the Reform Party. Say what you will about the 
feather boas from his pro-wrestling days, he's getting it done as 
governor.	 
</P>
<P>  In a rational world, where people think about their vote instead 
of blindly following their party leaders, Al Gore and George W. Bush 
would have less of a chance in the upcoming presidential election 
than Humphrey and Coleman did in Minnesota. Of course, in a rational 
world, Ralph Nader would be eligible for federal campaign funding and 
allowed to participate in the presidential debates.	 
</P>
<P>Vote with your heart, and your brain. And let's all be glad that in 
this election, the Seans who don't care won't be there to screw it up 
for everyone.	 
</P>
<P>  On tonight's finale, millions of Americans will watch to see 
whether it will be Kelly, Sue, Rudy or Rich (no one ended up in the 
final four except the members of the alliance) who wins the grand 
prize. But in the bigger election -- can't we stop the Riches?
