              -- In October 1984, as a young reporter just four months into my 
              first job writing for a big-city newspaper, I was dispatched to 
              Kansas City to cover the second presidential debate between Republican 
              Ronald Reagan and Democrat Walter Mondale.
            </font>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              debate, it was said, would be a high-stakes affair. Former Vice 
              President Mondale was broadly viewed as having won the first debate 
              with a sharp, issue-oriented challenge to the seemingly less prepared 
              and certainly less sharp Reagan, a man in his mid-70s who was clearly 
              showing his age. Indeed, the sitting president's performance had 
              been so inept that it is now referenced as a possible first public 
              manifestation of his Alzheimer's disease.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              story of how the media saved Reagan with its coverage of that second 
              1984 debate points up everything that is wrong with how these campaign 
              face-offs are staged and reported. It also offers a cautionary warning 
              to viewers of tonight's much-hyped encounter between Democrat Al 
              Gore and Republican George W. Bush.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              Gore-Bush debate comes at a moment that is, if anything, even more 
              critical than that second 1984 debate. Polls show that this year's 
              candidates are evenly matched in their popular appeal -- and those 
              numbers are just the latest measure of a constantly shifting contest 
              where support for both contenders is so soft that minor missteps 
              can have big meaning.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
              the question of how the media will measure those missteps is even 
              more up in the air than the question of who will win in November. 
              And the Orwellian lessons from the 1984 Mondale-Reagan debate are 
              not encouraging.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sitting 
              in the audience in Kansas City that night, I watched as Ronald Reagan 
              lost it. In a rambling closing statement, the incumbent president 
              went down the Pacific Coast Highway and never came back. It appeared 
              that Reagan was attempting to expand on the &quot;morning in America'' 
              theme of his campaign's television commercials. But what the audience 
              heard was a unfocused, seemingly unending rumination on California 
              cruising that went, precisely, nowhere.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, 
              mercifully, moderator Edwin Newman interrupted Reagan, explaining 
              to the leader of the free world that, while he had made no point 
              whatsoever, he had run well beyond his allotted time. And on the 
              basis of one of the strangest and most disconcerting performances 
              ever in a presidential debate, it seemed that Reagan's time was, 
              indeed, up.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Until 
              the media started &quot;spinning'' the story.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 
              the time the television talk shows got done with the &quot;instant 
              analysis'' and the morning papers rolled off their presses, a truly 
              tragic presidential performance had been transformed into a triumphal 
              &quot;knockout punch'' because Reagan had thrown off a line about 
              not wanting to exploit Mondale's youth and inexperience. Scripted 
              to address rising concerns about his age and mental agility, the 
              quip was delivered perfunctorily by a man who had spent most of 
              his adult life in Hollywood.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
              how could a throwaway line erase the reality of a dismal debate 
              performance?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because, 
              for all the hype, debates are usually reduced to a couple of sound 
              bites that are repeated again and again in the post-debate coverage 
              that ends up defining winners and losers. Television could reproduce 
              the &quot;youth and inexperience'' clip a lot more easily and a 
              lot less controversially than it could the more revealing closing-statement 
              mishap.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So 
              that's what television did. And the rest was history -- or, rather, 
              historical revision.</font></P>
<P align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Reagan 
              lost the second debate in 1984 badly. But the media reports made 
              him a &quot;winner'' -- and that &quot;win'' virtually guaranteed 
              his re-election.So, as viewers watch tonight's debate, they would 
              be well advised to dismiss the spin and believe their own eyes. 
              Because, as that final 1984 debate proved, reality often gets washed 
              away in a media spin cycle that opts for the quick and inoffensive 
              one-liner over the complex and disturbing reality.
