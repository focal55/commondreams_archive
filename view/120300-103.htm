RALPH NADER'S NAME has mercifully dropped from the  headlines. Democrats are so enraged at George W. Bush's  attempt to run the clock on a recount that Bush, rather than  Nader, has become the object of Democrats' wrath.
<P>
<P>It's probably premature, but I'd like to be the first to  propose an amnesty for Ralph.
<P>
<P>By way of disclaimer, I voted for Gore. Like many other  liberals, I did so with little enthusiasm. That wasn't Nader's fault,  it was Gore's.
<P>
<P>I also thought Nader's campaign was misconceived, and  in the end mischievous. As ill feeling rose between Nader and  the Democrats, it became clear that many Greens and perhaps  Nader himself hoped that Bush would defeat Gore.
<P>
<P>Nader deliberately chose to campaign in the tightest  battleground states. In the end, Gore squeaked through in all of  them, thanks largely to the loyalty of the labor movement. If  indeed Gore lost the election, he lost it Tennessee and Florida,  both states where Nader did not campaign actively and where  labor is relatively weak.
<P>
<P>The Nader campaign promoted the idea that liberal  Democrats in safe Gore states should help the Greens qualify for  federal funding in 2004. But why should practical liberals want  more such mischief four years hence - more electoral votes,  House and Senate seats tipped to the Republicans?
<P>
<P>In our system with winner-take-all elections, third parties  have a nearly impossible time gaining a foothold. In Germany, by  contrast, the Greens have matured into a constructive political  force. But in the German parliamentary system, five percent of  the total vote gets you seats in the national legislature. In ours,  Greens mainly split the liberal vote.
<P>
<P>Further, the promise that Nader would draw new  people into politics was not realized. Overall turnout remained  near an all time low. It was African-American turnout that rose.
<P>
<P>Having established my bona fides as someone who  thought Nader's campaign ill conceived, I still think nothing will  be gained by ostracizing him.
<P>
<P>For one thing, Nader raises issues that ought to be  mainstream issues, which most Democratic politicians including  Al Gore ignore. Don't we need universal health insurance?    Universal day care for kids? A more progressive tax system? A  serious assault on global warming? A strategy for getting big  money out of politics? A true commitment that everyone who  works should earn a living wage?
<P>
<P>A Democrat who ran, with passion, on such a platform  could bring public opinion along with him (or her.) But Al Gore  didn't. If Democrats fail to keep these causes alive, and instead  keep cultivating the people with the big bucks, they are  practically begging for third party candidates.
<P>
<P>Secondly, Nader and his affiliates have done  extraordinary work on behalf of the public interest for nearly 40 years. To take just one example, the latest major drug  recall - the third this year - was stimulated by Public Citizens'  Health Research Group. Hundreds of thousands of people  didn't die in auto accidents, thanks to Nader.
<P>
<P>Nobody in public life has done a better job of explaining  why, in a vibrant capitalist economy, there still need to be  constraints on the power of corporations. Nobody has been a  better advocate of engaged citizenship. No one has better  illuminated the dark side of globalism.
<P>
<P>Nader, for his part, has been shocked, perhaps naively,  at the vehemence of the liberal rage. Some of his people are  reciprocating by insisting there is little meaningful difference  between the Republican right and progressive Democrats.
<P>
<P>Nader told me that, after more than three decades, he  just got fed up with establishment politicians, many of them  Democrats, blocking progress on reform after reform, as politics  in this country has become more corporate. Maybe he  exaggerates, but you can understand his frustration.
<P>
<P>I hope he doesn't run for president again, at least not as  a Green. But I value Nader as a force for good.
<P>
<P>Now, if he had run as a Democrat, that would have  been something. Nader would not have been denied debate  coverage; he and Gore could have gone head to head on crucial  public issues that never got a proper airing; and an energized  Gore would likely have beaten Bush cleanly with no third-party  spoiler.   However, Nader chose a different course. Now he is  living with the consequences.
<P>
<P>But it would be unfortunate, even tragic, if Nader ended  his long and constructive career by being written off as a pariah  or, worse, a crank. Lord knows, if George W. Bush does take  office, he and the liberals will need each other.
