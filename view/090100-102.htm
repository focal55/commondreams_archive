The most powerful man in the world on Wednesday spent 11 hours in Cartagena, the nicest and safest of Colombia's cities, and then left, afraid to sleep there. Despite the fact that President Clinton was protected by thousands of security agents, troops and police officers plus six military helicopters patrolling the skies over his head, his advisers felt that the risk was simply too high to stay in Colombia overnight.
<P>
<P>Thirty-eight million Colombians, meanwhile, spend night after night in uncertainty and dread with no one to protect them. Colombia has a murder rate 10 times higher than that of the United States; one Colombian is murdered every 20 minutes. In the rural zones, left-wing guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries prey on peasants, committing nightly massacres - sometimes of whole villages - in an effort to eradicate their enemies and show their power. Last year, according to Colombian authorities, 399 such massacres took place. Almost 2 million Colombians have run away from their homes to avoid the violence, becoming refugees in their own country.
<P>
<P>Colombians in the cities don't have it much better. Random bombings, delinquent gangs, and kidnappings for ransom - 3,000 of them last year - keep Colombians living in fear.
<P>
<P>This is reality for Colombians, and despite Clinton's insistence that the United States' $1.3 billion aid package for Colombia does not further a military objective, calling it a ''package in favor of peace'' does not make  it so.
<P>
<P>The US aid package includes 60 Black Hawk and Huey combat helicopters and US military advisers to train and outfit Colombian antidrug brigades to eradicate coca crops in two southern provinces that are largely controlled  by Colombia's largest guerrilla group. That inevitably will intensify Colombia's civil war. The Army Revolutionary Forces of Colombia, or FARC, announced through a spokesman that the FARC is prepared to fight any encroachment into the territory it holds. Clinton last week waived several human rights conditions put on the aid program by Congress, declaring  Colombia a national security priority.
<P>
<P>Clearly the sides are gearing up for more war, not peace. And desperate  Colombians seem to expect that the greatest conflict will be between  Colombian guerrillas and US troops. A poll conducted in July for Colombian television broadcaster Canal Caracol asked: Who do you believe has more  power right now in Colombia? 
<P>
<P>FARC leader Manuel Marulanda, known as ''Tirofijo'' or ''Sureshot,'' came in first with 46 percent. The United States was second with 31 percent, and only 10 percent picked Colombia's president,  Andres Pastrana. Another poll, by the Gallup Organization, indicated that 56 percent of Colombians would support direct military intervention by the United States to stop the bloodshed. Of course, Colombians believe a lot of the bloodshed is the fault of the US demand for cocaine, which the Colombian defense minister estimated at 300 tons per year.
<P>
<P>Clinton's message to Colombians during his visit - ''Please do not  misunderstand our purpose; we have no military objective. There won't be American involvement in a shooting war'' - flies in the face of common sense. Can any informed person really believe this?
<P>
<P>Why does Clinton not call a thing by its name? Though $238 million of the aid package will go for programs to support drug crop substitution, judicial reform and human rights in Colombia, 80 percent, or more than a billion dollars, will be devoted to funding the Colombian military. A popular Colombian expression seems to apply: ''Aunque el mono se vista de seda mono  se queda'' - ''Even if the monkey decides to wear a silk outfit, it still  would be a monkey.''
<P>
<P>Pastrana, meanwhile, is playing his own word games. He repeats that while he is president there will not be foreign military intervention in Colombia. But that depends on how you define the word ''intervention.''
<P>
<P>There are already 100 US military advisers training Colombian soldiers, and according to the Miami Herald, the Pentagon will send US Army General Keith Huber to oversee deployment of part of the $1.3  billion package, making him the only US general posted in South or Central America.
<P>
<P>It is important that the United States shows interest in Colombia. But it is also important that US and Colombian leaders tell people what is really happening and not just what they want to  hear. The most straightforward answer as to what the future holds seems to come from the commander of the Colombian armed forces, General Fernando Tapias, who said:  ''There will be peace. But first there will be war.''
