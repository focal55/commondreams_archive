Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: It is the Nicaraguan 
presidential election of 1990. On one side are the incumbent Sandinistas, 
on the other side their opposition, which is supported materially by the 
United States.

<p>The Sandinistas lose the popular vote by 4,000 votes, but, due to an arcane 
electoral system, they win the election by a total of 41 votes in one of 
the provinces. This in a nation of three million. But there are numerous 
irregularities, as faulty equipment and ballots and questionable practices 
mean that thousands of votes -- disproportionately from the stridently 
anti-Sandinista districts -- are not included in the tally.  The governor 
of the province where many irregularities occur is Sandinista candidate 
Daniel Ortega's brother. The official specifically in charge of seeing that 
it is a fair vote is the campaign manager for the Ortega's campaign in her 
province, and a die-hard party activist.

<p>Immediately after the election, the Sandinistas demand that the opposition 
concede for the good of the nation. The media chime in,  noting that the 
people are "tired" of the election "dragging out," and want it resolved 
immediately. The Sandinistas resist any and all efforts to count the 
missing votes -- even sending in a goon squad to break up one effort at 
doing a hand recount -- except for their insistence that irregularities in 
the counting of the absentee ballots of Sandinista soldiers and diehard 
Sandinista party supporters be ignored. Otherwise, the vote should remain 
exactly as it is. They point out that the Nicaraguan constitution has a 
firm deadline for resolving elections. After stalling for a month the 
deadline rapidly approaches. A regional court rules that the uncounted 
votes must be included in the election results.

<p>At this point, the matter finally ends up in the Nicaraguan Supreme Court 
where seven of the nine judges were appointed by the Sandinistas. Three of 
the justices are closely linked to the most militant wing of the Sandinista 
movement, and have spouses or children gainfully employed by those 
connected to the extreme wing of the Sandinista movement. In a 5-4 vote, 
the opposition's efforts to have the uncounted votes included is rejected, 
although two Sandinista appointed judges dissent, noting that this was 
nothing short of a refutation of political democracy.

<p>The Sandinistas assume power for another six year term. The news media harp 
on the need for the nation to put aside partisan bickering and unite behind 
Ortega. "The system works," is a common refrain.

<p>Imagine, again, what the response to this would have been by U.S. 
politicians and the U.S. news media to all of this. As one who lived 
through this era I can state without qualification it would have been as 
follows: The news media and all politicians would have deplored the 
Sandinista coup d'etat in the strongest language imaginable. Then Secretary 
of State James Baker and then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney would have 
pounded their  fists on the table and howled their indignation at this 
assault of core democratic values. Any effort to defend the Sandinistas on 
technical legal grounds would have been dismissed as an outrageous apologia 
for tyranny. "The bottom line is whoever gets the most votes should win," 
Chris Matthews, Jeff Greenfield, Brian Williams, Tim Russert and Bill 
O'Reilly would have bellowed, "and the Sandinistas couldn't win a fair 
election so they rigged it." The U.S. military would have invaded Nicaragua 
and installed the opposition party in power.

<p>The most vociferous champions of invading Nicaragua in the name of free and 
fair elections would have been exactly those right-wing Republicans who 
have championed the George W. Bush cause over the past six weeks. Yet the 
facts in Florida are almost exactly those I posit for Nicaragua, with the 
actual conduct of the Republicans mirroring the hypothetical conduct of the 
democracy-killing Sandinistas. Yet in the United States, anti-democratic 
Republican behavior has generated not an iota of criticism from any 
Republicans, except for two notable dissenters on the Supreme Court. The 
Republicans' lack of principle, their cowardice and corruption, their 
contempt for democracy, lie naked before the eye, draped only in layers of 
propaganda, lies, and half-truths that might impress Josef Goebbels.

<p>The media punditocracy and the political establishment are now in 
overdrive, telling us we need to come together and accept George W. Bush as 
our president.``The wounds that have come from the passions of partisanship 
must begin to heal for the good of the country,'' Speaker of the House 
Dennis Hastert said in a statement that set the tone for other Republicans.

<p>Not so fast, Mr. Hastert. That is the prescription for scoundrels and 
opportunists, or for a slave population, but not for a free people.

<p>The job for those of us who cherish free and fair elections, who value 
democracy, is to remind the morally challenged George W. Bush that he is 
not a legitimate president of the United States. A true leader for a free 
people would demand that all the votes be counted before accepting power. 
Bush and his cronies have stolen the election. We need to make every day of 
his presidency a living hell, so that no individual or political party will 
ever dare do this again. A living hell!

<p>It is what Tom Paine and Patrick Henry would have done. It is what Abe 
Lincoln and Frederick Douglass would have done. It is what we must do with 
every fiber of our beings. It is the only option for those who believe in 
the American experiment in democracy.
