A publicity-conscious American scientific corporation announces that a cow it owns will shortly give birth to a cloned Indian bison whose existence in southern Asia is threatened. A lot of breathless guff is talked about saving species; scientists and commentators who should know better are encouraged to say this is a good thing and the public is lulled into believing a technological fix can stop the decline of species across the world. 
<P>That scientists may be able to recreate "lost" life is interesting but quite irrelevant to the real problems facing the conservation of animal life. More sober scientists agree that nature is even now in freefall. We are witnessing the approach of what could be the greatest global extinction of biodiversity - the full variety of nature - since the end of the dinosaurs 200m years ago.  
<P>There are, it is thought, somewhere between 7m and 70m species, of which only 1.7m have been named. No one has a clue what we have lost in the past 50 years, but at a conservative guess the rate of extinction is 100 to 1,000 times what is normal.  
<P>Mankind's present destruction of generic and species diversity is known as the "sixth great extinction" and is, say leading scientists like EO Wilson, a process as damaging as any full-scale thermo-nuclear war, one that will take at least 10myears to correct.  
<P>Against this background, the idea that mankind, having destroyed so much, can put nature back together is insulting and politically naive, and conservation groups like the World Wide Fund For Nature were yesterday damning about the announcement from Advanced Cell Technology. At best, they say, the idea of bringing back extinct species is a simplistic publicity stunt for the creation of an unreal, short-term designer-nature fit only for museums.  
<P>When an animal or species becomes endangered or extinct, it is usually the end of a very long line of reversals in its fortunes; these may include being overhunted, genetic disorders, or because the environment to which it has adapted to live over very many centuries has been destroyed or so degraded that it cannot support a population.  
<P>To bring back an animal and see it prosper, therefore, means not only finding a habitat in which it can live, but one where all the other plants and species on which it depends can survive, too. For most "extinct" animals, which were often at the top of their particular food chains, this is now impossible. Whole   forests, coral reefs, and most of the the great centres of biodiversity are all being degraded and destroyed. What is left is increasingly small fragments, or islands of protected life that are being inexorably eroded and are in themselves unsustainable.  
<P>Cloning an extinct animal is a cul-de-sac in the complex world of nature conservation. The only way a cloned species could survive in the wild, even with the continual help of man, would be to have a broad genetic pool to allow them to adapt to extremes and changes.  
<P>Small populations of anything are vulnerable. One freak disease or weather event can wipe out a population. The genetic blueprint of just one or two animals is not enough to develop a sustainable population. Dozens, if not hundreds of cloned animals, would be needed - in most cases an impossibility.  
<P>But even if an undisturbed habitat were found, and a broad and diverse genetic pool were available, any cloned animal would need the approval of people to survive. As all conservation groups have found, this can be hard. Any animal with a commercial value - and every single one which a corporation could imagine bringing back most certainly would be valuable - is liable to be hunted. A "new" animal, which would have cost millions of pounds to create, would be little more than a zoological freak.  
<P>The only way to protect animals, it is now broadly agreed, is to tackle the root causes of decline and extinction. This means protecting habitats, addressing the threats that have caused extinction in the first place, and educating people who live close to wildlife - and lifting them out of the poverty that puts them in competition with the animals for the resources to live. It also means addressing genetic resources, whole ecosystems, and understanding that the conservation of plants and animals is an integral part of the whole development process.  
<P>Avoiding the further free fall of nature is possible, but it needs money and global and national agreements. The Convention on Biological Diversity, to which most governmnents signed up after the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, is struggling. As ever, the sticking points are with rich countries refusing to share the financial or technological resources that would enable the poor countries to put into effect their plans for conservation.
