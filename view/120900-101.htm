One hundred years from now, what will historians say about the consequences of the 

Presidential election of 2000?   I hope the following:
     
<p>In the year 2000, even before a winner of the presidential contest was finally named, 

representatives of the media along with partisan Democrats and Republicans announced 

their intentions to hand count every Florida vote.  Party hacks and media bosses said that 

they  would take advantage of Florida's liberal "Sunshine Law" to get access to all the 

ballots.    The Democrats thought the hand count would prove that Al Gore won 

the  Presidency.  The Republicans thought the hand count would only prove that it 

was  impossible to divine the true intent of a voter who left a "dimpled" chad on a punch 

ballot.  The media bosses thought the hand count would be a ratings booster on 

par with the O.J. Simpson and Clinton impeachment trials, two well-known media 

obsessions of the time.  

<p>But before the first ballot was counted, a group of wise citizens came up with another 

idea.   During the Clinton impeachment trial, they argued, the Democrats kept repeating 

the mantra that it was time to "move on."   The wise citizens thought that this was sound 

advice as regards the ballot count, but they also realized that they were living in a 

time period when it was difficult to move on until "closure" had been achieved.    

<p>How to achieve closure?  The wise citizens proposed that all of Florida's ballots be 

taken from storage in Tallahassee, transported to the coast, and dumped in the Gulf of 

Mexico.  Without having the ballots to obsess over, the wise citizens argued, the country 

could finally "move on" to the business of the nation.  

<p>The "Dump in the Gulf" proposal made a big splash.   So popular was the idea that 

the wise citizens added a further proposal:  that on the first Tuesday of November in 

each non-Presidential election year, citizens gather at the site of the ballot dumping as 

part of a national day of atonement for all historical voting abuses.  The day would be 

called "Clinton Harris Atonement Day," or CHAD, named after the Democrat most 

despised by Republicans (Bill Clinton), and the Republican most despised by Democrats 

(then Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris).   Clinton and Harris were perfect 

symbols of the petty partisanship produced by the United States election laws of the 

twentieth century. 

<p>The CHAD caught on and soon became  a popular national holiday.   Each year, 

citizens gathered at the coastal site and listened to speeches about the  ways Americans 

had historically been denied the right to vote or had the power of their vote  minimized-

poll taxes,  literacy tests, property restrictions, gender and racial  discrimination, 

confusing ballots, onerous ballot access laws,  "winner take all"  elections that made it 

near impossible for third party candidates to win, and many others.   Those gathering 

would pledge to protect and defend democracy, then dive into the Gulf as a symbolic 

reenactment of the great Florida ballot dumping of 2001.  

<p>But the Clinton Harris Atonement Day did not only focus on the negative.   Citizens 

began discussions of ways to improve America's antiquated election procedures.  As 

early as 2001, citizens wrote to their representatives and demanded consideration of  HR 

5631, a bill introduced by Peter DeFazio (D-OR) and Jim Leach (R- IA) that  required 

study of pro-democracy reforms.   Soon, citizens developed  persuasive proposals for 

pro- democracy measures like instant runoff voting, proportional  representation, 

weekend voting, and voting via Internet and mail.    

<p>Thanks to the CHAD, by the middle of the twenty-first century the United States had 

finally developed electoral laws respecting the right of every citizen to participate 

equally and fairly.   Voter turnout began to increase, and for the first time in American 

history it became possible for third parties such as the Greens and Libertarians to have an 

impact on the political system without being labeled "spoilers" by the Democrats and 

Republicans.   By the year 2050, the United States had finally become the role model of 

citizen participation and democracy always dreamed of by early reformers like 

Wisconsin's Bob LaFollette.  

<p>Dumping those Florida ballots was a controversial proposal in the year 2000.  But by 

doing it, the United States was able to avoid a prolonged partisan and media induced 

obsession with minutia and get on with the business of making the United States into the 

great democratic republic it had always promised to be.
