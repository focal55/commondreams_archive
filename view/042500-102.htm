Government - as an institution and even as an idea - hasn't fared well in this era 
        of corporate globalization. The prevailing view, especially in elite circles, 
        is either that government has become irrelevant and powerless, swept away 
        in the swirl of the global market, or that it is an odious obstacle to 
        the market and its bounty. Yet it is growing increasingly clear that the 
        world doesn't need more rapid marketization. Instead, it needs more effective, 
        democratic government and a stronger popular political voice, from local 
        communities to global financial institutions. 

      
<p>Ironically, the view that government is bad is often imposed on developing 
        countries by two institutions created by governments, the International 
        Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the latest targets of popular protest 
        against globalization. When countries get into economic difficulties, 
        often as a result of financial market instability (currency swings, short-term 
        capital flight, commodity price plunges or interest rate spurts), the 
        IMF typically has demanded that governments privatize operations, cut 
        budgets (with education and health care the usual victims), eliminate 
        subsidies, open and deregulate all markets and make labor "flexible" (that 
        is, make it easy to fire workers and cut their pay). Everything must be 
        sacrificed to protect government's sacred bond - not with its own citizens, 
        but with international bond holders. </p>
<p>In many 
        developing countries where the IMF prescribes its harsh medicine, governments 
        have been particularly bad - corrupt, ill-managed, inefficient, undemocratic, 
        inequitable and ineffective in their basic tasks. But as the 1997 Asian 
        crisis demonstrated, the IMF prescribed the same treatment for governments 
        that had been doing many things well, especially on issues that typically 
        matter to the IMF - balancing budgets, promoting growth, opening markets. 
        As Russia shows, even a functioning government that doesn't do much well 
        can be economically preferable to virtually no functioning government. 
        Joseph Stiglitz, who recently resigned as the World Bank's chief economist, 
        has argued in criticism of the IMF that markets don't work well without 
        appropriate governmental institutions. In their absence, it can be disastrous 
        to push rapidly for more exposure to global market forces. </p>
<p>The developing world certainly has suffered from corrupt despots, and 
        IMF critics often downplay the extent to which economic and political 
        elites in poor countries have been responsible for poverty and squalor. 
        But from Indonesia to Guatemala, the responsibility for many bad governments 
        also rests with outside forces, both the United States and international 
        financial institutions. No matter how much the powerhouses of global capitalism 
        may criticize corruption in these countries, they have preferred it over 
        even moderately left-wing popular governments. </p>
<p>With the end of the Cold War, there is no longer the "strategic" justification 
        for propping up such governments, concluded a recent congressional advisory 
        commission on international financial institutions chaired by conservative 
        economist Alan Meltzer. But it was not just a Cold War strategy: The United 
        States, often acting through the IMF and World Bank, was clearly setting 
        policies that were designed foremost to protect the interests of Wall 
        Street, turning governments into handmaidens of global corporations and 
        financiers. Now the United States may support limited democratization 
        in countries like Haiti, Korea or Indonesia - but only to gain popular 
        legitimacy for a set of policies that still favors the global money elite. 
      </p>
<p>The overall record of countries under IMF structural adjustment programs 
        - the policies imposed as a condition for loans - has ranged from unimpressive 
        to disastrous, despite some successes in dampening inflation and increasing 
        exports. Even by its own account, roughly 60 percent of World Bank projects 
        have been failures. </p>
<p>One 
        of the biggest problems has been the horrendous burden of debts on many 
        poor countries. Many of these debts are odious - especially when contracted 
        by undemocratic, corrupt rulers - and could legally be repudiated under 
        a precedent established a century ago by the United States, when it canceled 
        Cuba's debt to Spain after the Spanish-American War. The Jubilee 2000 
        campaign finally has forced the rich nations to acknowledge the need for 
        debt relief. Yet the plans for writing off some of the debt still leave 
        most poor countries saddled with unsustainable debt service charges and 
        untenable conditions. </p>
<p>Governments have been turned into debt collectors for global capital. 
        But the money and its repayment are not as important as enforcing the 
        iron law that capital always come first. Moreover, collecting the debt 
        by dismantling public services and turning everything over to private 
        business is very rarely the best solution to the failures of government. 
      </p>
<p>The key to correcting government failures and creating the conditions 
        for solid development is less a matter of technical economics - like "getting 
        prices right" - than a matter of politics - giving people a voice. In 
        its most recent Poverty Report, the U.N. Development Program argues that 
        "effective governance is often the 'missing link' " in strategies to reduce 
        poverty; countries need help in improving governance, not more economic 
        conditions imposed from outside. Most important, the report states, "The 
        foundation of poverty reduction is self-organization of the poor at the 
        community level. Such self-organization is the best antidote to powerlessness, 
        a central source of poverty." Poverty programs are unlikely to work, the 
        report continues, if the poor are not empowered, or if macro-economic 
        policies are anti-poor. Yet the IMF not only imposes anti-poor policies, 
        but also undermines democracy. IMF strategy disempowers the poor, whether 
        it's secretly setting national policies, dismantling the few programs 
        that serve the poor, or undermining unions. </p>
<p>Stiglitz argues development must be viewed as a transformation of society, 
        not just an increase in GDP, and it must spring from within the society. 
        Economic democracy is essential, he said in a January speech in Boston, 
        and "democratic and participatory processes involving labor unions and 
        other social organizations" are needed both to deal with the legitimate 
        interests and anxieties of working people and to make possible a participatory 
        "high road" to economic development. </p>
<p>Pushing for a flexible labor market, Stiglitz said, may be tantamount 
        to telling workers to give up hard won advances in labor standards without 
        any overall public benefit. "By becoming advocates of stronger workers 
        rights and representation at every level - from the workplace ... to the 
        international level - I believe that we can achieve much more than improvements 
        in efficiency," he said. "Labor unions and other genuine forms of popular 
        self-organization are key to democratic economic development." </p>
<p>While IMF officials disdain promoting labor rights as illegitimately 
        "political," they regularly encourage policies that undermine labor rights 
        as simply "economic." The IMF pays no attention to the distribution of 
        income and wealth. Yet several studies show a link between lower levels 
        of income inequality and higher levels of growth in nations around the 
        world. Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has shown a strong correlation between 
        democratic institutions and rates of growth as well. Stiglitz also argues 
        that economic problems increase as inequality of wealth grows, possibly 
        reducing productivity, and union organization can help correct some of 
        those problems. Clearly, the political arguments for democracy, workers 
        rights and effective government form the basis for sound economic policy. 
      </p>
<p>The 
        most important thing that the international financial institutions could 
        do to strengthen government and democratic participation is to stop doing 
        harm: stop acting as enforcers for global capital and stop interfering 
        in the organization of workers, peasants and other citizens in unions, 
        non-governmental organizations and political parties. </p>
<p>Although it is unlikely that the World Bank or IMF will be eliminated, 
        as some protesters demanded at the spring meetings in Washington, there 
        is growing clamor - some of it from conservatives - to drastically scale 
        back the IMF to focus on its original mission of managing short-term currency 
        problems. There is a need, however, for both increased foreign aid and 
        long-term loans to poor countries. That could come from a new organization, 
        possibly funded by receipts from a small tax on currency and other financial 
        transactions, or even a reformed World Bank. The conditions for such assistance 
        should not be privatization and austerity, but recognition of core labor 
        and human rights. Although rich countries can provide poor countries technical 
        assistance in developing effective governmental institutions and a professional 
        corps of civil servants, the real political transformation must come from 
        within the countries themselves. For that to happen, ordinary people must 
        be able to organize. </p>
<p>The creation of strong forms of economic and political democracy can 
        become the basis for real, sustainable development. This would not preclude 
        foreign investment, but it would mean that when countries bargain with 
        international investors and institutions, workers, poor people, environmentalists 
        and other citizens will have a voice in setting the terms of the new global 
        market. This model of development is likely to produce a more egalitarian 
        society - one that measures wealth, as recent Nobel Prize-winning economist 
        Amartya Sen proposes, not just in dollars but in the growth of human capacities 
        of the greatest number of people throughout the world. </p>
