WASHINGTON -- Both President Clinton and 
Gov. George W. Bush 
would like the Pentagon to get along with 
fewer nuclear warheads, and the Russians are eager for talks to push the 
numbers down. But top American 
military officers insist that current 
nuclear policy prevents them from 
shrinking our arsenal  to fewer than 
2,000 to 2,500 strategic weapons -- 
and that going lower would threaten 
our security. The reason for their 
position is a matter of simple arithmetic, buried in the nation's strategic war plan and ultimately linked 
to presidential guidance.

<p>  Defense officials do not talk openly 
about the  nuclear targets in the strategic plan. But for 25 years, beginning with a background in the Strategic Air Command, I have  studied 
strategic policy and operations and 
have had extensive contacts with officials who are knowledgeable in 
these areas. I have been able to develop current estimates, and they 
lead inexorably to a conclusion that 
our leaders are clinging to outdated 
planning that helps keep an unnecessarily large number of American 
and Russian missiles pointed at one 
another on hair-trigger alert.

<p>  The strategic war plan consists of a 
very long list of targets in Russia and 
a shorter list of targets in China. The 
Pentagon says the United States must 
be able to destroy these targets to 
meet current presidential guidance 
on nuclear war planning, a directive 
issued in late 1997 to get the number 
of warheads down from even higher 
levels required in earlier plans.

<p>    Oddly enough, the target list has 
been growing instead of contracting 
since the last strategic arms reduction treaty, Start II,  was  signed in 
1993. The list has grown by 20 percent over the last five years alone, 
according to top military  and former 
administration officials. The vast 
bulk of the targets are in Russia. 
Three other former republics of the 
Soviet Union -- Belarus, Ukraine and 
Kazakhstan -- were dropped from 
the strategic plan in 1997, yet the list 
of sites the Pentagon says we must 
be ready to destroy has grown from 
2,500 in 1995 to 3,000 now.

<p> My research and interviews indicate that there are about 2,260 so-called vital Russian targets on the 
list today, only 1,100 of them actual 
nuclear arms sites within Russia. By 
this calculation, we have nuclear 
weapons aimed at 500 "conventional" targets -- the buildings and 
bases of a hollow Russian army on 
the verge of disintegration; 160  leadership targets, like government offices and military command centers, 
in a country practically devoid of 
leadership; and 500 mostly crumbling factories that produced almost 
no armaments last year.

<p> American strategic planners have 
historically set the level of damage 
that they wish to inflict on vital targets at 80 percent. This is tantamount 
to requiring our forces to be able to 
destroy 80 percent of the 2,260 Russian targets, which in turn requires 
the ability to deliver nearly 1,800 warheads to their targets. It is no accident that we have about 2,200 strategic warheads on alert, according to 
numbers provided by Strategic Command officers. Virtually all of our 
missiles on land are ready for launch 
in two minutes, and those on four 
submarines, two in the Atlantic and 
two in the Pacific, are ready to 
launch on 15 minutes' notice, officers 
say. The land-based missiles must 
leave the ground fast enough to be 
sure of being in the air before Russian missiles can destroy them.

<p>  If 1,800 warheads have to be delivered quickly, the Pentagon says, we 
need a larger arsenal because of the 
demands of maintenance. For instance, typically 6 to 7 of the 18 nuclear-armed submarines are port-bound 
at any time and cannot be counted on 
to survive and deliver nuclear warheads if we are attacked. Thus the 
United States needs one-third more 
sea-based strategic weapons than it 
can expect to deliver in wartime.

<p>  And Russia is not our missiles' only 
target.   Responding to the 1997 presidential guidance, the Pentagon put 
China back into the strategic plan 
after a hiatus of about 20 years. For 
China, we now have two so-called 
limited attack options, involving a 
handful of nuclear weapons on submarines and bombers, for striking 
nuclear targets, leadership sites and 
critical industries. Compare this with 
scores of limited attack options 
against Russia, each using from a 
handful of weapons to more than 100, 
as well as a few major attack options, 
the smallest of which would send 
more than 1,000 strategic warheads 
to attack Russia's nuclear complex.

<p>  There are also many hundreds of 
secondary targets in China, Iran, 
Iraq and North Korea that have 
weapons assigned to them, though 
not on immediate alert,  further driving up the size of the arsenal.

<p>  Add it all up, and at least 2,500 
American warheads are deemed necessary to carry out nuclear war 
against Russia and China, countries 
that Al Gore recently said represent 
our vital partners, not our enemies.

<p>   Getting to below 2,000 warheads  will 
be difficult unless the target requirements  are eased by new presidential 
guidance.   Of course they could be, if 
our leaders would bring our war plans 
up to date. No thoughtful American 
general, much less any political leader, really believes that deterrence depends on the scale of nuclear bombing 
with which Russia and the United 
States now threaten each other.

<p>Almost without exception, 
our leaders regard 
the attack options 
that unleash thousands of nuclear 
warheads as absurd 
and grotesque. They do not believe 
that a cold-blooded, deliberate nuclear strike by either Russia or the 
United States is remotely plausible. 
The only circumstances for nuclear 
war that they do consider plausible 
involve the use of one or a handful of 
nonstrategic weapons, like nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, against a 
country other than Russia.

<p>  Deterrence would remain robust 
with far smaller arsenals on far lower levels of alert. The United States 
and Russia should aim to cut the 
numbers of their nuclear weapons  to 
the low hundreds and to take all of 
them  off hair-trigger alert, with a 
view to eventually eliminating them 
under existing treaty obligations. As 
a first step, the United States could 
drop to 1,500 warheads, the ceiling 
the Russians are pushing for.

<p>  Such a force could consist of 10 
submarines armed with a total of  480 
warheads; 300 Minuteman III land-based missiles with one warhead 
apiece; 20 B-2 bombers with 16 
weapons apiece, for 320;  and 50 B-52 
bombers modified to carry 8 warheads apiece, for 400.

<p>  A better option would  be to retire 
the B-2 and B-52 nuclear bomber force 
from the arsenal and have the submarines in this mix  carry 1,200 warheads. 
But planners cringe at the thought of 
removing a leg from the vaunted triad 
-- the mix of missiles, submarines and 
bombers carrying nuclear weapons -- 
a vestige of cold war rivalry between 
the Navy and the Air Force. 

<p> Even without relying on launch on 
warning, 1,500 warheads would be 
more than adequate to destroy 250 
targets of any choice in retaliation for 
any  surprise attack under normal conditions, and to destroy 1,000 targets in 
retaliation to an attack in a crisis. If 
the threat of this much nuclear retaliation does not deter a prospective 
adversary, it is difficult to conceive of 
anything that would.
