Imagine a country, a democracy, 
with a domestic program that is increasingly costly and socially disruptive. The problem it is supposed to 
solve has actually grown worse over 
the years -- but neither major political party will talk about changing the 
policy.

<p> That is a picture of the United 
States and its drug policy. By any 
rational test the war on drugs, with 
its use of the criminal law and harsh 
sentences to solve the problem, is a 
costly failure. The number of Americans in prison for drug offenses has 
multiplied by 10 since 1980, from 
41,000 to 458,000. But drugs are more 
available than ever, and more young 
people are using them. 

<p> In the face of this political and 
social disaster the Republican and 
Democratic parties offer: silence. 
Their leaders are evidently afraid 
that even discussing different approaches might get them labeled as 
soft on drugs.

<p> But the silence is about to be broken. In tandem with the Republican 
National Convention starting Monday in Philadelphia, and later with 
the Democrats, there will be shadow 
conventions that discuss the failed 
war on drugs and two other issues 
that the major parties have not 
solved: campaign finance and the 
gap between rich and poor.

<p> Senator John McCain and other 
politicians brave enough to break 
with their parties' wishes will participate. Senator McCain will be the 
keynote speaker tomorrow, talking 
about the idea that makes him anathema to so many other Republicans: 
ending the scandal of campaign money and influence.

<p> The shadow conventions are the 
brainchild of Arianna Huffington, the 
columnist and gadfly. She has moved 
from the political right toward the 
left -- or perhaps to a position of 
dislike for all evasive politicians. The 
shadow conventions will have participants from all camps.

<p> Representative Tom Campbell of 
California, the Republican candidate 
for Senate against the incumbent 
Dianne Feinstein, will talk about the 
failed drug war. So will another Republican brave enough to challenge 
the policy, Gov. Gary Johnson of New 
Mexico, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
Walter Cronkite, the greatly respected former broadcast newsman, has 
made a 10-minute video special for 
the shadow convention on the cost of 
the drug war.

<p> The staggering figure mentioned 
above -- that 10 times as many 
Americans are in prison for drug 
offenses today as in 1980 -- comes 
from the Justice Policy Institute in 
Washington. It has just issued a report that shows, in fresh ways, some 
consequences of the war on drugs.

<p> The 458,000 men and women now in 
U.S. prisons on drug charges are 
100,000 more than all prisoners in the 
European Union, whose population is 
100 million more than ours. The annual cost of incarcerating them is $9 
billion.

<p> Nearly 80 percent of drug arrests 
in 1997, the most recent year for 
which figures are available, were for 
possession. Of those, 44 percent were 
for possession of marijuana.

<p> Blacks are overwhelmingly more 
likely than whites to be imprisoned 
for drug offenses, a study by Human 
Rights Watch showed. Just 13 percent of regular drug users in this 
country are black, but 62.7 percent of 
drug offenders sentenced to prison 
are black. Evidently juries and 
judges treat offenders less seriously 
if they are white.

<p> The Justice Policy Institute report 
found that in 1986, 31 out of every 
100,000 young people in America 
were put in state prisons for drug 
offenses. By 1996 the figure had nearly quadrupled, to 122 per 100,000.

<p> The institute studied states with 
higher rates of imprisonment for 
drug offenses to see whether that had 
a deterrent effect. It found, to the 
contrary, that states with higher incarceration rates also had higher 
rates of drug use.

<p> There are already signs around 
the country of unease with the human cost and practical failure of our 
drug policy. Perhaps the shadow conventions will move more political 
leaders to face the reality recently 
stated by The Economist of London: 
 "That misguided policy has put millions of people behind bars, cost billions, encouraged crime and spread 
corruption while failing completely 
to reduce drug abuse." 
 

<p>    Ralph Nader has chided me for 
saying that he has paid little or no 
attention as a candidate to the civil 
liberties record of the major parties. 
In fact he has called the Clinton administration's record "abysmal."
