DURHAM --  What you might call "pople's globalization" first came to Velikije Luki, Russia, with some Polish shuttle workers in the late 1970s. Velikije Luki is a small city, about 300 miles west of Moscow, where foreigners had been unheard of since the last war with the Germans. The Poles came to build a terminal for an oil pipeline called "Friendship."
<P>
Soon everyone in Velikije Luki could purchase such forbidden fruits of Western civilization as Polish chewing gum and suspiciously flimsy blue jeans with fake "Made in U.S.A." labels. 
<P>
As the locals say, the Poles clothed and booted the whole city. And with their speculative rubles, shuttling Poles bought sturdy Russian pans, kettles and irons to make fortunes in the markets of Belostok and Warsaw.  
<P>
Then came the preachers. They handed out free Bibles and color booklets with promises of a prompt Apocalypse. From time to time the booklets emerge in the farmers market, used by phlegmatic vendors as handy wrapping.
<P>
This is not to say that the city remained atheist. As a toddler I was stealthily baptized in a local Orthodox church long before communism went. My parents called it "tradition" but wisely kept it secret from neighbors and colleagues, who very well might have secrets of their own.
<P>
When capitalism arrived as an adequate substitute for the Apocalypse, a landmark Orthodox church was erected in the place where another had stood before the revolution. Father Dimitry, a priest of that church, was a "metallist" in the 1980s. That is, he preached not Gospel, but heavy metal rock. In the spiritual void of the late Soviet Union, he went through Buddhism, Daoism and Yoga, changing girlfriends each time he tried another belief. Eventually he converted to the faith of the fathers and took a permanent wife. 
<P>
My wife, Tatyana, says she'd like to go confess one time; what stops her is the fact that Father Dimitry is a bigger sinner than anybody. 
<P>
The old-new Orthodox church is located on Karl Liebknecht Street. Karl Liebknecht, who was Jewish, was a hero of the failed German socialist revolution of 1918. Unlike in other places across Eastern Europe where new capitalist governments changed street names to quickly forget their collective past, locals in Velikije Luki did not change a single name.
<P>
History has made the city's residents resilient and reserved. 
<P>
From its foundation in the 11th century until the 16th century, Velikije Luki was a virtually independent city-state that elected its prince in an all-town meeting called in by the special Veche bell. Oftentimes, invited princes got kicked out by the locals, who had some sort of international tender for the position, open even to foreign Lithuanians.  
<P>
The problem of Velikije Luki has always been its proximity to the West. When in the 13th century most of Russia's princedoms were defeated by the Mongols and made to pay an onerous tribute for over two centuries to come, Germany, Sweden and Poland explored their chance to conquer the part of weakened Russia that the Mongols did not reach. Their eyes were on such trading city-republics of the Russian Northwest as Velikije Luki. 
<P>
Democracy held on until in the 15th century, when Western crusades made Velikije Luki call on a powerful prince of Moscow for military help. He relentlessly pursued a policy of unification of Russia, and so asked for unconditional loyalty in return. In 1510, the last vestige of democracy, the Veche bell, was silenced.          
<P>
But Velikije Luki hasn't ceased to be a battleground. 
<P>
In the 16th century, a huge army of Polish king Stephan Batory laid siege to the city. It was burned to ashes, but did not surrender.
<P>
In 1942, Velikije Luki was the site of one of the most ferocious battles of World War II, one lasting for months. With the Red Army bearing down, Hitler demanded that the city be held at all costs, and promised a chief German commander that he would rename the city after him. There was no building left standing. After the city was liberated and the German commander captured, he and his officers were tried and publicly hanged on the main square.   
<P>
After the war, when Stalin had released his own latent anti-Semitism, some Jews from big cities moved to Velikije Luki, just to play it safe. Most were teachers, doctors and artists. Residents recall that the notion of good manners reappeared. It became "cool" to wear good suits, play piano and not swear. After the public hangings, music lessons were a good change. German POWs were rebuilding the city; the houses they built were good and still stand.
<P>
In the 1990s, a new brand of crusaders came to Russia. They brought a new religion -- market fundamentalism --  with its God the dollar and its prophet the American free-market economist Milton Friedman. For Velikije Luki, this new religion was worth a few of Stephan Batory's sieges. 
<P>
A local textile factory was turned into a disco, and Radiozavod, an audio recorder producer, was effectively shut down. Other enterprises got privatized, with new investors who knew that it made more sense to sell out the equipment and leave than to stay in business.
<P>
In few years, unemployment soared, and so did crime. Velikije Luki became home of a brutal mafia gang that waged its wars as far beyond the city's borders as Budapest. Resilient as ever, local residents survived. 
<P>
The city is surround by beautiful lakes and forests, which are still, despite the International Monetary Fund, in the public domain. So fishermen can fish without paying to some Global Water Ltd., and many sell their fresh catch on the market. Beside fishing, one of the favorite local pastimes is picking berries and mushrooms in the wood (I hope the IMF is not reading this article). Old ladies sell berries in the market, using glasses for measures. They heard that the IMF had sucked all the money out of Russia, but do not think the forests may be privatized one day. 
<P>
"This is everybody's property and should stay so," they say. "What, is it going to be master's again, as under the serfdom? Nobody will allow that to happen."
<P>
Like characters in Shakespearean plays, residents of Velikije Luki rarely say everything that's on their minds. They can hardly be surprised by anything, and if they are, they'll never show it. They have a good if not too courteous sense of humor. More importantly, very often they laugh last. 
<P>
They don't take a thing for its face value, and there is the only way to deserve their respect. That is to be as good as your word. Not surprisingly, big ideas and big-time politicians don't fare very well in Velikije Luki, unless they "walk the walk." 
<P>
Last summer, people in Velikije Luki talked about an international balloon championship that the city had just held. Before the championship, the mayor had ordered that all the roads be repaired. The tourists were not told that to repair the roads, the mayor had held up single-mother's payments.  
<P>
The linen factory was about to open again, as did a couple of other plants. The market has outgrown its old place and sprawled into neighboring streets. Some new cafes opened, with unbelievably low prices. Local writers published a number of books, one of them the talk of the town. Local journalists from competing newspapers, as usual, bitterly quarreled.
<P>
I walked along the embankment watching kids on water bikes passing the bridge. A new bridge has opened, in place of one that had stood there forever. From a window of the music school came a piano's staccato. There are already three local Internet providers, waging price wars. Three years ago, there were none, and to connect you had to dial long distance. Today, the prices are lower than in the U.S.
<P>
Velikije Luki is still trying hard to have a place in the global economy. Its residents went through wars and social experiments and attempts by men to change the nature of things. As a worldwide social experiment, communism failed. Now the city is living through a new radical experiment, capitalist-led globalization.
<P>
Today, when I hear the news that, after the worst is over, the IMF is going to return to Russia, I have goose bumps.  In Velikije Luki, we learned the hard way not to rely on the kindness of strangers.
<P>
<I>A native of Velikije Luki, journalist Igor Shnurenko is a media fellow at the DeWitt Wallace Center for Communications and Journalism at Duke University.  He plans to return to Russia later this month</I>.
