<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->I<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">t's Wednesday, Nov. 1 , and there's only a week
      to go til the presidential election. All signs are that the Gore
      people are in full, flat-out panic mode, doing everything possible
      to frighten Nader voters into thinking that a vote for Ralph
      is a vote for W. Bush. In fact, they're going further -- they're
      even arguing that a vote for Nader is a vote for fascism!
      </font>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last night was Halloween,
      but that doesn't explain why so many creepies have crawled out
      of the woodwork. Only terror explains it. This morning my email
      mailbox was full of emergency exhortations to &quot;do the right
      thing&quot;. They were passed on by teacher's unions, educator
      coalitions, fellow communications professors and even supposed
      greens.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For openers, a graduate
      student forwarded me a &quot;petition&quot; calling on Ralph
      Nader to pull out of the campaign. After some slimy warm-ups
      about what a great guy Nader is and how much he has contributed
      to American society, the petitioner delivers the sucker punch,
      urging Nader to &quot;do what is right for the American people
      in this crucial week before the 2000 presidential election.&quot;
      He should withdraw in the name of democracy so the mono-party
      can continue unchallenged. &quot;Please do not distort the American
      political process by splitting the liberal vote and allowing
      the conservative right to steal this election. Please do not
      waste the good will, respect and admiration the American people
      have for you by the throwing the 2000 American presidential election
      to George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.&quot;</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do I think
      of this, the student asks? I say it sounds like a Gore &amp;
      Co. press release. I send her back a copy of an excellent article
      Robert McChesney just wrote for the Madison, Wisconsin Capitol
      Times. Bob argues that the person who is losing the election
      for Gore is Gore, and that those who are going to shift their
      votes from Nader to Gore have already decided to do so. The election
      was Gore's to lose, and he's losing it, while Nader is picking
      up non-voters, and dissatisfied Republicans and Libertarians.
      But the Democrats could win by swinging their support behind
      Nader, a man people trust and believe in.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why would withdrawing
      be &quot;the right thing for democracy&quot; in a corporately
      dominated political system? I ask the student. Anyway, did Gore
      do the right thing for democracy when he refused to debate Nader
      and had him thrown out of the halls -- twice? (He certainly gave
      Nader a bounce in the polls.) The student replies evasively that
      she &quot;admires my conviction.&quot; Just to be prickly, I
      forward Bob's piece to all the graduate students where I teach,
      and three write back with warm thanks.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I move down my in-box list. It's getting worse.
      My fellow faculty are howling paeans to the lesser evil. The
      head of a local higher-ed coalition forwards me a poisonous piece
      from that great mind of the twentieth century, Gloria Steinem,
      titled &quot;Ten Reasons Why I'm Not Voting for Ralph Nader.&quot;
      The sender attaches a chipper comment: &quot;Once again, Gloria's
      right on target!&quot; (Gloria Steinem? On target? That rich,
      connected, Clinton-pandering, New York fashion plate, featured
      in Vogue and Vanity Fair, on political target?) Steinem's ten
      reasons include (I'm editing):</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10. He is in it
      for the matching funds, and trying to start a viable third party.
      Terrible idea.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9. &quot;He was
      able to take all those perfect progressive positions of the past
      because he never had to build an electoral coalition, earn a
      majority vote, or otherwise submit to democracy.&quot; Translation:
      he's an idealist. Why is submission to a phony democracy such
      a comfy position for you, Gloria?</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8. He's condemned
      Gore for voting against abortion while a Tennessee senator, and
      &quot;this actually dissuades others from changing their minds
      and joining us. &quot; Hunh? Steinem thinks abortion is the key
      issue, *and* she thinks Nader should not condemn someone who's
      consistently opposed abortion rights. Oooookayeee, as the thirteen-year
      olds say, but to me, this is pure prejudice. Nader can't have
      a reasonable position on abortion because....he's Ralph Nader.
      See below.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7.&quot;Nader is
      rightly obsessed with economic and corporate control, yet he
      belittles the movements against a deeper form of control--control
      of reproduction, and the most intimate parts of our lives. ...He...
      ridicules the use of the word &quot;patriarchy,&quot; as if it
      were somehow more less important than the World Trade Organization.
      &quot; Hey, maybe the guy's got a valid point: peoples' basic
      economic control over their everyday lives is where we have to
      start -- and that earning an equal, living wage and health benefits
      is a necessary step toward women having real control over their
      own lives and bodies. Somehow Steinem thinks reproductive rights
      are &quot;deeper&quot; (more radical?) than broadly-distributed
      economic equality, but weren't feminsts supposed to drop this
      either-or thinking a long time ago? Have you ever noticed how
      older, white women with money can get abortions, and younger,
      poor, darker and rural women have a lot harder time even finding
      a clinic? I think the word &quot;patriarchy&quot; is overused,
      and the way it is usually tossed around doesn't explain much.
      Her insistence on reproductive rights as central contradicts
      Steinem's point 6 above, about wanting to get anti-abortion people
      &quot;on our side.&quot; This is thinking? This is a reason to
      be against Nader?</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. &quot;The issues
      of corporate control can only be addressed by voting for candidates
      who will pass campaign-funding restrictions, and conducting grassroots
      boycotts and consumer campaigns against sweatshops, not by voting
      for one man who will never become President.&quot; Dead wrong.
      Campaign funding restrictions will NEVER be addressed by the
      men who CAN become president, because they're too deeply owned
      by the mega-contributors. If this were a remote possibility,
      Gore would not have kicked Nader out of the debates, and Gore-Bush
      would have been forced to address the issue. Campaign reform
      will have to be produced by a popular movement, which takes us
      back up to point 10, and Gloria's horror of same.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. She swears that
      the no-difference argument makes no sense. &quot;There is a far
      greater gulf between Bush and Gore than between Nixon and Kennedy
      and what did that mean to history?&quot; Hunh? I don't know,
      Gloria, -- what *did* that mean for history? Both men were president,
      and both did major damage. Did you dig Vietnam, Kennedy's sell-out
      of King, and the Cuban missile crisis? I didn't.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. &quot;Nader asked
      Winona LaDuke, an important Native American leader, to support
      and run with him, despite his possible contribution to the victory
      of George W. Bush, a man who has stated that &quot;state law
      is supreme when it comes to Indians,&quot; ..... She doesn't
      think Winona La Duke made her own decision to run? She shouldn't
      run either, because she might lose, too? She thinks the Clinton
      administration has a good record on Indian sovereignty and the
      environment? I'd love to hear No-Nukes Winona answer that one.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. &quot;If I were
      to run for President in the same symbolic way, I hope my friends
      and colleagues would have the good sense to vote against me,
      too, ....&quot; I hope so too. You can count on me. But of course,
      if *you* ran, it'd be purely symbolic and not a practical, political
      step, right?</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. The Supreme Court
      issue.. &quot;Gore is the opposite [from Bush on every important
      judicial issue]. Gore has made clear that his appointments would
      uphold our hard-won progress in those areas, and he has outlined
      advances in each one.&quot; This is everybody's big worry, and
      I just don't buy it. Gore voted for Scalia and didn't prevent
      Thomas's confirmation. On the vague possibility that Gore would
      dare nominate someone decent, and she/he could be confirmed,
      we're supposed to dump the possibility of getting a real progressive
      third party off the ground? If Gore had denounced Janet Reno's
      and Clinton's horrid records on civil liberties, immigration
      and privacy rights, you might convince me.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. &quot;The art
      of behaving ethically is behaving as if everything we do matters.
      If we want Gore and not Bush in the White House, we have to vote
      for Gore and not Bush out of respect for the vote and self-respect.
      &quot; If everything we do matters, then why do we want a sleazeball
      like Gore in the White House? If everything we do matter, then
      I have to vote for Nader to try to build a third party movement
      in this country. If not now, when? As for self-respect, it's
      a matter of looking at myself in the mirror in the morning. Which
      I can't do if I vote for someone owned by the military and the
      oil companies, while kidding myself that he's an honest politician.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Steinem goes on
      to add: &quot;Perhaps there's a reason why Nader's rallies seem
      so white, middle class, and disproportionately male.&quot; Think
      of it! White, middle-class and male! Then think of Steinem's
      NOW feminism -- white, middle class and female! Perhaps there's
      a reason why feminism is seen by the general public as a largely
      privileged and irrelevant non-movement -- all those years of
      cozying with the Clintonites. People like Steinem are terrified
      of not being at the table and in the game. Nader hasn't played
      insider politics, but somehow he's gotten a hell of a lot done.
      His consumer movement is an actual movement.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Time for a third cup of coffee. Steinem's &quot;Ten
      Reasons&quot; were straight-up slime and it was even worse that
      my own union rep recirculated them to me later in the morning.
      (Well, he's sort of my rep, but it's not like we have a contract
      or anything.) I wrote back and told him I thought it was a disgusting
      thing for him to send around. Then another communications professor
      -- supposedly a deep thinker on political theory -- sent Steinem
      around again, this time in answer to McChesney. What would Jurgen
      Habermas say? But what was coming was even creepier.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next I opened a
      message headed &quot;Long Night Coming&quot; that appeared to
      be from the John Muir Sierrans listserve. The JMSers are a reform
      faction of the Sierra Club, largely composed of Nader supporters.
      In it, some one named &quot;Doug&quot; (Doug Korthof) unfolded
      dark meditations. Doug wrote:</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I feel as
      lifeless as in the lead up to the election of 1968, knowing that
      the forces of evil are coming at you, but not being able to do
      anything about it. A long night is coming, apparently, unless
      we do something about it, instead, Nader continues vicious attacks
      on Gore.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The triumph
      of the reactionaries will be forever blamed, in my mind, on Nader
      more than the inept Gore.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If only Nader
      took the stronger, harder path of attacking Bush, instead of
      wreaking havoc on Gore, and killing the few scattered alliances
      trying to protect the environment.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Nader is doing
      the work of the Republican national committee, and doing it well.....&quot;</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What a nice warm
      thought, supposedly coming from the John Muir Sierrans, the opposition
      within the Sierra Club. It's Gore we want, and Gore we must have,
      and he's losing because Ralph Nader is vicious. And here I thought
      Ralph Nader, running as a Green, was viciously attacking the
      corporate control of the political system, including both major
      candidates, and especially on their environmental records.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dougie goes on to
      say &quot;Nader has split the left.&quot; (Here I thought he
      was pulling it together and breathing life into it, but I guess
      Doug thinks that Clinton-Gore are a &quot;left&quot; of some
      sort --- the left hand of darkness?) The Naderites &quot;have
      weakened any opposition to the Oil Lobby taking power. This will
      be a fearsome thing, if it occurs; the terrible abuses in Nigeria
      and Myanmar may come home, you may see them here. The Oil people
      have destroyed our electric railroads, and now they have bought
      up the patents for the new batteries which make electric cars
      possible. &quot; All Ralph Nader's future fault, and he's being
      so unfair to that outspoken defender of the people of Nigeria
      against Sun Oil, Al Gore.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Doug calls Nader
      &quot;venal&quot; for trying to get 5 per cent of the vote. This
      will lead directly to the &quot;elimination of the Electric Vehicle
      program, to the curtailing of abortion rights, to the continued
      pollution of poor communities by refineries in Wilmington.&quot;</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Nader will
      be the one who takes the blame, in the long night which is apparently
      inevitable, now.&quot;</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wow. Some optimistic, clear-thinking people
      in the John Muir Sierrans, no? I emailed Doug back and asked
      if his position represented the position of all the JMSers, since
      his message came via that listserve. If it did, I said, I wanted
      to know, because I'd want to be off the list. He replied ---
      &quot;You're off!&quot; What?</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm not too swift
      about this email technology. I assumed that since the message
      came to me *via* the JMS listserve that that meant it came *from*
      the JMS listserve. Further, I thought that since Dougie Korthof
      told me I was &quot;off&quot;, that that meant he was somehow
      monitoring the JMS listserve, and had taken me off it. That pissed
      me off. &quot;Are you the listserve operator?&quot; I asked.
      &quot;Did you really take me off the list? And what's your relationship
      to John Muir Sierrans?&quot; I asked. He refused to answer those
      questions, but wrote back to tell me that even though there's
      diversity of opinion in the Sierra Club, dark fascism is for
      sure coming to the US, especially if people vote for Nader. Carl
      Pope told him so, and it is incumbent on all us Sierrans to line
      up behind Carl's position. Can't you just hear the bootheels
      clicking?</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus Doug Korthof
      let me, and perhaps others, think he was representing a JMS position
      with his posting. He should have told me that I'd simply misunderstood
      and this was his own private list, even though it was embedded
      in a JMS email frame. But then he'd have to explain why he got
      my address from the JM Sierrans. After exchanging a few nasty
      remarks with him about censorship --- what did he mean I was
      &quot;off the list&quot; for asking a political question?, and
      he replied to the effect that &quot;if you think this kind of
      censorship is bad, there's worse coming after Nader gives the
      election to Bush&quot; --- it finally dawned on me that Doug
      was using John Muir Sierrans listserve addresses to send around
      his own anti-Nader scare letters. And then looked back through
      my mailbox and found that a few days earlier, he'd forwarded
      a false letter Nader being a direct threat to the lives of the
      U'wa people of Colombia. The real threats, of course, are Occidental
      Petroleum, in which Al Gore has a million dollars in stock, and
      the Clinton Administration's support for the Colombian military.
      This disinformation letter, the Rainforest Action Network and
      the Village Voice say, originated with the Gore campaign and
      was circulated over the internet by a Sierra Club member. Oh,
      Dougie, Dougie.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David Orr of the Sierra Club later told me that
      Korthof &quot;is not on the real JMS listserve.&quot; Orr believes
      Korthof has created his own version of a JMS list. Smooth, and
      it looks plausible. So, is Doug a Gore-warrior doing dirty tricks
      by making a message appear to come from JMS? Or did his own loose
      brainwaves tell him to scoop up JMS email addresses and freelance
      some diatribes, preposterous as they are? Or should I take a
      class in how to decode email headers? Who knows? In any case,
      Doug's a nasty little blister.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But he is right
      -- fascism is definitely coming to the US if &quot;greens&quot;
      so-called can use the electronic stationery of a legitimate organization
      to try to scare people out of voting for a third party while
      they still have a legal right to do so, and all the while claiming
      their reasoning is &quot;green.&quot; Sieg Heil, Doug, and have
      a nice day.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush may well win this election, in large part
      because Gore has been unable to convince anyone that he's trustworthy.
      He's been trying to out Republican the Republicans and he's behaved
      scandalously in refusing to debate Nader. Plus he looks awful
      -- like some inflatable rubber doll with a wooden head. It reminds
      me of the old Malvina Reynolds song about watching Nixon on TV:
      &quot;They say it's his face, but I just can't believe it. It
      looks like a mask that you buy at the store......&quot; On the
      other hand, Bush looks wooden, too, like a shifty-eyed Charlie
      McCarthy. I guess it depends who has the better mask.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If Gore loses it's
      not because Ralph Nader has &quot;viciously attacked him,&quot;
      or criticized his anti-abortion stances, or refused to cave,
      but because people can see Gore's dishonest. They know the same
      about Bush, too, but maybe they want a change in authoritarian
      phonies. How anybody can think the Democrats have any credibility
      in their calls for campaign finance reform, personal freedom,
      and an open political system after the last eight years is beyond
      me -- and apparently beyond a lot of others. Not unexpectedly,
      Gore's liberal toadies are scraping the bottom of their empty
      barrel, looking for moral authority to attack Nader with in a
      last minute panic. And the moral authority just isn't there.
      They're down to slime.</font></P>

I'm not especially
      worried about the differences between Gore and Bush --- I think
      that we are in for a very bad time no matter who wins. But what
      has driven this home to me are the screaming anti-Nader emails
      whizzing around on this very bad email day. They show how ferociously
      the fraudulent logic of the one-party system has reproduced itself
      in the brains of people who think they are &quot;on the left&quot;.
      Do you think I should unsubscribe?
