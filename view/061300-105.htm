The price at the pump is going up again. Of course, if you've got the loot, it's only a slight aggravation; annoying in the same sense it is when you buy a two-liter bottle of soda for $1.59 at one store and then see it for 99 cents at another.<BR>
<br>
On the other hand, rising gasoline prices are more than annoying for those operating on a shoestring budget. By the way, is it possible for people living on a shoestring to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps?<BR>
<br>
But I digress. I'm pretty sure the trucking and transportation industry is concerned about the <IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>cost of gas. It makes oil corporations and their hired underlings - aka politicians and policymakers - downright nervous. Reason being: everyday, average Americans start asking questions about the oil industry.<BR>
<br>
And if you dig a little (no pun intended), you'll find that no matter what the sign says at the gas station, it doesn't reflect the true cost. Follow me and you'll catch a glimpse as to why pump prices are not the actual cost of gas, and why our "free-market" economy is anything but free.<BR>
<br>
It was 11 months after I was born at the dawn of the age of Aquarius. In December 1971, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, in its report to the president, strongly supported a crucial role for the CIA in "free-world economic intelligence," according to "Inside CIA's Private World" - a collection of declassified articles from the agency's internal journal (1955-1992).<BR>
<br>
The report "recommended that resources be added for production of economic intelligence, that requirements be re-examined, and that the community served by intelligence producers be expanded to include the entire economic policy community. In effect, the concept of economic intelligence was once again broadened to include not only U.S. foreign policy considerations, but also considerations of U.S. economic power and international competitiveness," wrote veteran CIA economic analyst Maurice Ernst.<BR>
<br>
Sly & the Family Stone had just released "There's a Riot Goin' On" and Jesse Jackson formed People United to Save Humanity (PUSH) in Chicago. Turbulent times. Yet the hope that humanity could actually be saved had not yet flickered out.<BR>
<br>
But it wasn't until 1978 - the year Leon Spinks defeated Muhammed Ali in New Orleans and the Supreme Court ruled that affirmative action can result in reverse discrimination - that the "CIA was formally given the responsibility to produce economic intelligence on the entire world" by way of executive order.<BR>
<br>
What were CIA agents reading at the time? According to Ernst, the agency's weekly International Oil Developments (later renamed International Energy Weekly) became a "best seller." The publication started in 1973 at the request of the National Security Council.<BR>
<br>
This interest in oil stems from the fact that our entire economy is wholly dependent on a natural resource abundantly located in regions that are not officially part of the United States -  the Middle East, for example.<BR>
<br>
In the years following World War II, President Eisenhower wrote to Winston Churchill about Britain's "colonial ambitions." Using the United States imperialist relationship with the Philippines as an example, Eisenhower wrote that "that's the way this situation must be handled. We must work with these people and then they themselves will soon find out that we are their friends and that they can't live without us."<BR>
<br>
In Blanche Wiesen Cook's "The Declassified Eisenhower," we learn that "The United States' first successful covert operation occurred in Iran, where the Shah-appointed prime minister, Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh, actually attempted to 'live without us,' that is, without the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company."<BR>
<br>
You see, between 1913 and 1951, Anglo-Iranian grossed $3 billion; $624 million went to the Iranian government and $2.4 billion was transferred abroad as profits. When Britain threatened to send in the 16th Parachute Brigade, stationed on Cyprus, the United States intervened. In 1953, Kermit Roosevelt, CIA chief in Iran, organized the overthrow of Mossadegh, according to the book.<BR>
<br>
The British oil monopoly was over. An international cartel was set up where British Petroleum received 40 percent, the big five U.S. oil companies divided another 40 percent and the remaining 20 percent was shared by Royal Dutch Shell and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles.<BR>
<br>
Churchill congratulated Eisenhower. "I am so glad that you recognize the importance of oil from the Middle East. When I was at the Admiralty in 1913, I acquired control of the Anglo-Persian Company. That was a good bargain if ever there was one."<BR>
<br>
Fast-forward to modern-day Iraq. The United States destroyed Iraq's infrastructure and imposed sanctions that kill several thousand children every month for the past decade. Saddam and the rest of the Arab world are being shown by oil execs, and therefore U.S. planners, that "they can't live without us."<BR>
<br>
And that is the true cost of gas. According to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, "the price is worth it."
