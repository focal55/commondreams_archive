Al Gore already owes a debt to Ralph Nader's insurgent campaign.
As a Green Party candidate for president, Nader raised populist
issues such as the corporate control of government and the problems
of workers who are cast adrift in a global "free trade" push while
all Gore wanted to talk about was the booming economy. Democratic
leaders became alarmed as Nader's support in polls approached double
digits in key states while Gore lagged double digits behind the
Republican boy wonder, George Dubya Bush.

<P>Bush was so confident of victory last month that he named a fellow
oilman from Texas as his running mate.</P>
<P>Gore shook it up on the final night of the Democratic convention
in Los Angeles when he first embraced wife Tipper with a prime-time
lip-lock and then embraced populist rhetoric as he accepted the
Democratic nomination. There was not that much new in his support for
campaign finance reform, education, Social Security, Medicare and
health coverage for children, and his promise to fight for the
interests of working families will not strike fear into the hearts of
corporate executives who have been financing his campaign so far, but
it was refreshing to hear the vice president at least give lip
service to populist issues.</P>
<P>Gore's rise in the polls after his acceptance speech wiped the
smirk off Dubya's face for a moment and showed that the $20 million
payment Dick Cheney got as a going-away gift from Halliburton, an
oilfield service and construction company, may have been premature.
Gore's 55-minute performance, if not spellbinding, at least confirmed
that he is in command of his issues, in contrast with the Texas
governor's "compassionate conservative" platitudes delivered two
weeks earlier in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Bush later charged that Gore was engaging in "class warfare" and
was "playing politics" in his promises to fight for the interests of
working people. This from the standard-bearer of the Republican Party
whose main initiatives are elimination of the estate tax for wealthy
heirs, more reductions in the capital gains tax and holding the line
against any increases in the minimum wage, much less spending on
welfare programs for the poor. And Bush -- who has raised $100
million for his presidential race so far and whose handlers would not
allow John McCain to mention campaign finance reform in his speech to
the Republican convention -- had the gall to say that Gore could not
be trusted to deliver on his promise to clean up elections. Clear the
sty out of your own eye, Dubya.</P>
<P>In the meantime, Gore was off rocking and rolling down the
Mississippi River with Tipper, showing off his inner Elvis as well as
his New Populism to the crowds that welcomed him along the river's
banks in Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois and Missouri.</P>
<P>Sen. Paul Wellstone, DFL-Minn., has been making the point that
bread-and-butter progressive issues are winning issues, as polls show
that people want campaign finance reform, better health care,
stronger Social Security and improved public schools, but the first
reaction of pundits after Gore's speech seemed to be that he was
taking a risk in taking this populist turn. That shows you how far
removed the pundit class is from working people who haven't
benefitted all that much from the economic boom.</P>
<P>In 1988 it took Michael Dukakis until the final two weeks of the
campaign to discover that populist rhetoric appeals to voters
(imagine that!). His belated pitch to address workers' concerns
nearly caught the wonkish Dukakis up with old George Bush. That Gore
clued in on this "secret" this early is a hopeful sign for Democrats.
One can imagine a poster in Gore's "war room" that reminds one and
all of the central talking point: "It's the working families,
stupid!"</P>
<P>Not that we should get carried away over what so far appears to be
little more than a cosmetic change which, it turns out, was field
tested before Big Al wrote it into his speech. Recall that Bill
Clinton ran a populist campaign in 1992, only to find out after he
plopped into the Oval Office that Wall Street was calling the
shots.</P>
<P>So the race is on and progressives face the choice: Gore, the
Democratic nominee, who has evolved from a centrist congressman and
senator to a vice president who supports incremental reforms in
campaign finance, education, Social Security and health care. Or we
have Nader, the Green nominee, who has made a career of fighting for
citizen rights, accountability for giant corporations, public
financing of elections, universal health coverage and "fair trade"
pacts that protect labor standards and the environment in the United
States and overseas.</P>
<P>Barbara Ehrenreich, a progressive author who supports Nader, says,
"If you vote for Al Gore, you say you're OK with the plutocracy that
controls the Democratic Party as well as the Republican Party." There
is something to that argument.</P>
<P>However, Nader's rhetoric notwithstanding, there is still a
difference between Democrats and Republicans. Sometimes it might not
look like much of a difference -- the D's at times do appear reduced
to the centrist wing of the Money Party, and you can bet that Al
Gore's fighting spirit will fold before the same bond traders that
explained reality to Clinton in 1993 -- but if the GOP gets control
of the White House and both houses of Congress you'd see how
right-wing Dubya could become in a New York minute. The Supreme Court
soon would be headed the same direction, with several seats likely to
come open in the next few years, and pretty soon abortion rights
wouldn't be the only thing out the window.</P>
<P>If you thought Reagan/Bush was bad, the Democrats warn, picture
its sequel with Dick Armey calling the shots in the House, Trent Lott
running the Senate, Dubya ready to sign any bill that bunch of
scoundrels produces, and Antonin Scalia as the new Chief Justice of a
Supreme Court packed with his clones. It wouldn't even do you any
good to leave the country, because then you run the risk of becoming
a victim of American foreign policy.</P>
<P>But Gore has not earned your vote. Even if his new populist turn
has you thinking maybe he'd be OK after all, it's too soon to write
Nader off. Come November you can make an informed vote, but don't
settle for a protest vote for Nader. If you do vote for Nader, vote
for him to win. In American politics, there is no consolation
prize.</P>
<P>Of course, the rap on Nader is that he cannot win. That same rap
was used to belittle Jesse Ventura in 1998 before he was included in
debates of Minnesota candidates for governor. Going into the debates
he was polling only 10% support but his straight talk impressed
viewers and he upset the mainstream contenders in large part by
appealing to the working people who would not have otherwise
voted.</P>
<P>Recent polls show Nader with anywhere from 3 to 7 percent support
after little more than a word-of-mouth campaign. If he had gotten the
amount of press coverage that Gore and Bush have received over the
past year, there is no telling the level of public support he would
be enjoying right now. But in a year where cynicism about politics is
widespread and less than half the electorate is expected to vote,
Nader could make a race of it just by appealing to those 100 million
discouraged voters. Televised debates could be just the forum for
that sort of appeal.</P>
<P>The electorate deserves a full airing of the broad spectrum of
American politics, from the full-throated progressive populism of
Nader to the pop-flavored centrism of Gore, to the conservatism of
Bush, to the right-wing populism of Buchanan. Democracy depends on
the myth that the people decide.</P>
<P>Gore revived his campaign by reaching to the populist roots that
made the political career of his father. Now that Gore and Bush have
accepted the $67 million each in federal funds for the general
election campaign Gore can show us how independent he intends to be.
A bold start would be to open up the presidential debates by inviting
Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan.
