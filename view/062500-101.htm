Item: The World Health Organization has ranked the  United States health care system 37th among nations, at the  bottom of the list of advanced industrial countries.  The United States ranks last, even though it spends a higher percent of its national income on health than any other country.
<P>
<P>Item: Congress remains deadlocked on the Patients' Bill of Rights.  Most Democrats want to give consumers the right to  sue a managed care company for malpractice if the company  wrongfully second-guesses the doctor, in effect practicing  medicine without a license.  Republicans oppose this measure,  seconded by the insurance industry.
<P>
<P>Item: In Massachusetts, insurance companies that sell  Medigap insurance (to cover what Medicare does not) want  rate hikes of as much as 40 percent.  As this kind of such insurance becomes more unaffordable, only people who are  very sick, or very affluent, or both, buy it - which then requires  further rate hikes.
<P>
<P>Item:  The House Republicans have approved a bill to  offer partial prescription drug coverage to people eligible for   Medicare but without controlling drug prices. The actual  insurance would be sold by private insurance companies.  Most  drug costs would still be paid out of pocket.
<P>
<P>Item:  A Wall Street Journal investigation reports that  two major companies that sell long-term care insurance signed up elderly people at low rates that turned out to be too good to be true.  Then, when the companies had to pay out costly claims, they jacked up the premiums to the point where many of the subscribers who needed the care could not afford to  continue the coverage.
<P>
<P>What do all these stories have in common? They testify  to the failure of market forces to allocate health care  either efficiently or fairly.
<P>
<P>The basic principle of insurance is what economists call  the law of large numbers.  If you want to manage risks, it makes  sense to spread them around to a very large group.
<P>
<P>In the case of health insurance, the largest available  group is the entire population.  That way, the well subsidize the  sick, the young subsidize the old, and nobody fears losing  coverage when they are sick or old.
<P>
<P>But when private insurance companies carve up the population, they maximize their profits in a fashion that is socially  perverse.  They try to enroll the people least likely to get sick.
<P>
<P>Or if they are unlucky enough to end up covering sick people,  they often discourage doctors from providing costly treatments.
<P>
<P>It makes no economic sense to divide the population  into different population pools for purposes of health care.  The  result is not greater patient choice but greater limits on choice.
<P>
<P>The one plan that consistently lets any patient choose  any doctor is Medicare, our one universal program. It is the for-profit HMOs that tell you whom you can't see or what treatment  you can't have. These same managed care companies don't  want Congress to pass a patients' rights bill; that would limit their ability to dictate the withholding of care.
<P>
<P>Take the case of drugs.  Prescription drugs are the  fastest-rising cost in the health care budget.  Elderly people now spend more on drugs than they do on doctors.  Drugs are often the most cost-effective and painless treatment available, but most older Americans lack full prescription drug coverage.
<P>
<P>A great deal of the research behind new drugs is borne  by taxpayers via government-funded research. Yet much of the  benefit goes to private drug companies that benefit from  generous patent protection as well as public research dollars.
<P>
<P>Year after year they keep prices high and usually enjoy the  highest profit margins of any industry.
<P>
<P>So it's no surprise that we spend more and get less for our health dollar.  The fragmented, for-profit health industry leaves tens of millions of Americans uninsured and underinsured. It gives insurers incentives to discriminate against the  sick.  It leaves drug prices far higher they ought to be.
<P>
<P>The solution to all of this is universal coverage. Then no insurance company would spend a nickel on marketing or on dividing the sick from the well or on thinking up incentives to divide doctors from patients, because everyone would be insured. People who needed prescription drugs would get them.
<P>
<P>There would still be difficult ethical dilemmas of how far to go with costly heroics, but we would be spending every available penny far more efficiently and humanely.
<P>
<P>The vast majority of Americans want universal coverage; the big exceptions are the insurance and pharmaceutical industries.
<P>
<P>It makes you wonder who is running the country.
