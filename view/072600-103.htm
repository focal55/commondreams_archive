They've got the ``Don't ask, don't tell'' part nearly nailed down, but it's the rest of the policy -- ``don't pursue'' -- that our armed forces need to work harder on. That much was true even before Army Pfc. Barry Winchell's head was used for batting practice at Fort Campbell, Ky.
<P>

   In the year since Winchell was bludgeoned while he slept, the climate of fear and harassment of homosexuals has intensified in the military, according to watchdog groups such as the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network. The campaign to search for and destroy gays, lesbians and bisexuals also appears to have gained momentum.
<P>

   The bludgeoning of Winchell and last week's reported exoneration of Fort Campbell commanders in his death serve as haunting reminders of the second-class treatment of homosexuals in the military.
<P>

   Sometimes even the rumor of being gay is enough to destroy a military career. The defense network released its annual ``Conduct Unbecoming'' report in March. Although women compose 14 percent of the armed forces, according to the report, they compose 31 percent of gay discharges in 1999. ``Women are often accused of being lesbians for retaliatory reasons, regardless of their actual sexual orientation,'' the report said.
<P>

   Worse than a discharge was what happened to Winchell: a bat upside the head that followed weeks of alleged anti-gay harassment. Winchell's murderer, Pvt. Calvin Glover, was sentenced to life in prison. Winchell's roommate, Spc. Justin Fisher, was sentenced to 12 years in prison.
<P>

   The administration's military policy, initially hailed as a corrective, has been a disaster because it never was fully implemented throughout the various services. The Army, Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy all seem to operate under different rules of engagement, according to the defense network.
<P>

   The group's ``Conduct Unbecoming'' reports, now in their sixth year, continue to bear that out. The latest report said: ``Some chaplains have berated gay members who have reported harassment, while others have advised service members to turn themselves in and face discharge.''
<P>

   The March report covers Feb. 15, 1999, to Feb. 15, 2000, and reported 968 incidents of anti-gay harassment, doubling what was previously reported. Further reports of military officials who asked about orientation -- a violation of the ``Don't ask'' part of the policy -- increased 30 percent.
<P>

   The watchdog group documented 665 incidents in which service members were asked and pursued, up from 511 violations the year before. Further, ``In six years the military has not officially held anyone accountable for violating the current policy'' against asking and pursuing.

  Double standards are certainly nothing new in the armed forces. But when the double standards lead to the loss of dedicated men and women who would lay their lives on the line for the cause of freedom and democracy, and when that policy in any way incites anti-gay hostilities down the ranks and protects abusers through inaction, then it becomes more than a policy failure; it becomes life-threatening. It goes beyond unconstitutionality.
<P>

   Just ask Kansas City's Patricia Kutteles. That was her little boy they killed in Kentucky.
