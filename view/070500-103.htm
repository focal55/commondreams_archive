Something important happened last week in France -- a demonstration against globalization. Nothing new under that sun, of course. There have been demonstrations against globalizations aplenty in the past year, in London, Geneva, Washington, Bologna and, most famously, in Seattle.
<P>Seattle, where the demonstrators as good as wrecked the World Trade Organization get-together, was pretty important. Why make a fuss about another one, especially since this latest protest was utterly peaceful, and it was in a small town, Millau, about 80 kilometres north of Montpellier in the south of France.</P>
<P>Millau is on a river, the Tarn, in which people swim of a summer's morning. The hills of the Larzac district roll into it, enfolding it in a pretty valley. The town is big enough to have cinemas, a theatre, a good library, bookshops where you can browse and caf&#233;s spilling onto every pavement, where the wines of Bordeaux to the west and Langedoc-Roussillon to the south are savoured. The sheep in the hills about it give the blue-seamed Roquefort cheese.</P>
<P>In this idyll, a number of ingredients came together, like the making of a dramatic French meal, to profoundly affect the direction of the debate on globalization. For in Millau, the local became global and the global local. The place itself produced a reaction rooted in the conditions of the people. And it meant that protest -- easily represented as a bunch of anarchists smashing U.S. restaurant chains -- had a solid base from which it could build a structure of thought and action that encircle the globe. The protestors of Washington, London and Seattle often were local -- but their cities lived by the process of globalization. The people of Millau were suffering from it.</P>
<P>The place itself was the first ingredient. One of France's earliest cinema geniuses, Jean Vigo, made the film<I> Zero for Conduct</I> (1933), an anarchic vision based on the Millau boarding school to which he, a poor orphan, had been sent. There's a modest plaque dedicated to Mr. Vigo outside Millau's central cinema -- which was showing the latest U.S. version of Roman history,<I> Gladiator</I>, when I was there.</P>
<P>In our own times, one of the longest-running and most successful actions against the French state occurred just north of the town, when farmers and others opposed, throughout the 1970s, the extension of a military camp in the Larzac district. They won in 1981, and pride in the achievement is part of the local lore.</P>
<P>The second ingredient is Roquefort. The strong, tangy cheese made from sheep's milk has been a staple for centuries; much of it is exported, with rich markets in the United States. Last year, the U.S. government slapped 100-per-cent import duties on a range of foods and products in retaliation for European Union bans on genetically modified foods. Roquefort was one such product. And Jos&#233; Bov&#233; was one Roquefort producer. The individual in this case has a history of protest, and is the strongest ingredient in the recipe.</P>
<P>Mr. Bov&#233;, now 47, is no ordinary &#34;peasant&#34; (as he likes to call himself). Indeed, he is full of contradictions. The man who opposes the latest scientific breakthroughs in gene technology was the son of scientist parents; he who now leads a movement against Americanization spent his earliest years in the United States, when his parents were at the University of California at Berkeley.</P>
<P>But he was always a rebel. He objected to military service, writing a precocious teenage letter to the Minister of Defence detailing his objections. On the run from the police when he failed to get an exemption, he came to Larzac. His military service commuted to community work, he stayed to become a sheep farmer. He was one of the leaders of the protest against the camp extension and was a militant anti-nuclear protestor, especially against French nuclear tests in its colony of New Caledonia.</P>
<P>But it was the smashing of &#34;McDo's&#34; last year which gave him world fame. He was one of the organizers of the Confederation des Paysans, which brought together small farmers badly hit by price cuts and the growing power of French -- and international -- agribusiness. The Roquefort cheese embargo was the last straw: A few hundred of the producers marched on the building site on the southern periphery of the town where the latest McDonald's was going up. According to Mr. Bov&#233;, they had a &#34;festive deconstruction&#34; of the partly built restaurant. In the words of the local franchisee, it was a &#34;wrecking party.&#34;</P>
<P>Mr. Bov&#233; was charged which malicious damage and put in jail: He refused to post bail and stayed in longer than most of the other nine militants charged with him. He knew -- and openly admitted -- the value of being photographed in manacles and issuing statements from behind bars. He had struck a blow for the people of the Larzac. More -- he had, as a Frenchman, taken on the power of the most visible of the U.S. multinationals (never an unpopular posture, in this, the most prickly of European countries on the subject of American hegemony).</P>
<P>The French have made up a word, &#34;malbouffe,&#34; or &#34;bad grub.&#34; Fast food of all kinds is &#34;malbouffe&#34; in a country -- and in a region -- that takes its eating and drinking seriously and which recognizes that food has to be both slowly made and slowly enjoyed.</P>
<P>Thus any &#34;restaurant&#34; that lays down to its staff that every hamburger must be cooked for no more nor less than 43 seconds, and whose customers often seem to be competing to see how much food they can cram into themselves in the shortest time, is a standing affront. To choose McDo's as the symbol of Americanism, globalization, oppression and malbouffe was thus both natural (what else was more visible?) and inspired (what else drew together more strands of French public and private life?)</P>
<P>Two kinds of freedoms were at issue. The supporters of Jos&#233; Bov&#233;, who descended on Millau in their tens of thousands last weekend to be present at the trial of Mr. Bov&#233; and his nine comrades, carried banners saying &#34;Le Monde n'est pas une marchandise&#34; (the world is not for sale -- also the title of Mr. Bov&#233;'s bestselling book) -- adding &#34;et moi non plus&#34; (neither am I).</P>
<P>They also carried placards saying &#34;No to liberal globalization&#34; -- a protest against the free-trade policies that, they believe, favour the strong and especially the U.S. against the weak. They hate the World Trade Organization, which promotes free trade and whose meeting in Seattle last year was the focus of the protests.</P>
<P>Indeed, they see this find of &#34;freedom&#34; as oppression -- oppression of customs, or ways of life, of jobs, of culture. That which governments and corporations see as a liberal world, they see as a dictatorial one -- the dictatorship of General Motors, run by IBM, entertained by Hollywood and fed McDonald's and Coca-Cola. The Millau fiesta was a fusion of all of these anxieties and hatreds and losses. It was the cry from the heart of a state that sees itself as the guardian of a way of life: which genuinely, at every level, thinks that America can be evil.</P>
<P>The trial of Jos&#233; Bov&#233; and the &#34;McDo's 10&#34; will not bring in a judgement until later this summer. I left Millau on the overnight train to Paris and whiled away part of the night with a teacher who was travelling from Montpellier. He was a careful, measured man in his 50s, who sternly took Mr. Bov&#233; to task for an action that was violent and showed no respect for property. &#34;Do I then burn the books with which I don't agree?&#34; he asked. But he also observed: &#34;Bov&#233; expressed something real. It should be expressed. I see in my pupils, at times, a terrible passivity: a desire to do no more than watch TV and play computer games. I thank God my children grew up and went to university before computer games, which are all violent, and all American, even when they have French soundtracks.&#34;</P>
<P>It is a new version of the old (American) truth: that all politics are local. But it has a new twist. Local politics are now global. Nowhere -- not the rural peace of Millau, nor the ruined factories of the Ukraine, nor the humming software plants of Ireland, nor the coffee fields of Kenya, nor even the hungry collective farms of North Korea -- is now untouched by half-understood processes happening far away, incomprehensibly and out of all control, even by one's own government.</P>
<P>Jos&#233; Bov&#233;, with his curved mustachios, his open grin, his small farmer's muscled arms, is one of &#34;us&#34; who still understands &#34;them.&#34; He has made himself a bridge between the directly experienced and the distantly apprehended. He is the local internationalized. And thus his little local difficulty is now a global issue -- and will continue to be, as we rocket on into new worlds.
