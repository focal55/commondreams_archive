<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America owes African Americans a debt. It is an old debt. It has
lain around in edgy disregard for a century and a half. Long-term neglect
of it has aggravated exponentially its original consequence, itself being
staggering. Its compounded interest can be measured in the social
disrepair of its contemporary victims: black youth who menace one another
and society in general; black mothers, weary and solitary beneath the
burden of bleak prospect; black fathers, shorn of manhood before becoming
man-like.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These, the heirs of slavery's destructive promise, lag economically
far behind whites as a group in American society. Almost no one, black or
white, expects blacks to close this gap in the foreseeable future. So
small is any such expectation that the very question of it occurs only to
a statistically insignificant number of people, black or white. About as
motionless as China's ancient terra cotta Qin dynasty soldiers, the two
groups have known since Jamestown where to find each other on the
American economic ladder: whites at the top, blacks at the bottom. We've
all, in the United States, been pretty much left to figure out for
ourselves why this static verticality is so. Whites no doubt (even
liberals privately) ascribe it to their innate superiority. Most blacks
attribute it to contemporary racial discrimination, although more than a
few would harbor a lurking doubt or two about their relative worth. Some
blacks have simply come to hate themselves. It is the price of long-term
unexplained socioeconomic bottomness.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Almost never discussed in the United States is the seminal cause of
what long ago cleaved us into two unequal, mutually hostile racial
societies. It is not that slavery is never discussed or publicly
acknowledged, but simply that when slavery is discussed its story is told
to us as an academic recollection of a closed American chapter, as if the
246-year episode could be cordoned off in a blameless rubric of America's
sanitized version of itself.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Slavery was, and remains, an American holocaust. It lasted 20 times as
long as the Nazi Holocaust. It killed at least 10 times as many people.
It extinguished on three continents and a necklace of vegetal isles a
people's sustaining sense of selfhood. It eviscerated whole cultures:
languages, religions, mores, customs. It plundered. It raped. It
commodified human beings. It mercilessly crushed African social and
economic institutions in order to capitalize its own. It psychologically
hulled empty its victims. It wrenched from them their history, their
memory of what they had once meant to the world and to themselves, and
replaced their estimable story of their people with another, alien and
reproachful. All of this accomplished on a scale of human cruelty the
world theretofore had never witnessed.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And when this monstrous institution finally drained of energy a mere
135 years ago, this country (which had for 2 1/2 centuries hosted,
facilitated and materially benefited from the forced labors of millions
of uncompensated human beings) would embrace for the next hundred years
racial segregation and de jure racial discrimination, leaving a
disproportionate number of American descendants of slaves bottom-stuck in
debilitating poverty.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And then, rubble stilled, dust settled, silence. Even as around the
world restitution for less heinous crimes of shorter duration had been
made to Koreans, Poles, Aborigines, First Canadians, even as the United
States government made restitution to Japanese Americans interned during
World War II.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Silence.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even as U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat labored to make
16 German companies compensate Jews used as slave laborers during the
Nazi era.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Silence.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Slaves had built the U.S. Capitol, cast and hoisted the statue of
freedom atop its dome, cleared the forest between the Capitol and its
co-symbol of American democracy, the White House.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Silence.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Construction of the National Museum of the American Indian will begin
soon on the National Mall. Plans have been laid to build near the mall a
Japanese memorial park to commemorate Japanese American victims of World
War II internment. Daily, Americans queue in long lines to enter the
Jewish Holocaust Museum, where the Nazi terror is remembered in wrenching
detail.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet nowhere on the mall can anything be found--monument, memorial or
stone tablet--to commemorate the hundreds of millions of victims of the
American holocaust. While urging other nations to publicly atone for past
misdeeds, the United States schizophrenically has repressed its own.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American government for hundreds of years played a major role in
deconstructing Africa and millions of its issue. It abused them as beasts
of burden and released them uncompensated into a racial environment
certain to hold them fast in perpetuity to the economic bottom of
American society.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is now the United States' turn to atone. To pay its debt. To
materially compensate slavery's living victims. And to commemorate in its
public architecture those tortured souls who can no longer hear a simple
apology.
