THE DISTRICT COURT conclusion that Microsoft ``maintained its monopoly 
power by anticompetitive means -- in violation of the Sherman Act'' 
has forged a remarkable political and intellectual consensus on the 
need to restore competition in the software industry.
<P>  Conservatives (Judge Robert Bork and the Progress and Freedom 
Foundation) have joined liberals (Ralph Nader) and prominent academic 
economists (from Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, University of California at Berkeley and the Brookings 
Institution) in calling for a breakup to promote consumer choice, 
stimulate innovation and lower prices.	 
Some want separate companies to immediately sell competing Windows 
operating systems, but others, along with the Department of Justice 
and attorneys general from 17 states, recommend two companies that 
specialize in different products. The operating system company would 
be built around Windows. The applications company would be built 
around the Office Suite and Internet Explorer.	 
</P>
<P> This approach is cautious but appears to be a good compromise. 
Breaking up Microsoft would unleash powerful new competitive market 
forces in the industry and send a strong message that illegal 
business practices will not be tolerated.	 
</P>
<P>  This breakup would not fragment the operating system and, after a 
short transition, there would be no regulation of either of the new 
companies. The companies are each a spin-off of business units that 
already exist within Microsoft and would have substantial resources 
and strong products.	 
</P>
<P>Competition cannot be restored without a breakup. The trial 
identified half a dozen products that Microsoft prevented or slowed 
from getting to the market and evidence that Microsoft is 
perpetuating its illegal tactics of creating proprietary 
incompatibilities to frustrate new competition from Internet-based 
software and hand-held devices, such as the Palm Pilot.	 
</P>
<P>Ironically, some argue that the monopoly is good for consumers, who 
they believe cannot handle a choice of operating systems or a variety 
of combinations of software. They claim that one workable product is 
enough and that consumers are 
better off with one firm controlling technological development to 
preserve compatibility and avoid confusion.	 
</P>
<P>  This argument is wrong because it underestimates consumer 
abilities and ignores the tendency of competitive markets to produce 
compatible products. The products Microsoft attacked most vigorously 
were those that increased interoperability and compatibility, because 
they threatened its dominance.	 
Mature appliance markets, which is what the PC is becoming, typically 
present consumers with a wide range of easy-to-use 
products that embody complex price, quality and functionality 
trade-offs.	 
</P>
<P>  Consumers make sophisticated technology choices every day when 
they buy TVs, VCRs, automobiles and computer hardware. Consumers do 
not have to know how things work to be savvy buyers; all they have to 
know is what they need and want. The wider the range of choices, the 
better consumer needs will be met.	 
</P>
<P>  This is called consumer sovereignty. It works in most markets; it 
can work in the software market, if given a chance. A competitive 
market for PC software would en 
sure that programs run efficiently on a variety of computers that 
communicate well with each other.	 
</P>
<P>  Choice and competition will drive prices down. Evidence from the 
trial shows that the price of Microsoft's operating system tripled in 
the 1990s, even though its costs were falling. This was hidden from 
the public because Microsoft's monopoly prices are bundled in the 
total cost of the PC. Early in the case, we estimated overcharges of 
$10 billion to $15 billion. Recent academic analyses suggest even 
larger monopoly profits. Monopoly power allowed Microsoft to pursue 
an upgrade strategy that drives consumers to buy new software and 
more hardware sooner than they need to at a cost of tens of billions 
of dollars.	 
</P>
<P>  Experts supporting this breakup conclude it would restore 
competitive dynamics in the software market by changing the economic 
incentives of the new companies. The applications company could not 
rely on the operating system monopoly to maximize its profits. It 
would have to find new revenues, like developing applications for 
non-Microsoft operating systems, such as Linux. It would have to be 
more responsive to consumer demands -- improving quality and cutting 
prices.	 
</P>
<P>With more applications available and interoperability expanding, 
non-Microsoft operating systems would put greater competitive 
pressure on Windows. The operating system company could not retaliate 
by threatening to withhold its product or raising its prices, as it 
has done in the past, lest competing operating systems become more 
attractive to computer manufacturers and software developers, who 
would have a real choice in PC operating systems for the first time 
in years.	 
</P>
<P>A functional divestiture of Microsoft would restore the natural 
competitive process in the software industry. Products that have 
gained acceptance in closely related markets become competitors by 
expanding into neighboring markets. This is the competitive dynamic 
that existed in the mid-
1990s before Microsoft ``cut off its air supply.'' We agree that it 
makes good sense to resuscitate those market forces and let them work 
their magic.
