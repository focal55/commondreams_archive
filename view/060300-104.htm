R.C. Longworth of the Chicago Tribune blames the educational system for
younger Americans' belief that Social Security won't be around for them.
<p>I think it's simpler than that. The problem is that too many today rely on
radio and television's superficial news coverage. Take that incomplete
information, add to it the flood of misinformation generated daily by talk show
hosts around the country, and you wind up with a perception about Social
Security that is far, far from the truth.</p>
<p>As Longworth pointed out in a major piece on the nation's safety net for
older Americans, &quot;No matter what you hear: Social Security is not in
crisis. It has some problems but nothing that can't be solved with a little
tinkering. Root-and-branch reform is not needed. And while it's better to act
now, we really have 30 years to do this.''</p>
<p>Remember now, Longworth is a senior writer for the Chicago Trib, a paper not
exactly known for its liberal or Democratic leanings. Yet he is appalled at
George W. Bush's plan to &quot;reform'' the Social Security system by
privatizing some of the contributions.</p>
<p>&quot;(It's) an unneeded solution to a nonproblem, a reform that will only
make things worse, a rescue that could kill its victim,'' he wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;The real debate is not about Social Security itself but about the size
of benefits. Privatizers say retirees would be better off it we put Social
Security's money into the stock market. Anti-privatizers say this may be true
but it also may not be true and, at any rate, it's a gamble.</p>
<p>&quot;Do we really want to roll the dice with the national nest egg for the
elderly?'' he asked.</p>
<p>Precisely. Too many today view Social Security solely as a pension system. It
is so much more than that. It takes care of widowed mothers and their families.
It pays kids who have lost a parent a monthly benefit until they graduate from
college. It is insurance for the permanently disabled.</p>
<p>Take all that out of today's high-flying 401(k)s and then let's see just how
large the growth rate is.</p>
<p>Those like Bush who tout the market as somehow a savior for the system are
oblivious to history. There was a day in this country when millions of Americans
did rely on the market for their future. Most of them lost it all in the Great
Depression, winding up penniless in their old age.</p>
<p>There was also a day when older Americans lived in abject poverty, virtually
having to beg for food and shelter because they had no income. Our counties set
up &quot;homes'' to take care of the more destitute.</p>
<p>But then Franklin D. Roosevelt, with the help of several progressive
Wisconsinites, devised the Old Age and Survivors' Benefit plan -- Social
Security -- that turned that sorry chapter in our history completely around.</p>
<p>Today, thanks to the base of income that Social Security provides, our
parents and grandparents can live out their lives with dignity.</p>
<p>As Longworth wrote, &quot;We're talking about Social Security here, not
Social Maximum Return. And there's more to Social Security than the monthly
check, including a compact between generations and Americans' sense of
themselves as one nation, united by something more than the profit motive.''</p>
<p>George Bush's plan to take billions of Social Security dollars and invest
them in the market would be a tremendous boon to Wall Street and many of the
Texas governor's big-time contributors.</p>
<p>But what about the ordinary American people?</p>
