Despite all the emphasis on new media, photography has never lost the
power to move us. Some recent photo essays in major American magazines,
focusing on the poor and dispossessed, are efforts to break through
abstraction and indifference. They tell us a lot about the potential
impacts -- and common limitations -- of photojournalism.

	<p>The March 27 edition of Time devoted six pages to the haunting
black-and-white work of renowned photographer Sebastiao Salgado. Bleak
images evoke humanity struggling for survival and hope: Rwandans at refugee
camps, women holding pictures of men abducted from a Kurdish village in
Iraq, toddlers -- abandoned by destitute parents -- crawling at a care
center in urban Brazil.

	<p>Meanwhile, two other magazines showed that color photos can also be stark.
If we don't turn the pages too quickly, the pictures are heart-wrenching.
The New York Times Magazine published a March 19 cover story, "In the
Shadow of Wealth," featuring photographs of "the invisible poor" from the
East Coast to California. And the March issue of Life offered 10 vivid
photos of Americans living in poverty, from Manhattan to rural areas of the
Northeast, South and West.

	<p>The companion articles varied. The Times magazine examined how the
impoverished live outside the line-of-sight of affluent America. ("Our poor
are like people in Madagascar," writes James Fallows. "We feel bad for
them, but they live someplace else.") The story with Life's photos, titled
"The Uncounted," explored how 10 million Americans are likely to be missed
by the U.S. Census this year -- "men, women and children already on the low
end of an uneven playing field."

	<p>These photos are reminiscent of Dorothea Lange, whose Depression-era
pictures of gaunt Americans endure as great photographic art. Transcending
the historic moment, they resonate in the midst of today's extreme inequities.

	<p>By themselves, empathetic photos say plenty about what has happened. Yet
context is not automatic. The photographs provide glimpses of human
realities. We still need to learn more.

	<p>The Time magazine spread included two gripping photos of refugees from
Rwanda, but did not mention the U.N. Security Council's refusal to send in
peacekeeping troops to prevent the imminent mass slaughter in April 1994.
There was a photo of Kurdish women made bereft by the savagery of
U.S.-enemy Iraq, but no photo of Kurdish women made bereft by the savagery
of U.S.-ally Turkey.

	<p>Salgado's picture of forsaken little children, with the modern Sao Paulo
skyline behind them, is brilliant. The brief text underneath it noted that
in the Third World "farmers have been displaced by the transformation of
family agriculture into corporate agribusiness." There was a passing
reference to "the failure of policy and the market." Yet the context
afforded the photos was paltry. Readers might only guess at how the
insatiable amassing of wealth correlates to such destitution.

	<p>In the New York Times Magazine -- right after the end of the essay
accompanying pictures of poor people -- readers found a full-page ad
showcasing a very different sort of photo. An opulent jewel dangled from a
woman's neck, while big letters proclaimed: "FEAR OF LOSING should back off
and let JOY OF HAVING go about its business."

	<p>On the same day, similar messages pervaded Part 2 of the magazine --
"Men's Fashions of the Times" -- 108 pages of articles and advertisements
largely devoted to the theme announced on the cover: "We're so vain."

	<p>"Once the exclusive terrain of women, vanity now belongs to any man with a
pulse," declared the headline over the keynote piece by the magazine's
editor. "To be vain can be glorious." Consciously or not, the tag line
echoed a famous proclamation by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who gained
power in the late 1970s and soon warmed the hearts of elites everywhere
with a new Beijing motto: "To get rich is glorious."

	<p>Looking at American mass media, how do we reconcile the occasional tugs at
heartstrings and compassion with the ongoing appeals to vanity and
acquisitiveness? Analysts say that visual images, in print and on screen,
routinely overpower any words. Certainly the dominant images keep prodding,
needling and imploring us to want -- and figure out how to get -- more,
more, more.

	<p>Once in a while, in the media world, the eyes of the poor are peering at
us, captured through a photographer's lens. We can see them. But do we
really see them?
