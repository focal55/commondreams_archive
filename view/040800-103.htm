Back in the 50's Carol Burnett made her name as 

a nightclub performer 

with a song called "I 

Made a Fool of Myself 

Over John Foster Dulles." If the Al Gore campaign had a 

theme song for the past week it 

might well be "I Made a Fool of 

Myself Over Eli&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez." But 

even Mr. Gore's craven act of political child abuse may not match the 

marathon foolishness of George W. 

Bush's self-immolating grudge 

match with the gay Log Cabin Republicans.



<p>       "It's really comical, if not farcical, 

it's so ridiculous," says Robert 

Stears, the chairman of Log Cabin's 

board. It's not clear, though, that it'll 

 end happily. While the cold war being 

re-fought by proxy in Miami is increasingly ancient history as far as 

most Americans are concerned, Mr. 

Bush has stumbled into a lingering 

culture war that, while waning in 

much of the country, could well rage 

in the Republican Party through the 

convention and Election Day.



<p>      This particular battle in that war 

began in November when Tim Russert, mindful of Bob Dole's mean-spirited rejection of a Log Cabin donation 

during the '96 campaign, asked Mr. 

Bush on "Meet the Press" if he'd 

meet with the gay group, and the 

governor replied "probably not," saying it might be a "huge political, you 

know, nightmare for people." A few 

weeks later, when the question failed 

to go away, the Bush campaign rebuffed Log Cabin again, explaining 

that its candidate "didn't see the 

point" of meeting with groups "he 

disagrees with." But then Mr. Bush 

appeared at Bob Jones University -- 

and justified <I>that</I> meeting by saying 

"it is important" to bring his message 

"to people . . . I don't agree with." 



<p>      So if it's right to meet with racists 

and anti-Catholic bigots with whom he 

disagrees, why is it wrong to meet 

with gay Republicans? To answer 

that question, Mr. Bush and his emissaries have floated a series of other 

strategies, variously saying that the 

governor's initial statement on "Meet 

the Press" was "misinterpreted" and 

that his real beef against Log Cabin 

was that it had made a "commitment" to John McCain. In truth Log 

Cabin had made no such commitment 

at the time of the Russert interview -- 

it only raised money for the McCain 

campaign <I>after</I> being spurned by Mr. 

Bush  -- but even if it had, does that 

mean Mr. Bush won't meet with heterosexual McCain supporters either? 

Somehow I doubt it.   

<p>



<p>      At one point, on the eve of Super 

Tuesday in March, Mr. Bush even 

told The San Francisco Chronicle 

"yes, I would consider meeting with 

them" -- a statement widely publicized in other news media as a 

change of heart, though once the 

primaries had safely passed it was 

never acted upon. Next up is a some-of-my-best-sycophants-are-gay gambit: A covey of Bush supporters, 

among them some dissident Log 

Cabin members, is being rounded up 

for a meeting in Austin next week. 



<p> But this strategy, reminiscent of 

Mr. Bush's recruitment of fringe veteran activists to attack Mr. McCain 

during the South Carolina primary, 

 is backfiring already, by opening up 

another rowdy front in the internal 

G.O.P. war over homosexuality:  a 

noisy civil war among gay Republicans themselves. Mr. Stears draws 

the line clearly by saying that any 

Log Cabin meeting minus its leadership is "a sham" and speculates that 

the gay Republicans who turn up in 

Austin would be seeking jobs in a 

Bush administration and "a pat on 

the head." On Wednesday David 

Hanson, the head of Log Cabin California, wrote a letter to Mr. Bush 

spurning the meeting as "an effort to 

end the media story concerning Log 

Cabin Republicans" rather than a 

serious  attempt to "deal forthrightly" with gay civil rights issues. 



<p>      Who are these nightmarish Log 

Cabin leaders who instill such fear in 

the heart of George W. Bush? You'd 

think from all the noise they must be 

a G.O.P. auxiliary of Queer Nation. 

As it happens, Mr. Stears is the 45-year-old owner of a lobbying business in New Jersey, and Mr. Hanson 

is a 62-year-old retired pharmacist 

who's voted Republican "since the 

second term of Dwight Eisenhower." 

Richard Tafel, the executive director 

of Log Cabin, is an American Baptist 

minister who spent six years under 

the tutelage of the Harvard Divinity 

School eminence Peter Gomes, who 

preached the National Cathedral sermon for George Bush Sr. at his inaugural. We're not talking Rupert Everett here.



<p>      In his six years as Texas governor, 

George W. Bush has never met with 

the leaders of Texas Log Cabin either. 

Whatever fear is driving this aversion, it wasn't shared by his father, 

who invited a Log Cabin leader to a 

1990 White House signing of the Hate 

Crimes Statistics Act. And as the Dole 

campaign's contortions over Log Cabin became a metaphor for its mishaps 

in '96, George W. Bush's nonstop battle with his own party's major gay 

organization makes a self-styled 

"compassionate conservative" and 

"uniter not a divider" increasingly 

look like a hypocrite.



<p>      What the growing tiff with Log Cabin also reveals is just how out of touch 

Mr. Bush is with mainstream America in the new century. The governor 

is fond of citing Ronald Reagan's visit 

to Bob Jones as a precedent for his 

own, and in 1980, it's true, no one 

looked askance at the Reagan visit -- 

just as there would have been widespread shock if Mr. Reagan had met 

with Log Cabin (which dates back to 

1978). But we're not in 1980 anymore. 

In 2000, the Bob Jones visit was the 

shocker for most Americans; a gracious Log Cabin meeting would have 

been a routine one-paragraph news 

item (as Mr. McCain's meeting with 

the group was).   

<p>



<p>      Mr. Bush seems clueless about 

how fast American attitudes about 

homosexuality are evolving. Fresh 

Newsweek polling last month shows 

that more than three-quarters of the 

country thinks gay Americans deserve job and housing protection 

against discrimination. The magazine also reported that a majority 

believes that gay spouses deserve 

some legal benefits of marriage 

(such as health insurance) and that, 

for the first time, fewer than half of 

Americans label homosexuality a 

sin.   

While homophobia is hardly extinct, voters tend to punish politicians who stoke it. Anyone who 

thinks the murder of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming wasn't a contributing factor to the surprise downfall of 

religious-right Republicans in the '98 

election is kidding himself.



<p>      Gay-baiters  want to believe that 

the culture has brainwashed Americans into accepting gay people -- 

whether in the form of TV's "Will & 

Grace" or Hollywood's latest Best 

Picture, "American Beauty," in 

which the only "normal" couple is 

all-male. But this is another delusion. 

Exit polls in '96 show that 5 percent 

of voters identify themselves as gay, 

a figure roughly equal to the total 

number of Hispanics and approaching double the number of Jews. As 

more gay people are out, more 

Americans realize they have a sibling, child or parent who is gay, and 

that it's far from a "nightmare." 

This is a huge constituency, more 

crucial in a national election than 

any homophobes  the Texas governor 

has pandered to in and beyond South 

Carolina.



<p>      Mr. Bush doesn't seem to have 

heard the news. And even were he to 

declare a truce with Log Cabin tomorrow and invite its entire membership to the governor's mansion 

for a rodeo, such a meeting would 

still amount to empty symbolism and 

fail to quiet debate about the real 

substance of the issue -- his actual 

record. 



<p>      His positions on gay civil rights 

range from nonexistent to fudged to 

hostile. He opposes gay adoptions. He 

has said that as "a symbolic gesture 

of traditional values" he would veto 

any attempt by the Texas legislature 

to repeal medieval statutes that 

criminalize gay people for practicing 

sex in their own bedrooms. As for job 

protection for gays, Cal Thomas reported in his column for The Los 

Angeles Times syndicate last fall 

that Mr. Bush told a group of Christian conservatives "he would not 

'knowingly' appoint a practicing homosexual as an ambassador or department head, but neither would he 

dismiss anyone who was discovered 

to be a homosexual after being 

named to a position." Gee, how compassionate can you get?





<P>

So far in his campaign Mr. 

Bush has been dogged 

by queries about his 

drug history and his 

knowledge of foreign 

leaders. These questions seem to have faded away. But 

the questions that began five months 

ago with Log Cabin aren't about to 

let up; they're going to gather force 

and specificity, and become impossible to dodge. Far from concerning 

the candidate's nose or even his 

brain, they get to the crux of the very 

organ he has made the selling point 

of his campaign -- his heart.
