IN WHAT resembled a newspaper city room, except that it was really a conference
room at the Marriott Marquis in Manhattan, 22-year-old Annalisa Burgos labored
over a newspaper story she was writing the other day and told me why she wants
to be a journalist.
<P>
    "I like the interaction with everyday people, with the average worker and
stuff," Burgos said, adding that she also wants to contribute her experience as
an Asian American and to voice the experience of other Asian Americans. The
problem, she said, is that Asian Americans have been historically
misrepresented by the media.
<P>
    Burgos, an intern at The Dallas Morning News, is one of 16 aspiring
journalists in a newspaper workshop sponsored by the Asian American Journalists
Association, which is holding its convention in New York City this week.
<P>
    That news coverage of Asian Americans is frequently distorted is an opinion
shared by the veteran journalists of the AAJA, which has published a handbook
for reporters and editors called "All American: How to Cover Asian America."
Because I wanted to know how I ought to be covering Asian Americans, I got a
copy.
<P>
    You might think Asian Americans don't have much to complain about. From the
news reports most of us have read or watched on TV, you'd think no Asian
student ever scores below 750 on the SAT, that Asian immigrants are universally
successful entrepreneurs and that every Asian- American family can boast of a
musical or mathematical genius.
<P>
    In fact, although a lot of Asian Americans are prosperous, some national
groups suffer from high rates of poverty, unemployment and lack of education. A
1995 United Way study found that Cambodians living in Los Angeles had lower
median incomes and college graduation rates and higher levels of poverty and
unemployment than the city's African Americans.
<P>
    "We suffer from reporting that says we're either the first or the worst,"
says Catalina Camia, Washington correspondent for The Dallas Morning News and
president of the AAJA.
<P>
    The news stories are either about exemplary Asian Americans like Bill Lann
Lee, the first Asian American to serve as assistant attorney general for civil
rights in the Justice Department, or they're about the Asian Americans who were
involved in the Democrats' fund-raising scandals or alleged villains like Wen
Ho Lee, the Los Alamos physicist who stands accused of breaching national
security by downloading nuclear weapons secrets.
<P>
    Anthony Ramirez, a New York Times reporter and author of "How to Cover
Asian America," feels the coverage of the Wen Ho Lee story has been
particularly unbalanced. Most stories, he said, have failed to point out that
Taiwan, where Lee was born, is an anti-Communist country, yet he's accused of
spying for Communist China. "A lot of the coverage has focused on his being [an
ethnic] Chinese," says Anna- lisa Burgos. "Too much of the reporting has
focused on that instead of on the facts of the case."
    We journalists have come to expect that political correctness will be
strictly enforced in reporting about most racial groups. Yet ethnic slurs for
Asian Americans still slip into stories and headlines. So do cartoons depicting
buck-toothed Asians. When Rockefeller Center was sold to a Japanese firm some
years ago, you'd have thought Pearl Harbor had been bombed again, so loud was
the press outcry about selling an American icon to the Japanese.
<P>
    And while other ethnic groups are presumed to become Americanized over
time, Asian Americans are regarded as eternally foreign. When a reporter asks
an Asian American where she's from, Sacramento isn't a sufficient answer,
Ramirez said, even though she might be a third-generation American. The
reporter usually wants to know where the person is really from, say, China,
Korea or Taiwan. When Tara Lupinski defeated Michele Kwan for the Olympic gold
medal in figure skating, the headline on the MSNBC Web site read, "American
Beats Out Kwan," even though both young women are American.
<P>
    And for that matter, how many journalists really know what we're talking
about when we talk about Asia and Asians? How many of us could actually find
Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore on a map? AAJA's Camia says she
hopes the group's handbook will wind up on the desk of every news desk in
America. It's a reminder that we know a lot less about Asian Americans than we
think we do.
