It doesn't happen often that one stands in a truly historic moment, a
pivotal time in which things as they were will never be the same again.  I
felt that watching in 2000 the last act of 1989 -- the Yugoslavian people
storm the stronghold of Milosevic, the Parliament building -- and I feel
that tonight, October 8th, as we wait for Barak's 48 hour ultimatum to
expire.  Its surrealistic sitting at home in quiet West Jerusalem; we hear
on the news of street battles raging between the Palestinian neighborhood
of Shuafat and the north Jerusalem settlement of Pisgat Ze'ev, with the
army providing armed support for the Pisgat Ze'ev rioters.  But its Yom
Kippur night, so no TV; we have to rely on CNN or BBC to provide coverage
of what is happening a mile or two away.  We are also receiving reports of
attacks of mobs of Israeli Jews from Upper Nazareth on the Palestinian
neighborhoods of Nazareth proper -- with the police intervening in the side
of the Jews (one dead so far), as well as attacks on Arab villages (like
Kifl Harith, Dir Istiya, Salfit, Bidiya and other villages and near Ariel
and al-Azariya near Ma'aleh Adumim) by settlers.  What makes attacks by
settlers especially deadly is that they occur in Area C of the West Bank,
where the settlers have been heavily armed by the army (for their
"protection"), where the Palestinians are completely unarmed and have no
recourse to aid from the Palestinian Authority, and where the army wades in
on the side of the settlers.

<p>I have the feeling that whatever happens tomorrow night (Wednesday) or the
next day -- whether Israel opens an all-out assault on the Palestinians in
the Occupied Territories or whether international pressure forestalls it --
all the old frameworks, ideologies and relationships have been demolished.


<p>Both the Oslo peace process and the myth of a state that is both Jewish AND
democratic are gone.  I don't know what's going to replace them, and the
struggle and bloodshed is far from over, but the old frameworks are
shattered and can never be put together again.

<p>Although I fear for the loss of life looming before us, I take hope in that
the uprising on both sides of the "Green Line" will in the end give birth to
new possibilities for a just and viable peace between Israel and the
emerging Palestinian State, as well as a new overall post-Zionist
framework -- perhaps the eventual emergence of a bi-national state in all of
Palestine/Israel.  Many forces played a role in the sparking the uprising:
religious sentiments aroused by Sharon's provocation on the Temple
Mount/Haram, the feeling that only a Lebanon-style armed resistance will
lead to true independence, the Johnny-come-lately entry of the Palestinian
Authority, the pressures exerted on Arafat to accept an imposed settlement
before the end of Clinton's term of office, overwhelming feelings of
frustration, anger, deprivation and humiliation directed at the suffocating
Israeli Occupation.  The great underlying force, however, was and is, in my
opinion, the popular rejection by the Palestinian "Street" of the Oslo
process, and in particular the Camp David "solution" that would have led to
a bantustan-type state truncated with large Israeli settlements,
disconnected from Jerusalem and without meaningful sovereignty.

<p>Some of the same forces prompted the popular uprising of Palestinian
citizens of Israel ("Israeli Arabs," as they are called, their very
Palestinian identity denied them in the Israeli civil framework).  While
liberal commentators ascribe the protests that turned violent after lethal
police intervention as due to "frustrations" generated by long-standing
economic and social "deprivation," the fact is that despite their Israeli
citizenship, Palestinians in Israel live under a kind of occupation.  The
vast majority of their lands have been taken for Jewish kibbutzim, towns,
cities, "outposts" and even parks and forests.  Because 92% of the land in

<p>Israel is reserved by law exclusively for Jewish use, Israeli-Palestinians
live in crowded conditions without adequate infrastructures, some in dozens
of "unrecognized villages" receiving no urban services whatsoever.  They
constitute the high majority of the unemployed, suffer from sub-standard
education and, as "non-Jews," are excluded from virtually all work places
that offer some kind of upward mobility.  And they have been effectively
locked out of Israeli society.  The Israeli flag and national anthem contain
only Jewish symbols; official Israel policy is to "Judaize" parts of the
country with heavy Arab populations; and in a poll taken after the
confrontations of the past week 74% of Jewish Israelis consider Israeli
Arabs as "traitors" -- a figure reaching way beyond the usual "right-wing"
sectors of society.

<p>I fear much greater levels of violence in the coming weeks and months.
Israeli Jews have never allowed themselves to even consider alternatives to
an exclusively Jewish state, including large West Bank settlement and a
Jerusalem under effective Israeli sovereignty.  As Barak's ultimatum
indicates, and the widening pogroms against Palestinians both within Israel
and in the Occupied Territories portend, Israeli Jews are liable to react
like the Serbs when their reality changes abruptly.  I fear a resurgence of
an Israeli Jewish tribalism that will lash out violently at any attempt to
tamper with the status quo.  This explains why Israel's response to the
uprising been so ferocious.  Why has it employed much greater firepower on a
largely unarmed (or lightly armed) civilian population -- helicopter
gunships, tanks, anti-tank missiles, high-velocity arms, laser projectiles,
snipers, an especially damaging form of tear gas and more -- than it did
during the Intifada?

<p>The fact that the Palestinians had greater firepower themselves and had
clear targets (Netzarim settlement in Gaza, Joseph's Tomb in Nablus and
many others) explains this to a certain degree.  But a deeper answer has to
do more with asserting control than putting down an uprising.  The Intifada
demonstrated that outright occupation (or "administration" in Israeli terms)
was untenable, but it did not actually threaten that control.  The current
uprising constitutes a much more serious threat.  It rejects control
completely and insists on genuine sovereignty and viability.  As such it
challenges Israeli domination (or, as Barak would say, Israeli "security"),
and therefore has to be put down decisively.  Already in June the Israeli
Chief of Staff, Shaul Mofaz, was publicly threatening the use of tanks and
assault helicopters against Palestinians if they dared an uprising, or
unilaterally declared a state.  Demands that Arafat end the fighting and
"return to the negotiating table" thus have less to do with putting down the
violence (which Israel can do handily) and more with reasserting the Oslo
framework of control The events of the past ten days have irrevocably
altered the status quo.


<p>It falls to Israeli intellectuals to help formulate alternatives to
traditional Zionism, occupation and domination so as to offer alternatives
to the Israeli Jewish public.  As an Israeli I do not fear alternatives
such as a bi-national state, something that will permit everyone to live
wherever he or she wants in the entire Land of Israel/Palestine.  Israeli
society, culture and economy are strong enough to survive and even thrive
as an integral part of a larger political entity.  One of Israel's
visionaries, Aryeh Lova Eliav, even gave a name to this promising new
entity: ISFALUR (Israel-Syria-Falastin-Arabia-Lebanon-URdan/Jordan).  We
have a long way to go in the process of paradigm-change, political
negotiations, the construction of interim political frameworks and
reconciliation.  Violence will only delay this necessary process and make
it all that more difficult.  In these harrowing hours before Barak's
ultimatum expires, as Oslo lays in rubble and new negotiating frameworks
have still to emerge, I allow myself to be cautiously optimistic.
