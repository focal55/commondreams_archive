<p>The real benefit of being an opinion writer is to receive feedback from so many of you. I am convinced that 
most of the people who write or e-mail are genuinely struggling with the same issues that I am. We are, in fact, kindred spirits on a quest for the same truths.
<P>
     Many of my columns have dealt with racial matters. I believe that how well we handle this issue will determine the fate of this nation. Many of you have asserted that the real issue is whether or how fast African Americans will merge into the American mainstream.
<P>
     Wearing many African hats and talking about an African culture confuses some of you. You cannot understand why we would hold on to the culture of people who are in such bad shape, as Africans seem to be in. You readily, if not eagerly, point out poverty, tribal warfare and AIDS as proof that African culture is in shambles.
<P>
    Rarely does anyone who makes this argument mention the impact of the loss of millions of skilled people stolen from Africa and enslaved. Africa's loss was America's gain.
<P>
    Historians believe that over 100 million Africans died on the journey from Africa to the Americas. The slavers forced many of the tribes literally into hiding and totally disrupted Africans' ability to build stable societies for hundreds of years.
<P>
     If success in this country is defined as becoming financially wealthy or politically powerful, the process of getting there is clearly spelled out: You act like and are like those who have the things you want. If European Americans represent the pinnacle of that pyramid, then being like European Americans would seem like the logical thing to do.
<P>
     African Americans were on a quest for acceptance, and our white friends and allies have told us that black people will be respected if we prove ourselves "worthy of respect." We were never sure about who was judging our worthiness or what the criteria were for getting there. The one thing that was clear was that it required a deafening silence about things like racial bigotry. Because "why stir up things even more."
<P>
     We were told that people would resist change if we seemed to be trying to coerce them into doing it. So go easy and do the things that gain their trust and respect.
<P>
     Yet, history has clearly demonstrated that change in America rarely comes without a major upheaval. Without the Civil War, slavery could still be part of America; without the race riots, Jim Crow and lynching might still be a common part of the American landscape.
<P>
     America has never voted in monumental racial change. This kind of change has always been pushed by a small group of multiracial leaders who clearly saw how bad the alternative was. Special-interest groups are now using referendums and initiatives to overturn these rules of fair conduct and we have slowly drifted back toward racial hostility as a result.
<P>
     Change is even more difficult when America is going through a major economic upheaval. Right now, it's high-tech stocks that are driving a bullish stock market, merger mania, creating new and bigger corporations every day, and people becoming overnight millionaires.
<P>
    Greed is sexy. Those in the throes of the new American gold rush don't want to be slowed down with issues of racial fairness in high-tech hiring. Questions about access to capital for high-tech start-ups, real estate and stock purchases will only trip up the bull in the bull market.
<P>
    But this is also a time when we are the most vulnerable as a nation. We have subdued all the beasts without while ignoring the beast within. America is like Achilles, and race is Achilles' vulnerable heel. A major racial clash could be the arrow that brings down this powerful giant. Wealth and power often breed arrogance, and the child of arrogance is carelessness.
<P>
     Our status as the most powerful nation on the earth should be a celebration of what this nation has done because of the diversity of its population. But that's not the story we are telling. We are eliminating a discussion of diversity and more often than not we present the power of America as the success of white culture.
<P>
      The American cultural soup is a mixture of white, black, brown, red and yellow cultures. Take out any of these ingredients and a key piece of what makes this nation unique is missing.
<P>
     African Americans hold on to African culture because we know that it's a critical part of the soup. If America fails to recognize this, it fails to give us respect as a key component of this nation.
<P>
     The strength of America is its diversity. People from every point on the globe have thrown something in the pot. Everyone who tastes it should taste something familiar in the midst of things unfamiliar.
<P>
     It's that familiar taste that lets me know I had something to do with this meal. If the chef hat has African prints, just accept the fact that today, it's the turn of a person of African descent to stir the soup. Just hold out your bowl for another dip of American java. Do you recognize the taste?
<P>
