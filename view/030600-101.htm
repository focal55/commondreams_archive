<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->A few days ago I got a nice 
letter from the Social 
Security   Administration, telling me that I 
was entitled to some 
$1,600 a month, but 
that unfortunately  I couldn't receive it 
because I was still earning a lot of 
money. Last week I opened the newspaper to find that the House of Representatives has voted unanimously to 
have the money sent to me anyway. 
The Senate and the president, it appears, are quite prepared to approve 
this change. So in the course of this 
year I shall get government checks for 
about $20,000. About $8,000 of it will go 
for federal and state taxes, but I shall 
still have a net $1,000 extra a month 
that I never expected to have.

<p>  I do not feel entitled to that money. 
Like a lot of other Americans who are 
68, I am making a very good living. 
When I stop working I will get a pension that ensures that I still live perfectly comfortably. I would like Congress to use the Social Security taxes 
I've paid over the last 45 years to 
promote the general welfare.

<p>    That means leveling things out a bit, 
so that my fellow 68-year-olds who 
could not go to college, and could not 
get nice, highly paid, white-collar jobs 
like mine, will have a better chance at 
a reasonably comfortable old age. 
Congress could have sent the extra 
money it wants  to send me, and millions like me, to some of my fellow 
sexagenarians who do need it. These 
include all those arthritic 68-year-olds 
who are shelving groceries, or standing on their feet all day making 
change, for $7 a hour. They are doing 
this because their monthly Social Security payments will probably never 
rise above $1,000.

<p>   Members of Congress know perfectly well that the rich have been getting 
steadily richer and the poor poorer -- 
that Americans like me are getting a 
bigger and bigger share of the gross 
national product, whereas the people 
who clean the toilets in my office 
building are getting less and less of it. 
But this knowledge seems to have no 
influence on them whatever. They act 
as if promoting the general welfare 
meant promoting the interest of people who make more than $50,000 a 
year. As Nicholas von Hoffman has 
put it, we live under "government of 
the comfortable, by the comfortable 
and for the comfortable."

<p>   Once the boom stops, and the Silicon 
Valley bubble bursts, we can expect 
our elected representatives to take 
considerable pains to see that the 
comfortable remain comfortable, 
while letting the poor assume any 
burdens that must be borne. The man 
who puts in eight hours making sandwiches at a cafeteria on the Stanford 
campus, and another eight hours 
bringing glasses of ever fruitier cabernet and ever spicier chardonnay to 
us comfortably off folk in one of Palo 
Alto's better restaurants, will probably lose his second job, because many 
of the professionals in Silicon Valley 
will start drinking jug wine at home. 

<p> This will probably mean that this 
man cannot move his kids into a 
school district where they might learn 
something, and that they will never 
get properly educated. Our elected 
representatives can be expected to 
look with equanimity on this steady 
reinforcement of our present system 
of hereditary castes. 

<p>     President Clinton has said that he 
will sign the legislation that gives me 
that extra $1,000 a month. He should 
think again. He is a decent and generous-spirited man, whose attempts to 
do the right thing have been frustrated 
by Republican majorities in Congress. 
But he could use his last year in office 
to speak out. With the backing of Vice 
President Al Gore and former Senator 
Bill Bradley, he could ask Congress to 
take the  bill back and make it a little 
less absurd -- a little more fair, a little 
less selfish.

<p>     Our president has been good at political compromises, but unless he 
takes a few uncompromising stands 
before leaving office he will go down in 
history as having acquiesced in our 
nation's moral decline. This decline 
has nothing to do with our sexual 
mores. It has everything to do with our 
increasing willingness to let the rich 
take more and more from the poor.
