            A lot of tired men are about to creep back into power in America. 
            "President" Bush is a local Texas boy; for the big picture he relies 
            on his father's people, in economics as much as in foreign policy. 
            I met quite a few of these yesterday's men (almost all males) when 
            they were out of office in the 1990s, passing the years of idleness 
            at policy conferences on the virtues of private enterprise. They are 
            an unimpressive lot. 
            <P>They didn't get the new e-economy, neither how it worked nor what 
              its dangers were. When the rich in America were raking money in 
              and the markets booming, Dad's people continued to harp on the need 
              for tax cuts to stimulate investment. When the treasury secretary, 
              Robert Rubin, began to pay down the national debt (with the help 
              of Dad's one distinguished appointee to office, Alan Greenspan), 
              they cried foul; Democrats are supposed to be reckless spenders. 
            <P>That businessmen, or business-minded people, are efficient and 
              hard-headed in government is an outdated illusion. Compare Gordon 
              Brown to the Conservative chancellors who came before him. He is 
              infinitely more prudent and cunning - and tight-fisted, doling out 
              goodies on social services only after the money had piled up in 
              the Treasury kitty. You might not like the delay (I don't), but 
              you understand it; a finance minister is meant to keep order rather 
              than, like Norman Lamont, cry "I am in pain!" and reel from every 
              economic blow. 
            <P>Brown's American counterpart, Robert Rubin, was every bit as prudent 
              and tight-fisted - and as clever. Unlike his Republican predecessors, 
              who frequently lost control of the business cycle while steadily 
              piling up a huge national debt, Rubin had no single economic policy; 
              he had lots of policies, for whatever the moment required. There 
              were several moments in the last administration when the economy 
              faced a downturn; Rubin helped prevent them by adroit fiscal manoeuvring. 
            <P> Why do conservative businessmen make bad politicians? Why, when 
              they gain power, do they suddenly seem to lose their grasp of reality, 
              clinging to simple nostrums like "Cut taxes!", bewildered by how 
              to spend public money? 
            <P>I kept going to policy seminars with Republican-era businessmen 
              because they were something of an enigma. Get them talking about 
              how to sell soap or insurance and suddenly the years fell away, 
              they were full of energy and interesting ideas; I've the same sense 
              of energy listening to aged doyens of the CBI in Britain. But speak 
              the words "public" or "social" and the metal shutters of the mind 
              come clattering down, shutters on which the graffiti "free market" 
              and "lower taxes" have been sprayed. 
            <P>The shuttered mind simply refuses to accept the positive side of 
              the public economy. It cannot, in particular, accept the welfare 
              state as a more efficient way to do the public's business, in medicine, 
              transport, and housing, than ways based on selling soap. In the 
              Reagan-Bush years, whenever these businessmen-politicians were confronted 
              by unpalatable facts, they engaged in denial - or, in one egregious 
              instance, tried to pretty-up unemployment figures by changing how 
              the Department of Labour did its sums. 
            <P>Blinded by their own belief in the superiority of business, guided 
              by simplistic cliches, public servants drawn from the private realm 
              tend to be bad servants of the public. Yet with a wave of the fairy's 
              electoral wand in Florida, Dad's tired men will become the global 
              economy's new masters. Their reappearance is particularly chilling 
              because global capitalism looks set for another hard landing. 
            <P>The big boom of the 1990s was largely fuelled by the technological 
              revolution and a worldwide demand for consumer goods. Technology 
              is now in a post-revolutionary phase and consumer demand is no longer 
              pent up. In the States, both inflation and labour costs are rising. 
              The bond markets have become credit averse and the stock markets 
              are down, particularly the new-economy Nasdaq market. It is not 
              a pretty picture, but it needn't spell disaster. The landing needs 
              to be managed. For that, however, you need good managers. And good 
              managers, in office, need to believe in government. 
            <P>British friends assure me that Thatcherism is dead - though at 
              10 Downing Street there seem surviving signs of it, if not at No 
              11. But the fact that the British and American economies have become 
              so interlocked is the real issue. During the big boom, British investment 
              poured into America, as it did from the Netherlands and Germany; 
              conversely, American management flowed into Europe. 
            <P>The return of these blind, tired men to Washington is therefore 
              no foreign spectacle. As diplomats, they aim to "coddle" Europe 
              less; but in their own country, as businessmen in government, their 
              incompetence will soon enough become our problem.
