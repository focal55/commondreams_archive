It started with a little toothache. When the dentist took out the old filling and put in the new, my daughter became ill. Infection invaded her bone. Three procedures, two specialists, one evening in the ER and nine days of antibiotics later, my child is still far from well.<p>
I&#0039;m ready to curl up and cry. For my daughter&#0039;s sake, of course. For her pain. But also for me - because even though my husband is beyond supportive, and even though self-employment lets me schedule my work around my child, I&#0039;m mentally and emotionally drained. I have nothing left to give.<p>
But life doesn&#0039;t stop for illness. I have another, healthy child who wants to go to dance lessons. I have dinners to cook. Dishes to wash. And a host of dental and medical specialists who each need to hear the entire story from the beginning. <p>
Good thing I&#0039;m not traditionally employed. If I were, I&#0039;d be unemployed by now. And I wonder how single parents manage when the demands of the workplace conflict with the needs at home. I&#0039;m torn in two, and I have all the advantages. How do you manage when you have to make every decision alone?<p>
I asked a friend, fully expecting to hear a tale of shared child care, of loving relatives who assume at least some of the burden, of good friends who listen and help when they can.<p>
&quot;Actually,&quot; she said, &quot;I had a bit of a meltdown last night.&quot;<p>
She does it all alone. She runs her business during the day, cares for her toddler at night, and that is her life. Work. Baby. Work. Baby. The rhythm never varies. Until she melts down. <p>
My friend is a victim of a uniquely American myth: the Myth of Independence. In this bizarre and utterly unrealistic ideology, we are separate. Completely. I am me. You are you. Any connections we may form are transient, temporary, easily broken. I&#0039;ll work for you as long as we&#0039;re both pleased with the relationship. But should one of us become dissatisfied, then I&#0039;ll find another job, you&#0039;ll find another employee, and everyone will be happy.<p>
We take this approach to our hobbies, our churches, even to the people we marry. We enter every relationship secure in the knowledge that it can always end. We call this &quot;independence,&quot; a kind of &quot;freedom.&quot; Yet still we feel burdened, chained.<p>
Why? Because the independence of individuals is a very bad thing.<p>
Independence works for nations. It works because a nation is not one lone entity but rather a collection of separate parts. United, we form a community that can function as one. Independence is born of unity.<p>
But you and I are not collections of separate parts. We&#0039;re just one part. And just as we wouldn&#0039;t expect much from a steering wheel divorced from its car, so we cannot reasonably expect much from ourselves in isolation.<p>
Our fierce misinterpretation of independence has bought us a society in the process of meltdown. It has endowed us with the knowledge that we can&#0039;t afford to curl up and cry. That there&#0039;s no one to take our place.<p>
This isn&#0039;t independence. <p>
It&#0039;s insanity.<p>
