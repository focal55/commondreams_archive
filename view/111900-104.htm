My hands were visibly trembling when I handed my passport to the border guard. Standing close by was an armed Iraqi soldier. The last time I had seen Iraqi guns they were pointed directly at me; some of them had even been fired. 
<P>When I told my friends I was returning to Baghdad after 10 years they all said I was mad. Why would I want to return to the place where I was abused, humiliated and nearly died? As I waited at the Iraqi border, I asked myself the same questions. My journey had begun a few months before with an idea to make a film for the BBC as the tenth anniversary of the Gulf War approached. It had been an exciting proposition.  
<P>I knew from colleagues in the RAF patrolling the no-fly zone that Britain and America were still bombing Iraq on a regular basis. This undeclared war goes largely unreported by the media, something which I find truly disturbing. More importantly, I wanted to meet real Iraqis and see how the war and subsequent years of sanctions had affected the 'man in the street'.  
<P>Sanctions meant that I could not fly into Baghdad; the only way in is via Jordan and a 15-hour car journey. Sanctions also control the sale of Iraqi oil, a fact which seems to have escaped the Iraqis   themselves as the only other vehicles on the road were oil tankers. Completely ignoring the restrictions, thousands of them plied the route between the Iraqi oilfields and ports in Syria and Jordan.  
<P>Sanctions were imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War in an effort to force the regime into surrendering its weapons of mass destruction (WMD). United Nations inspectors were also put in place with a brief to find and destroy any undeclared weapons. As I entered Baghdad, I drove past the UN compound - it was deserted. The inspectors were evicted from Iraq during Operation Desert Fox, the three-day bombing campaign in December 1998. At the end of that operation, we were told that 'Saddam had been put back in his cage'. That may have been so, but he was in his cage with his people and his weapons and we had drawn curtains tightly around the bars. Despite our overwhelming technological superiority, without UN weapons inspectors on the ground, we have no real idea what is going on in the darkest corners of Iraq.  
<P>In many ways, Britain and America have painted themselves into a corner, which really is the nub of the Iraqi problem. Sanctions, weapons inspectors and the no-fly zones are all inexorably linked. Until the UN is allowed to return and verify that all WMD have been destroyed, sanctions must stay in place, argue Britain and America. Iraq denies that it has any WMD and refuses to accept inspectors. But sanctions are having little effect on the regime; the only people suffering are the poorest. In a truly ludicrous state of affairs, even pencils come under the items banned by the sanctions.   
<P>And the no-fly zones are in disarray. They were set up to protect from Iraqi repression the marsh Arabs in southern Iraq and the Kurds in the north. But, in an obscene piece of hypocrisy, we allow one of our Nato allies to bomb the very group we claim to protect.  
<P>Aircraft patrolling the northern no-fly zone are based in Turkey and our pilots put their lives in danger on a daily basis to fly into Iraq and ensure that the Iraqi military is prevented from attacking the Kurds. However, Turkey itself is also fighting a war with the Kurds, who want an independent homeland. On a regular basis, the Turkish authorities ground our aircraft so that their own air force can attack the very Kurds that the RAF was protecting a few hours before. After the Turkish jets land, our own pilots get airborne to resume their mission over the still smoking craters.  
<P>British and American policy is a shambles. And it is only Britain and America that maintain the current position. Over the last few months, an increasing number of countries have flouted the ban on air travel and have made symbolic flights to Baghdad. At the recent Baghdad trade fair, European nations were falling over themselves to ensure they would profit if sanctions are lifted. None of our old allies takes part in the regular attacks launched into the no-fly zone. Indeed, even Iraq has decided to ignore the restrictions and has recently begun internal domestic flights around the country.  
<P>After 10 years, the time has   come to admit that the current state of affairs is not working and to review the situation. The great problem is that there appears to be no means of ending the dispute.  
<P>What conditions must be met for the no-fly zones to be removed? No one seems to know any more. How long can sanctions remain in place? Again, no answer.  
<P>No one can deny that parts of the Iraqi regime are repressive and evil. But we manage to deal with other similar regimes on a daily basis. After 10 years, sanctions have failed to produce the required result. It is time they were lifted. Perhaps the removal of sanctions can be linked to a return of some sort of independent weapons inspection team. Whatever the options are, they have to be better than the current stalemate.  
<P>As I travelled around Iraq, I was struck by how friendly and personable the people were. At an Iraqi airbase, I was given lunch by an Iraqi air force colonel who might have tried to shoot me out of the sky 10 years ago. It seemed strange to sit with my former enemy and to talk about the realities of war. But we both agreed on one thing - there was little that the military could do to solve the current situation. Only our respective leaders could do that. It must be an unpalatable thought for our politicians, but perhaps the time has come for them to talk to their former adversaries. 
<P><i>&#149; John Nichol and John Peters were captured when their RAF Tornado was hit by a missile over Iraq during the Gulf war early in 1991. Both men were tortured and forced to appear on Iraqi TV to denounce the war. John Nichol's latest book,  Decisive Measures , is published by Hodder & Stoughton at £16.99.
