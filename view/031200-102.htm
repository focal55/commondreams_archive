<p>ON MARCH 8, millions of women celebrated International Women's Day. Millions more didn't even notice. They were struggling for survival -- as they do every day. One life and death issue is childbirth. The World Health Organization estimates that half a million women die and 8 million are disabled each year during pregnancy or childbirth.
<p><COCO_LEAD>
</COCO_LEAD>In Mozambique 1,500 of every 100,000 women die during pregnancy or childbirth, according to Pathfinder International, a U.S.-based organization that promotes women's health around the world.
<P>

 
Millions of women do not have reproductive freedom. In China, women undergo forced abortions. In the 1990s, more than 100,000 women in developing countries were subject to chemical sterilization with pellets containing quinacrine. The World Health Organization says quinacrine may cause cancer.
<P>

 
In northeast Brazil, 43 percent of women resort to female sterilization as a contraceptive method. These women have to take drastic steps to exercise their reproductive rights because more reversible methods aren't available to them.
<P>

 
In some countries, like in Chile, abortion is illegal under all circumstances. And close to 80,000 women die each year from unsafe abortions, according to the World Health Organization.
<P>

 
Poverty is a global women's issue. The AFL-CIO estimates that women constitute 70 percent of the 1 billion people living in poverty in the world today.
<P>

 
As more women are displaced by rampant poverty, the trafficking and prostitution of girls and women is escalating. Japan is now home to more than 100,000 Thai and Filipino sex workers. Activists estimate that there are at least 1 million women and girls working in Thailand's sex trade. Colombia's Department of National Security estimates that 50,000 Colombian women are dispersed throughout European and Asian sex markets.
<P>

 
And all over the world, women face terrible situations of domestic abuse and sexual violence. According to the World Health Organization, one in five women in the world is physically or sexually abused in her lifetime. Violence against women is as serious a cause of death and disability as cancer, and causes more ill health than traffic accidents and malaria combined, according to the World Bank.
<P>

 
In parts of the Islamic world, such as Kuwait, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, women are regarded as second-class citizens. Religious texts are invoked to deny women equal rights and to enforce strict laws against divorce, adultery, education and employment. An Islamic court in the United Arab Emirates recently ordered a pregnant Indonesian domestic worker to be stoned to death for adultery.
<P>

 
Women in the industrialized world face many obstacles to equality, as well. A survey by the Foreign Press Center, a nonprofit foundation that supports foreign journalists in Japan, showed that 35 percent of Japanese women who responded felt that sexual harassment at work was one of the major problems they faced. Another 47 percent said they were subject to discriminatory treatment at work.
<P>

 
Women in the United States still earn, on average, 75 percent of men's pay, according to the AFL-CIO. And the United States is one of very few countries that does not have a national policy mandating paid maternity leave.
<P>

 
There are spots of hope. Just last week, women in Egypt won the right to divorce their husbands. India now has national laws in place that reserve a third of the village council seats and village chief positions for women.
<P>

 
But the picture is still dire. We must face our collective failure in protecting and uplifting women.
<P>

 
This June, at a special session of the United Nations titled "Beijing  3/85," participating nations will show the world exactly how they've improved women's lives since the 1995 women's conference in Beijing. At that conference, the Beijing delegates concluded that a change in "values, attitudes, practices and priorities at all levels" was necessary.
<P>

 
We have a lot of work yet to do.
<P>
