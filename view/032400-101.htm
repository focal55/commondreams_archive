A gigantic monarch butterfly wearing a gas mask could stalk the Back Bay this
weekend -- and it may not be the weirdest sight in the neighborhood. That honor
could go to an unholy union between a fish and a tomato that will be protesting
in Copley Square on Sunday afternoon.
<p>
Sounds goofy, and it is goofy. But whoever is inside these and similar costumes
will bear a serious message: the genetic engineering of food crops is dangerous
stuff. This Friday marks the opening of Biodevastation 2000, a week of
educational forums, protests, and street theater by activists concerned with
the ethical, environmental, and public-health implications of this emerging
technology.<p>
Biodevastation is meant largely as a response to the annual conference of the
Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), which opens this weekend at the
Hynes Convention Center. The BIO conference, the industry's premier event,
draws thousands of scientists and industry officials to discuss various
dimensions of the growing industry, with seminars on topics that include
financing, research, and regulation. Senator Ted Kennedy will be there. So will
Christopher Reeve.<p>
Biodevastation 2000, meanwhile, will open with a "counter-conference" March 24
at Northeastern University and will meet the industry conference head-on two
days later, with a Copley Square rally and a parade to the Hynes. Organizers
hope to draw 1000 people for the conference, and more for the rally and other
events throughout the week. Organizers include Northeast Resistance Against
Genetic Engineering, MassPIRG, and the Toxics Action Center.<p>
Biodevastation activists want decisions about biotech to be more democratic.
Their demands include ending commerce in genetically engineered products;
holding corporations liable for any "negative consequences" of genetically
engineered products already on the market; abolishing ownership of life forms,
including the patenting of seeds, genes, animals, plants, and cell lines; strengthening
public regulation of "potentially dangerous technologies"; and ending
"corporate control of food and health" through institutions such as the World
Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization.<p>
The Biodevastation protest may be one of the bigger demonstrations that Boston
has seen in years,<b> </b>excepting, of course, some of the larger annual
events such as the gay and lesbian pride march and the hemp rally.<b> </b>The
week's demonstrations will probably involve the "direct action" techniques --
like hanging banners from buildings -- that were visible at last year's
demonstrations against the World Trade Organization in Seattle. Activists are
also training in nonviolent civil disobedience, so arrests are a possibility.
<p>
It's not clear how many people will show up at Biodevastation, but organizers
do think they're tapping into growing public awareness. The issue of
engineering food "has just exploded in the last couple of months," says Heather
Albert-Knopp, one of the event's planners. And that may affect
turnout.<b></b>
<p>
Police are taking the event seriously. A few weeks ago, editors and
reporters were invited to a press conference and lunch at Boston Police
Department headquarters to listen to the police explain their preparations for
Biodevastation. Police officials say they want to be ready for the
direct-action techniques that demonstrators used in Seattle. "The type of
tactics used there were tactics I don't think that law enforcement has seen in
this country," says Boston Police Commissioner Paul Evans.
<p>
Police have pledged to respect protesters' First Amendment rights and will show
tolerance for nonviolent civil disobedience. "If we can avoid confrontation, we
do avoid confrontation," Evans says. But they seem to be readying themselves
for it. Police have asked the publishers of newspapers including the
<i>Boston</i> <i>Phoenix</i>, the <i>Boston Globe</i>, and the <i>Boston
Herald</i> to remove newspaper boxes from Back Bay and parts of downtown in
anticipation of the event. "They could be used for anything -- to tip over, to
stand on, to smash windows," says police spokesperson Kevin Jones, who adds
that police also asked companies to remove the boxes for the most recent First
Night celebration and the Boston Marathon.<b></b>
<p>
<b></b>Although organizers aren't trying to control the protests' scope from
the top down, they've called for an event free from violence, drugs, alcohol,
and property destruction. "We are not here to disrupt the lives or property of
the people of Boston," says Albert-Knopp, an organizer with Vermont's Institute
for Social Ecology. "We have told people we are here to highlight the issues,
and any actions undertaken should highlight the unethical practices of the
industry."
<p>

Biotechnology is a powerful science that, among other things, allows
researchers to manipulate genetic structures -- the essence of life. It's also
a big and growing business, boasting more than $18&nbsp;billion in revenues
last year (up from $10&nbsp;billion five years earlier). All told, almost
$100&nbsp;billion is tied up in the industry. The Boston area, with firms such
as Genzyme and Biogen, is a major hub.
<p>
Although medical biotechnology is the field's largest sector, it's the
agricultural applications that are most controversial right now. Proponents see
particular promise in that area; they pledge that science can lead to greater
crop yields, less pesticide use, and, eventually, more-
nutritious foods.
Basically, genetic engineering in agriculture means deliberately crossing
genetic barriers in order to produce a desired trait. It's taken hold and grown
in the past half-decade. Last year, farmers worldwide -- though mostly in the
US and Canada -- planted more than 90&nbsp;million acres of genetically
modified crops, up from about eight million in 1996, according to the Consumers
Union.
<p>
Already, much of the soybean and corn grown in the United States is planted
with seeds from Monsanto and other firms that are heavily involved in biotech.
Last year almost half the US corn crop and about 37&nbsp;percent of the US
soybean crop were genetically modified. Much of that produce is used for animal
feed, but odds are you've eaten genetically modified plants yourself.
Tortillas, cereals, and soy burgers are just some of the foods that already
contain them.
<p>Activists call genetically engineered foods a radical break with the past, and
they say the technology is creating new and poorly understood threats to public
and environmental health. They warn that crops engineered to contain
pest-killing toxins will inevitably spread their genes to other plants through
insect pollination -- and kill unintended, or "non-target," species.
<p>
Critics also fear that creating herbicide-resistant crops could end up
encouraging farmers to use more herbicide on the weeds found in their fields.
And if that genetic material finds its way into weeds, activists warn, it could
yield new strains of "superweeds." What's more, skeptics worry that genetic
engineering could affect human health by subjecting people to allergens not
found in unmodified foods.
<p>
"We want to launch a public-awareness campaign to get this issue into the
mainstream so people can understand they have been eating these things for five
years .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they have potential risks that could dismantle entire
ecosystems," says Mark Pelletier, an organizer of Biodevastation.
<p>
The concerns are dribbling beyond the realm of theory, too. Last year, Cornell
University scientists showed that pollen from corn genetically engineered to
produce a toxin called Bt -- which kills corn borers -- kills monarch-butterfly
caterpillars as well. For activists, the Bt study is the proverbial canary in
the coal mine, evidence that genetically modified foods may ultimately harm
more than just the intended pests.
<p>
"There are major uncertainties that are inherent in the science of genetic
engineering," says Jessica Hayes, another Biodevastation planner. "We don't
know the long-term effects, and we don't know the short-term effects, and that
study really revealed that."
<p>
Resistance to genetically engineered foods has been a huge issue in Europe,
where the European Union requires such products to be labeled. Protesters have
destroyed crops, and consumers have largely rejected modified foods. But most
Americans don't even know they're eating them. The US Food and Drug
Administration doesn't require labeling, and the industry wants to keep it that
way, fearing the same rejection faced overseas.
<p>
Activists, of course, are hoping for the opposite. And concern over genetically
modified foods is becoming bigger news in the United States, though the issue
hardly rivals gun control or health care. Grassroots groups have increased
their activity, newspapers and magazines have begun writing more about the
issue, and a recent <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article showed that some
high-end restaurants are rebelling -- the paper reported that Alice Waters,
owner of Berkeley's Chez Panisse, won't use genetically modified foods.
<p>
"There's been .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. more interest from the press, consumers, and
government officials in what's going on, largely because Europe has said no to
our [country's] food," says Rebecca Goldburg, a biologist with Environmental
Defense. "It makes consumers question if this food is good for them."
<p>
Already, several American food companies, including Gerber and Heinz, have said
"Thanks, but no thanks" to genetically modified foods for some products.
Congress, too, is emerging as a staging ground for the fight over what's for
dinner. Both Senator Barbara Boxer of California and Representative Dennis
Kucinich of Ohio have introduced legislation that would require labeling of
genetically modified foods, and Kucinich is also sponsoring a bill to increase
FDA testing of modified foods. "The bills .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are a strong vehicle
for introducing the issue in the United States, for heightening awareness, for
developing support for labeling and safety standards," he says.
<p>

Facing an American backlash, supporters of genetically modified crops have done
what many industries do to win public and media support: they've formed a front
group. The Alliance for Better Foods sprang up last fall as part of the
campaign by certain food-industry groups to help ensure that what happened in
Europe doesn't happen here. The group is run out of the Washington, DC, offices
of public-relations powerhouse BSMG Worldwide, the same firm that represents
the BIO.
<p>
And there's more to come. According to <i>O'Dwyer's Washington Report</i>, a
newsletter that tracks the PR and lobbying industry, several biotech companies,
including Monsanto and Novartis, are about to launch a $50&nbsp;million drive
touting genetically modified foods. "One of the [industry's] biggest fears is
that the issue is actually going to become even 20&nbsp;percent as big [here]
as it is in Europe," says Kevin McCauley, the newsletter's editor.
<p>
Profit may motivate the push for better public relations, but the industry's
boosters also say that activists' fears are misinformed and misleading. While
activists talk of "superweeds" and allergens, proponents say that biotechnology
can increase crop yields and make foods more nutritious. And engineering crops
to incorporate certain toxins, they say, would allow plants to repel pests so
that farmers could use fewer pesticides -- an environmental plus.
<p>
"The upside is that this is a valuable tool that will enable us to feed
billions of people the demographers tell us will be in the world in 50 years,"
says Gene Grabowski, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America. "It
also offers the promise in both the developing and the developed world for
greater variations of food and greater nutrition."
<p>
"I think it is fair to say the industry needs to do more to educate the public
and the ordinary consumer," adds Carl Feldbaum, the BIO's president. "Frankly,
a lot of the criticisms leveled against the agricultural applications are just
plain misinformed." And, he says, the industry is hardly blind to the power of
the science it promotes. "Everyone is concerned that there not be any negative
impact on environmental health or human safety," he says.
<p>
But the Biodevastation organizers aren't buying it. Some will call for stronger
government oversight; others will call for an outright ban on genetically
modified foods. And though the future of food is probably the largest concern
-- and certainly the hottest issue right now -- Biodevastation organizers are
also driven by long-standing fears about abuses of the genetic knowledge
scientists already possess. Organizers are concerned with the ethics of gene
manipulation, the prospect of using genetic knowledge for eugenic ends, and the
dangers present in medical applications, such as transplanting animal organs
into humans.
<p>
All told, when Biodevastation is over, activists hope that the industry and the
public will be looking at their concerns as carefully as the police are
examining their plans for the upcoming week. "That's why we are doing all
this," says Albert-Knopp. "To raise the level of public awareness and debate,
to let the biotech industry know there is opposition, and to let the public
understand why the opposition exists. That's critical."
