I wrote this the night after Election Day so I don't have the luxury of knowing who will be the next president of the United States. My guess is that it'll be George W. Bush.<BR>
<br>
Either way, just like Ralph Nader said, there's a number of important issues where you'd have a helluva time trying to distinguish between Bush and Al Gore. When it comes to what Eisenhower called "the military industrial complex," debating the differences between Gore and Bush is as cosmically significant as deciding which religious cult leader was closer to the truth - Jim Jones or David Koresh?<BR>
<br>
They're running to "the center," I'm told. Why? Because that's where "the American people" are, <IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>according to conventional wisdom. But you know what they say about conventional wisdom. Anyway, I think the important question is: Running to the center of what?<BR>
<br>
In 1994, Newt Gingrich and his fellow Contractors zigged the electorate toward the Right. Two years later, Clinton and Gore had managed to zag it back toward this "center" - the New Democratic center. Then comes Bush with his "compassionate conservatism" - just a zig to the Right.<BR>
<br>
Gore said he would like to see military spending increase by $100 billion over the next 10 years. Bush's plan calls for a mere increase of $45 million, or something close to that. Neither figures are really worth remembering because, as I hinted a few paragraphs ago, new Democrats and compassionate conservatives are quibbling over deadly divisions within the same ideological framework - a pathway that leads to death and destruction, at least for the world's most vulnerable, all in the name of freedom and peace, of course.<BR>
<br>
Now that the Cold War is over, the Pentagon is buying fewer new weapons than it did 10 years ago. This leads to an excess of defense industry capacity. Why? Because weapons manufacturers have been fighting successfully to keep Cold War-era production lines open, selling the excess weapons abroad.<BR>
<br>
Between 1990 and 1995, our leaders exported $7 billion of surplus arms. Secretary of State Madeliene Albright commented on this phenomenon in a 1996 edition of the New York Times Magazine. "The trading of arms is disgusting and contributes to horrors around the world. With the breakup of the Soviet Union, it's a bazaar out there," she said.<BR>
<br>
What she didn't say was that 90 percent of the world arms shipments are exported by the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - the permanent five members of the U.N. Security Council; not "rogue nations" or "hostile enemies."<BR>
<br>
In 1994, then-Secretary of Defense William Perry made a trip to Beijing to represent the United States at the first meeting of the no-longer-existing U.S.-Sino Defense Conversion Commission. The commission's mission was to help Chinese arms manufacturers switch to the production of commercial goods. Perry explained the U.S. interest in this endeavor.<BR>
<br>
"It is to our benefit to help these countries (China, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia) to resist the pressure to make weapons even beyond their needs," he said. "And secondly, to resist the pressure for foreign arms sales. One very obvious way of using the excess capacity in the arms industry in each of these countries is to continue to produce the same amount but then to sell the excess to other countries."<BR>
<br>
This, Perry continued, creates "its own set of policy and security issues. So to the extent we can be useful and constructive in diverting this pressure into the production of commercial goods, then I believe it is a security benefit."   <BR>
<br>
Months later, in February 1995, Perry's insight was deemed irrelevant in drafting the Clinton administration's new conventional arms transfer policy. In fact, this do-as-we-say-not-as-we-do policy says explicitly that one of its major purposes is to preserve the U.S. arms industrial base.<BR>
<br>
So, under the pretense of staying competitive in a military-technology race with no apparent competitor, some of the most sophisticated weapons in the world are being exported. Arms sales by the United States and its allies supply the military threats that we're so worried about.<BR>
<br>
Recall that Lockheed's lobbying efforts for the F-22 "Stealth" fighters were predicated on the proliferation of U.S.-manufactured F-15Es, F-16C/Ds and F/A-18s.<BR>
<br>
Guess where Lockheed makes its F-16 "Fighting Falcon"? Forth Worth, Texas - Bush's backyard. It's a popular product among foreign militaries. As of Sept. 30, 1997, according to the Federation of American Scientists Arms Sales Monitoring Project, 1,700 F-16s had been sold to 19 countries, including Belgium, Denmark, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, South Korea, Morocco, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela.<BR>
<br>
So while pundits debate the efficacy of the electoral college, I'm concerned about the fact that both major choices presented to the electoral college would like to see the arms bazaar continue to boom well into our future.<BR>
