Unlike the bland and boring debates that marked this last week, the
discussions between friends and family about whether to vote for Gore or
Nader continue at an intense level.  For those still frightened by the
possibility of a victory for Bush and the right-wing goblins and ghouls
gathered around his campaign, not to vote for Gore, especially in states
where the race is tight, is tantamount to treason to progressive
causes.  For supporters of Nader, Gore and the Democrats have betrayed
those causes so many times that not voting for Nader is tantamount to
enabling an abusive spouse.
<p>Although I have made an unshakable commitment to the Green Party
and the Nader/LaDuke ticket, my three daughters reflect, I believe, the
variety of positions adopted by those wrestling with the impact of the
Nader campaign.  To review each of their situations and their
perspectives may shed some light on the divisions that underscore the
Gore/Nader dilemma.
<p>My oldest daughter, Molly, resides in Michigan - a key “toss-up”
state.  As a young professional with feminist convictions, she is
horrified at the thought of what a Bush Administration would do to the
right to choose.  Although I have pointed out that this is a right that
women will still have to struggle to retain, irrespective of Supreme
Court appointments, she cannot bring herself to “waste” her vote on
Nader.  When I’ve countered that a “wasted” vote is one that is
squandered on the lesser of two evils, she argues that she could not
bear the thought that her vote would help elect Bush.
<p>My middle daughter, Miriam, is an actress living in New York City.
With equal amounts of realism and idealism, she understands that voting
for Nader will not cost Gore a victory in the safe state of New York.
While not convinced that Nader is the best Presidential candidate on all
of the issues that concern her, she values his integrity against the
highly scripted and opportunistic Gore.
<p>My youngest daughter, Emma, is a freshman at the University of
California at Berkeley.  That in itself is an indication of where she
comes down on the Presidential question.  With a sticker attached to her
dorm room saying “Gore and Bush make me want to Ralph!,” she reflects
the incredible passion with which young students have embraced the Nader
campaign.  Also, as an Ani DiFranco-loving, vegan-proselytizing, and
righteous-declaiming teenager, she represents one wing of a growing
Green orientation around this country.
<p>I am proud of all my three daughters.  I deeply respect their
intelligence and choices they have made and continue to make in their
lives.  Even if they don’t share all of the values I have absorbed and
articulate in my life, they have a wonderful capacity to re-shape these
values according to their own consciences.  For that I am thankful, even
if there are still certain disagreements, whether political or not.
<p>On the other hand, the great fortune and privilege that we all have
does not extend to other young woman and girls.  Under other
circumstances, I could be a father of a young teenage daughter in
Vietnam suffering from the toxic residues left behind by the American
military (a military that both Gore and Bush supported and continue to
support in aggressive interventions).  Now working in a Nike factory
under near slave conditions with slave wages, the life of this teenage
girl would not be made better under either a Gore or Bush Presidency.
<p>If I were a father in Iraq whose young daughter came down with
dysentery because of the destruction of the water sewage system overseen
by Washington policymakers during the Gulf War (a war supported by Gore
and Bush) would a Bush or Gore Presidency change the policies that led
to this destruction and the continuing blockade of simple chlorine
tablets and other medicines necessary to prevent the deaths of thousands
of daughters and sons?  Where would the relief come from?
<p>And if I were a father in Gaza, running away with my young daughter
from Apache helicopter gunships piloted by Israeli soldiers but supplied
by the political support of politicians like Gore and Bush, what vote
would help me and my family to live in peace in my own country?
<p>Yes.  My three daughters and I are very fortunate.  We have the
luxury of arguing and debating about our choices for President.  We also
are not threatened in a direct way by the ravages of corporate
globalization or imperialist policies.  However, isn’t it incumbent upon
all of us to recognize that voting for Gore and Bush and everything they
represent is a threat to the well-being of so many other children around
the world.  If we are only fathers to our daughters, parents to our own
children, and not the protectors of others, who are we?  If not now for
Nader and alternatives to politics as usual, when?
