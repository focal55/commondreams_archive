WASHINGTON<wbr> - <wbr>As in Vietnam nearly 40 years ago, the United States has embarked
on the phantasmagoric enterprise of destroying the countryside of
Colombia in order, supposedly, to save it.
<p>In the 1960s, the mission was called "Search and Destroy." Today, it's
Plan Colombia, the objective of which is to eradicate cocaine drug lords,
leftist and rightist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitary vigilantes,
thugs and thousands in between. In Vietnam, the enemy was identified as
communists. In Colombia, everyone seems to be a potential enemy.
<p>Congress quietly approved U.S. armed intervention in Colombia last
month, complete with at least 60 Black Hawk and Huey-2 helicopter
gunships with U.S. crews. U.S. Army Special Forces are already training
two Colombian battalions in counterinsurgency. President Bill Clinton is
expected to endorse the mission Aug. 30 on a one-day visit to Colombia.
<p>Most Americans seem to have no idea that Plan Colombia threatens to
suck the United States into the longest and most brutal civil war in the
Western Hemisphere, which has lasted on and off for 160 years. It has
never been explained to them, just like Vietnam was never explained at
the outset.
<p>In another ghastly reminder of Vietnam, the administration has
persuaded Colombia to develop a powerful biological herbicide against
coca and heroin poppy fields. It is a fungus known as fusarium oxysporum,
derived from the coca plant. Washington's idea is to spread it across
hundreds of thousands of acres cultivated for poppies. Nobody appears to
know the impact of this fungus on humans, which evokes memories of the
Agent Orange defoliant in Vietnam that killed and maimed the Viet Cong
and Americans alike.
<p>Plan Colombia is the result of the administration's festering
frustration over its continuing inability to stem the huge flow of
cocaine and heroine produced in Colombia, notwithstanding billions of
dollars spent over the years on interdiction and for what passed for
cooperation with Colombian authorities. The plan's chief author is the
White House drug czar, Gen. Barry M. McCaffrey, former head of the U.S.
Southern Command. Congress allocated $1.3 billion to put it into action.
<p>To the extent that it can be understood, the plan calls for the
elimination of the guerrillas, no matter their allegiance, who guard the
fields, so small aircraft can safely spray the fungus over the poppy
plantations. This task is to be carried out by U.S.-trained Colombian
counterinsurgency battalions ferried to the poppy fields by U.S.
helicopters. Nothing has been said about what would happen should a U.S.
chopper be shot down and members of its crew killed or injured.
<p>A complicating factor is that a half-dozen guerrilla wars or conflicts
are currently underway in Colombia, making it difficult for McCaffrey to
decide whom and where to hit. The most important guerrilla group is the
FARC (Spanish acronym for Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), whose
15,000 troops occupy the southern departments of Putumayo and Caqueta, an
area the size of Switzerland, and function as a virtually independent
coca-rich state. The FARC's ranks have swelled since the U.S. launched
Plan Colombia. The counterinsurgency battalions will have a tough time
with the Marxist-Leninist force, as will their U.S. advisors. The
Vietnam-era question of how many Americans will be needed to overwhelm
the guerrillas will surely arise.
<p>In the north, the ELN (National Liberation Army), a more politically
moderate organization, controls its own smaller "mini-country," equally
wealthy in coca. It has no more than 5,000 fighters.
<p>Then there are right-wing paramilitary units at war with the
guerrillas and local peasants. These units have a frightening
human-rights record, but so do the guerrillas. Hardly a day passes in
Colombia without dozens slaughtered on all sides. The Colombian army and
police have been accused of working quietly with the paramilitary squads,
but under Plan Colombia, they are to ensure peace and probity.
<p>It does not require much imagination to conclude that Plan Colombia,
as most informed Colombians know, is simply unfeasible. In Brasilia last
week, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, on a mission to sell the
plan in Latin America, was told that Brazil would have no part of it.
Most other Latin American governments feel the same way, leaving
Washington isolated in its undertaking.
<p>Perhaps the greatest threat and tragedy facing the U.S. in its
Colombian venture is that the plan was developed by men and women who
know little of Colombia's history, culture and politics. This, too, is
reminiscent of Vietnam, where President John F. Kennedy engaged the U.S.
without consulting the handful of officials who actually knew something
about Hanoi, Dien Bien Phu, Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Cong.
<p>The shakiness of U.S. knowledge of Colombian history is best
illustrated by the widely repeated falsehood that the civil war there has
been going on for 40 years. Actually, the first great civil war that
would define subsequent ones erupted between the Liberals and the
Conservatives in 1840, 21 years after Simon Bolivar won Colombia's
independence from Spain. These wars never really stopped, and a key
milestone were the savage riots in Bogota, the capital, in 1948, when the
leftist liberal presidential candidate Jorge Eliecer Gaitan was murdered.
<p>The civil war--the violencia--continued after 1948, leading to
military coups, a restoration of formal democracy and the emergence of
large guerrilla forces. What's left of that democracy today is in
tatters, and Plan Colombia will clearly not rescue it. It is difficult to
"save" a nation about whose history and identity our top Washington
policymakers know so little.  *
