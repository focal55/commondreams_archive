The case of Percy Schmeiser, the Saskatchewan farmer who recently went toe-to-toe with the agribusiness giant Monsanto in a Saskatoon courtroom, was billed as a modern-day David and Goliath struggle. It was a story of the little guy against the capitalist giant or, in some versions, the freeloading peasant who snubbing his nose at big business. But the subtext to that courtroom theatre is even more significant. Can genes from genetically modified crops travel and cross-pollinate with other plants in unpredictable, possibly dangerous ways?
<P>The lawyers acting for Monsanto, the developers of Roundup Ready canola, worked hard to paint a picture of Mr. Schmeiser as a farmer who pilfered intellectually protected GMO seed and planted it without paying the necessary license fees. Mr. Schmeiser, on the other hand, claims the genetically engineered, herbicide-resistant canola found in his fields got there by mistake, carried by birds, bees, the wind or a passing grain truck.</P>
<P>Very soon, the judge in the Schmeiser case will determine who is right. However, despite the naysayers, there is ample evidence that genes from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can travel and do it well. This has potential long-term consequences not only for farmers but for the planet.</P>
<P>The first genetically-modified commercial crops were introduced into the North American marketplace in 1996. Most of these new inventions -- laboratory enhanced soybeans, corn, potatoes, and canola -- were manipulated to help farmers improve their crop yield. But in developing seeds that are herbicide resistant, what pesticide was a farmer to treat his crops with? That's where the friendly seed producer came in again. He just happened to have a tailor-made chemical the farmer could use: Roundup Ready crops go hand-in-hand with Monsanto's popular herbicide Roundup; Liberty Link canola takes Liberty herbicide, and so on.</P>
<P>What happens, however, if a field of one herbicide-resistant crop is infiltrated with a different kind of herbicide resistant crop? Or if a weed, cross-pollinated by a resistant crop, takes up residence?</P>
<P>Farmers have a term to describe crops that pop up where they shouldn't: volunteer. From a farmer's perspective, it doesn't really matter if a field is peppered with herbicide-resistant wild mustard or herbicide-resistant &#34;volunteer&#34; canola. These plants should not be there. And they pose an irritating challenge for crop management. Perhaps more trouble that the original technology was worth.</P>
<P>Ask the Alberta farmer who found his fields tainted with not one, but three different varieties of herbicide-resistant &#34;volunteer&#34; canola. In such a case, figuring out what kind of pesticide to use without killing the crop itself is a mystery worthy of an agrarian Sherlock Holmes.</P>
<P>The ability of genetically modified traits to travel to other plants is having a direct commercial impact on Canadian business. When Advanta Seeds Canada, a Winnipeg-based subsidiary of a Dutch company, shipped canola seeds to Europe, it thought it was sending conventional, untainted canola to a marketplace that is undeniably hostile to GMOs. However, tests showed a tiny trace (.4 per cent) of the canola was genetically engineered. Even the strict isolation rules that apply to certified seed production were not enough to stop cross pollination. European farmers are now tearing up their canola fields and demanding compensation from Advanta.</P>
<P>Some of the world's biggest seed companies are now moving their operations to countries that are free of GM production. Advanta told the Times of London it was abandoning seed propagation in Western Canada because the risk of cross pollination was too high. Pioneer has moved its seed growing to Romania, Hungary, and Austria. A report from the UK Ministry of Agriculture advised the Canadian government that &#34;in the absence of more precise data, all such imports should be regarded as potentially contaminated.&#34;</P>
<P>But this is not just a commercial calculation. GMOs are transforming the rural landscape itself. From a passing car in early July, the prairie canola fields may blaze that familiar butter yellow. It's impossible to discern from a distance whether the crop is conventional canola, herbicide-resistant canola, or some unintended mixture of the two.</P>
<P>But farmers will know. The technology that was supposed to make life simpler for them will demand they develop new skills in chemical management.</P>
<P>And there is more to come. Work is now being done to develop herbicide-resistant wheat -- the crop that defines Canadian agriculture. Monsanto hopes it will have a Roundup Ready wheat commercially available by the 2003-2004 crop year. Whatever concerns consumers and farmers have had about gentically-modified canola will pale in comparison to the public uproar over corporate tinkering with our daily bread.
