Ever been to LaGuardia Airport in New York? Do you know who LaGuardia is? Well, I don't mind telling you. He was the most politically fascinating Republican of the 20th century.<BR>
<br>
I know you know F. Scott Fitzgerald, the author of the American literary classic, "The Great Gatsby." Both LaGuardia and Fitzgerald were figures of the "Jazz Age", a.k.a. the "Roaring Twenties."<BR>
<br>
It was a time not unlike the <IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>time we live in now. The economy was booming. Conspicuous consumption was commonplace. And everywhere you turned, people - rich people, mostly - were praising the god of affluence.<BR>
<br>
What's that? Yes, you are correct. As spiritually deceiving and socially damaging as it all was, the economic prosperity was real. From 1921 to 1927, unemployment declined from 4.3 million to 2.1 million. Real wages climbed a bit and the number of financially successful farmers increased.<BR>
<br>
According to "Recent Social Trends: Report of the President's Research Committee on Social Trends (1933)," as noted by Howard Zinn in his "The Politics of History," there were 25,000 farms by 1929 that had gross incomes over $20,000 a year.<BR>
<br>
But even Fitzgerald could see and be moved by pervasive social suffering. In an article he wrote for Scribner's, called "Echoes of a Jazz Age," Fitzgerald recounted the violent deaths committed by and suffered by several friends. "These are not catastrophes that I went out of my way to look for - these were my friends; moreover, these things happened not during the depression but during the boom."<BR>
<br>
Born in a Greenwich Village flat, Fiorello LaGuardia was the son of a Jewish mother from Trieste and an Italian father who had immigrated to America as arranger for the well-known soprano Adelina Patti. LaGuardia's father served in the Army as bandmaster, but died of food poisoning during the Spanish-American War - one of thousands of victims who ate the "embalmed beef" sold to the Quartermaster Corps by some big meatpacking company.<BR>
<br>
After stints with the American consulate in Budapest and Fiume, LaGuardia worked as an interpreter for immigrants coming into Ellis Island. "He went to law school at night, walked the picket lines with striking garment workers in Manhattan and became attracted to the Progressive wing of the Republican party, surprising the machine men by his victory in 1916," Zinn elaborates.<BR>
<br>
A Progressive wing of the Republican party? Political archeologists take note. He derided the Espionage Act of 1917 - a piece of legislation prohibiting "scurrilous, abusive" criticism of Uncle Sam. He worked to lower taxes for (get this) the working poor and called for federal government regulation of the food industry in both peace and war.<BR>
<br>
The GOP mainstream wanted LaGuardia out the way, especially when the governor's race of 1922 came around. Republican leadership offered him the congressional district of East Harlem. He accepted and was soon in office, declaring his political philosophy in the New York World: "I stand for the Republicanism of Abraham Lincoln; and let me tell you that the average Republican leader east of the Mississippi doesn't know anything more about Abraham Lincoln than Henry Ford knows about the Talmud. I am a Progressive." <BR>
<br>
When it came to prolonging wartime rent control, the distinguished gentleman from East Harlem argued in Congress on behalf of tenants. Landlords, economics professors and legal scholars all argued against rent control.<BR>
<br>
LaGuardia responded: "But gentlemen, with all of their experts, with all of their professors, with all of their legal talent, there is no argument that can prevail when a man with a weekly income and a family to support is compelled to pay out of his income such a large proportion that there is not sufficient left to properly care for and nourish his children. That is the condition in New York City; that is the condition in Washington, D.C." <BR>
<br>
He even clashed with the powerful Andrew W. Mellon, secretary of the Treasury and coal, oil, gas and aluminum magnate. When the anthracite miners in eastern Pennsylvania went on strike, LaGuardia argued for government ownership of the mines.<BR>
<br>
"This country is blessed with a rich supply of coal. It is not the invention of any one man. It is God's gift to the people of America. It requires human labor to dig the coal, bring it back from the bowels of the earth so it may be used for the benefit of mankind... . The government should (take) such actions as eventually will put the government in possession of the gift of God that surely was intended to be used for the benefit of all American people," LaGuardia said.<BR>
<br>
Excuse me, Gen. Colin Powell, do they have any room for LaGuardia-like Republicans in that big tent called the Grand Old Party? Are there any Lincoln Republicans left?<BR>
