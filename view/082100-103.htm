I WATCHED IN DISBELIEF as John Stossel, co-anchor of ABC's ``20/20,'' 
delivered a half-hearted apology August 11 for falsifying evidence in 
a report that claimed organic produce is potentially more dangerous 
than food raised using toxic agrochemicals, antibiotics, added 
hormones, genetically engineered seeds and massive animal-feeding 
factories.
<P>  In his apology, Stossel did admit that some tests he relied on to 
support his conclusion had never been conducted. But he shrugged that 
off as a minor oversight, maintaining that because organic farmers 
favor manure and other natural fertilizers over synthetic chemicals, 
organic produce carries a greater risk of E. coli infection and 
``could kill you.''	 
What wasn't mentioned is that most of the manure spread on land in 
the United States is, in fact, used by conventional farmers. The 
difference is that organic farmers are the only ones required to farm 
in a way that might minimize the risk of E. coli or other food-borne 
illness. Organic certification standards require that all raw manure 
is applied to the fields or orchards at least 60 days, and sometimes 
as many as 120 days, before the produce is harvested -- a period that 
allows for ecological processes that eliminate harmful microbes. (The 
pathogens become food for other soil organisms or degrade from 
exposure to the elements).	 
</P>
<P>  Conventional growers, in contrast, can spray on raw, uncomposted 
manure (even on fruits and veggies that are but days from being 
harvested), in addition to human sewage sludge and slurry from 
industrial animal farms -- all practices that are explicitly 
forbidden under organic regulations.	 
</P>
<P>There has been no systematic analysis of whether organic or nonorganic 
foods carry a greater risk of E. coli O157 -- the particular strain 
that is so deadly to humans and that we hear so much about in the 
news -- but the prevailing epidemiology of this bug points to the 
safety of organic over conventional farming. Nearly all cases of E. 
coli 0157 result from consumption of contaminated meat, a function of 
the conditions of industrial factory farms and meat processing 
plants. For livestock that are used to eating mostly grass and straw, 
the feedlot diet of grain concentrate encourag 
es the proliferation of E. coli 0157 in the animal's gut, while the 
highly confined and unsanitary conditions facilitate transmission of 
the bugs between animals. At the same time, overuse of antibiotics in 
the feedlot diet virtually ensures the potency of emerging microbes. 
Meanwhile, meat packing at breakneck speed, often in close proximity 
to animal carcasses and feces, paves the way for additional 
contamination.	 
</P>
<P>  In those cases that do occur in produce, the E. coli generally 
enters the food chain at the packaging and handling stage, not the 
farm environment.	 
</P>
<P>Here are a few other things that weren't mentioned:	 
ABC's false claims relied almost exclusively on testimony of Dennis 
Avery of the agribusiness-funded Hudson Institute, whose thoughts on 
pesticides and food-
borne illness have already been widely discredited. Last year, Avery 
manipulated data from the Centers for Disease Control in order to 
back his claim that organic produce carries a greater risk of E. coli 
than nonorganic produce. CDC officials have stated that their data do 
not support Avery's claims -- a fact that might deter most 
journalists (even TV journalists) from relying on Avery as a source.	 
</P>
<P>  The report also played down the risk of pesticide residues, 
claiming (with data that did not exist) that organic produce has no 
fewer pesticide residues than nonorganic 
produce. In truth, organic produce -- from bananas to peppers to 
strawberries -- has been consistently shown to carry fewer toxic 
pesticide residues than nonorganic produce. Some of the more recent 
evidence includes the January 1998 issue of Consumer Reports, which 
tested 1,000 pounds of organic and nonorganic produce, and found that 
organic produce consistently carried the lowest, and least-toxic, 
pesticide residues. (The fact that even foods grown without 
pesticides may contain trace pesticide residues is the unfortunate 
consequence of past pesticide use which has left background pesticide 
levels in the soil, water supply and even our bodies.)	 
Perhaps the most basic oversight of the report was the failure to 
mention that organic farming -- the fastest growing sector of the 
food economy -- offers tremendous hope for reconciling the toll that 
industrial, chemical-dependent farming has taken on rivers and 
streams, topsoil, wildlife and the environment in general. By relying 
on a sophisticated understanding of crop diversity, nutrient cycling, 
predator-prey interactions and other ecological processes occurring 
in the field, instead of chemical quick-fixes, organic farming 
provides a model for improving the way we currently grow most of our 
food.	 
</P>
<P>The fabrication of information on an ABC news report -- not to mention 
the neglect of extensive evidence disputing its conclusions -- raises 
serious questions of journalistic integrity. According to Brill's 
Content magazine, over the last two years, Stossel has collected 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees from various 
industry and conservative groups, including agribusiness interests. 
At the very least, this gives the appearance of a potential conflict 
of interest, and with the organic food market in this country growing 
by more than 20 percent a year, there is no shortage of groups who 
feel threatened -- agrochemical companies, biotech companies, and 
nonorganic food manufacturers and retailers.	 
</P>
<P>  ``All we have in this business is our credibility -- your trust 
that we get it right,` Stossel reminds the audience in his apology. 
Unfortunately, for his and ABC's reputation, this realization has 
come too late.
