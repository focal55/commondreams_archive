Dear friends,

<p>It's after 5am on the East coast and things couldn't 
be more insane.

<p>At 2:20am, they declared Bush the winner. Gore 
called Bush and conceded.

<p>One hour later, all hell broke lose. Suddenly, Bush's 
50,000 vote lead in Florida had dropped to 500! 
Gore, getting ready to take the stage in Nashville to 
tell his supporters he had lost, looked at the new 
numbers and called Bush to take his concession back!

<p>At 3:45am, they took Florida out of the Bush column. 
Bush's lead had dropped to just 224 votes -- with 
thousands of ballots still uncounted! The Florida 
Attorney General acknowledged on NBC that ballots 
in the Palm Beach area were suspiciously structured in 
such a way that people who thought they were voting 
for Gore ended up having their votes being counted for 
Pat Buchanan! 

<p>Now, an hour later, Gore has pulled out significantly 
ahead of Bush in the nationwide popular vote -- at 
last count, Gore leads Bush by over 260,000 votes  
-- and it continues to climb. Ten percent of California 
-- a state which Gore is winning big -- has yet to be 
counted. This will only add to his popular vote as the 
morning goes on.

<p>One thing is certain now: According to all the networks, 
Gore is going to win the popular vote. 

<p>But they are also saying that, no matter if he has won the 
most votes, he may be denied the Presidency -- because 
of the Electoral College!

<p>My fellow Americans -- we have to set aside our 
differences regarding Gore and Nader and demand, 
IMMEDIATELY DEMAND, that Bush step aside and 
not claim the Presidency based on this insane ancient 
Electoral College. The Electoral College was designed by 
the founding fathers who wrote it into the Constitution along 
with this rule: only white men who owned property and paid 
taxes would be allowed to vote. 

<p>The United States is no longer that country. This is a 
democracy. One person, one vote. We should have done 
away with this antique long before now. I guess no one ever
thought it would come to a night like this.

<p>Well, it did.

<p>Even though I did not vote for Al Gore, for all the reasons 
I have previously stated (from his support of the death 
penalty to his promise to expand our militrary), the majority 
of those who voted yesterday DID vote for him -- and, 
therefore the will of the people must be honored. He must 
take his seat in the Oval Office. 

<p>Already, the pundits and professional political hacks are 
harumphing about how the Constitution must be followed. 
They are saying both candidates knew the rules and now 
must abide by them.

<p>It's also against "The Law" to wear a hat on Sunday in 
Helena, Montana, and it is written into LAW that a woman 
in Tucson must not spit on the sidewalk. Those and thousand 
of laws like it are still on the books. But common sense 
dictates that we ignore these laws. 

<p>We must ask that common sense and decency prevail here 
with this election. Al Gore is the choice of the people. To 
go against that single, explicit fact would do more damage 
to an already cynical electorate than I want to imagine. 
Once again we had the same sad situation yesterday when 
half the country didn't even vote! Can we afford to have 
more citizens lose even more faith in our democracy?

<p>There will be ample time to analyze and discuss the 
other issues regarding this election. One thing is clear 
-- most of the Nader voters decided at the last minute 
to change their vote to Al Gore. Nader's 5% in the polls 
for the past month ended up being less than 3% in the 
voting booth. In Florida, Nader went from an expected 
6% of the vote to only 1.7% of the votes cast! Exit polls
 showed that Fear of Bush lead to nearly all of Nader's 
support there to switch over to Gore. Nader's votes 
came from those who said they were registered 
Republicans or who were initially planning on not voting 
for either candidate. In Oregon, half of Nader's voters 
went for Gore, with the same happening in Wisconsin. In 
the end, Ralph achieved neither his 5% goal, nor did his 
supporters help to elect Bush.

<p>For me, what truly put Gore in jeopardy through most 
of the night was losing his home state to Bush. Those 11 
electoral votes could have made all the difference. And 
to lose Clinton's Arkansas was a serious blow to wrapping 
up the election early. 

<p>But a dead guy won, defeating a Republican incumbent 
Senator in Missouri. At least two or three women have 
been added to the ranks of the Senate. Hillary won, 
causing right-wing nuts everywhere to go into convulsions. 
The governor of Vermont, who many thought might lose 
because of his support of Vermont's new gay marriage law, 
won. The state of Colorado, in the wake of Columbine, 
passed a gun control law by a vote of 70 to 30 percent. 
Michigan slammed Bush hard, as I predicted.

<p>But, as I said, we can discuss all this later. Right now, all 
good citizens must speak out today, in the next few hours, 
loudly and clearly, that George W. Bush has lost the vote 
of the people and we will NEVER trust all the shenanigans 
that took place with the vote in Florida tonight -- a vote 
presided over by none other than Little Brother Governor 
Jeb Bush!! Send e-mails, call talk shows, contact your 
congressmen and women -- RAISE HOLY BLOODY HELL!! 

<p>I guess I'm not going to bed. My support for Nader will 
have no integrity if I am not willing to do everything in my 
limited power to support the main belief of the Nader campaign 
-- demand that the will of the people be heeded and heard. I 
ask all of Ralph's supporters -- those who voted for him, and 
those who voted for Gore -- to join with me this morning to stop 
this potential theft of our majority democratic rule.

<p>Yours,

<p>Michael Moore<br>
