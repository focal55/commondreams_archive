SITTING IN the bleachers at the Dance Mission Theater on Saturday 
night, watching a troupe of lesbians perform a new work called "CaveWomen," I 
kept thinking about the word "community."
<P>  Most of us throw it around as if it had some absolute, easy-to-identify 
meaning. We talk blithely about all manner of communities: The gay one. The 
straight one. The African American, Latino, Filipino, Pan Asian and immigrant 
ones. We speak knowingly of the academic community, the civil rights, AIDS, 
Christian, bicycle, homeless, scientific and vegan ones.
</P>
<P>  Sillier yet, we often behave as though each "community" were a monolith, 
made up of people who are first, last and nothing but the characteristics that 
qualify them for "membership" in their group.
</P>
<P>  What then to make of all of us assembled around "CaveWomen"?
</P>
<P>  A heterosexual, I'd come to watch a known lesbian company, Dance Brigade, 
put on a wild and in-your-face tribute to females who prefer the company of XX 
chromosomes. Did that make me part of the lesbian community? Because I'd paid 
for my ticket, thus lending a bit of help to Dance Mission's continuing rent 
struggle, was I part of the dance community?
</P>
<P>  How about the young Asian man (not a lesbian) sitting next to me? When the 
five Dance Brigade dames were pounding away on Taiko drums and a bell, no one 
stomped his foot any harder or more happily than this guy. And yet, unlike 
anyone else in the audience, he was wearing a blazer, dress shirt, 
conservative tie and pressed khakis.
</P>
<P>  Was he primarily a member of the law or accounting community? From their 
pre-show conversation, the two thirtysomething men behind me seemed to be 
members of the dot-com community: A chief tech officer-led coup d'etat, they 
said, had given everyone at "the teamwide meetings" something exciting to talk 
about for a change.
</P>
<P>  But isn't the dance community supposed to be at war with the dot-com 
community -- and any other group that's contributed to evictions and 
skyrocketing real estate prices in the Mission District? What brought these 
men to enemy territory?
</P>
<P>  A few rows away was a member of the cancer-survivor community. I could tell 
by her lean frame, tired eyes and bright bandana around a bald head. But the 
woman who was with her, who whispered in her ear, nuzzled her neck and looked 
upon her with such love that you could almost hear violins, indicated that 
both were also bona fide members of the lesbian community. The committed 
lesbian community.
</P>
<P>  Then there were the dancers: Five sexy, super-looking women who performed a 
30-minute work that is based on the Yoginis of 10th century India but involves 
a circus knife-throwing act, the aforementioned kick-butt drumming and a great 
deal of water.
</P>
<P>  Obviously, all are part of the lesbian and the dance communities. But one 
is also a member of the Latino community, another of the Asian American. Three 
are moms with kids in public school. We learned this during the bows, when the 
Dance Brigade mothers motioned for their children to join them on the dance 
floor.
</P>
<P>  On Friday and Saturday, when "CaveWomen" repeats and Anne Bluethenthal and 
Dancers join to present their new work, one of those public schools -- Buena 
Vista Elementary -- will be the beneficiary of ticket sales. (This is San 
Francisco Unified we're talking about; some parents' groups help out by 
auctioning off quilts or weekends in Napa, others perform in lesbian dance 
troupes.)
</P>
<P>  If you're straight, childless, Anglo-Saxon, work a desk job and have two 
left feet, the benefit could be a great chance to be part of several 
communities you never dreamed you'd be included in. And it could serve as a 
reminder of just how monolithic most communities are not.
