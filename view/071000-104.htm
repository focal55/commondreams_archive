As a rule, the only buzz in the quiet little seaside village in the Hamptons, Long Island, where I spend weekends, is from the subfamily Apinae: bees to you. (They are slim, social bees, not to be confused with the obese, hairy  Anthophorus crowd). This weekend the  Apinae were buzzed out by the rising excitement concerning the slim queen bee of the Clinton family. Hadn't I heard she was coming in a couple of weeks and we could all have a summer lunch with Hillary for $1,000 a plate? Candidates in the American system spend most of their lives raising money for television commercials and $1,000 is small change: $5,000 a seat is commonplace for the rubbernecking you get with the rubber chicken.
<P>Hillary needs every cent she can get for her bid for the Senate seat for New York, which is being vacated by the scholarly and tetchy Senator Daniel Moynihan. This is the first anniversary of her candidacy and she is still unable to break 50% in the polls, despite the commotions in the Republican party. The melodramatic contest I described between Hillary, as the schoolmarm, and Rudy Giuliani, as the law'n'order sheriff of New York City, has been pulled from local theatres. Mayor Giuliani has retired from the race, having announced that he was suffering from prostate cancer and had finally decided to leave his wife for his mistress. He had barely made his exit when last week a book suggested his father, Harold, spent a year and half in Sing Sing for taking a baseball bat to slow payers in loan-shark and gambling operations run by La Cosa Nostra, and his cousin, Leo d'Avanzo, was a car-thieving goodfella who was gunned down by FBI agents in Brooklyn in 1977.
<P>The mafia smear sooner or later gets attached to anyone with a vowel at the end of his name running for office in New York, but for Giuliani, a very effective prosecutor, it's akin to someone suggesting that when Joe McCarthy was doing his witch-hunts, his dad was heading up a Soviet spy ring. Rudy came to fame getting 100 years jail apiece for the heads of five mafia families and I think he would have got a huge sympathy vote if he had stayed the course.
<P>Rudy's place, alas, has been taken by another vowel, a handsome young New York congressman, Rick Lazio, with a thin skin and an erratic left-right-left voting record. But Lazio has lots of   Republican cash. He has spent some of it giving the press a special bus fitted out for them with a fax machine, captain's swivel chairs, couches, a microwave oven, coffeemaker, well-stocked fridge, satellite phones and colour television. A cunning move, that TV set. From their captain's chairs, reporters have been watching Wimbledon all week, which is a safer use of their time than trying to disentangle where Lazio stands on abortion. His position has been that he is pro-choice provided nobody chooses. Now the supreme court has removed his wriggle room in a judgment weighted in favour of women's rights, which is Hillary's position. But her press crowd have been no help: they've been too busy grumbling about her plain old press bus and the nanny notice that the campaign "Cannot be responsible for any electrical items plugged into this socket. (Use at your own risk.)"
<P>This weekend the enemy forces were already gathering. Outside the Village Cafe there was parked a racy blue convertible with a fancy plaque welded to the boot: "Go Back Home Hillary", which was rich, because the vehicle's licence plate was from the Sunshine State, suggesting someone had the nerve to drive all the way from Florida to protest carpet-bagging in our politics up here. I did a double take when a slim blonde emerged from the cafe, a Hillary lookalike, but it's symptomatic of what is going on. Hillary has a problem with women, just the kind of women you would think she would attract. She has slipped from a 50% approval rate among women in 1998, during the Monica affair, to 44%. The trouble is the suburbs where the vowel is ahead 54% to 32%. Suburban women could give Rick the Senate seat. It is puzzling. So many of them look and talk like Hillary and think more like her than Lazio on abortion and guns and education.
<P>The polls afford little clue to the contradiction, but she may be resented for being too poised, too perfect, too self-righteous, too forgiving, even - the wife who has fixed her hair and manicure and is in the hammock reading Foreign Affairs while you're still wrestling with the kids' breakfast. Call it the queen bee syndrome. My conclusion is she needs the sympathy vote again. Maybe she could borrow a skeleton or two from Giuliani's cupboard.
