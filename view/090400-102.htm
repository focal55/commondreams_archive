Feeling virtuous is one of the most pleasurable human emotions. And more than 150 heads of state have scheduled virtue into their diaries for this week. Tony Blair does his bit on Wednesday, President Clinton and Fidel Castro are both pitching up. They're gathering in New York for the biggest UN summit ever and they'll give and listen to more long speeches on poverty eradication, conflict resolution and sustainable development than ever before. Welcome to the UN's Millennium Summit, scheduled to beat all previous records on admirable promises, declarations of noble ideals and evocations of a peaceful and just future for humanity.
<P>The contrast between the frenetic activity in the UN in New York and its rapidly disintegrating operation in Sierra Leone is painfully obvious. And yet more embarrassing revelations about the UN's role in Rwanda are published in a new book this week. We are wearily familiar with this old conundrum: the UN is good at drawing up idealistic conventions, but near-useless at getting them translated into political reality. This usually prompts one or other of two conclusions: first, that the UN is powerless, second that it is hypocritical - or both.
<P>These will be the sort of criticisms flung at the UN in the second international jamboree this month - the autumn meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Prague. Thousands of frustrated demonstrators are expected in the Czech capital in a follow-up to Seattle last November.
<P>But the UN is extraordinarily powerful in many ways; few other organisations have the power to get 150 heads of state into town. They come to buy into the closest we've got to a universal, secular faith - the UN Declaration of Human Rights is its credo and Kofi Annan its high priest. As William Shawcross writes in concluding his study of UN peacekeeping operations, Deliver Us From Evil: "In a more religious time it was only God whom we asked to deliver us from evil. Now we call upon our own man-mutions for such deliverance."
<P>Not only do many pray for the UN to deliver them from evil, they pray for it to deliver them their daily bread (hundreds of thousands of south Sudanese have been dependent on the UN food operation for years). The 500-plus UN conventions (land mines, rights of children, elimination of discrimination against women) which Annan is urging his guests to sign-up to this week, are a modern day version of the Beatitudes, our vision of the Kingdom of God. It's no accident that many UN secretary-generals have been deeply religious (including the practising Christian Annan). Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld, one of the most admired men to head the UN, made its spiritual mission explicit: "We have tried to make peace on this earth and we have failed miserably. Unless there is a spiritual renaissance, this world will know no peace."
<P>The charge of hypocrisy is levelled at the UN, just as it is at any other faith-based organisation. This opens up the whole vexed relationship between idealism and reality - and nowhere is this issue more complicated than politics. If the reality doesn't fulfill the promise of the ideals, do you junk the ideals? Surely the role of idealism is as a motivating aspiration and a yardstick. Curiously, the right has often been much more comfortable with this issue than the left; believing some variation of original sin, it knows that human nature can't match the ideals it aspires to. It is the left which finds the mismatch so frustrating.
<P>The relationship between idealism and politics is not academic, it is central to why the Czech police claim to be preparing tear gas and riot police to deal with up to 50,000 activists in Prague on September 26. While the UN summit in New York will elaborate the ideals, the real decisions affecting billions of lives will be made in Prague by the IMF and the World Bank. On hundreds of websites environmentalists, human rights groups and anarchists have embarked on a mass education programme to mobilise their supporters in the campaign against international financial institutions. The big idea whose time has finally come is global democratic deficit. They want to know why the IMF and the World Bank are run on a blatantly undemocratic system of money buying votes, while the far more democratic UN has always been squeezed out of any significant input into managing the global economy.
<P> Right from the start the UN was rigged primarily as a talking shop to promulgate an ideology. Attempts to provide the UN with muscle in economic matters have been blocked throughout its history by primarily the US, as a New Economics Foundation pamphlet published today charts. The IMF and the World Bank rejected the idea of being UN agencies; a UN international trade organisation collapsed for lack of US support and the UN conference on trade and development was emasculated. The result is the kind of castrated idealism and international institutional chaos we have now; the UN has a remit for the environment and for development but no access to the economic levers which might enable it to deliver on either. So, the UN painstakingly negotiates complex treaties on such issues as biodiversity only to find them coming into conflict with World Trade Organisation rules: which takes precedence in international law? No one knows - and that's what has banded such disparate   groups together as conservationists, trade unions and development NGOs in the global protest movement.
<P>The UN's idealism was part of a western bid for ideological hegemony; it was never designed to have any military or economic power. But its use as a cold war weapon is over, and now we need it to have power. That is what the last 10 years has shown again and again when the UN has been called into peacekeeping operations. And as it has had to grapple with challenges to the whole globe such as climate change, Aids and biodiversity.
<P>What happens next is the tricky part: in the last 50 years, an elaborate moral edifice has been constructed of human rights, but how can it survive the next 50 years with any credibility? Recently, Sir Crispin Tickell drew from 25 years experience of diplomacy and environmentalism to paint a bleak picture of ever-increasing   natural disasters due to climate change such as floods and droughts. The International Red Cross has already warned that the scale and frequency of disasters have overwhelmed our capacity to respond - there will be many more refugees and much more hunger. Will we look back on the second half of the 20th century as an astonishing period of moral luxury, the UN's universal human rights as a formulation of Christian millenarianism like socialism, admirable but impractical? The cracks in the moral edifice are visibly growing: people are beginning to opt out of its orthodoxies - the right to asylum is a vital test case with Jack Straw's bid to renegotiate the Geneva convention. Or will we find a way - muddling, messy - to bring UN ideal and political reality into closer relationship?
