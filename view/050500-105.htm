A spectre is haunting Europe,&#34; was the opening line of <I>The Communist Manifesto</I>, by Karl Marx, in 1848. The &#34;spectre&#34; was communism and the claim proved accurate (substituting &#34;the world&#34; for &#34;Europe&#34;) till about 10 years ago. Now another spectre haunts the world: capitalism. It haunted Marx's world too, before communism did, which is why he wrote so much on it. It's as if we're reliving those early years of the 19th century when capitalism was new and unchallenged. You get a sense of how worrisome and perplexing it must have seemed, as people today experience similar fears and jitters.
<P>There's concern with basics like safety of the food supply (as in genetically manipulated) under an unregulated or &#34;self-regulated&#34; capitalism. There's apprehension over treatment of workers: not just the right to unionize but even child labour, suddenly on the agenda again. Back then, alternatives to capitalism were unclear, as they are today. There were utopian communities and rough theories of socialism, but Marx and the Workers' International hadn't yet laid down a clear, durable version of the competition. It seems to me what you heard in protests in Seattle, Washington or a host of places last Monday, was a spirited critique of capitalism, lacking only, now as then, the sense of an alternative.</P>
<P>But hold on, didn't capitalism win and socialism lose? Maybe, but projects like capitalism, socialism or religion rarely just win or lose. They have their good and bad days or decades, they feel more or less energized or spent. But anyone who expects such grand(iose) visions to simply vanish is likely to be surprised.</P>
<P><B>The commodification of everything</B></P>
<P>
    The event that made capitalism possible, Marx thought, was the shift from use-values (things valued for what they are or do) to exchange-values (things as commodities, equated to other things through a device like money). This led to trade, commerce, division of labour etc. However, for a long time, markets existed on the edges between societies or in special locales like bazaars. The commodification process lumbered along for millennia, only slowly including, for instance, raw human creativity under the rubric of &#34;labour power&#34; with a price on it.</P>
<P>In the modern era, the process accelerated wildly and in our time has gone truly wacky -- think of the mad rush to patent &#34;intellectual property.&#34; There are battles over the ownership of life forms like lab mice or human genes and genetic codes. This is even crazier than slavery, which involved ownership of a mortal body but not its transmittable essence. The same goes for ignoring the common intellectual heritage (language, math, science) behind most &#34;discoveries&#34; in areas like pharmaceuticals. The Onion magazine caught this idiocy nicely in a satirical story headed, Microsoft Patents Ones, Zeros. Microsoft had been using the binary system since 1975, it said, but generously allowed others free access until &#34;changing marketplace conditions&#34; made it decide to start charging fees.</P>
<P>Commodification can be not just stupid, but damn hard. Look at the panic in the music business over people putting CD collections on their Web sites for others to download using MP3. It seems impossible to police and control. Could capitalism reach the point where it will collapse under its own absurdity? Or just get to be more trouble than it's worth? 
</P>
<P>
    <B>The people part</B> 
</P>
<P>
    The nice thing about May Day is that it's always been about the workers for whom the cause (socialism, communism) existed, and not about the cause itself. It doesn't celebrate an abstract ideology or specific event. Too often the people whom a cause or ideology is supposed to serve, are expected to serve <I>it</I>. But May Day stayed true to its origins -- a popular festival from agricultural times -- early pop culture, you could say.</P>
<P>Yet are there workers today at all, as there were when Marx wrote, and long after? The answer is yes-no. Maybe not on the classic model, but you'd assume that in a time like ours of mergers and concentration, where there are far fewer owners, there will be more employees than ever. Yet when you look in the mirrors of the media, where are those workers?</P>
<P>The National Post Business magazine recently ran a cover on an 11-year-old CEO as part of &#34;a wave of young -- very young -- entrepreneurs.&#34; You got the impression everyone in the world was running a company or planning a startup. So who's going to be left to work for them? On the other hand, I was walking along my downtown Toronto street last weekend. A girl in her late teens was lovingly washing her car in front of the family house. She didn't appear to have a startup or IPO on her mind. Just someone who worked for a living and looked forward to some basic pleasures for the rest of her life. It was a rare vision, so unlike what we're normally shown. And to think that I saw it on Markham Street.</P>
