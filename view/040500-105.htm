Corporate lobbyists believe that their campaign to give China
permanent trading privileges is simply a matter of "educating" the public
to the benefits of the latest trade deal. Actually, those lobbyists could
learn a thing or two from the people they're trying to persuade.
<p>In Washington, it's fashionable to look down on people who don't fully
appreciate the benefits of our government's trade policies and of
permanent, normal trade relations--what used to be known as
most-favored-nation status--for China. Too often, critics of permanent
trading privileges, or the North American Free Trade Agreement, or the
World Trade Organization, are reflexively dismissed as isolationists or
protectionists. There's no basis for that sort of condescension.
<p>Most people I meet in Minnesota and across the country are a lot more
sophisticated than they're given credit for. They're perfectly aware that
we live in a global economy. They understand that, under the right
conditions, trade and investment can benefit both Americans and our
foreign partners. However, they want global competition to be based on
quality and legitimate comparative advantage. They don't want a bidding
war to see who can pay the lowest wages or wreak the most environmental
damage.
<p>Most people I meet are indeed skeptical of trade deals, for good
reason. For starters, each new deal is accompanied by enough hype and
exaggeration to make a carnival barker blush. More important, working
people know firsthand that the threat of moving jobs to Mexico is
routinely used to lower their wages and defeat union organizing. They see
an unsustainable trade deficit destroying good manufacturing jobs that
are hard to replace. They understand that encouraging corporations to
move jobs wherever labor, environmental and public health standards are
weakest puts downward pressure on standards in every country.
<p>They realize that China's immense pool of exploited labor and lax
regulation can only accelerate this race to the bottom, especially if we
end Congress' annual review of China's trading privileges. The whole
point of the review is to promote human rights, including labor rights.
<p>In short, a lot of working families have figured out that they're
getting the shorted. Are they wrong to feel that way? Not at all. There's
ample evidence that our trade and investment policies are a major reason
why inequality has reached record levels in the U.S., and why inequality
has risen dramatically within and between nations over the past couple of
decades.
<p>It doesn't have to be this way. In this country, we made the economy
work for working people by setting minimum standards for labor, the
environment, public health and consumer safety. We managed to write rules
for the domestic economy that reflect values other than just the narrow
commercial interests of big business. Why should those values be banished
from the rules of the global economy? Can it really be impossible to make
the global economy work for working people?
<p>Of course not. But it all depends on who's writing the rules. Right
now, the way those rules are written is not very democratic. When
President Clinton's first trade czar tried to incorporate labor and
environmental values into our trading rules, one corporate lobbyist
sniffed: "He's forgotten who his constituency is." I believe the
"constituency" for our trade policies is the American people as a whole,
not just transnational corporations. The rules for the global economy
should be written as democratically as possible so they benefit the many,
not just the few.
<p>There's a movement underway to do just that. Following last year's WTO
gathering in Seattle, a diverse coalition of trade unionists,
environmentalists, family farmers, students and religious leaders has
emerged to rewrite the rules of the global economy. This coalition
understands that raising standards overseas is not only the right thing
to do, it's also necessary to maintain our own standards. Ensuring that
prosperity is shared more broadly overseas also is needed to stabilize
the world economy and create healthy, sustainable markets for our
exports.
<p>Ending annual congressional review of China's trading privileges is a
step in the opposite direction. Though most people are miles ahead of
their government in understanding the global economy, it seems their
concerns have not yet registered on the political radar screen, either in
Washington or on the presidential campaign trail.
