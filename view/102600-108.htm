A censor's work is never done.

<p>For several decades, the Pacifica Foundation -- which owns five 
radio stations and operates a small national network -- nurtured precious 
experiments in the arid terrain of radioland. Pacifica has provided 
listeners with wide-ranging discussion, progressive analysis and 
independent news coverage, in acute contrast to America's usual 
corporate-backed media fare.

<p>But during the last few years, Pacifica's board of directors made 
itself a self-selecting body with an increasingly mainstream agenda. The 
more highhanded the new hierarchy became -- and the more it deserved strong 
criticism -- the more determined it became to prevent criticism of itself 
from getting onto Pacifica airwaves.

<p>Defenders of the "gag rule" argued that it's best not to air dirty 
laundry in public. But when Pacifica's top executives turned into zealous 
censors, the network began to self-destruct. Distinctive for its vigorous 
advocacy of freedom and democracy at home and abroad, Pacifica foundered as 
it brandished the implements of censorship. As Virginia Woolf wrote long 
ago, "If you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about 
other people."

<p>In the summer of 1999, the foundation's board of directors made 
headlines with outrageous actions against KPFA, the trail-blazing Pacifica 
station that has been on the FM dial in the San Francisco area for half a 
century. Journalists were arrested in the KPFA studios -- even in the 
station's newsroom -- where they had worked for many years. The crux of the 
matter was that they had refused to lie to listeners with silence. Pacifica 
management swiftly responded with a lockout.

<p>Massive support for KPFA in Northern California -- including a 
march of 10,000 people past the station's Berkeley headquarters -- showed 
that Pacifica "leaders" had miscalculated. Pacifica backed off, and the 
station re-opened. But the underlying issues have remained.

<p>Pacifica's current national board -- dominated by an array of 
corporate executives, business professionals, investors and political 
people aligned with the Clinton administration -- is hostile to the 
strongly progressive content that had been integral to the network's 
strength. The latest target for Pacifica's ideological housecleaning is 
award-winning journalist Amy Goodman, host of the finest national daily 
radio program in the United States, "Democracy Now!"

<p>From prisons, picket lines and forums in America to fast-breaking 
events in East Timor, Nigeria, Yugoslavia and many other countries, the 
hour-long syndicated "Democracy Now!" show has informed and challenged 
listeners across the USA. Despite the program's successes -- or perhaps 
because of them -- the Pacifica board majority is now attempting to push 
Goodman out.

<p>Longtime broadcast journalist Danny Schechter (executive editor of 
Media Channel, www.mediachannel.org) commented days ago: "That Pacifica 
would seek to undercut the one national show that is building audience and 
generating attention showcases some of the crippling contradictions within 
the network."

<p>A lot of factors are involved in management's dispute with Amy 
Goodman. But here's the crucial point: Pacifica is moving into a new stage 
of an ideological purge.

<p>Recognizing that grim fact, hundreds of people have mobilized to 
defend "Democracy Now!" as part of ongoing efforts to reverse the ominous 
trends at the Pacifica network. Demonstrations occurred Oct. 25 in front of 
KPFA and the four other Pacifica-owned stations, located in Los Angeles, 
Houston, New York City and Washington, D.C. (Details are available at the 
www.savepacifica.net website.)

<p>"Despite meeting and exceeding every stated objective for the show 
-- i.e. audience growth, fund raising, new listeners, groundbreaking 
programming -- 'Democracy Now!' is being subjected to a withering assault 
by Pacifica management," Goodman wrote in an Oct. 18 memo. "The motivation 
is blatantly political."

<p>Goodman added that her show is "a hard-hitting grassroots program 
that is not afraid of tackling controversial issues day after day in the 
Pacifica tradition. We are not only being censored for our critical 
coverage of the Democrats as well as the Republicans, but for giving voice 
to a growing grassroots movement that fundamentally challenges the status 
quo -- people fighting sweatshops, police brutality, prison growth and 
corporate globalization."

<p>A quarter of a century ago, the American historian C. Vann 
Woodward chaired a committee that issued a major report on free speech. His 
words now help to illuminate why it is so important to support journalists 
who face the kind of incessant pressure that Amy Goodman is now withstanding.

<p>"The history of intellectual growth and discovery clearly 
demonstrates the need for unfettered freedom, the right to think the 
unthinkable, discuss the unmentionable, and challenge the unchallengeable," 
Woodward wrote. "To curtail free expression strikes twice at intellectual 
freedom, for whoever deprives another of the right to state unpopular views 
necessarily deprives others of the right to listen to those views."
