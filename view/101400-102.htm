Despite a robust stock market and a lack of threatening international
conflicts, Americans are still deeply concerned about issues of basic
equality and social justice, here and abroad. And, overwhelmingly, they
want the presidential candidates to debate a range of issues that, so far,
both Bush and Gore have been ignoring.

<p>Unfortunately, the first two presidential debates only highlighted the
divide between public concerns and political rhetoric. For 180 minutes,
Bush and Gore have dished out prepackaged, carefully scripted answers
designed to shed little light on their real views and policies. It's no
wonder that people's opinions were not swayed. 

<p>A new public opinion poll, commissioned by The Nation magazine and the
Institute for Policy Studies released just before the debate, found a large
majority of the public wants the candidates to debate U.S. involvement in
peacekeeping missions, how to close the gap between rich and poor school
districts, and the nuclear test ban treaty among a host of other issues.
None of these topics were discussed in depth by the candidates in the
debates. And on two key issues where Bush and Gore basically agree-the
benefits of international trade and increased military spending relative to
other priorities, for instance-the public does not. 

<p>The findings of the poll include:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Despite the booming economy, many Americans worry about the
disenfranchised: they show concern for the many Americans without health
insurance (91%) and the gaps between rich and poor (74%). An overwhelming
majority (81%) supports an increase in the minimum wage.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
While both candidates express enthusiasm for the growth of international
trade, a huge majority of voters (83%) wants to see this expansion
moderated by other goals-protecting workers, the environment and human
rights-even if this means slowing the growth of the economy.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
While both candidates are speaking in favor of increases in defense
spending, a strong majority (63%) of Americans are interested in
redirecting defense funds to education and other priorities.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
A clear majority considers it "very important" or "somewhat important"
for the candidates to debate some of the foreign policy issues that are
rarely see the light of day on the campaign trail, such as the
comprehensive test ban treaty (80%) and contributing to international
peacekeeping operations (86%). An equally strong majority (81%) wants the
United States to cooperate with other countries through the United Nations. 

</li>
</ul>

<p>The poll asked questions which had been used in previous polls over the
last several years. These questions were asked again to see if the current
political campaign has made much difference in public attitudes.
Surprisingly, The Nation/IPS poll found that voter views and levels of
interest on these issues are generally about as strong as they were in
mid-1999-even though many of the issues tested received scant attention
during the last 12 months of intensive campaigning. 

<p>These questions were neither posed or answered in Boston or in North
Carolina. Mr. Lehrer openly stated at the beginning of the debates, "The
questions and the subjects were chosen by me alone." The lack of democracy
at the debates-the very place where voters are gaining information to elect
their leader-severely undermines the credibility of our electoral system.
Protesters in Boston tried to elevate this basic issue but neither the
media nor the candidates paid them any attention.

<p>By shutting out the critical issues it is no wonder why voters are not
tuning into the debates-nor should it be a surprise that some major
television networks are not even broadcasting the live debates. More
importantly, if citizens don't hear the candidates speak to the issues
affecting their lives, the voter turnout on election day is bound to be slim. 

<p>One way to break out of this tightly controlled format would be to allow
all of the official presidential candidates to take part in the debates.
Instead, the Commission on Presidential Debates, the organization which has
organized the presidential debates since 1988, banned the two minority
candidates-Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan-even though Buchanan has qualified
for federal funding, Nader's public support is greater than five percent,
and a majority of the public wants to see them in the debates. The
Commission, which receives sizeable corporate funding, even had the
audacity to bar Nader, who had a ticket to enter, from sitting in the
audience. Such manipulation of our electoral process undermines our
democratic institutions.

<p>Voters are out ahead of one or both of candidates Bush and Gore in
believing fair trade is more important than free trade, supporting shifting
military spending to other priorities, wanting the U.S. to act as a global
partner with the United Nations, and in democratizing the debate process.
When are the two main presidential candidates and the Commission on Public
Debates going to catch up?
