<p>The Supreme Court's unanimous decision yesterday to
strike down the Massachusetts Burma law says more about the pro-
business bias of the present Court than it does about the legal
principles involved in the case.

<p>The Massachusetts selective purchasing law made it hard
for companies that do business in Burma to win contracts from the
state. It is difficult to see what is wrong with that. After all,
our law respects the concept of consumer sovereignty: as
individuals, we are free to vote with our dollars and refuse
to buy anything from any company that we dislike.

<p>Shouldn't the State of Massachusetts have the same right?

<p>Justice David Souter, writing for the Court, said no. For
him, the Massachusetts Burma law would "compromise the very
capacity of the President to speak for the Nation with one voice in
dealing with other governments."

<p>Well, maybe so. But then, so does the First Amendment to
the Constitution. What would the Court have done if
Massachusetts had passed a resolution condemning Burma's
military government for gross human rights violations? If all 50
states were to pass such resolutions, they might "undermine the
President's capacity. . . for effective diplomacy," as Souter said
about the Massachusetts law. Would the states therefore be forced
to rescind such resolutions?

<p>The 1996 Massachusetts law was intended to support the
movement for democracy in Burma, also known as Myanmar. The
country is ruled by a military government that seized power in
1990, after opposition party candidates won more than 80% of the
contested seats in parliament. The newly elected representatives
were arrested. The military government is internationally
condemned for political murders and imprisonment, burning of
villages, forced labor, and forced relocation of hundreds of
thousands of people.

<p>A few months after Massachusetts passed its law, Congress
authorized federal sanctions against Burma. Although Congress
expressed no intent to preempt the Massachusetts law, the Supreme
Court somehow found that it did.

<p>The argument that states are constitutionally excluded from
participation in foreign affairs is weak. As Justice Scalia noted
during oral arguments, the Constitution's specific prohibitions
against state involvement in wars and treaties "would all be
unnecessary if there was some overriding, unexpressed principle in
the Constitution that states can't get involved in foreign policy."

<p>Souter's concern about the President speaking "for the
Nation with one voice" echoes arguments made by the lawyer for
the National Foreign Trade Council, the consortium of more than
600 companies that won this case. "As trade becomes more
important, it becomes more important for Congress to speak with
one voice."

<p>That "one voice" is the voice of big business, with the
federal government increasingly acting as a mere echo chamber.
Even worse, our government is working overtime to stifle dissent
by transferring power from elected officials to unaccountable,
supra-national institutions.

<p>One of those institutions is the World Trade Organization.
The Court's opinion specifically cites the complaint that the
European Union and Japan have brought against the Massachusetts
law at the WTO, as part of the foreign policy problem that the law
had created. The multi-national corporations that challenged this
law also stressed the conflict with WTO rules, and the WTO case
was clearly a factor in the Court's decision.

<p>The Court's decision therefore has implications for state
and local laws throughout the country that deal with public
purchasing. These include preferences based on human rights,
labor standards, or even environmental standards such as recycled
material in government-purchased goods. Many of these laws are
incompatible with WTO rules, and could lead to similar challenges
in federal court.

<p>That is why Attorneys General from 22 states, as well as 78
members of Congress, local governments, and dozens of non-profit
organizations joined briefs in defense of the Massachusetts law.

<p>It's getting to be a formulaic plot: on the one side, everyone
who has a stake in democracy, human rights, or moral values. On
the other, the relentless pursuit of that "single, unconscionable
freedom-- free trade."

<p>So it's sad to see the whole Supreme Court line up
unanimously on the side of big business. The Court was never
called upon to rule on the legality of the sanctions adopted in the
1980s, by 25 states and 164 local governments, against the
apartheid regime of South Africa. But the implication of this
decision is that the anti-apartheid laws, on which the
Massachusetts Burma law was modeled, would also have been
overturned.

<p>Of course the anti-apartheid sanctions were adopted before
agreements like NAFTA and the WTO had established the
supremacy of trade over all other human concerns.

<p>Welcome to the New World Order.
