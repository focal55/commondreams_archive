Dr. William R. (Reyn) Archer III is the health commissioner for the 
state of Texas. He got into trouble a 
few weeks ago when, in an interview 
with The Times, he made some untoward remarks about Hispanics and 
teen pregnancy.

<p> The remarks proved embarrassing to Gov. George W. Bush, who has 
been running from one photo-op to 
another, posing relentlessly with 
black and brown children and teenagers, trying to show that he and his 
party are not the mortal enemies of 
ethnic minorities.

<p> (The governor's task is not an easy 
one when you consider that Ronald 
Reagan chose to kick off his 1980 
general election campaign in Philadelphia, Miss., which is where the 
civil rights workers Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James 
Chaney were murdered, and that the 
governor's own father, George Herbert Walker Bush, pumped up his 
win over Michael Dukakis in the 1988 
presidential race with the loathsome 
Willie Horton ads.)

<p> So George W. does what he can to 
put a friendlier face on the G.O.P., 
and then he picks up The Times and 
sees that his man, Reyn Archer, is 
blaming the sky-high teen pregnancy 
rate in Texas on the fact that Hispanics lack the cultural belief "that getting pregnant is a bad thing."

<p> Uh-oh.

<p> Said Dr. Archer: "If I were to go to 
a Hispanic community and say, 
'Well, we need to get you into family 
planning,' they say, 'No, I want to be 
pregnant' -- it doesn't work very 
well."

<p> Latinos in Texas were not happy 
about that and neither was George 
W. So before you could say "Let me 
take my Texas-sized foot out of my 
mouth," Reyn Archer was apologizing.

<p> Which might have been fine except 
for the fact that Dr. Archer, a gynecologist, has said so much crazy stuff 
in the past. In the early 1990's, Dr. 
Archer was a deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services, where 
he served as the Bush administration's point person on the so-called 
gag rule, the regulation that barred 
doctors at federally financed family 
planning clinics from discussing 
abortion with women.

<p> Dr. Archer told a Congressional 
hearing that a woman could not even 
be told that a nearby hospital offered 
abortions.

<p> He was asked if that information 
could be provided if the woman's life 
was at stake.

<p> Dr. Archer replied, "No, sir."

<p> On another occasion, Dr. Archer 
was asked about the type of family-planning counseling he gave to the 
women he saw in his private practice. He said, "I would talk to them, 
and if they did not bend to my will, I 
would tell them to go elsewhere."

<p> Dr. Archer is not only a staunch 
foe of abortion, he has objected in the 
past to birth control measures as 
well, most notably the pill. He is 
reported to have said, at a Health 
and Human Services dinner in 1991, 
that "when it became possible for 
women to buy contraceptives on 
their own, men lost their  manhood."

<p> Dr. Archer's appointment as Texas health commissioner was loudly 
applauded by right-wing groups in 
Texas. He has said he likes to look at 
health and other problems with an 
anthropologist's eye, examining the 
customs, behavioral issues and cultural values that might be contributing factors.

<p> The Houston Chronicle recently reported that at an education conference in 1998, Dr. Archer said, "We 
need to figure out why it is when 
blacks were more segregated, and 
had less opportunity, that they did 
better on cultural measures than 
they do in that sense today."

<p> The newspaper said Dr. Archer 
expressed the view that blacks 
"don't buy" such cultural and legal 
institutions as marriage, and that a 
value system that places loyalty 
above honesty might explain why a 
mostly black jury acquitted O. J. 
Simpson.

<p> I could be wrong, but this may not 
be the best way for the Republican 
Party to reach out for black votes.

<p> Dr. Archer has said that he's made 
some mistakes, that some of his 
comments were awkward, and he's 
sorry if he has offended anyone.

<p> A spokesman told me on Friday it 
was never Dr. Archer's intent to criticize or disparage anyone, and that 
he felt "really bad" about the way 
his remarks were perceived.

<p> The doctor's regret was intensified, he said, "by the closeness that 
he felt to Hispanics and to African-Americans."
