<p>Biotech stocks plummeted this week as President Clinton and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair requested that companies make their data on the human genome
public.</p>
<p>Private firms are racing madly to read and patent the genetic code that makes
you you and me me.  They are trying to beat publicly funded labs, which are
required as a condition of their grants to publish the gene sequences they
unravel.  One company, Celera Genomics, is funded by drug companies with the
understanding that the funders will see the code before anyone else does.</p>
<p>If it strikes you as alarming that private investors can patent and keep secret
and sell something that sits within every cell of your body, you ought to pay
much closer attention to the new, jaw-dropping  biotech industry.  I have just
spent several weeks with my students listening to biotech enthusiasts, critics,
and a lot of folks in between.  There were three particular moments I'd like to
tell you about, all of them moments of stunned silence.</p>
<p>The first came when we heard from an ecologist who sits on a USDA panel that
approves the release of genetically engineered crop plants.  Of the 71
applications currently pending, one is for the implantation of the gene by which
scorpions make their toxin.  Splice that gene into a plant, and anything that
nibbles on a leaf, from woodchucks to bugs, falls down dead.  Of course people
who eat the plant fall down dead too, so there must also be a package of genes
to turn the scorpion gene on and off.  Turn it on in the roots and leaves and
stems, turn it off in the flower and fruit.</p>
<p>But what happens to the poison, the students asked, when roots or leaves
decompose in the soil?  What happens if the turn-off gene doesn't work
infallibly?  Would we have to check every fruit or grain for traces of scorpion
poison?</p>
<p>Don't know, said the ecologist.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>The second moment came when a geneticist described a new rice with a pasted-in
gene that allows the plant to make and store beta-carotene, the yellow pigment
from which our bodies make vitamin A.  Thousands of poor children in Asia, who
eat little but rice, go blind or die for lack of vitamin A.  The &quot;golden rice&quot;
could solve that problem.</p>
<p>A hand went up, and one of the students asked, &quot;Why not just splice the
beta-carotene gene into the child?&quot;</p>
<p>Silence.  Finally another visiting expert said, &quot;Within five years that could be
possible.  Fasten your seat belts.&quot;</p>
<p>More silence.  I guess everyone's mind was racing as mine was.  I was picturing
golden children.  Then I thought, why not splice in the gene for chlorophyll
while we're at it, and just send the kids out in the sun to photosynthesize
their lunch?  Gold-green children.</p>
<p>Moment number three came when I showed the students a documentary called &quot;The
Day After Trinity.&quot;  It's the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the developer of
the atomic bomb, told through interviews with some of the great physicists who
worked with him at Los Alamos during the Second World War.</p>
<p>The cause was compelling: to stop Hitler.  The science was thrilling.  The
effort was tremendous.  The bomb was nearing completion when Hitler surrendered
in May, 1945.</p>
<p>That surrender did not cause any slowdown in the work at Los Alamos.  There was
too much excitement.  It was nearly time for the first test, called Trinity,
which took place at Alamagordo, New Mexico, on July 16.  The scientists said
that on that day, as they watched the first atom bomb explosion in history,
their reaction was joyous.  &quot;It worked!&quot;</p>
<p>Less than a month later, when a similar bomb incinerated 100,000 people at
Hiroshima, one scientist said his first thought was, &quot;Thank goodness it wasn't a
dud.&quot;  His second thought was, &quot;Oh my God, what have we done?&quot;</p>
<p>The film ends with Oppenheimer testifying in Washington two decades later.  When
asked by a senator how to contain the nuclear arms race, Oppenheimer answered,
&quot;It's 20 years too late.  We should have done it the day after Trinity.&quot;</p>
<p>I turned on the lights.  The students just sat there.  Didn't move.  Didn't say
a word.  I couldn't either.</p>
<p>Geneticists are already cloning sheep and cows and mice and pigs.  They can pick
out a trait from almost any creature and paste it into any other, and they are
on the verge of being able to turn a gene on or off at will.  We already plant
gene-spliced crops on tens of millions of acres.  We can order genes from
catalogs.  Within a few years we will be able to read the code for our very
selves and reach in and tinker with it.  It is only a matter of time before
hackers appear who think it might be fun, as computer hackers do, to create and
release their own viruses.</p>
<p>The stock market is speculating on this stuff.  National leaders ask companies,
politely, to make their knowledge available to all.  We need to do much more
that, more than just fasten our seatbelts and go along for the ride.  We need to
slow down and think together about where this technology is going and who should
own it and who should decide. </p> 
<p>For genomics it is still the day after Trinity.  We don't want or need to have
to ask, helplessly, &quot;Oh my God, what have we done?&quot; 
<p>
