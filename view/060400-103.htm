Thus far into the presidential campaign, the 
debate over national 
missile defenses  has 
been nothing short of 
surreal.

<p>On the one hand, President Clinton 
and Vice President Gore have been 
promoting a limited defense system 
to protect the nation against attacks 
by rogue states, though the system 
has not been proven and may never 
work reliably. They have also  been 
asking Russia to agree to amend the 
Antiballistic Missile Treaty to permit 
such a system, though the Russians 
have always adamantly opposed such 
an amendment and by all accounts 
will continue to do so at the summit 
meeting today in Moscow.

<p> On the other hand, Gov. George W. 
Bush, backed by such cold war heavyweights as Henry Kissinger, George 
Shultz and Brent Scowcroft, has promised a much more robust national missile defense, though based on technologies he has not yet named. In addition, he has promised deep reductions 
in the American and Russian strategic 
arsenals. The Russians, however, 
have already told us that they see a 
larger defense effort as a threat to 
their nuclear deterrent. The idea that 
they would make deep reductions in 
the face of such effort  defies logic.

<p> Everyone in Washington knows all 
of this, so what is going on? The 
answer, of course, is politics. But it is 
a politics that cannot be understood 
apart from the history of the debate: 
a debate that has never been about 
reality.

<p>  On March 23, 1983,  President Reagan, whose hard-line anti-Soviet policies had by then given rise to the 
largest antinuclear movement in cold 
war history, personally -- and almost 
in secret -- wrote an insert to a routine defense speech,  calling on the 
scientific community to turn its great 
talents to the cause of world peace and 
to give us a means of rendering nuclear weapons "impotent and obsolete." 
In background briefings after the 
speech there was talk of such Buck 
Rogers weaponry as space-based lasers that could destroy the entire Soviet missile fleet. Mr. Reagan's own 
officials, among them Mr. Shultz,  his 
secretary of state,  were appalled, and 
some speculated that the president 
had got the idea from a science fiction 
film. It took them almost a year to 
discover what a stroke of political 
genius the speech insert was.

<p>    Since 1946, opinion polls had shown 
that the vast majority of Americans 
believed that scientists could develop 
a defense against nuclear missiles if 
they put their minds to it. Indeed, 
except when the issue of vulnerability 
was front and center in the news, most 
Americans expressed confidence that 
the United States had a defense 
against nuclear weapons already.

<p> Just two weeks after Mr. Reagan's 
speech, a White House poll  asked 
respondents whether they believed 
scientists could come up with "a really effective  way to destroy Soviet nuclear missiles from space." The answer was, as always, a resounding 
yes. Mr. Reagan certainly expected 
this answer. In addition, he and his 
close aides recognized that because of 
its inherent ambiguity, a defense initiative would appeal to conservatives 
as a way to develop a weapons system 
even while it appealed to the public at 
large as a means to eliminating the 
nuclear threat.

<p>   By the time of Mr. Reagan's re-election in November 1984, all of his 
top officials had lined up behind the 
Star Wars concept. A number of existing research programs were cobbled 
together, and the Strategic Defense 
Initiative was launched with great 
fanfare and much rhetoric about the 
potential of lasers and other exotic 
technologies. Mr. Shultz, Robert 
McFarlane and other moderates in 
the administration wanted to use 
S.D.I. as a bargaining chip for Soviet 
strategic weapons. "It would be like 
giving them the sleeves off our vest," 
Mr. Shultz told the president.

<p>  However, Defense Secretary  Caspar Weinberger, his aide Richard 
Perle and their fellow  hard-liners had 
other ideas. They saw S.D.I. as a way 
to block offensive arms reductions, to 
tear up the 1972 ABM treaty and to 
begin an arms race in defensive as 
well as offensive weapons.

<p>  The two sides brawled for the rest of 
the Reagan administration, and neither succeeded in gaining its ends. In 
the meantime, however, S.D.I. became 
extremely popular in the polls. While 
the hard-liners pleased knowledgeable 
conservatives by blocking strategic 
talks, Mr. Reagan pleased the public 
by offering to share S.D.I. technology 
with the Soviets and promising the 
elimination of nuclear weapons. The 
antinuclear movement, its rhetoric 
stolen, gradually faded away.

<p>  In the past 15 years, the  United 
States has spent $60 billion on antimissile defense research and has yet to 
produce a  workable weapons system. 
An effective defense of the country 
remains wholly elusive. Yet Republican conservatives have continued to 
speak as if exotic technologies were 
ready to jump off the assembly lines 
and have continued to press for a  
deployment of something -- anything 
-- that would irrevocably commit this 
country to an open-ended process of 
developing national missile defenses. 
Congressional Democrats tried to resist the pressure, but their ability to do 
so waxed and waned with their own 
political fortunes and those of the Republican right. In early 1998, or 
around the time the Republicans took 
 their impeachment case against President Clinton to the Senate, the Democrats gave way.

<P>

The previous fall a commission headed by Donald Rumsfeld, a former 
defense secretary,  had 
concluded that "rogue 
states" could acquire 
ballistic missile technologies, and 
North Korea had test-fired a long-range missile out over the Pacific. In 
January the Clinton administration 
pledged financing for the deployment 
of a national missile defense system to 
cope with this  threat. In March the 
Senate, with administration support, 
overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling for a deployment. At the 
time White House officials commented that the administration's support 
for the bill would help to defuse a 
potent political issue for the Republicans in the campaign of 2000. 

<p> Last fall, Mr. Clinton announced he 
would make a final deployment decision this summer -- in the very midst 
of the presidential campaign. This determination clearly had  little to do 
with technology, for the schedule did 
not permit time for adequate testing 
-- and since then one of the two tests 
has failed. Rather, it had to do with the 
fear that the Republicans would call 
Democrats weak on defense. In their 
unsuccessful attempt to persuade the 
Russians to agree to the deployment, 
administration officials assured them 
that they could defeat the system if 
they kept 1,000 or more strategic nuclear weapons on full alert. This was 
hardly a bargain for either country, 
given the decay of the Russian early-warning system and the increasingly 
 real threat of an accidental launch.

<p>  In the midst of these technological 
and diplomatic embarrassments for 
the administration, Governor Bush revived the political issue by calling for 
the entire Reagan program: Star 
Wars, radical nuclear-arms reductions, the de-alerting of nuclear forces 
and  the sharing of antimissile technology with our allies and possibly the 
Russians as well.

<p>  The proposal is, of course, self-contradictory; it is also wildly implausible in that the Pentagon is no more 
likely to agree to give away advanced 
American technology than it ever was, 
and no country except the United 
States can afford an open-ended missile defense program. But then, the 
majority of Americans did not notice 
any of these problems when Mr. Reagan made the proposal 15 years ago.
