EVER SINCE whaling ships discovered warm-blooded oil swimming beneath 
the surface of the Pacific Ocean, the quest for oil has been 
boundless.	 
America's thirst for oil, in particular, has been unquenchable. In 
our own Bay Area, note the endless procession of oil tankers through 
the Golden Gate, the belligerent congestion of sport utility vehicles 
on the road and the glowing smoggy sunsets.
<P>  Business and consumers are addicted to oil and, as a result, the 
industry controls much of the world's power, wealth and environmental 
destiny. The ChevronTexaco Corp. merger, if approved, will create the 
fourth-largest player in this pantheon of corporate influence.	 
</P>
<P> Texaco sprang -- almost literally -- from an oil gusher in Texas 
more than a hundred years ago. Chevron, the Pacific Coast branch of 
Standard Oil, gained prominence in the 1930s with the discovery of 
oil beneath the sands in Saudi Arabia.	 
</P>
<P>  Both Texaco and Chevron have amassed great wealth and carved out 
infamous reputations during the past century. Shareholders are 
obviously excited about the wealth. They should be wary of the 
reputations.	 
</P>
<P>  The merged ChevronTexaco will be the largest company in 
California, controlling 40 percent of the oil-refining business in 
California and generating $80 billion in annual revenues. The merged 
company will save $1 billion in its combined operating expenses. 
These are the numbers The Company and The Street use to define the 
merger. These numbers, however, only tell part of the tale.	 
</P>
<P>There is a social-investing technique called ``best of class.'' It 
measures a company's social performance against its peers, not 
against external benchmarks, such as the environmental impacts of its 
product, environmental reporting and transparency of its operations. 
BritishPetroleum, although guilty of being an oil company, is thought 
by many to represent the ``best of class'' in the energy industry. BP 
is known for its enlightened position on global warming and its 
interest in developing alternative energy.	 
</P>
<P>  Chevron and Texaco, on the other hand, are known primarily for 
their transgressions on a wide range of social issues. The two 
companies, for example, have been forced to settle high-profile 
lawsuits involving gender and racial discrimination, environmental 
racism and worker safety issues. And, as you would expect with two 
major oil refiners, their environmental violations have been 
innumerable.	 
</P>
<P>  In fact, investors in the new Chevron 
Texaco will likely be buying one of the biggest polluters in 
California history and one of the worst in the world, in terms of 
spills, leaks and the release of toxic emissions into the air.	 
</P>
<P>  The record of these two companies is even worse in the developing 
world. Both companies' operations overseas have been surrounded by 
allegations of corruption, exploitation, environmental catastrophe 
and human rights abuses. True, these abuses are endemic to the oil 
business in the developing world. Nonetheless, Chevron and Texaco 
have been implicated from Russia to West Africa to China.	 
</P>
<P>  Apologists dismiss the spills, explosions, toxic leaks and human 
rights abuses as part 
of the business. But over time, the scope and repetition of the 
accusations, violations, admissions of guilt and legal settlements 
define the corporate modus operandi of a company. More often than 
not, this pattern affects the performance of the stock as well.	 
</P>
<P>Chevron and Texaco's record and stock prices speak for themselves. 
Over the past three years, the prices of Chevron's and Texaco's stock 
have lagged far behind BP and the energy sector as a whole on both a 
price-only and reinvested basis. The stakes are high with a merger of 
oil titans because the conduct of big oil companies wreaks havoc on 
everyone, not just shareholders.	 
</P>
<P>  ChevronTexaco will have more political 
power as a merged company. Environmental protection will not on be on 
its agenda. ChevronTexaco will have more power in the marketplace. 
Competition at the pump will not be on its agenda. ChevronTexaco will 
have more influence in the developing world. Sustainable growth and 
supporting democratic societies will not be on its agenda. This 
merger represents a new chapter for these two companies. Investors 
should hope it's not from the same old story.	 

<P><I>Blaine Townsend is the regional manager of Trillium Asset Management Corp., an independent advisory firm that specializes in socially responsible investment.</I>
