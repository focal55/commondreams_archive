Some of the demonstrators in Washington, D.C., last weekend have

been grumbling about press coverage, suggesting that they had "failed" in

their efforts to close the World Bank talks down. I tell them that their

indignation is misplaced, and they are missing the full extent of their

triumph, namely that they have managed to place their issues squarely on

the national and, indeed, global political agenda.

<p>A decade ago, even five years ago, officials of the World Bank and

International Monetary Fund were florid with righteous self-satisfaction

at the good works their institutions were performing around the world.

Listen now to these same officials apologizing for sins of the past and

nervously contending that they are re-engineering themselves as forces

for good.

<p>It's the same on the sweatshop issue. Hardly a month goes by without a

firm like Nike claiming that it is trying to be responsive to the charges

of critics about its pay scales and labor practices in the Third World.

<p>What we've seen in Seattle at the end of last year and now, less

dramatically, in Washington is the flowering of a new radical movement in

America, rambunctious, anarchic, internationalist, well-informed and in

some ways more imaginative and supple than kindred radical eruptions in

earlier decades.

<p>Take a look at some of the threads in this new activist, populist

movement. Start with the Ruckus Society, one of whose founders was Mike

Roselle, a man whose political lineage started with Abbie Hoffman's

Yippies, continued with progressive politics and then ripened in Earth

First!, which he co-founded with Dave Foreman. Roselle has long argued

that large-scale, nonviolent civil disobedience could shut down a city

and take over the theme shows organized by world capital, such as the WTO

conference in Seattle. The Yippies understood street theater and so do

the Ruckusites and the anarchists. They also understand fun, something

the old Left looked at with grave suspicion.

<p>Add to this brew of militant environmentalism and sense of street

theater the concerns of the anti-globalization crowd for economic

justice. In 30 minutes worth of speeches in the Ellipse in Washington

last Sunday, one could hear speakers talk about sweatshops, cancellation

of Third World debt, the menace of biotechnology, unequal exchange in

world trade, labor organizing at the global level.

<p>One issue flows into another, as the Berkeley-based International

Rivers Network discovered years ago. As the IRN battled dams around the

world, it found that dams mostly had one thing in common: financial

backing from the World Bank. So the IRN founded the enormously effective

"50 Years Is Enough" campaign against the bank.

<p>In the same way, defenders of forests around the world found

themselves looking at the World Bank's forest-destroying agricultural

programs and the IMF's Third World "structural adjustment" programs.

<p>As with all new radical movements, some of the bloodlines go back a

long way, to movements of Third World solidarity that started in the

1960s. The anti-NAFTA battles of the early 1990s gave birth to

organizations such as the Naderite Citizens Trade Campaign that were

highly visible both in Seattle and Washington.

<p>There's a new student activism too, markedly different from the gender

and identity concerns of the early 1990s. Across the United States,

campuses are being organized by Students United Against Sweatshops,

bringing in speakers from Global Exchange; the garment workers' union;

and Jeff Ballinger's Press for Change.

<p>What's different about this new movement? It's anti-corporate, but in

a manner far more specific than older railings about "international

capital." We live in the age of the brand name, and so we see

well-informed campaigns against specific companies like Nike, the Gap,

Monsanto. The movement is well-informed and internationalist, a tribute

to the powers of the Internet. It's antagonistic to both the Republican

and Democratic parties. This summer will see big demonstrations at both

party conventions, in Philadelphia as well as Los Angeles.

<p>Perry Anderson, editor of New Left Review, declares with gloomy relish

in that journal that "the only starting point for a realistic Left today

is a lucid registration of historical defeat." Yet as I read these dour

lines, news comes over the radio of a tree-sit in a section of the

Headwaters redwood forest in Humboldt County. A young woman called

Firebird, at time of this writing, is tree-sitting 40 feet up in the air.

She's fixed up a rope with a noose around her neck and the other end tied

to a gate on the ground. If the loggers or their allies launch an attack,

Firebird is in imminent danger of being hanged.

<p>Firebird represents the will and, let's face it, the optimism of the

new radical movement. Hurrah for her and for others like her who battled

the WTO to a standstill in Seattle last fall and who reprised in

Washington last weekend. Hurrah for optimism!
