TORONTO -- Cocooned in the spiral staircase of a downtown bookstore recently, Naomi Klein gleefully 
popped corporate marketing balloons as she brought her war on 
modern corporations to hundreds of 
office workers who had skipped 
lunch to hear a fire-and-brimstone 
treatment of their bosses.

<p> "Branding means selling us our 
desires," said Ms. Klein, whose new 
book, "No Logo," has made her Canada's 29-year-old media meteor and 
the most visible face of a sometimes 
scattershot anti-corporate youth 
movement, which is planning a show 
of force in Washington in mid-April.

<p> "If you listen to Starbucks," she 
said, "we long for community. If you 
listen to Barnes & Noble, we long for 
libraries. If you listen to Microsoft, 
we long for communications."

<p> Her book has become something of 
a movement bible here, staying on 
Canadian best-seller lists since its 
release in January, just weeks after 
days of protests at a World Trade 
Organization meeting in Seattle 
thrust the complaints of her generation before a global audience.

<p> Mixing activism with analysis, she 
has filled university auditoriums, 
has won a column in The Globe and 
Mail and has been kicked off a television debate show by an angry conservative writer.  In the first week of 
April, she will hopscotch from debates in New York to "counter-summits" in Washington, where protesters are preparing to demonstrate at 
meetings of the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund.

<p> While her book is being published 
simultaneously in Australia, Britain 
and the United States (Picador), 
translations are in the works in 
French, German, Italian and Spanish, and a documentary is being negotiated with British filmmakers.

<p> Her war on modern corporations 
boils down to a central theme: as 
companies' marketing budgets become more and more lavish, they 
maintain profit margins by farming 
out manufacturing to sweatshops in 
the poorest corners of the globe. 

<p> In so doing, they break with a 
basic, Henry Ford principle of 20th-century manufacturing: create a 
mass market by paying workers well 
enough so they can buy the products 
they produce.   
At same time, Western 
consumers are the targets of what 
she calls "Big Brother branding."

<p> "My generation has grown up 
completely under the marketing microscope," she said.

<p> Energetic and optimistic, Ms. 
Klein incarnates that generation's 
reinvention of the North American 
left. One of Ms. Klein's grandfathers, 
a Marxist, was fired by Walt Disney 
for trying to unionize the animators 
of "Fantasia." Her parents left the 
United States in the late 1960's to 
protest the Vietnam War, her mother 
becoming a feminist filmmaker and 
her father, a doctor, a supporter of 
Canada's national health system.

<p> As an adolescent in Montreal, she 
rebelled against her socialist parents 
by becoming a self-described "mall 
rat," working after school in a chain 
clothing store. 

<p> At the University of Toronto she 
edited the campus newspaper, becoming, in her words, "Miss P.C." 
She denounced campus violators of a 
lengthening list of "isms." Recalling 
that phase of "identity politics," she 
said, "I watched the left get smaller 
and smaller."

<p> After college she edited This Magazine, a leftist review in Toronto that 
limped along on dwindling circulation. Pulling dusty back issues from 
the stacks, she discovered that once 
upon a time there was "a movement 
on the left."

<p> At the same time, she remembered that when advertisements 
started to infiltrate bathroom stalls 
at the University of Toronto, students fought back, wielding felt-tip 
pens against the omnipresence of 
marketing. 

<p> Four years later, her book contains some of her favorite "culture 
jamming" examples: perky models 
morphed into skulls; Nike's "Just Do 
It" slogan tweaked into "Justice. Do 
It"; Apple Computers' "Think Different" campaign mysteriously embellished with a photo of Stalin and 
the ominous slogan "Think Really 
Different."

<p> Gloria Steinem recalls watching 
Ms. Klein at a book promotion in 
New York, handing out little cutting 
tools to allow people to cut designer 
labels off their clothes.

<p> "In the women's movement, in the 
labor-left movement, we focused on 
how much money was earned and by 
whom," said Ms. Steinem, who has 
published Ms. Klein's essays in Ms. 
magazine. "Now, Naomi is focusing 
on the next step, which is how the 
money is spent."

<p> The resonance of Ms. Klein's ideas 
speaks volumes here about how Canada sees itself today.

<p> While Americans generally see 
Canadians as economic equals, Canada missed the American boom of 
the 1990's. After a decade of economic stagnation, Canadian per capita 
income fell in 1998 to $16,487, or 13 
percent below that of Mississippi, the 
poorest American state.

<p> At the same time, Canada has 
moved away from the isolated, nationalist economy of years past. In 
the last 15 years, foreign investors 
have roughly tripled their holdings in 
Canada, controlling about 13,000 corporations, which are worth about 
$500 billion and responsible for about 
a third of the country's corporate 
profits.   
Once an economic hinterland, Canada became the industrialized world's most trade-dependent 
country in the 1990's, with 43 percent 
of its economy tied to trade.

<p> In such an economy, Ms. Klein's 
anti-multinational message has appealed to people who complain of a 
loss of local economic control.

<p> "Canadians feel a little bit on the 
sidelines in the way the global economy is changing," said Paul Tough, 
who published many of Ms. Klein's 
essays in Saturday Night, an intellectual monthly here. "In the states you 
feel you are in the center. In Canada 
sometimes you feel you are in the 
center, but sometimes you feel you 
are in Indonesia, the Philippines or 
somewhere where you are being acted upon, not acting."

<p> It is that kind of anti-corporate, 
anti-marketing anger that boiled 
over in Seattle. "The real anarchists 
in Seattle," Ms. Klein said, "were the 
businessmen, who were saying, 'We 
don't want any rules.' "

<p> Then, warning that her generation's activists are not going to abandon their critique of laissez-faire 
globalism, she looked ahead to another meeting of World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund, in 
Prague in September, and predicted 
with ill-disguised glee, "Prague is 
going to be nuts."
