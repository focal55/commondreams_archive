Once, returning from a trip to Asia, a U.S. Customs inspector at
LAX marked "A" in capital letters on my customs declaration and circled
it. Oh my God, how did he know? But instead of marking me as an
anarchist, the designation turned out to be A for agriculture, since I
had just visited Vietnam, considered a rural region ripe for bug
infestation. I was asked to go through agricultural inspection.
<p>In this new millennium, in the post-Seattle World Trade Organization
protests era, the specter of hordes of black-clad, masked anarchists
running wild in Los Angeles during the Democratic convention has evoked
fear that downtown L.A. will suffer the same fate as Seattle's downtown.
City fathers have joined with law enforcement to try to isolate and limit
the area where protesters can gather, with civil liberties groups
successfully challenging many of the limits.
<p>But if what happened in Philadelphia during the GOP convention is any
guide, law enforcement in Southern California, like their brethren in the
City of Brotherly Love, will say, "Civil rights be damned," and be
tempted to engage in preemptive strikes against the protesters.
<p>L.A. Police Chief Bernard C. Parks is not likely to ignore the law
enforcement lessons from Philadelphia with city fathers there extolling
their success in preventing protesters from shutting down the convention.
Police there targeted protest leaders like John Sellers, the founder of
the Berkeley-based civil disobedience training group, the Ruckus Society,
who initially was hit with an incredible $1-million bail (later
lowered)--an amount typically reserved for serial killers, not those
accused of misdemeanors. Most of the protesters were rounded up before
they did anything, in a sort of preventive detention one would have
thought was barred by the U.S. Constitution. L.A. will appear lax in not
copying that successful tactic.
<p>Such "proactive" law enforcement makes a mockery of constitutional
guarantees of freedoms of assembly and speech. Watching the video and
reading the news accounts on alternative Web sites about the widespread
civil rights violations perpetrated by Philadelphia's Finest, I could not
help wondering if the birthplace of the U.S. Constitution and the city
that houses the Liberty Bell had not become another urban enclave in a
banana republic where dissidents were routinely locked up.
<p>Since Seattle, anarchists have become American society's latest
nightmare. Young people are convenient scapegoats in an era where even
rights for adults are fast becoming a scarce commodity--witness the fact
that few workers have any recourse to employers snooping on their e-mail.
<p>On "Subversity," my KUCI radio show, I've interviewed Orange County
anarchist youth who are part of the August Collective, a group organizing
a weeklong North American anarchist conference that overlaps the
Democratic convention. These scions of Orange County's working families
are not zonked-out kids out to do wanton violence. Indeed, among
anarchists themselves there is no consensus that violence is the right
tactic. Some like pointing out that there is a difference between
violence against people and that against property. Yet others worry that
any violence will only incur a violent police crackdown, with the
anarchist message lost in the turmoil.
<p>To be sure, the image of masked protesters does bring fear to those in
power. Intimidation, after all, is one of the purposes of wearing the
masks, as in hiding the identity of the wearer. But the anarchists I
talked with also point out that police themselves often pull down the
face shields on their riot-gear helmets and turn over their badges,
thereby effectively preventing identification. So, they argue, they are
just borrowing a tactic used by the cops.
<p>Like their ideological predecessors from the student protests of the
'60s, the anarchists I know are disgusted with their parents' generation
and abhor the capitalist values that dominate conventional politics.
Authorities in L.A. need to sit back, reflect and not be panicked into a
constitutional blunder that would take years and lawsuits to untangle.
These children of the dot.com generation have an important message that
needs to be given voice: We don't want to be cogs in a global capitalist
machine.
<p>As for my agriculture inspection, I passed with flying colors.
