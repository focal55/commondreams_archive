Once again we are being offered a
ballistic-missile-pig-in-a-national-defense poke. This time the proposal
being considered by the Clinton administration is much reduced from the
missile defense systems of the 1970s or the unrealistic impenetrable
umbrella of "Star Wars" in the 1980s. It is purported to be the national
missile defense system, designed to protect the nation from an attack by
a few intercontinental ballistic missiles launched by a rogue state--code
words for Iraq, Iran, possible Libya and in particular North Korea--or
from an accidental launch of a missile from Russia or China.
<p>In all the tests of the current design, the system has performed
poorly--often failing totally--even though the tests have been far from
realistic. In particular, the testers always know weeks in advance when
the attack is coming--knowledge that would be lacking in a real surprise
attack. If the test operators decide they are not ready, they simply
postpone the test. Even more serious is the failure to test against the
kinds of countermeasures that would surely be employed by any nation
capable of building ballistic missiles--for example, hiding the warhead
in a cloud of indistinguishable decoys. There is also a tactic against
which it is virtually impossible to test and against which the whole NMD
fails catastrophically: A warhead carrying chemical or biological agents
that disperses the payload in the form of hundreds of bomblets right
after booster burnout would overwhelm the defense. In sum, the tests
already carried out or planned are so unrealistic that they fail to
provide any basis for the deployment decision promised by President
Clinton for this summer.
<p>Of course, there are many other ways besides ballistic missiles to
deliver weapons of mass destruction to American targets. These include by
airplane (to date the only way that such weapons have in fact been
delivered), by cruise missile (really just a pilotless airplane) and by
ship, either directly into a harbor or through the use of short-range
missiles, or by smuggling it in. As the joke goes: Just hide it in a bale
of marijuana and it is sure to get through.
<p>Finally, consider the impact of an NMD deployment on our European
allies and on China and Russia. The Europeans could interpret this as
evidence of our fortress mentality and consider that it shows our reduced
willingness to help them defend themselves against rogues or others if we
ourselves are relatively impregnable. China and Russia may very well
overestimate the efficacy of the proposed NMD and therefore feel the need
to increase their offensive forces. Indeed, China has already made such a
statement.
<p>Worst of all, the NMD deployment cannot be carried out without
violating the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty or persuading Russia to
join us in abandoning this treaty, which forbids the construction of a
national missile defense. The ABM treaty has served as the cornerstone
for all subsequent arms reduction treaties, including START I, START II
and a potential START III. When completed, those treaties would decrease
significantly the number of weapons currently aimed at the U.S. and
Russia. Moreover, the restraint shown in establishing and maintaining all
these treaties is an essential part of our efforts to convince other
important powers to reduce or even eliminate their nuclear weapon
stockpiles.
<p>It would be tragic were we to proceed with deployment of a missile
defense system that would be very costly (estimates range up to $60
billion), would be totally ineffective and would threaten to revive an
arms buildup that we are just now getting under control.
