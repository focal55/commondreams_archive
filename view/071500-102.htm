GOSHEN, INDIANA - I Didn't go to see the local Independence Day fireworks display this year. It would have been too much of a reminder of the different type of fireworks occurring on the island of Vieques, off the coast of Puerto Rico.<P>

 The fireworks on Vieques are not a celebration of freedom. Instead, the U.S. Navy's bombardment of the island, which shakes people's homes, threatens their health and killed a civilian security guard in April 1999, serves as a powerful reminder to the residents there that, although they are U.S. citizens, they are not free.<P>

 
The Navy expropriated the land during World War II. About 10,000 people now live in the center of the island, surrounded by a munitions storage area and a bombing range for the Navy's Atlantic Fleet.<P>

 
I spent a week on the 21-mile-long island in May with a delegation from Christian Peacemaker Teams, an organization committed to "getting in the way" of the Navy's planned exercises. We joined local Christian leaders camping in the military zone; their protests had already succeeded in halting military exercises there for a year.<P>

 
These local organizations feared that the United States would attempt to remove them in advance of the resumption of the military exercises. They were right.<P>

 
U.S. marshals did indeed come and remove the protesters, including me. Despite continued protests -- more than 600 demonstrators have been removed since early May -- the bombing on Vieques has continued.<P>

 
And so have the protests. Every few days, another group of 20 or 50 people enter the Navy's land. They are committed to a cause that they believe is just. The people who have camped on the bombing range have worked together in many ways. <P>

 
Possibly, the most dramatic sight was the construction of an ecumenical chapel, built by Protestants, Catholics and Pentecostals. Its tall white cross stands beside the bombing range.<P>

 
As far as I know, the chapel remains. Or perhaps it will be bombed or dismantled. But the spirit of nonviolent resistance -- not merely "anti-military flower children," as one writer dubbed us -- will live on.<P>

 
In contrast to the violent revolution our nation celebrated earlier this month, the Vieques protesters are following the nonviolent way of Jesus, Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., carrying on their revolution through civil disobedience.<P>

 
President Clinton, the Navy and the governor of Puerto Rico recently reached a compromise that calls for a referendum on the Navy's continued use of Vieques Island in three years. But during those three years, concrete-filled bombs will continue to drop, shaking homes, destroying wildlife, reminding the island's population who truly controls their lives.<P>

 
It is time for the government to stop being a colonial power. The Navy should cease its operations immediately, clean up its mess and return Vieques to its rightful owners. Such actions would be a true celebration of independence.<P>
