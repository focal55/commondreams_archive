The formula for American media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict is simple: Report on the latest developments in the fragile "peace 
process." Depict U.S. officials as honest brokers in the negotiations. 
Emphasize the need for restraint and compromise instead of instability and 
bloodshed.

<p>In the world according to news media, the U.S. government is 
situated on high moral ground -- in contrast to some of the intractable 
adversaries. "The conflict that had been so elaborately dressed in the 
civilizing cloak of a peace effort has been stripped to its barest essence: 
Jew against Arab, Arab against Jew," the New York Times reported from 
Jerusalem.

<p>Soon afterwards, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright proclaimed: 
"The cycle of violence has to be stopped." Such pronouncements from 
Washington get a lot of respectful media play in our country.

<p>Rarely do American journalists explore the ample reasons to 
believe that the United States is part of the oft-decried cycle of 
violence. Nor, in the first half of October, was there much media analysis 
of the fact that the violence overwhelmingly struck at Palestinian people.

<p>Within a period of days, several dozen Palestinians were killed by 
heavily armed men in uniform -- often described by CNN and other news 
outlets as "Israeli security forces." Under the circumstances, it's a 
notably benign-sounding term for an army that shoots down protesters.

<p>As for the rock-throwing Palestinians, I have never seen or heard 
a single American news account describing them as "pro-democracy 
demonstrators." Yet that would be an appropriate way to refer to people who 
-- after more than three decades of living under occupation -- are in the 
streets to demand self-determination.

<p>While Israeli soldiers and police, with their vastly superior 
firepower, do most of the killing, Israel's public-relations engines keep 
whirling like well-oiled tops. Early this month, tilted by the usual spin, 
American news stories highlighted the specious ultimatums issued by Prime 
Minister Ehud Barak as he demanded that Palestinians end the violence -- 
while uniformed Israelis under his authority continued to kill them.

<p>Beneath the Israeli "peace process" rhetoric echoed by American 
media, an implicit message isn't hard to discern: If only Palestinians 
would stop resisting the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, it would no 
longer be necessary for Israeli forces to shoot them.

<p>"Israel Extends Time For Peace," said the lead headline on the 
Oct. 10 front page of USA Today. "Israel early today extended a deadline 
for Palestinians to end rioting," the article began. At this rate, we may 
someday see a headline that reads: "Israel Demands Palestinians Stop 
Attacking Bullets With Their Bodies."

<p>Of course, amid all the nifty Orwellian touches, the proper 
behavior of people whose homeland remains under occupation has never quite 
been spelled out. But U.S. media coverage has reflexively mimicked the 
themes coming out of the White House and State Department. It all makes 
sense -- as long as we set aside basic concepts of human rights -- as long 
as we refuse to acknowledge that without justice there can be no real peace.

<p>For American journalists on mainstream career ladders, it's 
prudent to avoid making a big deal about Israel's human rights violations, 
which persist without letup in tandem with Israel's occupation of land it 
captured in the 1967 war. Many pundits are fond of cloaking the occupiers 
in mantles of righteousness. And we hear few questions raised about the 
fact that the occupiers enjoy the powerful backing of the United States.

<p>The silence is usually deafening, even among journalists who write 
opinion columns on a regular basis. The U.S. government's economic and 
military assistance to Israel adds up to a few billion dollars per year. 
Among media professionals, that aid is widely seen as an untouchable "third 
rail." To challenge U.S. support for Israel is to invite a torrent of 
denunciations -- first and foremost, the accusation of "anti-Semitism."

<p>Occasionally, I've written columns criticizing U.S. media for 
strong pro-Israel bias in news reporting and spectrums of commentary. Every 
time, I can count on a flurry of angry letters that accuse me of being 
anti-Semitic. It's a timeworn, knee-jerk tactic: Whenever someone makes a 
coherent critique of Israel's policies, immediately go on the attack with 
charges of anti-Jewish bigotry.

<p>Numerous American supporters of Israel resort to this tactic. 
Perhaps the difficulties of defending the Israeli occupation on its merits 
have encouraged substitution of the "anti-Semitic" epithet for reasoned debate.

<p>Like quite a few other Jewish Americans, I'm appalled by what 
Israel is doing with U.S. tax dollars. Meanwhile, as journalists go along 
to get along, they diminish the humanity of us all.

<p>"Ask not for whom the bell tolls."

Highly Deceptive Media."</i>
