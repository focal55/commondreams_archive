<p>International Women's Day coincides with an international gathering of women's-rights activists today in New York City. Convened by the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, women from around the globe are gathering to assess their nations' progress in implementing the Beijing Platform for Action.
<p>Tracing our independence to 1776, U.S. citizens like to think of our nation as the oldest and the most advanced democracy in the modern world. But with respect to women's full citizenship, the United States has not yet fulfilled the promise of democracy. Although women constitute the majority of the population and the majority of registered voters, women have not realized the goal of majority rule.
<P>

   At the outset of the 21st century, women hold only: 12 percent of the seats in the 106th Congress, 22 percent of the seats in legislatures, 6 percent of the nation's 50 governorships, 36 percent of the offices of lieutenant governor, 27 percent of other statewide elective executive offices, 29.8 percent of gubernatorial appointments to state agencies, boards and commissions, 19 percent of the mayoral offices in cities with populations larger than 30,000, and 13.9 percent of the federal judiciary.
<P>

   The persistent under-representation of women in governance is seldom mentioned in American public life and even more seldom conceptualized as a political issue or a problem of democracy. Many citizens assume the absence of women in decision-making is a result either of women's lack of qualifications for public office or decisions made by women to choose other outlets for their energy and talents.
<P>

   Thirty years of research in the field of women and politics, however, suggests there are better explanations for women's under-representation. Institutional barriers, such as the nature of the electoral system, party recruitment practices and incumbency advantages contribute significantly to the absence of women from public offices. Institutional barriers are the product of political decisions and are subject to political change.
<P>

   In many nations around the world, political leaders and political parties have made concerted efforts to eliminate the obstacles to women's full participation in democracy. According to data gathered by the Interparliamentary Union, the United States lags behind 32 other nations that have elected women to the highest executive offices -- president and prime minister -- and 42 nations in terms of percentages of women elected to legislative offices.
<P>

   In 1995 at the Fourth World Conference on Women, the United States committed itself the goal of gender balance in governmental bodies and committees, as well as in public administrative entities, and in the judiciary. The ``Report of the President's Interagency Council on Women'' prepared for the United Nations' Beijing Plus 5 Review documents efforts made by the U.S. government to promote gender balance in governance overseas. But what efforts have been made at home?
<P>

   The Beijing Platform recommends a range of strategies to increase the number and percentages of women in decision making, including: encouraging political parties to integrate women in elective and nonelective positions in the same proportion and at the same levels as men; taking positive action to build a critical mass of women leaders; restructuring recruitment and career-development programs to ensure that all women, especially young ones, have equal access to managerial, entrepreneurial, technical and leadership training; and developing career-advancement programs for women of all ages that include career planning, tracking, mentoring, coaching and retraining.
<P>

   The U.S. response to the U.N. ``Questionnaire on the Implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action'' makes no reference to gender-balance initiatives either at the federal level or within the states. Attacks on affirmative action are gaining political momentum in several states; efforts to achieve gender parity in public office are not.
<P>

   When members of the National Women's Party began picketing the White House in 1917 in support of women's full citizenship, their placards asked, ``How long must women wait for liberty?'' As long as the liberty to participate fully in all tiers of governance eludes American women, we would do well to heed another well-known suffrage message, ``Democracy begins at home.''<SNML_TAGLINE>
