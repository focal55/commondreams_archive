A few years ago, a surprisingly frank 
encounter with a pharmaceutical salesman made me see prescription 
drugs in a new light. At a cafe in San Francisco's Castro District, 
an impeccably dressed young man sat next to me and struck up 
a conversation.
<P> ``I've always wanted to live in San Francisco,'' 
he told me. ``The job's tough, though. I sell physicians a new 
drug to treat CMV retinitus in AIDS patients. The trouble is, 
the other drug is better, with fewer side effects.''	 
</P>
<P> A look of discomfort momentarily clouded the young man's bright 
expression. Then it passed. ``Oh well,'' he said, ``a job's 
a job.''	 
</P>
<P> I have often thought of this conversation while 
reading about South African President Thabo Mbeki's controversial 
views on AIDS and his strained relations with AIDS drug makers. 
Mbeki has made headlines recently by making sympathetic comments 
about ``AIDS dissidents'' who claim HIV is not the cause of 
AIDS and by claiming that AIDS drugs are too toxic and expensive.	 
</P>
<P> But instead of being put off by his comments, American observers 
should take Mbeki's criticisms about the drawbacks of AIDS drugs 
seriously. Given the Third World context within which they are 
made, his suspicion of pharmaceutical companies is understandable.	 
</P>
<P> Furthermore, on closer analysis, Mbeki's comments apply to 
America's overall health care situation as much as they do to 
Africa's. As America is beginning to discover --  witness the 
current national outcry over our high prescription drug prices 
relative to other countries' --  a little more scrutiny of pharmaceutical 
companies may be just what the doctor ordered.	 
</P>
<P> Although most Americans are unaware of it, Mbeki's comments are just 
the latest complaint about drug companies made by poor countries. 
Third World countries have long argued that the market forces 
driving medical research have caused pharmaceutical firms to 
ignore the pressing health needs of poor countries that cannot 
pay the prices necessary to recoup research costs.	 
</P>
<P> Their complaints have been backed in recent years by influential Western 
observers. Doctors Without Borders, last year's Nobel Peace 
Prize winner, has criticized the lack of corporate interest 
in Third World health problems. Project Censored, a media watchdog 
group, lists the lack of pharmaceutical research in tropical 
diseases high on its Top 10 list of news stories underreported 
by the media.	 
</P>
<P> Third World governments and Western critics 
back their claims with some pretty revealing statistics. North 
America, Europe and Japan together account for 80 percent of 
pharmaceutical sales, valued at $303 billion a year, while Africa 
generates only 1 percent, according to IMS Health, a market 
research firm covering the field.	 
</P>
<P> The numbers precisely 
reflect this overwhelming industry focus on Western health needs. 
According to a recent study by Doctor Without Borders, only 
1 percent of medicines patented between 1975 and 1997 --  13 
drugs out of a total of 1,233 --  were for tropical diseases.	 
</P>
<P> This despite the fact that World Health Organization (WHO) 
statistics show that tropical diseases afflict hundreds of millions 
of people (there are an estimated 300 million to 500 million 
cases of malaria alone each year) and threaten several billion. 
Most of the afflicted live in Africa, with growing numbers in 
Asia, Latin America and former nations of the Soviet Union.	 
</P>
<P> The consequences of such skewed statistics are grim. According 
to Doctors Without Borders, the majority of tropical medicines 
were developed more than 40 years ago. Many are no longer effective, 
due to the mutation of microbes into drug-resistant strains, 
or are being discontinued due to lack of profitability.	 
</P>
<P>Sleeping sickness, a tropical disease caused by the tsetse 
fly, is a good example of pharmaceutical neglect. A major scourge 
of Africa, sleeping sickness often causes lasting neurological 
disorders, even when treated. An estimated 300,000 to 500,000 
people contract the illness every year. Untreated, it is overwhelmingly 
lethal.	 
</P>
<P> Melarsoprol, the only treatment for the advanced 
state of sleeping sickness, was developed more than 70 years 
ago. The drug is painful to ingest --  arsenic and antifreeze 
are literally its two key ingredients --  and it kills 5 percent 
of those treated with it. Worse yet, a strain of Melarsoprol-resistant 
sleeping sickness is spreading, and the only replacement therapy, 
Ornidyl, is four times as expensive.	 
</P>
<P> The response of drug 
companies? Aventis, the European company making Ornidyl, which 
was originally developed to fight cancer, has discontinued production 
of the medication due to lack of profitibility, ceding the patent 
rights over to the WHO to seek a new manufacturer (which it 
has not yet done).	 
</P>
<P> To explain his company's actions, an 
Aventis spokesman told the New York Times: ``We know what's 
happening in the Third World, but we don't act. We can't deny 
that we try to focus on top markets --  cardiovascular, metabolism, 
anti-infection, etc. But we're an industry in a competitive 
environment --  we have a commitment to deliver performance 
for shareholders.''	 
</P>
<P> Meanwhile, WHO estimates that 60 million 
people are at risk of infection in 36 sub-Saharan countries, 
most of them among the poorest nations in the world.	 
</P>
<P> Given this dearth of drug research and development for tropical diseases, 
President Mbeki's claims that current AIDS drugs are not tailored 
to fit the unique aspects of Africa's AIDS epidemic situation 
make more sense. After all, in Africa, the epidemic is fueled 
by a different strain of HIV than in the West, and possesses 
significant differences, such as spreading along heterosexual 
lines.	 
</P>
<P> The absence of new, specifically designed drugs 
is not the only problem undeveloped countries face. Modern medicines 
are simply too expensive for poor countries, with AIDS drugs 
being a perfect example. Even at an 85 percent discount offered 
by drug companies in response to Mbeki's criticisms, South Africa 
would still have to spend more than its entire health budget 
to pay for enough AIDS drugs to treat its infected citizens.	 
</P>
<P> Even drugs that have been donated to poor countries --  in 
response to a humanitarian crisis, for example --  have been 
a mixed blessing. Doctors Without Borders has documented many 
examples of ``drug dumping,'' in which drug companies donate 
pharmaceuticals that are obsolete or expired, thereby avoiding 
costly destruction or storage costs, emptying inventories and 
often reaping substantial tax breaks.	 
</P>
<P> Finally, even when 
poor countries get the right drugs at the right price, misleading 
advertising and inexperience can cause citizens to use them 
in the wrong way. In the Philippines, anthropologists have documented 
how advertisements have led to the view that a tuberculosis 
drug is a ``lung vitamin.'' The subsequent misuse and overuse 
of the medicine has created precisely the type of situation 
that breeds drug-resistant TB strains, a growing problem around 
the world. If AIDS drugs were used similarly in Africa, which 
has huge segments of the population with no experience with 
modern health services at all, the results would be disastrous. 
As America and the West are sadly discovering, adherence to 
the AIDS-cocktail regime is extremely difficult under the best 
circumstances, and drug-resistant strains of HIV, as a result, 
are increasingly common.	 
</P>
<P> Drug companies freely admit that 
because poor countries cannot pay the high prices necessary 
to recoup development costs, it is not feasible to put resources 
into research on tropical diseases.	 
</P>
<P> As the Aventis spokesman 
pointed out, pharmaceutical companies are commercial, not philanthropic, 
organizations operating in an intensely competitive climate. 
They are not set up to donate large sums of money and resources 
to counter the bad health conditions in poor countries --  that 
is the role of rich nations like the United States and international 
bodies like the United Nations. Drug companies, spokespeople 
point out, need to think of their shareholders and the bottom 
line.	 
</P>
<P> The question for Westerners, besides how to deal 
morally with the resulting neglect of so much of humanity, is 
whether the need for profits is also undermining our own health 
care.	 
</P>
<P> A brief look at our national situation is not encouraging. 
The pharmaceutical presence in the West is the flip side of 
Third World experience: Whereas poor countries lack drugs for 
dire diseases, the West has access to drugs for nearly every 
affliction, no matter how trivial or better served by other 
methods of redress.	 
</P>
<P> The top-selling drugs in the U.S. are 
for ailments like gastronomic ills and high cholesterol, which, 
although they are important problems, could be better addressed 
at the root cause with changes in diet and behaviors. Likewise, 
top-sellers like Viagra and the new anti-depressants may be 
contributing to a ``pill-for-every-problem'' ethos overtaking 
our health-care system.	 
</P>
<P> And this takeover seems to be accelerating. 
Due to changes in advertising laws and Food and Drug Administration 
testing procedures, --  lobbied for intensively by drug companies 
in the mid '90s --  new drugs are now sped into development 
with vastly shortened safety trials. These drugs are now marketed 
directly to customers through slick television advertising. 
Last year, drug companies spent $13.9 billion promoting their 
products, with amounts spent for direct pitches to consumers 
rising by 40 percent over the year before.	 
</P>
<P> In addition, it is not clear that this increasing reliance on drugs is good 
for our health. Remember fen-phen? Furthermore, the widespread 
use of antibiotics is producing drug-resistant strains of all 
sorts of diseases, creating a grave danger of future plagues. 
Meanwhile, rates of death and injuries due to mistakes in drug-dispensing 
and to toxic drug interactions are skyrocketing.	 
</P>
<P> Finally, this reliance on pharmaceuticals in the West has produced a 
great shift in the spending of health-care money. According 
to IMS Health, spending for prescription drugs more than doubled 
in the last decade, from $37.7 billion in 1990 to $78.9 billion 
in 1997. No wonder Fortune magazine has called the pharmaceutical 
field the country's most profitable industry, with profits rising 
22 percent in 1997 and 21 percent in 1998.	 
</P>
<P> As Americans begin to discuss the ramifications of the growing 
pharmaceutical presence in our lives, such as high prescription prices and 
adverse effects of multiple drug use, one thing seems clear: 
The era of Marcus Welby, M.D., the caring TV family doctor of 
a generation ago, is long gone, replaced by the smiling face 
of a pharmaceutical salesman with a new pill to sell.
