It should be apparent why  few people watched the Republican National Convention last week and why an  equally small number will  tune in next week when  Democrats put on their  show in the show biz capital.  And it has nothing to do  with lack of drama. 
<P>     In fact, it's so simple that  it's amazing convention  planners haven't been able to figure it  out: Americans have been spoiled by  the outbreak of truth in advertising,  and won't watch anything less. 
<P>     In an age when everything from  college bowl games to the weather  forecast have been openly brought to  us by a sponsor, anything that doesn't  come with a corporate name attached  just doesn't cut it. 
<P>     Remember those quaint old days  when we got up on New Year's and  just watched the Cotton Bowl? Now  it's the Q-Tip Cotton Bowl, the Minute Maid Orange Bowl and the Ben  Gay Master's golf series. And the  weather is brought to you by Totes. 
<P>     So how can you expect voters to  get excited about an election if democracy can't even attract a big-name  sponsor? 
<P>     The irony, of course, is that both  conventions have attracted all kinds of  sponsors. But for some  strange reason, they  want to keep it hush-hush. Go figure. 
<P>     This was especially  strange for Republicans, who always bray  about making government operate like the  private sector. 
<P>     Just imagine if Texas  oilman George W.  Bush had come out  wearing a Quaker State  jacket and Valvoline  cap, and unveiled the  slogan, &quot;Change your  oil every 3,000 miles and your president every four years!&quot; Millions would  have tuned in to see that. 
<P>     Or suppose the GOP had let the  Disney Corp. burnish its image as experts in fantasy by putting mouse ears  on Dick Cheney as he explained his  voting record? 
<P>     It would have been much more  honest than what actually went on in  Philadelphia, or what will occur next  week in Hollywood, as corporations  stealthily buy access by sponsoring  luncheons and parties - but do it all  in private. They fete lawmakers, committee chairmen and top advisers and  then ferry them around town in free  Cadillacs and SUVs. Some corporations have even stopped giving soft  money, finding this direct aid more effective. 
<P>     But the soft money is still there,  too, as evidenced by the $250,000 contributions it took to get into the well-guarded &quot;Republican Regents&quot; events  or the $350,000 admission fee to the  Democrats' private &quot;Leadership 2000&quot;  shindigs next week. 
<P>     Firms like General Motors, Microsoft and UPS are financing  access in all sorts of imaginative ways while collaborating  with the parties to hide the  fact that they're buying themselves a candidate. The public  sees red, white and blue balloons in the convention hall  while greenbacks speak loudly in the private parties. 
<P>     But the question is, &quot;Why  the secrecy?&quot; With 15,000 reporters  on hand, why pick this moment to get  shy about democracy? 
<P>     After all, if there's anything Americans love as much as honesty, it's getting something for free. If we could  plainly see who's buying our government for us, it would make the whole  process all the more appealing for TV  viewers. 
<P>     That gives Al Gore a unique opportunity to one-up the GOP and put  the genius of advertising to work for  the Democrats. When Gore gets to  the obligatory part of his speech -  you know, the part where he tells  about being personally moved by  some constituent - he can lower his  Southern drawl, look earnestly into  the camera, and tell the audience that  &quot;AT&amp;T reached out and touched  me.&quot; 
<P>     It would be the perfect acknowledgment of the phone  giant's $1 million contribution to each convention - and it would  make an unforgetable  Kodak moment. 
<P>     And while the Republicans talked of inclusion, Democrats  could walk the walk by  having morally-straight  VP nominee Joe Lieberman saunter over to  the Playboy Mansion  for the Democratic gala  being put on by the  girlie mag. 
<P>     You don't think openly embracing  that kind of sponsorship would entice  viewers? When it comes to getting the  public aroused, it's like Bill Clinton always says: Honesty is the best policy. 
<P>     Yet the candidates seem afraid to  openly wrap themselves in sponsors'  logos, no doubt because they underestimate the American public. Just as  the Europeans act like grown-ups  when it comes to sex and politics, we  are sophisticated when it comes to  money and politics. We already know  what goes on behind the scenes, and  we don't care - as long as we don't  have to pay for it. 
<P>     The good-government nags may  want public funding, but the rest of us  just want a good show. In an age when  we're used to product placement and  direct sponsorship of parades, concerts and public buildings, why should  democracy be any different? If we  want to end the apathy, let's end the  charade and make the conventions as  honest as everything else on television.
