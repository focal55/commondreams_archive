<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. military ban on openly gay soldiers will be lifted. That's inevitable. Discrimination that violates the very ideals that our armed forces are supposed to defend simply won't be allowed to continue forever. Yet it would be naive to think that lifting the unAmerican ban won't cause any trouble.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

How can we minimize the disruption?</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

With public support for gay military people steadily rising, that's the question all of us who believe in a strong national defense should be asking. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Jan. 28 found overwhelming voter support - 74 percent to 22 percent - for gays in the military. Most civilians - 56 percent versus 37 percent - favor letting gay people serve openly, according to a new report by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies, an academic think tank focused on the military.</font>
<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The trend in public opinion may be irreversible. So, the wise military leader looks at this and says, OK, we can either do this on our terms, or the terms can be dictated to us. Let's get out front and craft a policy that would be the least disruptive to military effectiveness," observes Duke University political scientist Peter Feaver, co-author of a 1,100-page Triangle Institute study of gaps between civilian and military attitudes on many issues.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The six-year-old "don't ask, don't tell" law really is the first step toward ending the ban because it established the right of gay Americans to serve - though only in silence. And, in an overdue but critical milestone on Feb. 1, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered every service member - from general to private - to attend training sessions stressing that anti-gay slurs and harassment are forbidden, and that violators will be punished.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Neither Feaver nor his report takes a position on the ban. But he and his fellow researchers offered me valuable insights into how lifting it could be done as smoothly as possible:</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Opposition to the ban would need to be even stronger, cross party lines in Congress and include some of the military's most ardent allies, they said. That would help the military brass not feel the change was being shoved down its throat. A strict new code of behavior would need to apply to everyone, gay and straight alike, but not attempt to change anti-gay attitudes. Commanders would need to demonstrate zero tolerance for anti-gay violence and harassment.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The Feaver team also noted:</font>
<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>Team spirit:</B> Service members would need to be taught that anti-gay behavior threatens unit cohesion - and could put the victimizer and the entire unit and its mission at risk.</font>
<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>Do unto others:</B> Some straight male soldiers who fear lifting the ban are afraid they would receive the kind of inappropriate advances many men make toward women. "When they think of being on the receiving end of that, they really get freaked out," says Feaver colleague Laura Miller, a military sociologist at the University of California at Los Angeles. As the fearful soldiers see men and women working together without sexual harassment, they may be less afraid of openly gay men.</font>
<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>Mission possible:</B> The Joint Chiefs would need to be wooed. "It can't just be ordered. There has to be an effort to make them understand what is driving the policy," says Feaver co-author Richard Kohn, a military historian at University of North Carolina. "The military has to reflect the attitudes of the society it serves."</font>
<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>Quitters:</B> Twenty-seven percent of rising officers told Feaver's team they would leave if gays serve openly. But on a list of nine possible reasons to leave, lifting the ban ranked only sixth. Higher choices included "less sense of fulfillment" (68 percent) and "too much time away from my family" (39 percent). It's unlikely most of the 27 percent would leave. "For some, this is a way of voting," of just signaling opposition, Miller says.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Lifting the ban on openly gay soldiers is vital to American interests. And working to minimize the difficulty should be a shared national goal.</font>
