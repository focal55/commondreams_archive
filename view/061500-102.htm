"The fate of the earth is likely to be decided in our generation. It doesn't mean the earth is going to die in our time, but the earth does have a cancerous condition. By the time the symptoms are so acute that they are giving us real pain, it will be too late." 
<P>
This statement by Maurice Strong, secretary-general of the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development, expresses the urgency for action on global warming. 
<P>
Congress, similar to the ostrich with its head in the sand, has basically ignored this crisis. Not surprisingly, Congress has once again put political considerations above its duty. It has not been swayed by the Intergovern-mental Panel on Climate Change which concluded that global warming is happening and that fossil fuels have played a role. Congress also seems unfazed by these widely reported facts:
<P>
 &#151;  The first three months of the year 2000 were the hottest first quarter ever. 
<P>
 &#151;  The 1990s were the hottest decade of the century. 
<P>
 &#151;  The 20th century was the hottest century in a thousand years! 
<P>
The overwhelming majority of scientists working on climate agree that drasticaction is necessary to lessen the effects of climate change. We can no longerbe satisfied with small increases in research funding. Scientists are calling for a 50 to 70 percent reduction in greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. 
<P>
Would reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases require us to sacrifice our way of life, as some contend? Absolutely not! For example, the Union of Concerned Scientists and other groups project that the U.S. can cut emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief global warming pollutant, while reducing national energy costs and creating nearly 800,000 net new jobs by 2010. Focusing on Colorado, a study by Economic Research Associates concluded: "An alternative energy future in the year 2010 means an energy bill savings of $1.2 billion for Colorado ratepayers, a net gain of 8,400 jobs for the Colorado economy, and a reduction of 133,000 tons of critical air pollutants." 
<P>
Simple steps can lead to these positive outcomes. Instead of continuing huge subsidies to the fossil fuel and nuclear energy industries, we must support renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass from crops such as switchgrass and energy cane) that don't give off carbon dioxide or pose other risks. We must stop deforestation and plant more trees to absorb carbon dioxide. We must require energy efficiency in all new products including our homes, appliances and cars. The retrofitting of old homes and office buildings with new energy-efficient windows alone would create thousands of new jobs. Mass transit, hybrid cars or cars with hydrogen fuel cells, technology already available, can greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. 
<P>
These ideas are not pipe dreams. In "Colorado Solutions: Choosing a Livable Future," a report from the Colorado Sustainability Project, David Wann has provided a number of case studies in which government and business policies reduce energy use and pollution, improve the quality of life and save money. Paul Hawken and Amory and Hunter Lovins provide more examples of what is possible in their new book "Natural Capitalism." Energy efficiency offers tremendous benefits. For example, Xerox, Compaq and 3M are among many firms that have realized they can make huge reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and see a 50 percent or higher return on their investments. 
<P>
Finally, we must also share these new technologies with the developing world. 
<P>
In the 1970s, we saw the satellite pictures of the earth that helped us all realizethat pollution on one part of the planet affects other areas as well. Therefore, unless we help clean up energy production in countries such as China and India, there is little chance of mitigating the effects of global climate change. Sharing energy technology would be a wise investment in our own future. 
<P>
If we fail to act, we will face not only rising costs for energy, food and water, but also the consequences of global climate change (floods, droughts, storms, air pollution, environmental refugees, etc.). If we act now and if we act responsibly, we can provide a sustainable future for our children and grandchildren. For me, the choice is clear. How about you?
