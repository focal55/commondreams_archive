<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wave goodbye to that fantasy of a more inclusive Republican Party.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> George W. Bush and John McCain 
have planted themselves on the 
wrong side of the Confederate flag 
issue. And last week, there was Mr. 
Bush in Greenville, S.C., happily touting "our ideas, Republican ideas, 
conservative ideas" at Bob Jones 
University, which maintains its perverse rules against the mingling of 
races and its disgusting hostility to 
the Catholic religion.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Love is fine at B.J.U. as long as it 
doesn't cross the color line. Mr. 
Bush's brother and sister-in-law -- 
Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida, 
and his Mexican-born wife, Columba 
-- would have been condemned and 
expelled from Bob Jones for having 
dared to fall in love and marry.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Nice place.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The former head of the university, 
Bob Jones Jr., engaged in an astonishing series of attacks on Catholics 
in the 1980's, asserting that "all the 
popes are demon-possessed" and 
that Pope John Paul II was "the 
greatest danger we face today."

</font>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The papacy," he said, "is the 
religion of Antichrist and is a satanic 
system." 

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On Tuesday I asked a spokesman 
for the university, Jonathan Pait, if 
the school had ever repudiated Mr. 
Jones's statements, or backed off of 
them in any way.

</font>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I don't believe so," he said.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> According to Mr. Pait, "There is a 
disagreement about what the Bible 
teaches between Catholicism and 
Protestantism. And  the university 
takes a very strong stand that Protestantism is the correct interpretation of Scripture."

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I asked about interracial dating.

</font>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There is to be no interracial dating," he said. "That is the policy."

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When I asked why the policy had 
been established, he replied, "Because there is a held belief from way 
back in the institution that that was 
biblically wrong." 

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bob Jones has black students, but 
Mr. Pait said he didn't know how 
many. He said the ban on interracial 
dating did not imply that the school 
loved any of its students less. "It 
doesn't matter to us what The Washington Post or The New York Times 
thinks," he said. "It's when I can look 
my black or Oriental or Indian or 
whatever color brother or sister in 
Christ in the eyes and say, 'I love 
you.' That's what matters."

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Mr. Bush's campaign appearance 
at Bob Jones reminded me of Ronald 
Reagan's first major appearance in 
the 1980 general election. Mr. Reagan chose to kick off his presidential 
bid in Philadelphia, Miss., which just 
happened to have been the place 
where three civil rights workers -- 
Andrew Goodman, Michael 
Schwerner and James Chaney -- 
were murdered in 1964.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> During that appearance Mr. Reagan told his audience, "I believe in 
states' rights."

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Enough said.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Mr. Bush's entanglement in the 
Confederate flag issue is not limited 
to the controversy over the flag that 
flies over the Statehouse in Columbia, S.C. Mr. Bush has his own controversy back home. Complaints have 
erupted over displays of the rebel 
flag in public buildings in Texas, 
including some public schools.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Defenders of the Confederate battle flag like to characterize it as a 
cherished symbol of a benevolent 
and oh-so-civilized Southern past, 
rather than a banner representing 
the twin abominations of slavery and 
race hatred. They might want to take 
a look at the Texas Ordinance of 
Secession, dated Feb. 2, 1861.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The ordinance declares that Texas 
was received into the Confederated 
States "as a commonwealth holding, 
maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro  slavery -- the 
servitude of the African to the white 
race within her limits -- a relation 
that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white 
race, and which her people intended 
should exist in all future time."

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The ordinance said Texas' "institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between 
her and other slave-holding States of 
the confederacy."

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Benign?

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Civilized?

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> For many years the Republican 
Party has been a haven for reactionary, right-wing and racist elements 
in the society. Many of its candidates 
have pandered to those elements.

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There is not much in the way of 
change that can be perceived on the 
horizon. <br>
