NEWARK, New Jersey &#151; In the Wall Street Journal, automotive writer Brock Yates says he gets "an added feeling of confidence" because his wife drives a sport utility vehicle.
<P>
"Neither she nor I fret," he quipped, "over the possibility of her rolling some hapless victim in a Geo Metro into a wad of metal."
<P>
That's a real knee-slapper! What a funny image!
<P>
Except in real life.
<P>
If you happened to drive a few days ago through the quiet oceanfront town of  Mantoloking, N.J., you might have noticed a memorial to a girl named Casie Kerr. It was along the fence of the house where her grandparents live.
<P>
Prominent among the collection of wreaths and flowers were news clippings of her career as an all-state cross-country runner for her high school.
<P>
At 4:30 p.m. Aug. 2, Casie pulled out of the driveway to go to track practice. For some reason, she failed to notice the oncoming traffic. Her Ford Probe was hit broadside by a Mercury Mountaineer.
<P>
Her car was rolled into a wad of metal.
<P>
This fatality occurred in a town where the speed limit on the highway is 40 mph. Most accidents are fender-benders, said Mantoloking Police Chief Bruce Garon.
<P>
"The general consensus of our traffic safety guys is that this fatality happened because an SUV hit a small car," Garon said. "It was felt that if that had been a standard car, the crash might have been survivable."
<P>
Garon said that no charges were filed because it seemed clear that the crash was Casie's fault. She was 17 and had just gotten her driver's license. She made a mistake.
<P>
All new drivers make mistakes. But should they have to die for them?
<P>
Evidently so, if you take Yates' point of view.
<P>
But not, if you take Frank Miscia's point of view.
<P>
Miscia, of Verona, N.J., is a nationally known expert on crash extrication. He told me that this tragedy was a classic example of the dangers of SUVs. The problem, Miscia said, is that the bumpers on SUVs are set at a height that makes them fatal to car occupants in side collisions.
<P>
Most doors on ordinary cars are reinforced with side rails from 14 to 20 inches off the ground, the same height as car bumpers. But the bumpers on SUVs can be as high as 30 inches off the ground.
<P>
"When an SUV hits a car, it goes right over the side impact rail," says Miscia. The result is that instead of hitting the protected area of the door, the SUV hits the head and shoulders of the car's front-seat occupants.
<P>
This brings up an obvious flaw in federal regulations. The feds are assuming that cars will collide only with cars and that SUVs will collide only with SUVs. This is bureaucracy at work.
<P>
In this case, though, it's not just the bureaucrats who are at fault. The auto manufacturers pulled a fast one on them. Light trucks were exempted from safety rules because it was assumed that they were going to be used for the purposes for which they were intended, hauling things around.
<P>
But then the automakers began filling these trucks with seats and selling them for passenger use. They now make up half the vehicles on the road.
<P>
They're cars, but they don't have to meet the same safety, fuel economy and emissions rules as real cars. So the boys from Detroit can make a killing. Literally.
<P>
But it's turning out that SUVs are dangerous to their owners as well. Recently, we learned that at least 46 people have been killed when their SUVs rolled over after their Firestone tires blew out. In a normal car, a blowout means a trip to the service station. In an SUV, a blowout means a trip to the morgue.
<P>
SUV owners claim to want safety, but as the Firestone example shows, they're only getting the illusion of safety.
<P>
If you really want to be safe, buy a big sedan or station wagon. They offer greater safety to drivers and passengers, and they're not a hazard to others.
<P>
Good luck finding one, however. Most of them have been taken off the market. Federal regulations penalize big cars with a "gas-guzzler" tax. Put the same gas-guzzling V-8 in an SUV and you not only escape the gas-guzzler tax, you escape safety and emissions rules as well.
<P>
To their credit, the feds are studying ways to make SUVs less hazardous to the rest of us. They're considering making them comply with the same bumper-height regulations as their victims. They're also considering regulations on headlight height, an aspect of the SUV that is even more irritating than the attitudes of their drivers.
<P>
If you want to register complaints about the safety hazards of SUVs, call the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hot line at (888) 327-4236.
<P>
No doubt there are thousands of car owners out there who would love to see SUVs made to conform to the same rules as cars.
<P>
As for me, I'd like to see them all rolled into a giant wad of metal.
