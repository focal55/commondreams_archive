In the week when this newspaper has been calling for a referendum on the monarchy, the proud republic which tore itself free of the British crown has been offering a lesson in the drawbacks of inherited power. 
<P>The biggest problem facing the likely president, George W Bush, is the perceived illegitimacy of his hold on the White House throne. Bush's shaky mandate is partly due to the closeness of the vote and the legal wrangling afterwards. 
<P>Yet his claim to run America was undermined long before the state of Florida was twinned with Chad by a central and very English illegitimacy. He is a monarchic president. At the exact moment when the British might be seriously questioning the rule of primogeniture, America is handing down power from father to son. Arise, King George. 
<P>Most of the reasons that this second Bush presidency appears either sinister or ridiculous result from its dynastic stucture. The essential problem with monarchy is that it puts power at the mercy of relatives and genetics. And this is precisely what hobbles the putative new Bush administration.  
<P>Let's begin with the question of Jeb. There's an honourable tradition of presidents being worried by their brothers. Jimmy Carter was often distracted from national security matters by concern over what the maverick Billy might say next. Roger Clinton's troubled and druggy past was one of the holes in which the Republicans tried to dig dirt on Bill. But these sibling difficulties are minor beside the difficulties opened up for George W Bush by his little bro.  
<P>Winning the presidency by a negligible and heavily doubted margin would be enough humiliation for any politician. But God reserved an even harsher joke for the governor of Texas. His victory-is-it? would be sealed by the results of a state run by his brother, who would be required to sign the legislation awarding the votes to him.  
<P>His public comments during the vote-tie crisis show no sign that Governor Jeb Bush of Florida understands the extent to which his brother is, in a reversal of the usual process, rendered illegitimate by family ties. 
<P>"I did everything I could to help my brother win," he admitted early on. More recently, to suggestions that he might recuse himself from the duty of signing Florida's election results into law, he insisted that he could not "recuse myself from my family".  
<P>Republicans spent eight years trying to prove that President Clinton had blood on his hands. The problem for President George W Bush is the blood in his veins. One of the major arguments for a republic - that you can't become head of state just because of being someone's relative - is being proved again in a nation founded on that doubt.  
<P>The defence of the Bush family, as it was for the Kennedys, is that their dynasties are elective. But government through bloodline is vulnerable to the same objections whether it occurs through voting or the passing down of a crown. This becomes even more apparent in the shape of King George II's main family problem - his dad, King George I. Already weakened by the perception that his brother got him the job, King George II seems determined to restore his father's court in Washington.  
<P>Putative cabinet appointments spun to the press as fresh and radical - General Colin Powell as the first black secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice as the first black national security advisor - are impaired by the fact that these candidates first served the king his father in other roles. His vice president, Dick Cheney, is another retread courtier. It's always said that Dubya is too dumb to read books but he seems to have studied English history with dangerous avidity.  
<P>Another case against the inheritance of power is the kick hidden in the DNA: whether haemophilia or   stupidity. Again, a Bush administration would illustrate this risk. His father's reign was that of a borderline dimwit whose mental wiring left him unable to speak the English language with conviction or precision. Precisely these design faults occur in King George II, with the additional hindrances of alcoholism (under control) and, unlike his father, extreme laziness.
<P>This presidency would perfectly prove Philip Larkin's lines about the influence of parents on children: "They give you all the faults they had /And add some extra, just for you." In fact, the decision of half of the electorate to vote for George W Bush is perhaps best understood as a genetic experiment. In an age obsessed with DNA and inheritance, the voters decided to see what would happen if they sent a son into a situation recently occupied by his father.  
<P>But the result of the experiment will almost certainly be disastrous and I urge Americans to consider the merits of Republicanism. By coincidence, a revival of Stephen Sondheim's musical Merrily We Roll Along opens in London on Monday. It includes a satirical song at the Washington court of the Kennedys, in which the paternal kingmaker sings: "One day, elections will be unknown/As each of our kids will ascend the throne." 
<P>Written as a joke about America's past, it now sounds like a gag about the nation's future. Prepare to watch The Madness Of King George II, a warning against monarchy from a nation which once took pride in not having one.
