AS CONGRESS debates whether to approve $1.6 billion in aid to combat 
drugs (and guerrillas) in Colombia, many warn against the dangers of 
``another Central America,'' i.e., deeper U.S. involvement in 
Colombia's civil war.
<P>  Less visible, but equally dangerous, is the political and military 
re-involvement of the United States in Central America itself, 
threatening the precarious peace settlements that took years to 
negotiate.	 
</P>
<P>  Since the end of the civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala, the 
United States has presented itself as a friend of peace and 
reconciliation. But recent moves by Washington prioritize the drug 
war over the peace accords, even increasing direct U.S. military 
presence for that purpose. 	 
</P>
<P>  The United States recently signed an agreement permitting the 
presence of U.S. personnel to conduct drug surveillance missions out 
of El Salvador's airport -- an arrangement that the left opposition 
party will fight to overturn in the legislature.	 
</P>
<P> Even more alarming is the case of Guatemala, where U.S. troops have 
been working with Guatemalan army officials and units as well as the 
civilian police unit designated to counter drug trafficking. For the 
last four decades, Guatemala's counterinsurgency army has been known 
as the most brutal in Latin America. (This killing machine was 
largely a product of U.S. training beginning in the mid-1960s.) As 
concluded by Guatemala's Truth Commission report in 1999, that army 
committed 93 percent of all human rights violations during the civil 
war; and it carried out genocidal actions and policies during the 
early 1980s' ``scorched earth'' campaign that killed up to 150,000 
civilians, mainly highlands Mayans, between 1981 and 1983 alone.	 
</P>
<P>  Given this history, the centerpiece of Guatemala's December 1996 
peace accords between the government and leftist insurgents, ending 
36 years of civil war and six years of difficult negotiations, was 
the demilitarization accord. That accord was designed to strip the 
army of the many functions it had appropriated for itself and to 
reduce its mission to external defense -- a precondition for 
strengthening civilian power and democratizing Guatemala.	 
</P>
<P>  Clearly, given Washington's long-standing role as the Guatemalan 
army's strategic ally and promoter, U.S. pressure would have been 
crucial for implementation of that accord. But before the ink had 
dried on the final peace accords, even as U.S. officials attended the 
peace signing, they were proposing to give the Guatemalan army a 
``new mission'' in counternarcotics control and pressuring the 
government to accept U.S. equipment and training for the Guatemalan 
army. Subsequent reports in April 1997 confirmed U.S. plans to send 
troops for anti-drug training to the army, as part of ``cooperation 
to consolidate peace'' -- precisely the wrong message.	 
</P>
<P>  Furthermore, every year since the sign 
ing of the peace accord, the Clinton administration has sought to 
reinitiate full U.S. military training and aid to the Guatemalan army 
</P>
<P>--even in the spring of 1998, the very week after the bloody 
assassination of Auxiliary Bishop Monsignor. Juan Gerardi, architect 
of a major report on human rights atrocities during the 36-year war. 
Only congressional opposition has slowed down these plans to 
legitimize the Guatemalan army once again.	 
</P>
<P>  During his March 1999 visit to Guatemala, President Clinton made a 
historic gesture, apologizing to the Guatemalan people for the U.S. 
role in supporting the brutal policies of the Guatemalan army for the 
past four decades. But Clinton's gesture of recognizing U.S. 
responsibility in 
Guatemala's war was contradicted by Washington's business-as-usual 
relationship with the Guatemalan army.	 
</P>
<P>  Today, the stakes are far higher than at any time since the 
signing of peace. Recent U.N. reports document significantly 
increased human rights violations in 1999, as well as noncompliance 
with the peace accords by the Guatemalan government and army. And in 
the new government that took office in January, the major political 
party is led and dominated by architects and henchmen of the 1980s 
holocaust.	 
</P>
<P>  Now more than ever, pressure from the international community is 
crucial to gaining compliance with the peace accords. The European 
Union is conditioning its assistance on such compliance; and in 
Spain, the counterinsurgency leaders of the 1980s may be put on 
trial. By contrast, the United States seems less interested in peace 
than in a drug war that revalidates the Guatemalan army.	 
</P>
<P>Today is the second anniversary of the 1998 Gerardi assassination -- a 
peacetime crime that remains unresolved. U.S. actions giving the 
Guatemalan army ``new missions'' and a new lease on life are an 
affront to the memory of Monsignor Gerardi. They could also end up 
contributing to a Central American tragedy: a lost opportunity to 
reform and truly democratize Guatemala through the peace accords.
