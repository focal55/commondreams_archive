So I'm driving up the Maine Turnpike thinking about voting for Ralph Nader again &#150; it's an occupational hazard &#150; and a little voice inside my head (that sounds suspiciously like my father's) asks, "Are you crazy?"

<P> Even though the passenger seat is empty when I glance over, I trot out the arguments that every progressive has considered this campaign season. Let's face it, for eight years the Clinton-Gore administration has tried mightily to revive the good old days of Eisenhower Republicanism. With the exception of an ethical lapse here and there, it's been a pretty successful revival.</P>
<P> During the better part of his tenure as vice president, Al Gore's free-trade policy made Ronald Reagan look protectionist. Now he only expresses some reservations about Clintonomics when he discovers populism at the Democratic National Convention.</P>
<P> Then there's Gore's position on state-sponsored executions. It seems clear that, in the Tennessean's view, the best death row is a long, crowded death row.</P>
<P> And let's not forget campaign finance. You might just get Gore to back minimal reform if you held a soiree and invited the well-heeled executives of Silicon Valley and Hollywood to the table, checkbooks in tow.</P>
<P> Frankly, I say aloud, the idea that Gore is the lesser of two evils in the race with George W. Bush isn't much solace.</P>
<P> The driver in a speeding Toyota SUV glares down at me from the passing lane. She mouths, "And what about the Supreme Court?" At least, I think that's what she's saying.</P>
<P> That's a potent argument. Assuming that Nader might play the spoiler's role, shouldn't I cast my ballot for the Democrat? After all, Rehnquist can't hold out forever, and a Gore nominee would be friendlier than a Bush pick, especially on women's issues.</P>
<P> Still, there's no guarantee that a Gore pick would be superior to the alternative. History has proven, much to the chagrin of Eisenhower and Nixon, that trying to predict a justice's ideological position on constitutional issues remains more art than science. As Christopher Hitchens wrote in a recent issue of The Nation, "It is as possible . . . to imagine Gore making a safe and stupid reactionary appointment as it is to picture Bush making an 'unpredictable' centrist one."</P>
<P> Besides, if Gore were elected, his nominee would still have to get through the Senate, which is likely to remain in Republican hands. A "centrist" nominee who could successfully navigate the appointment process wouldn't be that helpful to the left.</P>
<P> Brake lights blink up and down the highway as I approach that knotted stretch between Saco and Scarborough. There's a big caution sign with a flashing message: "Warning! If Bush wins, conservatives could control all three branches of the federal government!"</P>
<P> I grind my brake pedal into the floor. That's true &#150; for the better part of the past two decades, Americans have evidently decided that checking a GOP president with a Democratic House or Senate, and a Democratic administration with a Republican-controlled Congress, is the best way to avoid dealing with any substantive issue in Washington. Gridlock used to be a dirty word.</P>
<P> I flip on the radio as I sit in Maine's own version of gridlock &#150; the turnpike at 8 a.m.. The morning talk show hosts are arguing about the presidential debates, and callers who won't be voting for Nader (or any other third party candidate) are trying to spin the series of forums their way. And suddenly I wish I were one of them.</P>
<P> Instead of having to constantly justify my support for a guy who doesn't have a chance of winning, I could jump on the offensive and talk about what Ralph Nader would do if he were elected president. How he would fight to make sure that every American &#150; including the 40 million without health insurance &#150; could get proper medical care and prescription drugs. How he would enact real campaign finance reform that would eliminate soft money and hefty corporate contributions. How he wouldn't give China a free pass to American markets when that country refuses to respect basic human rights and international labor standards.</P>
<P> If Ralph Nader were president, does anyone think Firestone and Ford could have gotten away with their scheme to cover up product defects that the government now says are linked to the death of more than 80 people? Or that after 10 years of unprecedented economic growth, a majority of American workers would be making less than they did in 1979 when inflation is taken into account?</P>
<P> "Jack's in his car," the voice on the radio says. "Are you there, caller?"</P>
<P> I imagine myself saying if there really isn't that much difference between Gore and Bush, isn't my vote wasted if I use it for one of them?</P>
<P> The car behind me toots his horn. Traffic is moving again. Steeled by the morning commute, I'll stick by Ralph for yet another day.   </P>
