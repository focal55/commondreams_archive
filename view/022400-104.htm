<p>Over the last year, an enormous amount of progressive energy has been spent
organizing around issues of Pacifica Radio's policies and governance. As a
result, the sort of pickets, protests and pressure that we might expect to
see progressives mount against the corporate media have instead been
directed against America's only authentically listener-sponsored and
politically progressive network.
<p>Pacifica is far from a perfect institution. Many of the issues raised by
critics in the past months have some grounding. But in our opinion, the
honest debate over Pacifica has degenerated into an ugly spectacle of
Pacifica bashing and defamation. Much of the sober and well-intentioned
criticism has ceded to a destructive and alarmist exaggeration.
<p>The continuation of what has become a veritable war against Pacifica could
lead to the death of the only alternative radio network progressives
possess. This would be tragic. It would hurt all sides in the Pacifica
dispute and benefit only those who would love to see all alternative voices
vanish from the airwaves.
<p>This war suffered it most recent escalation when a group of  part-time and
free lance correspondents to Pacifica's National News news program called
for a three-month "strike" and boycott against the Pacifica National News.
Others have joined in this movement by calling for the witholding of some or
all financial support for Pacifica and its five stations.
<p>We call for an immediate end to such tactics. There is, indeed, no
sanctioned strike or authorized labor dispute underway at Pacifica National
News. Some of those urging the boycott have differences with Pacifica news
management. That is their right. But they do not have the right to cloak
their grievances in the language of a bona fide labor dispute.
<p>Boycotts, defunding campaigns and negative public relations strategies are
powerful tools that can be used against recalcitrant and abusive corporate
employers. To turn them against Pacifica is unconcsionable. The only victims
of such actions are the listeners, many of whom are activists who need
information, analysis and debate from radio to help nourish their world
views. While the inner workings and conflicts of Pacifica might be of some
interest to some of these listeners, the chief mission of Pacifica is to
bring much bigger and universal issues to its audience.
<p>Sadly, the amount of time spent this past year bashing Pacifica, we
calculate, was subtracted from the time available to fight against racism,
sexism, exploitation, injustice, inequality, environmental contamination,
corporate capitalism and imperialism.
<p>We recognize that there are legitimate debates to be had around Pacifica's
structure, its governance, its management of news, its vision of the future.
There always have been and there always will be. But we need debate and
cooperation-- not polarization, vilification and destructive
campaigns of defamation where listeners are misled into believing that
somehow this worthy but troubled 50 year old progressive radio network is
now "the enemy."
<p>Whatever grievances exist against Pacifica, they should be judged in the
broader context of the corporate-dominated society we live in. Surely,
Pacifica's shortcomings should be seen as such: shortcomings and mistakes,
not betrayals and conspiracies.
<p>It's time now for the National Board, the local station boards, the
individual station management and their staff employees and volunteers to
reunite as a Pacifica family and seek greater cooperation. This can only
occur if all sides pledge to engage in honest, open and civilized discussion
and refrain from any further public defamation and political
mischaracterization.
<p>Pacifica's Board and its national leadership, we believe, has not shown
great wisdom in confronting these crises. But crises often force mistakes.
Similar lapses in judgement and resulting mistakes have also been made by
some of Pacifica's critics who have tended to paint this progressive radio
network as some sort of runaway, right-wing juggernaut in the grips of a
dark conspiracy.
<p>Any more such mistakes from either side at this point and the whole debate
could become moot as Pacifica collapses. We hope that in a less tense
atmosphere, some of the festering issues can be resolved so that
progressives can again focus on their political and social interests and use
their one radio link as a source of informtation, analysis and connection -
that Pacifica was intended to be and still is for hundreds of thousands of
listeners.
<p>We the undersigned members of this ad hoc group pledge to help facilitate
the needed rapprochement. We ask you to join us now.  Contact us at :
