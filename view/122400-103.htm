THIS IS A good season to consider the scandal of  homelessness amid plenty as we remember the birthday of an infant born homeless.
<P>
<P>Thirty years ago, Americans did not use the word ''homeless.'' Millions of people were ill-housed, but except for the occasional skid row derelict, hardly anybody literally lived in  the street.
<P>
<P>Homelessness, as we understand it today, came from  five sources: the closing of state hospitals for the mentally ill; the  increase in drug and alcohol abuse; wives and children taking  flight from abusive husbands or boyfriends; a street culture of  runaway teenagers; and increasingly unaffordable housing costs  for the poor.
<P>
<P>While the casual observer may see a single subculture of  the homeless, there are really several different kinds of homeless  people. But each has a social cause - and a social remedy that our  society could easily afford.
<P>
<P>The largest single group of homeless is the mentally ill.
<P>
<P>The tragedy is that 30 years after deinstitutionalization, there  are well-established strategies for providing decent housing and  noncoercive care to the mentally handicapped.
<P>
<P>Here in Boston, the Massachusetts Housing and Shelter  Alliance pioneered a strategy called the Special Initiative that  combines permanent subsidized small-group or individual  housing with support services and case-management. Thanks to  this approach, which was launched in 1991, 1,200 of the  state's estimated 2,000 mentally ill homeless now have decent  housing. The support services are necessary so people stay  on medication, avoid crises, and begin to live ordered and stable lives. Often they become able to take paying jobs.
<P>
<P>This initiative, a national model, has an 83 percent success rate, and it is surprisingly cheap. It costs only $3 million of state money to house and support another 200 mentally ill homeless people. In other words, for $12 million more the problem in Massachusetts would be solved.
<P>
<P>Although this initiative was embraced by William Weld, the former Republican governor, his successor has been surprisingly unsympathetic. This past year the governor's budget  included no money for the homeless mentally ill. The state Legislature added a million dollars. With next year's budget due  in mid-January, Governor Cellucci is still considering whether to  support any additional funding.
<P>
<P>Nationally the picture is even less defensible.
<P>
<P>Community living for people with disabilities of various kinds  works; it is far more cost-effective than institutionalizing people  who cherish their freedom, and far more humane than leaving  them to push their worldly possessions in shopping carts and  sleep on heating grates. Yet nationally, the public funding for  community living initiatives has eroded dramatically in recent  decades.
<P>
<P>Side by side with the crisis of homelessness for the  mentally ill is a shortage of housing for victims of abuse and for  ordinary people of modest income who cannot afford spiraling  rents. In the years after World War II, the economy boomed but  housing stayed affordable because government subsidized its  construction in a variety of ways.
<P>
<P>In the 1990s, however, government essentially stopped  adding new units of subsidized housing to the nation's housing  stock. Especially in booming metropolitan areas, supply and  demand took over and pushed rentals to unimagined levels. In this game of musical chairs, some people doubled up and some  simply got pushed onto the street.
<P>
<P>As I write, both political parties are debating what to do  with an unprecedented federal budget surplus. Most  Republicans want to spend much of the surplus on a tax cut. Most Democrats want to use it to pay off the national debt.
<P>
<P>Both  miss the point.
<P>
<P>Looked at through a green eyeshade, the budget surplus is a mark of fiscal rectitude. But looked at with even a shred of  humanity, the surplus is a national disgrace. It reflects money  wrung out of budgets for needy people.
<P>
<P>In times like these, we should be spending some of this  money so people can literally afford a roof over their heads.
<P>
<P>In 30 years, our national income has nearly doubled, but more  people are homeless today than in 1970. Indeed, 2,000 years after the birth of Christ in a manger shamed and awed  onlookers, some people don't even have the shelter of a  manger.
<P>
<P>Kip Tiernan, the remarkable founder of Rosie's Place,  the Boston shelter for homeless women and children, likes to say that the proliferation of shelters is not a success but a sign of failure. At this Christmas season, please remember the needy, but let's remember, too, that individual charity is no substitute for  sensible and humane national action.
