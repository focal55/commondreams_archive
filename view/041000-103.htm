<p>While there has been much discussion in recent weeks over the many

changes taking place in our way of life as a result of the high-tech

economy, the single biggest change is occurring relatively unnoticed: The

near-warp speed of the new hypercapitalism is beginning to make ownership

itself an outmoded concept. The implications of this are enormous and

far-reaching.

<p>So much of the world we know has been bound up in the process of

selling, buying and owning things that we can't imagine any other way of

structuring human affairs. Yet the concept of "property," which once

drove men to ideological battles, revolutions and wars, slowly is dying

out in the wake of a new constellation of economic realities. Society is

rethinking the kinds of bonds and boundaries that will define human

relations in the coming century.

<p>In the new era, markets are making way for "networks," and ownership

is steadily being replaced by "access." This doesn't mean the concept of

property will disappear in what is becoming known as the Age of Access.

Yet property is far less likely to be exchanged in markets.

<p>Instead, those who do own property increasingly will hold on to it and

lease, rent or charge an admission fee, subscription or membership dues

for its short-term use. Markets will remain but play an increasingly

diminished role in human affairs.

<p>Some businesses already are well along the way toward the transition

from ownership to access. They are selling off real estate, shrinking

inventories, leasing equipment and outsourcing activities in a

life-or-death race to rid themselves of every conceivable kind of

physical property. Many companies, for example, no longer think of

purchasing capital equipment but rather borrow what they need in the form

of a lease. Today, nearly one-third of all the business machines,

equipment and transportation fleets in the U.S. are leased, allowing

companies to be flexible in fast-changing markets and when faced with

technological obsolescence.

<p>Being stuck with outdated plants, obsolete equipment and antiquated

business systems and processes is a prescription for failure. The new

thinking in the business community is, when in doubt, farm it out.

"Outsourcing" has quickly become the new mantra of the access economy.

<p>Intellectual capital, on the other hand, is the driving force of the

new era. What is really being bought and sold today are ideas and images.

The physical embodiment of these ideas and images becomes increasingly

secondary to the economic process. If the industrial marketplace was

characterized by the exchange of things, the network economy is

characterized by access to concepts, carried inside physical forms.

<p>Nike is perhaps the best example of the new commercial forces at work.

Nike is, for all intents and purposes, a virtual company. While the

public is likely to think of the company as a manufacturer of athletic

footwear, the company is really a research and design studio with a

sophisticated marketing formula and distribution mechanism. Although it

is the world's leading manufacturer of athletic shoes, Nike owns no

factories, machines, equipment or real estate to speak of.

<p>Instead, Nike has established an extensive network of

suppliers--called "production partners"--in Southeast Asia that produce

its hundreds of designer shoes and other gear. Nike's real business is

selling concepts. The shoes are merely containers for those concepts.

<p>In the future, the race is likely to go to the new weightless

companies like Nike that are unencumbered by ownership of large amounts

of property.

<p>Consumers are also following suit. Today, one out of every three

automobiles and trucks on the U.S. roads is leased--still another sign of

the shift from ownership to access. Ford Motor Co., for its part, would

be just as happy turning customers into clients and shifting from selling

vehicles to providing access to a driving experience.

<p>As for homeownership, while it remains strong, Americans are

increasingly opting for time-shares rather than purchasing a vacation or

retirement home, preferring to pay for the time they spend in the house

rather than paying for the house itself. Temporal estates are replacing

real estate.

<p>This change in the basic way we think about our relationship to the

things we use, from products we buy to services we access, is part of the

vast restructuring going on in the capitalist system as it makes the

transformation from a goods-producing to a service-performing and

experience-generating economy. Our long attachment to ownership is

beginning to weaken. It is likely that for a growing number of

enterprises and consumers, the very idea of ownership will seem limited,

even old-fashioned, 25 years from now.

<p>Ownership is based on the idea that possessing a physical asset or

piece of property over an extended period of time is valuable. Now,

however, the speed of technological innovation and the dizzying pace of

economic activity make everything almost immediately outdated. To have,

to hold and to accumulate in an economy in which change itself is the

only constant makes less and less sense.

<p>The very thought of leaving markets and the exchange of property

behind is as inconceivable to many people today as the enclosure and

privatization of land and labor into property relations must have been

more than half a millennium ago.

<p>Still, a growing number of businesses and consumers already have

embarked on this new journey. In the 21st century, having access will be

as important as being propertied was in the 20th century.
