We were all included at both political conventions: white, black,
Asian, Latino, gay, lesbian, Protestant, Catholic, Jew and disabled
paraded to the podiums in Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Both gatherings
were scripted as coming togethers of mythic proportions, as if America's
segregation wounds had healed.
<p>But one of the most memorable scenes during the week of the Democratic
National Convention did not occur at Staples Center or on the streets
where protesters and the Los Angeles Police Department played a game of
cat and mouse. In marked contrast to the programmed inclusivenessinside
the political hall was the unofficial, spontaneous version unfolding a
couple of miles away at MacArthur Park.
<p>There, several dozen young, white, middle-class kids, dressed in
psychedelic rags, writhed to the frenzied beat of a style of music known
as "electronica," spun by a deejay hovering over them on a modest stage
festooned with a banner reading "Four Days of Unity." It was a surreal
scene, but not so much for the '60s-style psychedelia (barkers selling
Tibetan scarves, hash pipes and tie-died T-shirts) repackaged as
21st-century rave. It was more a matter of where it was happening.
MacArthur Park lies at the heart of the Pico-Union district, the symbolic
center of L.A.'s Central American immigrant community.
<p>And so it was on a sweltering, smoggy afternoon that young people
clamoring for one kind of revolution or another were in a neighborhood
that is the product of revolution, or at least the civil wars of Central
America in the 1980s. While ravers danced in a loose circle in front of
the stage, Pico-Union denizens formed a concentric circle around them,
curiously eyeing the new kids on the block. The visitors had begun
settling in weeks ago, setting up camp at the Convergence Center, the
activist clearinghouse established in a rented four-story building on the
corner of 7th and Bonnie Brae, just two blocks off the park.
<p>For a brief moment, it seemed a miracle would happen: L.A's notorious
Balkanization would be broken by ravers dancing with immigrants. People
were so close to actually being close. Maybe the deejay would scratch a
tropical merengue number alongside the trance track, creating a third
musical language to mirror the marriage of strangers taking place below
him.
<p>Yet, there developed little more than some awkward conversations
between the locals and the visitors, in pidgin English and Spanish,
though a few of the immigrant children broke free from their parents to
prance about with the ravers. The promise turned out to be a fleeting
moment of mere proximity among strangers, the kind of contact that
normally passes for public life in Los Angeles. But it will be in just
such settings, far from the political Muzak of conventions and the media,
that a new politics and culture of inclusion will be created.
<p>It is a curious moment in America. Despite years of rhetoric and
policy-making that have set up minorities and immigrants as
boogeymen--the dismantling of affirmative action, the end of bilingual
education, the attempt to close the border and restrict services to the
undocumented--the political and cultural mainstream now declares, ipso
facto, the inclusionary society.
<p>It is true that some things have changed, particularly in pop culture.
The mainstream indulgence of the style of the immigrant Other--everything
from the Buena Vista Social Club to the "primitive" designs young white
kids brand their bodies with--is an essential part of America's cultural
journey. But much of this "inclusion" is no more than commercial
transaction; it is style.
<p>Our public life, as a city and as a nation, can reach its greatest
potential only to the extent that the new Americans among us participate
in it. Some will say that is up to them: The immigrants must learn
English, must pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. True enough.
But it is also true that we, the natives, must take stock of whether or
not we are truly offering the newcomers the opportunity to do so. It is
time to reexamine the policies born in the recessionary early '90s, many
of which were fueled by the worst kind of political inspiration: fear.
The fear of the stranger and of a faltering economy--they are
connected--neither of which has completely abated, even in these boom
times.
<p>There are signs that immigrants are beginning to lose their fear. One
evening during the convention, I walked through the protest pit. The last
speaker had finished his remarks on stage, and the crowd was rapidly
dispersing, obviously nervous that another confrontation with the police
would occur. Among the few protesters left was a man who gave his name
only as Francisco, a native of Veracruz, an immigrant flush with
excitement after his first protest experience in his adopted country.
<p>"I know most of my brothers aren't here," Francisco said. "They are
scared that they might be arrested and deported. But for me, I feel that
it's time I start saying what I feel about things in this country. It is
a democracy, no?"
<p>L.A. 2000 was no freedom summer, but it might have offered at least a
hint of a kind of politics we haven't seen since the '60s: the politics
of coalition. The civil rights movement achieved what it did because
black and white activists created a shared language that moved the
country's political center. Each immigrant generation in America has
acquired a public voice by networking with established communities, often
churches and labor unions. A new coalition will have to be formed to
allow the latest immigrant wave into the fold. Only then will we be able
to talk about inclusion.
<p>Television forged an image of young protesters hellbent on
confrontations with police. A handful undoubtedly were. But many others
were at least making that first awkward attempt to reach out to the
immigrants whose neighborhoods hosted the convention. It was a courageous
act. As courageous as a newcomer taking to the streets to make his voice
heard for the first time.
