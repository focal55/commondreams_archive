This is how he died. Guards dragged him  from his cell. They shackled his hands and  feet. They took him by van, escorted by police helicopters, to a facility 40 miles away.  He refused to eat. He did not speak. When  they came for him Thursday night, he once  again was dragged by guards, strapped to a  gurney, handcuffed and taken into the killing room.
<P>There he spoke his last words. &quot;They are  murdering me tonight.&quot;
<P>And they did. He was injected with poison. He died before a small group of witnesses. He died with one eye open and one eye  closed. Justice, according to those dishing it out in  Texas, was served.
<P>&quot;May God bless Mr. Graham,&quot; said Gov. George  W. Bush. The governor felt qualified to hand out God's blessing, since he was already making his decisions.
<P>Here is how I know the death penalty is wrong.  Not because I subscribe to one political party or another. Not because I am more sympathetic to prisoners than I am to victims. I know because if it feels  good to kill someone, then something is wrong with  you. And if it feels bad to kill someone, then something is wrong with doing it.
<P>There is simply no way to feel right about snuffing  out another human being. You know it in your heart. You sense it in your stomach. Which is why the execution of Gary Graham last week may indeed have  been about taking a stand against violence, or adhering to the laws of the state.
<P>But it wasn't right. It never will be.
<P>Now, those who oppose the death penalty have a toolbox stuffed with statistics. They show that states with the death penalty have nearly twice the murder rate of those without it. They show that two out of  three police do not think the death penalty deters  crime. They show that executing a convict costs far  more - thanks to all the appeals - than keeping  him in prison for life.
<P>They also point out that mistakes are made. They  cite 13 death row inmates in Illinois who were exonerated, prompting the governor there to halt the  death penalty altogether.
<P>Gary Graham was convicted of murdering a man  outside a Houston supermarket in 1981. Only one  person claims to have seen it, a woman  sitting in a car 30 feet away. There was no  physical evidence connecting Graham to  the crime; no fingerprints, no hairs, no fibers. His gun did not match the ballistics  of the murder weapon. His court-appointed lawyer, a hack who had been suspended by the bar several times, failed to call  six witnesses who were ready to refute  Graham being the murderer.
<P>Nonetheless - based on one woman's  testimony - he was sentenced to death.  It didn't help that he was young, black,  poor and hardly a saint, with a weeklong crime spree,  including 10 armed robberies and a rape on his record. He admitted these crimes, which should have  kept him in prison a very long time.
<P>But he denied the murder charge, right to the end,  right to the moment the needle pierced his skin and  we sent him to another world.
<P>It's funny. So many Americans believe O.J. Simpson used his money and fame to wrongly secure his  freedom. Why, then, is it hard to believe a poor,  anonymous man could lack the means to prevent a  wrongful conviction?
<P>&quot;There is absolutely no indication that an innocent  person has been executed in America since the (turn  of the century),&quot; said a clearly misguided woman  named Diane Clements, president of Justice for All,  a victims rights group. &quot;Texas has a wonderful system.&quot;
<P>Wonderful? What is wonderful here? Who felt  good when Graham died? The victim's family? I  doubt it. Revenge usually looks better than it tastes.
<P>The citizens of Texas? More than half of them believe their state puts innocent people to death, yet  they still overwhelmingly endorse the death penalty. I  don't know. There's something bloodthirsty in those  numbers.
<P>The rest of us? Let's hope we don't feel good. For  while our crime rate is intolerable and our penal system is ridiculous, there is nothing positive in Graham's execution. For all of Bush's coziness with God,  let's be honest: If we start feeling good about killing  people, we move a lot closer to the murderers than  we do to heaven.
<P>
