The column a few weeks ago that suggested the love affair some of our
politicians have with private school choice is only going to make our public
schools worse drew responses from all over the country.
<p>Indeed, many agreed, the whole choice concept that is now being used
extensively in Milwaukee will eventually leave the public schools with only the
most difficult students -- especially if the private schools aren't required to
follow the same rules and regulations that public schools do.</p>
<p>Several letter writers suggested there's an elitism at work here. The kids
from less than ideal family backgrounds are the ones left in the public schools
while the more involved families avail themselves of the opportunity to ''choose''
private school at taxpayer expense.</p>
<p>As I said in the column, that will only exacerbate, rather than address the
problem our public schools already face. What we as a society need to do is
address the issues that cause so much family dysfunction in the first place. No
school, after all, can be expected to solve the problems of poverty, inadequate
health care, poor day care and one-parent households.</p>
<p>Further, by separating those kids, we lose the cross-fertilization that
public schools have always provided.</p>
<p>That brought an interesting response from Steve Housewright, who reads this
column way out in Los Angeles. What he said deserves to be shared:</p>
<p>''Thanks for your insightful article. I learned something years ago coaching
kids on a roller hockey team that the politicians, educators and other 'team
players' could learn from.</p>
<p>''It was in an idyllic community where other coaches only wanted the 'cream
of the crop' for their teams -- the kids that go try out (with) scores of 9 or
10 on a scale of 1 to 10. Being my first time coaching, I chose the kids who
were rated 1, 2, 3. They had lots of problems, like most humans do.</p>
<p>''They were fat or dysfunctional, they had attention deficit disorders or
this disorder or that disorder, they were clumsy and awkward. They were kids
that nobody wanted except me.</p>
<p>''But each of them had their own individual talent at playing. And I allowed
them to tell me what their talent was. And I listened. And I built a team out of
each one of those individual talents.</p>
<p>And they beat the cream of the crop almost every game and were the champions
of that season.</p>
<p>''When children are allowed to express their own talents, their own gifts,
they can rise above the circumstance no matter how bad it is. It's getting
adults to listen and not count them out if they aren't somebody else's idea of 'perfect.'</p>
<p>''What we have is a system that is being built that seeks a 'superior'
society of chosen children -- the 8, 9, 10 kids. I hope that someday the coaches
who are trying to build those superior teams are as surprised as the coaches I
went up against.''</p>
