<p>How do you stop a war that profits not only generals on both sides but also Belgian diamond dealers, multinational oil corporations, international arms merchants and Americans at the gas pump? You don't. 
<P> Which is why one of Africa's longest running wars, in Angola, has killed a million people, created 3 million refugees and sucks up huge amounts of foreign aid, including $1.5 billion for a failed United 
Nations peacekeeping mission. 
<P> The war began in 1962 as a liberation struggle against Portuguese colonial rule, then evolved into an ideological conflict. After 
winning independence in 1975, the Marxist Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola (MPLA) took control of the country only to be 
opposed by its ally of 14 years, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). 
<P> During the Cold War, the Soviet Union and Cuba backed the MPLA, led 
by Jose Eduardo dos Santos, while the United States and South Africa 
backed UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi. After the Cold War, the MPLA 
abandoned Marxism and the United States dropped its support of 
Savimbi, motivated perhaps by Angola's huge oil reserves. 
<P> Peace was negotiated in 1991 but collapsed in 1992 when Savimbi 
refused to accept his defeat in Angola's first free elections. Another 
peace accord in 1994, known as the Lusaka Protocol, was never honored 
by UNITA, which refused to disarm. It broke down completely in 1998 
when government forces attacked rebel strongholds.
<P> By then, greed had eclipsed ideology. Angola had become a 
commercial battleground with MPLA leaders getting rich off $3 billion 
a year in oil revenues while UNITA made an estimated $4 billion off 
diamond smuggling. 
<P> Sanctions, imposed on UNITA in 1993, did little to stem its 
business dealings.
<P> A new U.N. report blames Belgium, Burkina Faso, Togo, Rwanda, 
Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Congo Republic, Ivory 
Coast, South Africa, Zambia, Morocco, Bulgaria and Ukraine for 
supplying UNITA with arms and fuel or facilitating its illicit diamond 
trade by allowing UNITA couriers to visit or pass through their 
territories in violation of an international travel ban.
<P> Most of UNITA's diamonds end up in Antwerp, Belgium, the largest 
market in the world for uncut stones, where the guerrilla group has a 
virtual branch office. It also maintains a presence in France, 
Portugal, Switzerland and the United States, suggesting that they too 
do not enforce the travel ban.
<P> While Savimbi is now demonized by the Western governments that used 
to support him, little is said of their dealings with the Dos Santos 
regime, which may be as guilty as he is of prolonging the conflict. 
<P> Angola is sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil producer after 
Nigeria, and recent discoveries are expected to make it the largest. 
With oil prices the highest in a decade, government receipts from the 
country's booming offshore oil industry are fat, topped op by $870 
million in bonuses recently paid by major oil exploration companies 
for drilling rights. 
<P> Some of the money has paid for new weapons and allowed the 
government to start paying soldiers' salaries, boosting morale after 
months of despondency. 
<P> But much of it has simply disappeared into the bank accounts of Dos 
Santos and his cronies. 
<P> In a report issued last year, the London-based human rights 
organization Global Witness said "a significant portion of Angola's 
oil-derived wealth is being subverted for personal gain and to support 
the aspirations of elite individuals, at the center of power around 
the presidency." 
<P> It named a long list of individuals and companies linked to oil 
exploration and weapons deals that would profit from an ongoing war. 
At the top of the list is Dos Santos himself, who controls a company 
registered in the British Virgin Islands that has a $720 million 
contract to supply the Angolan Armed Forces for the next five years. 
<P> They lead lives of luxury while 11 million Angolans live in abject 
poverty, with 1.6 million being fed by the World Food Program. 
<P> The United States does not seem to care as long as it gets 7 
percent of its oil from a country recently described by UNICEF as 
"the worst place in the world to be a child."
