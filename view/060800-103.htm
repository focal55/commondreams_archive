This summer past, the Dalia Lama's prayers for peace rose from the 
lush, green woodlands of southern Indiana's rolling hills. Meanwhile, 
war's parched winds continue to scourge a weary globe. The phenomenon of one 
person praying for peace while another prays for victory is as old as 
mankind. What bewilderment this must bring to the Hearer of such 
prayers. "Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition" has always been 
an exercise of the demented soul, but in today's thermonuclear world, 
it's pure madness. 
<P> The history of mankind is a history of war. Disputes between 
individuals and among nations have forever been settled by the fist, 
sword, gun, tank, battleship, bomb or rock, whatever comes to hand at 
the time. Diplomacy is engaged with weapons at the ready. When 
negotiations reach an apparent deadlock, military strategies quickly 
surface and hope for peace is lost. It has been said there will always 
be wars and rumors of wars. So far, such has clearly been the case, 
but if mankind is to make it through the next century, we must develop 
a different vision, a New Paradigm of Peace. 
<P> The concept of ends justifying means has always been a basic 
premise of the old paradigm of war. Everyone hates war, but victory 
for the righteous cause often necessitates the horrors of battle. The 
use of deplorable means to achieve glorious ends is the way of war, 
but such indulgence can no longer stand. 
<P> With the advent of the atomic age, the equation for the resolution 
of conflict dramatically changed. For the first time in the history of 
the cosmos, man has the means to obliterate all life on Earth. Under 
the thermonuclear equation, end and means become one: total 
annihilation. 
<P> After millions of years of warmongering, man is finally confronted 
by the final option - continue the old paradigm of war and, with sword 
in hand, move on to Armageddon, or implement a new paradigm of peace, 
turn our full energies to the plow and harness the power of the stars. 
<P> The appeal for today's America is to begin to study war no more. 
Page one in the manual for the New Paradigm of Peace is the final page 
of the old way of war. We must, in transition, meld from old toward 
new. Taking benevolent advantage of the fact that America is the 
world's only military superpower does this. What we do with our 
omnipotence will determine the fate of life on this planet, forever. 
We must begin to visualize a world without the sword. When conflicts 
arise, resolution is sought without consideration of force. The 
clinched fist of the animal becomes the helping hand of humanity. 
<P> The way to this New Paradigm of Peace is a hazy path through the 
future's shadowy landscape, but we have our reason, our past and our 
God to guide us. The logical understanding that nothing, neither land 
nor cause (economic, political or theological) justifies jeopardizing 
the future of the great human experiment becomes fundamental to the 
mandate of nonviolent resolution for human conflict. In the 21st 
century, the only survivable victory is peace. 
<P> Such thinking could transform this new century into an age of 
enlightenment and the next to utopia. Our bloody past has left us with 
two imperatives for the future. First, the cost of war is always 
greater than the gain. It is estimated that had the resources expended 
on war in this century alone been directed toward humane advancement, 
mankind's battle against poverty and disease might have been moved 
forward five hundred years. Second, war is always a result of failed 
diplomacy. There is no such thing as an unpreventable war. The old 
adage - that the first victim of war is truth - certainly applies 
here. When they tell us military involvement is unavoidable, truth is 
dead and battle begins. 
<P> Finally, it is not possible to summon an army of any consequence 
without giving the calling "spiritual wings." Most soldiers do not 
leave hearth and home to face the horror of battle without their god 
with them. Those who propagate the paradigm of war know this and 
encourage it. Thoughts of God have been in the heart of every soldier 
on every battlefield from the beginning of time, and the guidance of 
that same God must be sought at the table of peace as well. 
<P> What kind of god would want the children to war among themselves? 
Listen to the words of a brother of the Prince of Peace. 
<P> "From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not 
hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? Ye lust, and have 
not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, 
yet ye have not, because ye ask not. Ye ask, and receive not, because 
ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lust." 
<P> As we ask for peace, let us not do so to devour such upon our 
craving; but rather, with the unique compassion which distinguishes us 
as mankind. 
<P> 
<P>
