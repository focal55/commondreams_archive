<p>Ralph Nader's candidacy for President will bring a turnout of progressive
voters who could  furnish the margin of victory in enough close
Congressional races for the Democrats to regain control of Congress.  Nader
will energize many Progressives who would otherwise sit out the election
because Gore appears too much in-the-pockets of big corporate power and
hesitates and hedges on critical issues of economic and social justice like
world trade, campaign finance reform, and the death penalty.  Nader voters
are largely to the left of the political spectrum and will overwhelmingly
choose the more liberal Democratic candidates for Congress.   

<p>Gore strategists see Nader as a dark cloud hanging over crucial states like
California that could wash away Gore's chances by swinging some closely
contested states to Bush, but Democrats wanting to control Congress as much
as the White House are beginning to see a silver lining in Nader's
candidacy.   Clinton is raising big bucks for Democratic Congressional
candidates,  but many progressive Democrats blame the loss of Congress on
the Administration's botching of issues like health care reform and disagree
with Clinton's  co-opting conservative issues like welfare reform and
utilizing cynical and selfish "triangulation" politics.  

<p>Some liberal Democratic activists believe that the Administration's
"Republican mimicking" has helped produce the greatest shift in wealth from
the poor and middle class to the very rich in our nation's history.  They
feel the Administration's "new Democrat" agenda is selling out the
traditional Democratic working class base to global trading corporate
interests and is only paying lip service to the cause of economic justice.
Since the embarrassing loss on the big  issue of health care for all
Americans, Clinton has disingenuously disguised his rightward drift with
never-ending announcements of nuanced social tinkering, like offering niche
voters help in obtaining cell phones for crime watch block patrols and
advocating uniforms for public school children.  
  
<p>Mark Penn, Clinton's polling guru, identifies these micro-issues through
sophisticated techniques learned while selling the products of corporate
giants like AT&T, Procter & Gamble, and Microsoft.  The June 18th edition of
the N.Y. Times Magazine profiles Penn, who is also polling for Hillary
Clinton in New York.  Penn and his partner, Doug Schoen, also poll for the
Democratic National Committee and were introduced to Clinton by the crafty
cross-over consultant, Dick Morris.   Clinton, ever fearful of the "L-word"
label and always the savvy political pragmatist, saw such incrementalism as
a way to carve out enough votes from the moderate middle to win. 
 
<p>Nader voters are big issue activists who are concerned with the alarming
statistics on global warming, increasing income disparity, profligate
defense spending, and the racial divide.  Without Nader in the race, many
are disinclined to vote for a lessor of two evils --- an Administration that
tinkers around the edges and becomes an accessory to these growing
problems.   The voters Nader brings to the polls will vote overwhelmingly
for Democrats in Congressional races because they are more progressive than
their Republican opponents on the issues.   Rather than hurting Gore, there
is always the chance that Nader's candidacy will spur Gore on to speak out
on critical issues like racial justice and will energize the traditional
Democratic vote to furnish Gore the margin of  victory.  

<p>Gore has had little to say about three recent studies that cry out for
leadership in the struggle for racial justice.   According to Human Rights
Watch, five times as many whites use "illegal drugs" as do blacks, but
blacks comprise 62% of drug offenders sent to state prisons (in South
Carolina it's 86%) and blacks are only 13% of the overall U.S. population.
The U.S. Justice Department and five major foundations' study on racial
disparities in the juvenile justice system revealed that black youth were
six times more likely to go to jail than white youths charged with similar
crimes and who had similar criminal records.  A 1999 study by the University
of Michigan's Survey Research Center, funded by the National Science
Foundation, found the net worth for the median African-American family was
$7000, and the net worth for the median white family was $84,400!

<p>Randal Robinson of Trans-Africa has signed on as Co-Chair of Nader's
National Steering Committee, so we can expect Nader to make racial justice
an issue.  Nader's straight talk about big issues will bring out more voters
for a Democratic Congress and maybe even help Gore if he'll quit hemming and
hawing and take a stand on meaningful issues of justice. 
<p><i>Tom Turnipseed, former President of the SC Trial Lawyers Association, is a plaintiff's and civil rights attorney in Columbia, SC. He was co-counsel for the Macedonia Baptist Church, an African American congregation in Clarendon County, SC which won a $37,000,000.00 (Thirty Seven Million Dollar) verdict in 1998 against the Ku Klux Klan for burning their church. A former SC State Senator, he is active in state politics and has been the democratic nominee for state Attorney General and Congress. Tom is President of the Center for Democratic Renewal (formerly the Anti-Klan Network) a nationally recognized civil rights organization based in Atlanta. In 1998, he received the Holmes-Weatherly Award, the Unitarian-Universalist Association's highest honor for the pursuit of social justice.
