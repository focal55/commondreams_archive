The economy is strong. Crime rates have 
dropped. Now, as any pollster can tell you, the environment 
has crept up on the list of worries Americans are losing sleep 
over.	 

<P> A recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California 
and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation found that Californians 
are so concerned about the environment they are willing to tolerate 
higher housing and gasoline prices to protect it. Seventy percent 
of state residents see environmental problems as a threat to 
their health and well-being, with one in four characterizing 
the danger as ``very serious.''	 
</P>
<P> In the Bay Area, the environmentally 
correct routinely sort bottles, cans and newspapers on garbage 
pickup day. We weigh whether we want paper or plastic at the 
checkout stand and agonize over decisions like what type of 
diapers to buy. We may even choose to shop on the Internet, 
believing that e-commerce is a greener way to go.	 
</P>
<P> Meanwhile, 
our increasingly affluent population is producing and consuming 
at unprecedented rates. We can pat ourselves on the back because 
we're recycling more than ever, but the fact remains that we're 
also producing more waste than ever, especially in the areas 
of energy consumption, land use and packaging. Ironically, even 
when we mean to think and act green --  by shopping on the Internet 
in order to save gas, for instance --  our best efforts fail.	 
</P>
<P> Breathing Uneasy	 
</P>
<P> It's sobering to think about the amount 
of carbon dioxide each car, truck and SUV emits into the atmosphere. 
For reference, one gallon of gasoline creates about 22 pounds 
of carbon dioxide, the gas most responsible for the types of 
atmospheric changes that could lead to global warming. Let's 
say you've got a big SUV that gets around 12 miles per gallon, 
and you drive an average of 12,000 miles per year. The 1,000 
gallons of gas you burn will create 22,000 pounds --  11 tons -- of carbon dioxide.	 
</P>
<P> Even smaller, fuel-efficient cars 
create a fair amount of carbon dioxide. A car getting 30 mpg 
would need only 400 gallons to go those 12,000 miles but would 
still create 800 pounds, or 4.4 tons, of greenhouse gas annually. 
Put another way, each car creates its own weight in carbon dioxide 
every 4 to 6 months.	 
</P>
<P> Our reawakened love affair with big 
gas guzzlers is one reason we continue to pump huge amounts 
of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. But an overlooked contributor 
is that we no longer commute into the city as much as we used 
to. In the 1970s, about 25 percent of people carpooled. Today, 
the number is closer to 8 percent. A good part of the reason 
is that many of us no longer commute into the central city, 
but now move from suburb to suburb. There is no efficient and 
convenient way to do this, so we're forced to drive, mostly 
individually, from home to work and back.	 
</P>
<P> Now that gas 
prices are high, we have good reason to think about saving energy 
and finding ways to do things differently. First and foremost, 
try to carpool. Second, take public transportation when you 
can. Third, consolidate your trips so that you can take fewer 
of them, saving time, money and gasoline. And when you need 
to go out, exercise your legs, rather than the gas pedal, by 
walking and biking.	 
</P>
<P> Land Misuse	 
</P>
<P> Besides discouraging 
carpooling and use of public transportation, suburban growth 
has harmed the environment in many ways. It has reduced the 
amount of green space available for wildlife habitation and 
species diversity, which in turn lowers an area's ability to 
absorb excess carbon dioxide and generate oxygen. The more obvious 
and easy-to-spot damage includes increased flooding, because 
there's less ground available to absorb storm water, as well 
as lower air quality from smog and other pollutants.	 
</P>
<P> One of the major causes of suburban growth has been the spiraling 
cost of living in places like San Francisco and Silicon Valley. 
The Bay Area's beauty and hot economy is a double-edged sword, 
since the strong desire to live here has created an explosion 
in population growth, which in turn has helped send the price 
of food, shelter and other necessities skyward. The high prices 
have helped lead an exodus to suburbia. 	 
</P>
<P> These population 
shifts have taken a potentially environment-friendly situation 
of many people living close together who can walk or bus to 
work and turned it into an environment-unfriendly situation 
of many people spread over a large area who must drive virtually 
everywhere.	 
</P>
<P> Solutions to these issues include policies 
that encourage businesses to locate, and people to live and 
work near cities. Also required is the development of transportation 
and communications infrastructures that make it easier and cheaper 
to commute into the cities rather than between suburbs.	 
</P>
<P>Not-So-Pretty Packaging	 
</P>
<P> Americans are recycling trash 
and garbage like never before --  but the tonnage of discarded 
waste has also started to grow after several years of decline, 
according to a recent report by the Environmental Protection 
Agency.	 
</P>
<P> One of the key culprits here is the amount of packaging 
we create, which continues to not only increase, but is growing 
faster than the rest of the garbage we generate. According to 
the EPA, packaging waste grew from 64.5 to 71.8 million tons 
between 1990 and 1997. In 1990, packaging accounted for 31.4 
percent of household waste. By 1997, it grew to 33.1 percent 
of the total. EPA estimates show these growth trends continuing 
through at least 2005.	 
</P>
<P> If we're so aware of the need to 
use less, why is packaging waste still growing? First, we are 
overwhelmed by all we have to do, and therefore wish for more 
free time. Second, we are an insecure lot, and need to feel 
that we're getting the most for our money.	 
</P>
<P> Our frenetic 
lifestyles make spare time scarce and therefore precious. To 
compensate, we demand that products provide high levels of convenience. 
We want our foods precooked, preportioned and pre-plated. We 
want other goods and services to be prepackaged, prearranged 
and precisely measured. And we're willing to pay a premium price 
to get all of this.	 
</P>
<P> Unfortunately, with more convenience 
comes more packaging, and lots of it. Think about how much material 
is thrown away after serving individual frozen dinners and prepackaged 
lunches, for example. And if you serve an entire family this 
way, the waste can easily fill up a small trash can.	 
</P>
<P> Think of mini-bags of Goldfish. Junior sizes of yogurt. Kool-Aid in 
little bottles. All of these come with as much packaging as 
product: little bits of food in little packages, put in bigger 
packages that are then over-wrapped. Think of Happy Meals. Look 
at the colorful box! Inside is another colorful box filled with 
french fries. And another colorful wrapper with a hamburger. 
There's also a cup filled with soda and covered with a lid. 
Of course, there's also a little toy, wrapped for your protection. 
If you're eating at the restaurant, why can't they just put 
all that stuff on a tray?	 
</P>
<P> At grocery stores, you're increasingly 
likely to see fresh food sold in specific portions and packaged 
plastic containers. Suppose you have a recipe that calls for 
shallots. You need only one or two. Can you buy one or two? 
No. The store insists on packaging a dozen together. Yes, they 
sell more shallots. And yes, you throw more stuff away --  the 
container and the 10 or 11 sorry-looking shallots that rotted 
in your refrigerator three weeks later. Ditto for zucchini, 
squash, corn and other veggies packed this way.	 
</P>
<P> In addition 
to convenience, our need to feel that we're getting what we 
paid for makes packaging a potent tool for marketers and retailers.	 
</P>
<P> Take toothpaste, for example. The product --  the toothpaste 
</P>
<P>-- is basically the same from brand to brand. For marketers, 
the trick is to get us to buy their product, and preferably, 
to pay more for it than we would for anybody else's. How do 
they accomplish this? Some genius comes up with the idea of 
dispensing toothpaste in pump form. Consumers fall for the gimmick 
</P>
<P>-- a fancy package dispensing the same old product --  without 
stopping to consider that the old way of dispensing toothpaste 
not only worked just as well as the new way, it generated less 
waste.	 
</P>
<P> Perfume is another good example. Take off the cellophane 
and open the cardboard box. Reach in and grab the smaller ``presentation 
box.'' Take off the top of this box and see the tiny bottle 
of fragrance nestled in a felt-coated cardboard or plastic holder. 
Odds are you spent a fortune --  mostly for the packaging and 
advertising that got you to pick this brand in the first place.	 
</P>
<P> Computer software is a notorious example of bigger is better. 
Inside that big box is a slab of cardboard or foam. Wrapped 
inside is a little bitty CD or disk. Why the big box? To charge 
you a big price.	 
</P>
<P> There are some simple things you can do 
to reduce waste while still saving time. In many cases, these 
suggestions will save you money, as well. For example, let's 
say your kids are off to day camp tomorrow, and you have to 
go shopping for lunches. The first thing to do is buy large-size, 
rather than single-serve, bags of items like carrot sticks, 
celery, cookies and pretzels. Second, pick up some reusable 
Ziploc-style bags. Third, as soon as you get home, break these 
down into smaller sizes and store in the Ziploc bags. When it's 
time to pack lunches, most of the work will already be done.	 
</P>
<P> There are also ways to overcome the big-is-better syndrome, 
too. Take software, for example. Many companies now make their 
products available over the Internet, as well as through stores. 
You can download and install the software directly from Web 
sites and keep manuals on your hard drive rather than on your 
bookshelf. The result? No packaging at all.	 
</P>
<P> Our real environmental 
problems are due to the ways in which increasingly affluent, 
ever larger populations produce and consume food and energy 
and make use of land. Recycling is great. Keep doing it. But 
it's also time to find ways to consume less and to make better 
use of what we have.	 
<HR>

<P>

<H3>GOOD THINGS DON'T ALWAYS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES	 </H3>
<P> Excess packaging 
is not only on the rise, it's growing faster than the rest of 
the garbage we generate. That's because many of the items we 
consume come with as much packaging as product. Here are a few 
examples of particularly wasteful packaging, as well as some 
alternatives.	 
</P>
<P> --  Little bitty drinks packaged in paperboard cartons and 
covered with shrink-wrap. How about making Kool-Aid from concentrate 
and serving it in a reuseable container?	 
</P>
<P> --  The ultimate convenient school lunch. 
An outer paperboard box, with a plastic tray inside. Most items 
inside are prepackaged. Far more packaging than product.	 
</P>
<P> --  All the ingredients 
in one plastic single-serve package. How about putting some 
peanut butter and jelly on crackers and putting the crackers 
in a reusable container?	 
</P>
<P> --  Oh, those teeny little cans! 
Single-servings mean you get as much can as you get food. Buy 
larger cans and cover with foil. Better yet, buy dry food and 
add your own water.	 
</P>
<P> --  Inside this package are a few carrots in one pouch and 
some dressing in another. Pack carrots in reusable Ziploc bag 
and put dressing in a small reuseable container instead.	 
</P>
<P> --  Nice-looking bottle. In a nice-looking paperboard box 
with a see-through plastic window. No other cold cream needs 
a box. Why this one?	 
</P>
<P> --  Snack packs are just a little bit of food 
packed in a bag, put in a box and shrink-wrapped. Save money 
and resources by buying a large bag and putting one serving 
in a Ziploc.	 
</P>
<P> --  Tiny cups of yogurt held together with a big paperboard 
container. Why do you need the paperboard? And why not buy large 
sizes of yogurt and divvy them up yourself?	 
<HR>

<P>
<H3>IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE	 </H3>
<P> The more we recycle, 
the better we feel. The better we feel, the more we justify 
consuming --  especially if we're going to recycle. But you 
can't recycle the most important thing we consume: Energy. It 
takes energy to fuel the factories that create products, to 
get the products to the store and to melt down or otherwise 
recycle products. So while it's great to recycle, here's a list 
of things you can do to cut down on the consumption of energy.	 
</P>
<P> --  Choose a place to live that reduces the need to drive 
</P>
<P>-- remember that transportation is responsible for about one-third 
of energy consumed in the United States.	 
</P>
<P> --  Make your 
next car more fuel-efficient --  especially you SUV drivers.	 
</P>
<P> --  Consolidate trips. Going to the west side of town? Think 
about everything you can do while over there, rather than making 
separate journeys.	 
</P>
<P> --  Buy secondhand. More and more people 
are discovering the joys and value of buying all sorts of used 
stuff. This means that items last longer, reducing the need 
to produce new ones. And whole new stores are catering to these 
needs. There are used computer stores, sporting goods resellers, 
outlets for children's clothes and used CD stores popping up 
all over the place. So before you buy new, do the following:	 
</P>
<P> 1) Check the yellow pages for stores that buy and sell 
the used items you're looking for, and search the Internet for 
sites selling ``pre-owned items.'' 	 
</P>
<P> 2) Consider trading 
unwanted items you have for something else. This keeps your 
old stuff in circulation and out of the landfill. Clothes are 
a good example, since we get tired of them long before they 
actually wear out.	 
</P>
<P> --  Share. Why buy stuff if you can 
share it? Talk to your neighbors about jointly purchasing things 
you all need but only use occasionally. Examples include lawn 
mowers, hedge trimmers and other lawn and garden tools.	 
</P>
<P> --  Compost yard wastes and grass clippings. Cut the grass 
with a mulching mower to save time and resources while reducing 
waste. Since mulch acts as a fertilizer, you save money and 
reduce the amount of chemicals that seep into ground water and 
aquifers.	 
</P>
<P> --  Water the lawn in the early morning or evening, 
not during the heat of the day. This way, water will soak into 
the ground instead of evaporating.	 
</P>
<P> --  Improve the efficiency 
of home appliances, heating and cooling systems by dusting off 
coils and cleaning or changing filters.	 
</P>
<P> --  When birthday 
invitations arrive, try making the gift wrap yourself out of 
newspapers, magazine ads, etc. Also, consider buying gifts that 
are both thoughtful and consumption-reducing, like tickets to 
concerts, movies, skating rinks and sporting events. Gift certificates 
to local book, record and clothing stores also ensure your friends 
choose something they really want, and thus won't end up throwing 
it away.	 
</P>
<P> --  Spend less time in front of the TV and computer. 
Not only will it save energy, but it might bring you closer 
as a family.	 
</P>
<P> --  Use the library. It's a great source for 
magazine exchanges or checking out the latest video or CD. You 
can even borrow a book there for free.	 
</P>
<P> --  Thinking about 
buying something? Try the 30-Day Rule. If you still want it 
30 days from the first time you saw it, chances are it's something 
to really consider purchasing. Waiting the 30 days helps eliminate 
impulse buying.
