<p>LONDON -   On the day Lebanese Hizbollah guerrillas captured three Israeli soldiers in disputed border territory I was sitting talking to a middle-aged, middle-class Palestinian mother, a medical doctor, brought up in this country after Jewish fighters ejected her family from West Jerusalem in 1948 and far more likely to be found lecturing in her cut-glass English at a podium or ministering to the poor at her London surgery than breaking and piling up stones for children to throw at Israeli soldiers, though she would relish the experience. 
<P>She was beside herself at the news. She hit her palm with her fist; phoned a friend; jumped for joy. Her eyes glowed. Hizbollah's achievement in ejecting the Israeli army from Lebanon after 22 years has struck an ominous and envious chord in all Palestinians.  
<P>On the day of the lynching of two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah, Palestinians and other Arab friends of mine were not so much horrified as resigned. They were much more concerned by President Clinton's immediate condemnation of the 'murder' while the deaths by Israeli rifle fire of 25 Palestinian children up to that stage had evoked from him no such comment. To them, and to their millions of compatriots, the state of siege the Palestinians found themselves in and the underlying vitriolic hatreds released by the events of the previous weeks more than justified such an horrific act, an understandable reprisal, as one of them put it, by a resistance movement fighting against military occupation.  
<P>It is not surprising, this outpouring of hate, this bloodstained Schadenfreude, fuelled as it is by 52 years of Palestinian dispossession, 33 years of military occupation and the callous disregard for Arab lives shown by Israel's security forces and politicians and its many friends abroad. The river of bile flows from the continuing and, it seems, infinitely extendible, suppression of Palestinian civil and human rights under the diaphanous covering of the Oslo peace negotiations.  
<P>The Oslo process, woven in secret in 1993 - a bad start - and the skin-deep improvement since then in relations between some Israelis and some Arabs, has been a misleading and humiliating farce for the Palestinians. Yet it has been one they and their leader played out in mainly peaceful compliance until the beginning of the end of the whole affair at Camp David this summer. Then, the long-delayed but crucial issues of Jerusalem and refugees, Israel-Palestine borders and Jewish settlements, were finally addressed, with formidable pressure on Yasser Arafat to concede the match and yield any further claims against Israel, a pressure he successfully resisted with the reward of Arab accolade and American-Israeli contumely.  
<P>Now it is the end, the bitter end, manifested in the physical explosion of Arab resentment, frustration and loss of hope inside the Occupied Territories and inside Israel proper - among its one million (second-class) Palestinian citizens - during the past 17 days.  
<P>The essential flaw in the peace process is not just the vagueness of the original Oslo project, by which the Israelis were able to delay their staged military withdrawals from or redeployments in the Occupied Territories of the West Bank and Gaza to the extent that they are in possession of 60 per cent of the former and 20 per cent of the latter to this day, and still, as we see daily, effectively command and control the rest.  
<P>It is not just that in the seven years of this process, against the spirit but not the letter, of Oslo, Israel's illegal settler population in the West Bank and Gaza (not counting the Jerusalem settlers) has expanded from 110,000 to 195,000. Since Ehud Barak came to power 15 months ago, nearly 2,000 dwellings have been started in the Israeli settlements, about the same number as for 1998 under the ostensibly more aggressive Binyamin Netanyahu.  
<P>Nor is it only the closure of Jerusalem to Palestinians not resident there (which means that most Palestinians in the Territories cannot pray at the Holy Islamic and Christian sites of the Old City); nor the ethnic cleansing of Arabs from Jerusalem; nor the daily indignities at the roadblocks and Ministries and criminal courts run by a foreign military power; though all these impositions, which we called apartheid and pass laws in South Africa, continued to intensify Palestinian despair while the diplomats and politicians displayed their maps and talked of peace.  
<P>It was not alone the shame of seeing the leader, the Old Man, the apotheosis of Palestinian Nationalism, Yasser Arafat, forced into the role of quisling, arresting his own activists, made to bear responsibility for outrages triggered by the aggravation of his people by military occupation. Today, full of flaws, unaccountable, autocratic, quivering, beaten down, the visionary who brought the Palestinians to the brink of statehood, as he thought, seeing his dream explode, he evokes that cry: 'Those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad.'   
<P>No. It was more than this that accumulated and broke the dam. The Palestinians found out this summer that Israel wanted yet more concessions: their legal rights to proper, effective self-determination traded for a clean bill of health for Israel. For an ephemeral state, Arafat was to sign up to dropping the whole Palestinian case against Israel. For the administration of a sticking plaster, a deep and angry wound was to be forgotten: the exodus from Palestine; the horrors of massacre and exile; the right of return; all recognised by and enshrined in international law and United Nations resolutions.  
<P>As for Jerusalem, the Arabs had notionally conceded West Jerusalem to the Jews (a concession made by no major government, neither the United States nor Britain, for instance, since Israel's creation in 1948): now they were being asked to concede East, Arab, Jerusalem as well; though Ehud Barak's smoke and mirrors would have been deployed to make this look palatable, with outer Arab city areas granted a kind of municipal quasi-sovereignty.  
<P>The Israeli and American spin doctors convinced most of the media that only the Holy Places were at issue, when it was the ancient and continuing right to Jerusalem, the right to the communications, commerce, vitality, heritage, bloodline, stones and bones of that city, to a real capital at Palestine's core, the new state's nerve centre, that Arafat held out for and for which justifiable campaign he was excoriated and blamed by President Bill Clinton. It was ironic that, in the end, it was in the Holy Places where the dam finally broke.  
<P>Here is the final indignity, clear, undeniable yet unsolvable. The United States is no arbiter in this dispute between a feeble, nascent nation with no muscle and a shiftless, shaky Arab world at its rear; no unbiased broker with the best interests of both parties at heart, holding the ring for a fair outcome. The United States of Bill Clinton, and any foreseeable United States of Al Gore or of George W. Bush, is the friend, mentor, armourer and financier of Israel, advocate, judge and, ultimately, progenitor and saviour of unilateral Israeli rights and executioner of Palestinian aspirations. If anything, the jury, Congress, outdoes the Presidency, having already, by law, sanctified the confiscation by Israel of Palestinian refugee property by decreeing that the American Embassy in Israel should move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, on to what is largely stolen Palestinian land; only presidential veto, and that only just, has prevented this awesome precedent. As  Pat Buchanan once said: 'Congress is Israeli-occupied territory.'  
<P>No nation - none in Europe, especially Britain; none in the Arab world - can gainsay the United States's power or dare point out the futility of its contradictory position; nor can anyone deny American determination to hold Middle East diplomacy close to its chest.  
<P>Even Kofi Annan is regarded by the Arabs as an American plenipotentiary, called in temporarily to save the game from a disordered passage of play. And when, if another 'peace process' starts, it will be an American call, with American cards, at an American table, with Israel eyeing the pot.  
<P>For this reason, as far as the eye can see and despair can stretch, the Israelis and Palestinians are doomed to play out their wretched parts: Israel possessed of the hubris of demanding control of and security in the whole Holy Land in the false colours of a mutually beneficial peace treaty; the Palestinians denied any realistic semblance of self-determination or self-respect. One day nemesis will come, in God knows what form and at what date. Judging by the past two weeks it cannot be far away.
