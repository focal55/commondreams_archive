IF CORPORATE stonewallers are the obvious villains in the Firestone tire
fiasco, trial lawyers turn out to be the unexpected heroes. Never thought you'd
appreciate trial lawyers? Put your preconceptions aside and keep reading. By
now, everyone knows about the apparently fatal combination of defective
Firestone tires and Ford Explorers. But as recently as Aug. 2, Firestone
adamantly refused to admit that there was any danger at all. "These are good
tires," its spokeswoman insisted. Ford advanced its own cover-up, blaming
everything on Firestone even though the auto maker knew about and ignored the
exceptionally high incidence of tire failure on its Explorer and Mountaineer
SUVs. While it is natural to be outraged at the evasive tactics of Ford and
Firestone, they should hardly come as a surprise. Stonewalling, after all, is
what corporations do when they are faced with potentially massive liability
-except they call it "crisis management." There is even a certain logic to it.
<P>
Accidents, including fatal accidents, are to be expected in the automotive
industries. At one level, they are regarded as an accounting problem -risk
assessment, they call it -requiring only that an adequate reserve fund be set
up to handle the anticipated injury claims. No one expects a company to recall
6.5 million tires on the basis of a scattered handful of accidents. Devastating
as they might be to the victims and their families, deadly blowouts are part of
doing business to vast enterprises such as Ford and Firestone. Or, as a Ford
spokeswoman rationalized, "Every accident involves three factors: the vehicle,
the driver and the environment." So why rush to take responsibility? But
seemingly unrelated incidents may turn out to be tragically linked, perhaps by
tires produced in a single factory. In large corporations, however, every
incentive operates against the early recognition of such connections. Isolated
accidents can be blamed on drivers or road conditions -and individual lawsuits
can be quietly settled -but the acknowledgment of a defective product can lead
to a corporate calamity. So denial becomes the automatic response. Meanwhile,
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was in no position to be
quickly proactive. Although the NHTSA received early reports of fatalities due
to tread separation and subsequent rollovers, it was years before the
underfunded and overburdened agency launched a comprehensive investigation.
<P>
While the NHTSA has no incentive to suppress bad news, it faces the herculean
task of assembling and interpreting data from literally tens of thousands of
accidents each year. Thus, reports of separate accidents tend to be
pigeonholed, at least until a pattern becomes inescapably evident. So how did
the whole story finally come out, with Ford and Firestone in deep denial and
the NHTSA overwhelmed and short-staffed? The answer is that a group of personal
injury lawyers began filing lawsuits -and eventually succeeded in bringing the
problem tires to public attention. Of course, they didn't do it out of altruism
or public spiritedness, but they did have all the right incentives necessary to
blow the whistle on a hazardous situation.
<P>
    A single automobile fatality is nothing more than a statistic to a
corporate troubleshooter or a government bureaucrat. But to a lawyer, it's a
case -maybe even a big one. So the lawyer has ample reason to investigate each
accident, and to search out causes that might make the potential verdict bigger
(or easier to get).
<P>
    To strengthen their cases, trial lawyers collect, share and publicize
information despite the automakers' best efforts to keep things under wraps.
<P>
Plaintiffs' lawyers also provide the funding for research groups -such as the
Center for Auto Safety and Safety Forum -that first drew the necessary
connections and branded the SUV tires defective. Indeed, it was a series of
personal injury lawsuits -beginning in 1996 -that finally spurred the NHSTA to
begin its own investigation last May.
<P>
    In other words, the much maligned litigation system works pretty well.
<P>
Individual lawyers, working on behalf of injured clients, actually do seek out
and expose dangerous conditions. Without the work of trial lawyers, there is no
telling how much longer Firestone tires would have remained on the road,
causing further rollovers and endangering lives.
<P>
    Of course, the lawyers do it only to make a buck. But the desire to make a
buck turns out to be an extraordinarily powerful engine for the exposure of
harmful products. Just as the profit motive can cause corporations to overlook
potential safety hazards, it also inspires trial lawyers to uncover them.
<P>
    So the next time someone complains to you about the "litigation explosion,"
take a look at the tires on the nearest SUV. Then ask yourself how much longer
Ford and Firestone might have stalled if no lawsuits had ever been filed.
