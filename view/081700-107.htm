'I'M LOOKING at the most powerful people in America," Gerald McEntee,
president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
Union, told union-member delegates on the eve of the Democratic convention.
<P>
"You can decide the outcome of this presidential election."
    It was not entirely hyperbole to fire up the la- bor troops, who make up 30
percent of convention delegates. Unions provided vital early primary election
muscle against Sen. Bill Bradley, and this November they will have to turn out
voters disproportionately from union households for Al Gore to win essential
midwestern swing states, such as Michigan and Ohio.
<P>
    By the normal calculus of politics, Gore would then owe working people-and
their unions-a big debt of gratitude. Their reward certainly should go beyond
what Clinton delivered. Al- though wages at the bottom of the job hierarchy
have risen recently, as a result of minimum wage hikes and a tight labor
market, most moderate-income workers gained relatively little from the Clinton
boom, and the gap between the corporate elite and everyone else widened.
<P>
Luckily for Gore, he could satisfy his union family supporters with a few
strategic moves that would also be both good public policy and a boost to the
Democratic Party.
<P>
    But those same moves might not satisfy the corporate funders much in
evidence as the convention opened, such as SBC (Telecom), Blue Cross
(insurance), Raytheon (military hardware) and the National Restaurant
Association (opponents of the minimum wage). Though some unions, like
McEntee's, are big contributors, all unions together have given only about 10
percent of the money the Democratic Party itself has raised.
<P>
    But if Gore wanted to reverse the nation's growing inequality, he could,
first of all, promote legislation to make it easier for workers to organize
unions and harder for employers to interfere with their choice, for example, by
granting union recognition simply when a majority of workers sign union cards.
<P>
Though getting comprehensive labor law reform through Congress now seems
unlikely, Gore - and other labor-backed politicians -could still show up at
office buildings and factories where workers are organizing to support them and
oppose employer harassment of pro- union workers.
<P>
    Gore could also make sure that no federal money is used, even indirectly,
to fund anti-union campaigns, as happens so often now, and treat persistent
corporate labor law violators as "irresponsible contractors" that can be barred
from federal bidding. He could also change federal policy toward recent
immigrants, one of the most promising groups for union organizing, by
establishing a new amnesty program for those who have been here for years
without proper papers and by protecting workplace rights of immigrants rather
than harassing them.
<P>
    If more workers organize, they will have greater power to reverse the
decline in income equality that started in the early 1970s, which will be good
for the economy as a whole. That will also help to better enforce existing
workplace laws and give a voice to workers, helping to democratize the economy.
<P>
Politically, it would also help the Democrats, whose slippage - especially as a
progressive party -tracks closely the decline of organized labor. But it might
upset Jonathan Tisch, the chief executive of the Loews hotel chain and a major
Democratic Party contributor, whose luxury Santa Monica hotel was the target of
a major rally supporting workers who are trying to organize in the face of the
company's anti-union campaign.
<P>
    Second, Gore could use public policy directly to reduce the income gap.
<P>
Beyond preventing privatization of Social Security and raising the minimum
wage, the most urgent need for working people is national health insurance.
<P>
That would essentially mean expanding an improved Medicare program to the
entire population, starting -if Gore insists on small steps -with coverage of
all children.
<P>
    But he could also begin to reclaim the notion that federal monetary and
budgetary policy should aim to keep unemployment low, not just fight inflation
or reduce the debt. If Gore simply re-read the 1992 Clinton-Gore tract,
"Putting People First," he would find better ideas for public investment than
either his debt-reduction plan or the Republicans' proposed tax cuts.
<P>
    Finally, Gore needs to deliver on his promises to make workers' rights and
environmental protection part of all global economic agreements. The growing
power of multinational corporations in a global economy has been a major factor
in the trend toward economic inequality and the silencing of workers' voices on
the job. Increasingly, the rights and standards of American workers are linked
to the fate of working people in other countries.
<P>
    Moreover, the political future of the Democratic Party hinges on its
adopting a new approach to globalization, an issue where Clinton and Gore have
been out of step with most of the public, especially union workers. Instead of
continuing to act as a global apologist for the biggest banks and corporations,
Gore should be arguing for the same kind of regulation of corporations in the
global economy that progressive reformers won domestically over the past
century.
<P>
    While Gore's strategists, busy trying to inoculate his campaign against the
Republican campaign's character attacks, would scoff at the idea of running for
president on such a bold platform, polls generally indicate that these three
strategic initatives would have wide popular support.
<P>
    Will Gore seize the chance to reward the union workers who put him in
office with sound policies that are politically popular and would strengthen
the Democratic Party? His labor backers hope so, but the growing corporate
influence in the Democratic Party certainly makes it less likely, even if they
have the power, as McEntee argued, to determine who will become president this
fall.
