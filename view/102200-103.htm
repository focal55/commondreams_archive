AFTER SEVERAL DECADES characterized by collective somnambulence at best, 
and unrepentant self-serving gluttony at worst, Americans have begun to wake 
up to some very ugly truths. Everything from our basic civil liberties to 
the climate and the safety of the food we eat is imperiled.
<P>  By way of response, the direct action against the WTO in Seattle ushered 
in a new era of activism, and with it a commitment to challenging the 
unsavory practices of multinational corporations, governmental bodies and 
other institutions that wield power over our lives.	 
</P>
<P>  Buoyed by this vibrant energy, I am not alone in feeling tingly with hope 
for the first time in years. And yet I am disturbed by the tactics of some 
of today's activists. Fortunately, whether we're talking about AIDS 
research, animal rights, saving redwoods, or stopping sweatshop labor, the 
overwhelming majority of activists is committed to nonviolent action.	 
</P>
<P>As a pacifist and a realist, I applaud this path and walk it myself. My 
concern is with those whose approach includes smashing storefronts, setting 
fires and throwing rocks at police. Equally disturbing are environmentalists 
who spike trees, endangering the lives of loggers and mill workers, AIDS 
activists who disrupt civic meetings and hurl fake blood at pharmaceutical 
company executives and animal liberationists who torch labs.	 
</P>
<P>  I certainly share in the outrage of anyone who has seen a clear-cut 
forest, watched an animal suffer or a friend die because he couldn't afford 
medication. But how can we expect anyone else to stop committing acts of 
personal or institutional violence if we ourselves cannot? Many sincere, 
committed activists are convinced that violence is justified in the 
service of the greater good. To such people I say: You cannot do this alone. 
To make the changes this country so desperately needs, you must have at 
least the tacit support of the majority of Americans -- which you'll never 
get by dishing up mayhem on the evening news.	 
</P>
<P>Violent tactics serve to alienate the very people whom the activists are 
trying to convince, while simultaneously deflecting attention from their 
message.	 
</P>
<P>  Violence is counterproductive and symptomatic of old-paradigm thinking 
that we need outgrow. When we act from a place of rage and hate, we will 
only generate like energy in return. Instead we ought to turn, for example, 
to South Africa as a model for compassionate change -- coming from a people 
who chose reconciliation over retribution despite centuries of subjugation.	 
</P>
<P>  At the same time, it behooves us to remember one thing about those whose 
policies poison ground water, block paths to potential cures, criminalize 
classes of people, play Russian Roulette with our genetic inheritance and 
force people to work at less-than-subsistence wages: they are asleep to 
their own humanity and oblivious to that of others.	 
</P>
<P>  People who make power or profits their God are not so much evil as they 
are profoundly and dangerously ill. And just as we don't get an alcoholic 
sober by beating him over the head with a whiskey bottle, so too will we 
fail to awaken the hearts of government and industry leaders by attacking 
them.	 
</P>
<P>Instead, by engaging in peaceful demonstrations, ballot initiatives, 
informational picket lines, class-action lawsuits, consumer boycotts, 
letter-writing campaigns, and good, old-fashioned voting, we raise awareness 
about effective alternatives to animal testing; the number of jobs the 
United States lost to NAFTA; 
inhumane working conditions in factories where our athletic shoes are made; 
the dangers of unleashing genetically engineered crops without adequate 
research into the ramifications; the incalculable value of medicinal plants 
in rain forests being wiped out in favor of grazing cattle for ever more 
MacBurgers. Through thoughtful engagement, we open a public dialogue.	 
</P>
<P>  Spiking a tree is a statement. Statement is monologue. You cannot debate 
a spike, discuss with a rock, or open a dialogue with a Molotov cocktail. 
Communication, not escalation, is the key.	 
</P>
<P>  And if we think ``the enemy'' is cruel and inhumane, then we must strive 
harder to model the sort of behavior we wish to see in others. Let us summon 
the courage of ``ordinary people,'' like Rosa Parks and Erin Brokovich, who 
showed us just how powerful individuals can be.	 
It is through nonviolent direct action that we demand -- and are beginning 
to effect -- change. For though they are the beholden to no one, the 
corollary and hope rests in the fact that governments and corporations are 
beholden to everyone. And therein lies the rub.	 
</P>
<P>  Activists who resort to violent tactics do so in part as a reaction to 
the passivity of a silent majority who can't find a reason to vote, much 
less save the spotted owl. By the same token, is it any wonder that people 
in power think that either we don't care or are happy with the way things 
are because so many don't vote?	 
In a society spoiled by instant gratification, we are unaccustomed to 
efforts that take time and discipline. So, be patient. Go out and vote your 
conscience. Vote as if your life depended on it. Because, my friend, it 
does.
