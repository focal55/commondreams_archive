<p>As an organic farmer and seed producer, I feel compelled to correct some of the misinformation espoused by Beverly Johnson in her Jan. 29 Counterpoint on genetically engineered foods. She wonders about the concern over the insertion of Bt (<I>Bacillus theringiensis</I>) bacteria into crops like corn and cotton when organic farmers have used Bt for over a decade.</P>
<P>I worked the last four years for one of the largest organic broccoli growers in the state. We tried to spray our crop with Bt once a week during July and August, the season when cabbage looper caterpillars are the most prevalent. Bt used in this manner is a thick brown liquid you dilute with water and apply directly to the broccoli plants and only those plants. It can only kill caterpillars directly, that is, they must eat part of the plant that has a Bt coating on it. It "wears off" in a week to 10 days and needs to be reapplied. It is considered safe for human consumption right after spraying, because that bacteria doesn't affect humans. Used this way, it doesn't affect beneficial insects or butterfly larvae because they have no food supply in a broccoli field and aren't found there during the spraying. </P>
<P>Compare this to the bioengi neered Bt-containing crops, which contain the bacteria in every cell of every part of every plant in the field, all season long. That's every root, leaf, tassel, corn silk and, most importantly for the butterflies, every grain of pollen. Corn pollen is relatively heavy as these things go, but on a windy summer day, it can travel hundreds of yards. It's indiscriminately blown onto nearby weeds, flowers and trees, many of which are feeding sites for beneficial insects and butterfly larvae.</P>
<P>The fact that the bacteria are contained in every part of every plant in large fields means that pesticide-resistant insects will become the only ones left to reproduce that much sooner. European corn borers become resistant to new pesticides in about nine generations. At two generations a summer, that's less than five years until the technology becomes useless, not only to genetically modified organism (GMO) corn producers, but also to organic growers who have been applying it carefully for years.</P>
<P>Don't comfort yourself by thinking that genetically modified food crops are merely one step further along the path of mutations and hybridizations that occur naturally. "Nature" cannot put flounder DNA into tomatoes and strawberries, bacteria into corn and cotton, or antibiotics into wheat. It certainly cannot make soybeans "Round-Up Ready." </P>
<P>The battle over GMO food crops is not between the farmer and the consumer; we're both being used as guinea pigs by the profit-driven agribusiness corporations that are pushing their patented transgenic seeds onto growers without adequate long-term environmental testing.</P>
<P>Although Johnson has opinions about "what seems to be" and "from what I've heard," I wonder if she talked to any farmers about the GMO crops they grew last season. My relatives in Iowa paid more money for seed that yielded about the same and, because of international restrictions on GMO food imports, ended up with a crop they weren't sure they could sell.</P>
