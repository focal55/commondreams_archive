<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Whatever happens in the next days and weeks, one would have to be a granite-hearted Stalinist not to be uplifted watching the people of Belgrade dance in the streets. Even people for whom those same Yugoslav civilians represented legitimate targets a few short months ago will have enjoyed the pictures.
<P>Those who cheered as Nato offloaded its various hardware - some of which continues to explode, killing and maiming hundreds of people in Kosovo since the end of hostilities - will doubtless claim credit for the fall of Milosevic. I haven't yet heard comment from Mark Laity. Incidentally, it is high time he paid back all the public money he received as BBC defence correspondent. I'm sorry, but when a person who is accused of being a Nato spokesman is then hired to be the Nato spokesman, the accusation sticks like a prime minister to his shirt. For years, we paid for the shirts on Laity's back, including his pyjama tops, which, I am reliably informed, bear a pattern of Tornado jets. Whether he tucks the shirt into the bottoms, I don't know. Let's just say it seems certain.
<P>In any event, it will be said that defeat by Nato effected Milosevic's fall. It will probably even be claimed that freeing the Serbs from Milosevic was always the aim of the war, and Nato knew it would happen; which is like saying Hitler annexed Austria because he knew The Third Man would be a great film and was determined that it should be made. Both sides in the debate about the war against Yugoslavia made predictions, and predictions on both sides were inaccurate. For example, the war precipitated the thing it was ostensibly intended to prevent.
<P>On the anti-war side, we also made inaccurate predictions. That doesn't mean we were wrong to oppose the war, but   it means we didn't always put our case very well. That was partly because we were an uneasy alliance. I marched alongside people who were unabashed Milosevic fans and others who supported the KLA, arguing that, although they didn't support Nato, "we should arm the Kosovans". Since we had no guns, I didn't really understand the rationale, but it seemed to mean that we should campaign for Nato to become a non-profit-making arms dealer.
<P>But most of us, I think, saw nationalism as the curse of the Balkans. And we were all united in a belief that world politics should not be shaped   to the designs of the United States. We were right, although not all of our predictions were. We had no way of knowing how the war would go. Some people said that Yugoslavia would never submit to bombing. This struck me as an unwise prediction. Despite the breath-taking Nato lies about its successes against the Yugoslav army, the Yugoslav people were a much softer target, and there's only so much any country can take.
<P> It was also argued that the war would confirm Milosevic in power. In the short term that was clearly true. Voices of dissent, which had bravely challenged the regime for years with no recognition in the west, were immediately silenced. Had the destruction of Yugoslavia carried on for many months, it is hard to know what shape the opposition movement would have been in. I was surprised by the quickness of   his capitulation, but Milosevic must have realised that Nato had no interest in unseating him and so cut a deal.
<P>None the less he had brought humiliation, death and disaster to his people. Moreover, market capitalism has brought increasing deprivation and dislocation to eastern Europe and few rulers can now look to industrial workers for support. There is only so long that rulers can use the racism and nationalism that breeds under capitalism to distract people from the fact that they are not paid enough to live on.
<P>This is not to say that the new regime in Yugoslavia will reject capitalism. It will extend it. One of the great crimes of the old command economies is that they associated planning with tyranny. Small wonder that capitalism's propagandists get away with linking the market to freedom. I'm sure some of those dancing in the streets of Belgrade are part of the grow ing worldwide anti-capitalist movement. But one can't expect them to have a huge domestic audience just yet.
<P>Some might say it's easy to be anti-capitalist when you can afford to be, which is another way of saying that ideas are a product of material circumstances. In fact, it's much easier to be anti- capitalist if you work in a Far East sweat-shop making clothes for American youth. It is to the very great credit of American youth that so many of them are protesting about the conditions in which their clothes are produced. You might say their protests are a luxury. I say fair play to them; they could just go to the mall.
<P>The Yugoslav revolution reminds us that people have in themselves the power to change the world. Robin Cook, Madeleine Albright, Nato and Nike may be rubbing their hands now, but they shouldn't feel too comfortable.
