As I write this, more than 1,000 political prisoners are on a hunger strike 
in Turkish prisons.

<p>By the time you read this, some of them may be dead after more than two 
months of starving themselves.

<p>Americans reading this should care -- indeed, must care -- about this 
tragedy because it is only with U.S. support that such human-rights abuses 
by the Turkish government can continue.

<p>Prisoners starving themselves may sound irrational, but it makes sense when 
a hunger strike is the only thing that might keep prison officials from 
moving you into isolation cells, where worse fates likely await. In 
situations this desperate, the only thing the prisoners have left to put on 
the line is, quite literally, their own bodies.

<p>The prisoners, many of who are in jail simply for belonging to groups that 
oppose Turkey’s military-dominated government, currently live in large 
dormitories that hold 20 to 80 prisoners. Those numbers are the only 
protection prisoners have from the brutality of the guards; as documented 
by human rights groups, torture is “widespread and systematic” in Turkish 
prisons.

<p>Turkish officials, who cynically call the new cells “humane and luxurious,” 
say they won’t back down. Human-rights groups and prisoners agree that when 
prisoners are moved to such isolation cells, beatings and torture -- 
physical and psychological -- will increase.

<p>Why do U.S. citizens have a role in pressuring Turkish officials to abandon 
their plans and allow the political prisoners to remain where they are? 
There are 8.3 billion reasons.

<p>As a key link in U.S. strategy to dominate the Middle East, Turkey has long 
been a client of the United States. According to independent researchers 
using government figures, since 1993 President Clinton has approved $8.3 
billion worth of weapon sales and giveaways to Turkey. After Israel and 
Egypt (by far the leading recipients of U.S. aid), Turkey has raked in the 
most U.S. foreign aid, displaced in that spot only recently by Colombia.

<p>Without that money and those weapons, Turkey would not have been able to 
prosecute a 13-year counterinsurgency war against its Kurdish population in 
the southeast that killed more than 35,000 people, while at the same time 
maintaining a police state in the rest of the country. Without constant 
U.S. diplomatic and political support, Turkey would have come under severe 
international censure for its many human-rights abuses.

<p>The United States enables those atrocities, and it could use its influence 
to stop them but simply has chosen not to. The State Department's 1999 
human-rights report acknowledged serious problems with extra-judicial 
killings, "including deaths due to excessive force and deaths in detention 
due to torture. … Torture, beatings, and other abuses by security forces 
remained widespread." Such routine crimes at most lead to statements by 
U.S. officials about the need to respect human rights, but the aid and 
weapons continue to flow.

<p>That’s the paradox: The aid that has helped Turkey repress its own people 
now could provide the leverage for U.S. citizens to help the Turkish 
prisoners in their fight to stay alive. If we put the heat not just on 
Turkish officials, but also on U.S. representatives, the standoff could be 
resolved without the political prisoners having to make good on their 
threat to starve themselves.

<p>A similar hunger strike in 1996 ended with a promise by the Turkish 
government not to move the prisoners, but only after 12 had died. Those 
deaths need not be repeated this year. More information, including details 
on how to help, are available at:
