<p><i>Editor's Introduction: On the night of 24-25 March 1999 NATO unleashed an air attack on
    Yugoslavia that lasted for 78 days. How should the operation be viewed
    one year on? The suffering of the Kosovar Albanians has ended and the
    refugees have returned to their homes - more often than not destroyed
     - but Kosovo's Serbs and Gypsies have in turn been forced to leave.
     Mitrovica, the last great multiethnic city, is the scene of fearsome
    clashes. And Slobodan Milosevic is still in power in Belgrade. Such a
     failure means the real nature of this war needs to be examined. The
    "genocide" of the Kosovar Albanians had to be stopped. But was it not
    a question of the United States using NATO to imposing its grip on the
      Balkans? Which would explain why the allies stubbornly refused any
                             diplomatic solution.
</i>
<p>

    Noam Chomsky:<br>
<br>
Kosovo was an extremely ugly place last year. About 2000 people were
    killed according to NATO, mostly Albanians, in the course of a bitter
    struggle that began in February with Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
    actions that the United States denounced as "terrorism" and a brutal
    Serb response. By summer the KLA had taken over about 40% of the
    province, eliciting a vicious reaction by Serb security forces and
    paramilitaries, targeting the civilian population. According to
    Albanian Kosovar legal adviser Marc Weller, "within a few days [after
    the withdrawal of the monitors on 20 March 1999] the number of
    displaced had again risen to over 200,000," figures that conform
    roughly to US intelligence reports (1).

    
<p>Suppose the monitors had not been withdrawn in preparation for the
    bombing and diplomatic efforts had been pursued. Were such options
    feasible? Would they have led to an even worse outcome, or perhaps a
    better one? Since NATO refused to entertain this possibility, we
    cannot know. But we can at least consider the known facts, and ask
    what they suggest.

    
<p>Could the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) monitors of the
    Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have been
    left in place, preferably strengthened? That seems possible,
    particularly in the light of the immediate condemnation of the
    withdrawal by the Serb National Assembly. No argument has been
    advanced to suggest that the reported increase in atrocities after
    their withdrawal would have taken place even had they remained, let
    alone the vast escalation that was the predicted consequence of the
    bombing signalled by the withdrawal. NATO also made little effort to
    pursue other peaceful means; even an oil embargo, the core of any
    serious sanctions regime, was not considered until after the bombing.

    
<p>The most important question, however, has to do with the diplomatic
    options. Two proposals were on the table on the eve of the bombing.
    One was the Rambouillet accord, presented to Serbia as an ultimatum.
    The second was Serbia's position, formulated in its 15 March 1999
    "Revised Draft Agreement" and the Serb National Assembly Resolution of
    23 March 1999 (2). A serious concern for protecting Kosovars might
    well have brought into consideration other options as well, including,
    perhaps, something like the 1992-93 proposal of the Serbian president
    of Yugoslavia, Dobrica Cosic, that Kosovo be partitioned, separating
    itself from Serbia apart from "a number of Serbian enclaves" (3). At
    the time the proposal was rejected by Ibrahim Rugova's Republic of
    Kosovo, which had declared independence and set up a parallel
    government; but it might have served as a basis for negotiation in the
    different circumstances of early 1999. Let us, however, keep to the
    two official positions of late March: the Rambouillet ultimatum and
    the Serb Resolution.

<p>Kept from the public eye

    
<p>It is important and revealing that, with marginal exceptions, the
    essential contents of both positions were kept from the public eye,
    apart from dissident media that reach few people.

    
<p>The Serb National Assembly Resolution, though reported at once on the
    wire services, has remained a virtual secret. There has been little
    indication even of its existence, let alone its contents. The
    Resolution condemned the withdrawal of the OSCE monitors and called on
    the United Nations and OSCE to facilitate a diplomatic settlement
    through negotations "toward the reaching of a political agreement on a
    wide-ranging autonomy for [Kosovo], with the securing of a full
    equality of all citizens and ethnic communities and with respect for
    the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia
    and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]." It raised the
    possibility of an "international presence" of a "size and character"
    to be determined to carry out the "political accord on the self-rule
    agreed and accepted by the representatives of all national communities
    living in [Kosovo]." FRY agreement "to discuss the scope and character
    of international presence in [Kosovo] to implement the agreement to be
    accepted in Rambouillet" had been formally conveyed to the negotiators
    on 23 February, and announced by the FRY at a press conference the
    same day (4). Whether these proposals had any substance we cannot
    know, since they were never considered, and remain unknown.

    
<p>Perhaps even more striking is that the Rambouillet ultimatum, though
    universally described as the peace proposal, was also kept from the
    public, particularly the provisions that were apparently introduced in
    the final moments of the Paris peace talks in March after Serbia had
    expressed agreement with the main political proposals, and that
    virtually guaranteed rejection. Of particular importance are the terms
    of the implementation Appendices that accorded to NATO the right of
    "free and unrestricted passage and unimpeded access throughout the FRY
    including associated airspace and territorial waters", without limits
    or obligations or concern for the laws of the country or the
    jurisdiction of its authorities, who are, however, required to follow
    NATO orders "on a priority basis and with all appropriate means"
    (Appendix B).

    
<p>The Annex was kept from journalists covering the Rambouillet and Paris
    talks, says Robert Fisk: "The Serbs say they denounced it at their
    last Paris press conference - an ill-attended gathering at the
    Yugoslav Embassy at 11pm on 18 March". Serb dissidents who took part
    in the negotiations allege that they were given these conditions on
    the last day of the Paris talks and that the Russians did not know
    about them. These provisions were not made available to the British
    House of Commons until 1 April, the first day of the Parliamentary
    recess, a week after the bombing started (5).

    
<p>In the negotiations that began after the bombing, NATO abandoned these
    demands entirely, along with others to which Serbia had been opposed,
    and there is no mention of them in the final peace agreement.
    Reasonably, Fisk asks: "What was the real purpose of NATO's last
    minute demand? Was it a Trojan horse? To save the peace? Or to
    sabotage it?" Whatever the answer, if the NATO negotiators had been
    concerned with the fate of the Kosovar Albanians, they would have
    sought to determine whether diplomacy could succeed if NATO's most
    provocative, and evidently irrelevant, demands had been withdrawn; the
    monitoring enhanced, not terminated; and significant sanctions
    threatened.

<p>Take it or leave it

    
<p>When such questions have been raised, leaders of the US and British
    negotiating teams have claimed that they were willing to drop the
    exorbitant demands that they later withdrew, but that the Serbs
    refused. The claim is hardly credible. There would have been every
    reason for them to have made such facts public at once. It is
    interesting that they are not called to account for this startling
    performance.

    
<p>Prominent advocates of the bombing have made similar claims. An
    important example is the commentary on Rambouillet by Marc Weller (6).
    Weller ridicules the "extravagant claims" about the implementation
    Appendices, which he claims were "published along with the agreement,"
    meaning the Draft Agreement dated 23 February. Where they were
    published he does not say, nor does he explain why reporters covering
    the Rambouillet and Paris talks were unaware of them. As was, it
    appears, the British parliament. The "famous Appendix B," he states,
    established "the standard terms of a status of forces agreement for
    KFOR [the planned NATO occupying forces]". He does not explain why the
    demand was dropped by NATO after the bombing began, and is evidently
    not required by the forces that entered Kosovo under NATO command in
    June, which are far larger than what was contemplated at Rambouillet
    and therefore should be even more dependent on the status of forces'
    agreement. Also unexplained is the 15 March FRY response to the 23
    February Draft Agreement.

    
<p>This response goes through the Draft Agreement in close detail,
    section by section, proposing extensive changes and deletions
    throughout, but includes no mention at all of the appendices - the
    implementation agreements which, as Weller points out, were by far the
    most important part and were the subject of the Paris negotiations
    then underway. One can only view his account with some scepticism,
    even apart from his casual attitude toward crucial fact, already
    noted, and his clear commitments. For the moment, these important
    matters remain buried in obscurity.

    
<p>Despite official efforts to prevent public awareness of what was
    happening, the documents were available to any news media that chose
    to pursue the matter. In the US the extreme (and plainly irrelevant)
    demand for virtual NATO occupation of the FRY received its first
    mention at a NATO briefing of 26 April, when a question was raised
    about it but was quickly dismissed and not pursued. The facts were
    reported as soon as the demands had been formally withdrawn and had
    become irrelevant to democratic choice. Immediately after the
    announcement of the peace accords of 3 June the press quoted the
    crucial passages of the "take it or leave it" Rambouillet ultimatum,
    noting that they required that "a purely NATO force was to be given
    full permission to go anywhere it wanted in Yugoslavia, immune from
    any legal process," and that "NATO-led troops would have had virtually
    free access across Yugoslavia, not just Kosovo" (7).

    
<p>Through the 78 days of bombing negotiations continued, each side
    making compromises - described in the US as Serb deceit, or
    capitulation under the bombs. The peace agreement of 3 June was a
    compromise between the two positions on the table in late March. NATO
    abandoned its most extreme demands, including those that had
    apparently undermined the negotiations at the last minute and the
    wording that had been interpreted as calling for a referendum on
    independence. Serbia agreed to an "international security presence
    with substantial NATO participation" - the sole mention of NATO in the
    peace agreement or Security Council Resolution 1244 affirming it.

<p>Scraps of paper

    
<p>NATO had no intention of living up to the scraps of paper it had
    signed, and moved at once to violate them, implementing a military
    occupation of Kosovo under NATO command. When Serbia and Russia
    insisted on the terms of the formal agreements, they were castigated
    for their deceit, and bombing was renewed to bring them to heel. On 7
    June NATO planes again bombed the oil refineries in Novi Sad and
    Pancevo, both centres of opposition to Milosevic. The Pancevo refinery
    burst into flames, releasing a huge cloud of toxic fumes, shown in a
    photo accompanying a New York Times story of 14 July that discussed
    the severe economic and health effects. The bombing itself was not
    reported, though it was covered by wire services (8).

    
<p>It has been argued that Milosevic would have tried to evade the terms
    of an agreement, had one been reached in March. The record strongly
    supports that conclusion, just as it supports the same conclusion
    about NATO - not only in this case, incidentally; forceful dismantling
    of formal agreements is the norm on the part of the great powers (9).
    As now belatedly recognised, the record also suggests that "it might
    have been possible [in March] to initiate a genuine set of
    negotiations - not the disastrous American diktat presented to
    Milosevic at the Rambouillet conference - and to insert a large
    contingent of outside monitors capable of protecting Albanian and Serb
    civilians alike" (10).

    
<p>At least this much seems clear. NATO chose to reject diplomatic
    options that were not exhausted and to launch a military campaign that
    had terrible consequences for Kosovar Albanians, as anticipated.
