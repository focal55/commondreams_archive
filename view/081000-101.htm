ONLY IN Philadelphia can someone who is accused of blocking traffic and
disrupting rush hour be held in jail on bail higher than that usually set for
violent crimes. But that's what is happening to a number of people who took to
the streets during the Republican convention to express their dissatisfaction
with the status quo.
<P>
    On Aug. 1, several hundred people were arrested during protest activities
that got out of hand. A few were arrested for causing property damage, turning
over dumpsters or injuring police officers. A smaller number were arrested for
being "anarchist ringleaders." Seventy people were arrested because they
happened to be at a warehouse where chicken wire and arts and crafts materials
for a puppet display were confiscated by police as "dangerous implements." Many
others were arrested because they had sat in traffic intersections and joined
arms and legs.
<P>
    The district attorney of Philadelphia initially sought high bail for quite
a few defendants. Bail for John Sellers, who was charged with eight
misdemeanors, was initially set at $1 million at the request of the prosecutor.
<P>
By the Monday after the conclusion of the Republican convention, the district
attorney had conceded that this eye-popping figure was excessive and asked that
bail be lowered to $200,000.
<P>
    The judge, who had a better grasp of what -and who -was really before her,
lowered the bail to $100,000. Even that amount appears to be disproportionate
to the allegations against Sellers, who has family in the Philadelphia area.
<P>
    At first, it seemed that bail had been set so high to keep some of these
defendants in prison until the Republicans left town. Then it looked as though
the intent was to keep folks locked up through the Democratic convention next
week. Now we have every reason to believe that the prosecutors intend to try to
hold some of the defendants through the time of trial to make sure that they
are punished no matter what the ultimate outcome of those cases. All of these
tactics violate basic rights and are a misuse of the bail process.
<P>
    The purpose of bail is to ensure that a defendant who is released from
prison shows up for trial. In setting bail, the factors that can lawfully be
considered are the nature of the crime, the background of the defendant and the
defendant's ties to the community.
<P>
    Bail is not to be used as punishment or to hold persons in confinement
until their trial date. Certainly, bail is not intended as a means for
preventing people from expressing their dissenting views.
<P>
    Much has been made of the fact that many of the people arrested have
refused to identify themselves to authorities. But the reality is that many
others have either willingly identified themselves to authorities or have been
easily identified by the police.
<P>
    Other defendants, whose identities are known, are being held on bail that
runs into the six or seven figures. In some cases, these defendants are charged
with misdemeanors even though they have no known record of failing to appear in
court.
<P>
    The American Civil Liberties Union does not condone the unlawful acts that
occurred in Philadelphia last week. But we don't believe that those acts
warrant this kind of overreaction by requiring excessive bail.
<P>
    Sure, vandalizing property, turning over trash cans, assaulting persons and
shutting down the city by blocking traffic are not activities protected under
the First Amendment. But they are not the kind of crimes that justify treating
these defendants as if they were a dangerous urban mob.
<P>
    Requiring excessively high bail to keep speakers from expressing their
views turns a tool of law enforcement into a means of repression. You can't
call it free speech when the price tag is $1 million.
