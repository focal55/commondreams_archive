You know who didn't win the election. Do you want to know who won? The
winners were the folks in the streets all year who called for "no more
business as usual." As the politicians duel over counts and court orders,
and go tit-for-tat on TV, no one could say this was "usual."
<p>Consider the scene behind the tired-looking TV reporters in Florida. On
November 8, African-Americans, Haitians, Central Americans, Jews, labor
unionists, students and seniors rallied for voter justice with
hand-lettered, not Democratic Party-printed, signs. In predominantly black
and Jewish West Palm Beach, the idea that "butterfly" ballots might have
thrown their votes to Pat Buchanan brought people out, if not in hives,
then certainly in droves.
<p>At the New Birth Baptist Church in Miami on November 9, an overflow crowd
packed the pews and then spilled into a nearby school hall, connected to
the congregation via large video screens. In a letter to friends, Catholic
activist Mari Castellanos described the scene: "It felt like Birmingham.
People sang and prayed and listened. Story after story was told of people
being turned away at the polls, of ballots being allegedly destroyed, of
NAACP election literature being allegedly discarded at the main post
office, of Spanish-speaking poll workers being sent to Creole precincts and
vice-versa."
<p>Among the speakers were union leaders, civil rights activists, black
elected officials, ministers and rabbis. Each, Castellanos reports,
recalled  "the price their communities had paid for the right to vote and
vowed not to be disenfranchised ever again."
<p>On November 12, in Miami's Temple Israel synagogue, local rabbis and other
Jewish leaders shared the pulpit with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, NAACP
President Kweisi Mfume and Ralph Neas of People for the American Way. They
announced their shared intent to ask for a federal investigation of
possible violations of the Voting Rights Act. "I hadn't seen anything like
it for as long as I can remember," says Mandy Carter, who's no stranger to
nasty electoral politics-she once ran Harvey Gantt's campaign against Jesse
Helms.
<p>In a joint letter sent to Attorney General Janet Reno on November 14, the
NAACP and Congressional Black Caucus listed what they said were 11 specific
types of discrimination directed at minorities. Their charges included one
case of a voter, who had never been arrested, being denied the right to
vote after being told he had a prior felony conviction. (Roughly half a
million free Florida ex-convicts are currently disenfranchised under the
state's 1868 election law.) In another incident, election officials failed
to notify voters in a predominantly African-American precinct that their
usual polling place-a school-had been demolished. They also failed to
direct voters by signs or other means to the proper site. In addition, the
letter cited reports from the Orlando area that 200 Puerto Rican voters in
Orange County were denied the right to vote because they could only produce
one piece of identification (they were asked for two) or were unable to
understand the ballots (the county failed to produce Spanish language
ballots or interpreters, despite a legal requirement to do so).
<p>People with disabilities also joined the fray. According to Teri Mosier, a
deaf civil rights lawyer, people have long complained that the polling
booths in West Palm Beach are inaccessible. "If you were a person in a
wheelchair, you could not see the ballot," Mosier says. "You had to run
your finger down and count the number of holes. Hole No. 2 was supposed to
be Al Gore, but instead you voted for Buchanan."
<p>People with disabilities make up 20 percent of the voters in West Palm
Beach, Mosier says, and they had particular incentive to go to the polls
this year. "The Americans with Disabilities Act is already up for review in
the Supreme Court, and our lives depend on one vote."
<p>The Bush and Gore teams pontificate about the popular will, but even with
$4 billion spent to doll them up, neither came anywhere close to "popular."
The storm in the Sunshine State is between the one who persuaded just
24.931 percent of the nation's eligible voters to vote for him and the
other who attracted 24.932 percent.
<p>The presidency matters, but a much more important outcome of this tussle
would be a movement to repopularize politics. Al Gore won't drive
corruption out of the election process (though he's the preferred candidate
of these protesters). Nor will an anti-corporate Nader campaign that's
nowhere to be seen when a multiracial justice movement hits the streets.
The good news is that the coalitions on display in Florida end the year as
we began it, with reason to hope for something new. After all, some say the
new millennium actually starts next year.
