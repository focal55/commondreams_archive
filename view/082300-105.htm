DURING THE RECENT Democratic National Convention, much attention was 
focused on the mantle of ``morality'' worn by Sen. Joe Lieberman.
<P>  To be sure, Vice President Al Gore showed spectacular savvy when 
he chose a man who not only shares his centrist position on most 
issues, but who is Jewish in the bargain, as well as a scrappy 
campaigner -- and who had broken ranks with the Democrats to chastise 
Clinton for the Monica Lewinsky affair.	 
</P>
<P>  If Lieberman's admonishment of President Clinton two years ago was 
perhaps calculated to win a bipartisan base, it also seemed to arise 
from genuine moral outrage. He said his own anger and disappointment 
had widened to concern for the damage to Clinton's presidency, and 
for the impact of Clinton's actions on ``our democracy and its moral 
foundations.''	 
</P>
<P>  He likened Clinton's failure as a moral authority for children to 
the role of the entertainment industry in undermining ``the stability 
and integrity of the family,'' observing that children are quick to 
perceive a ``double standard.'' The word moral appears half a dozen 
times in the address.	 
</P>
<P>  Politically, it is hard to argue with either man's choice -- 
Lieberman's choosing to distance himself from Clinton, and Gore's 
subsequent choice of Lieberman. But whether this places Gore and 
Lieberman on the moral high ground is highly questionable. We may 
share Lieberman's condemnation of Clinton's moral lapses, his concern 
for violence and smut in the media and for the breakdown of the 
family in our society. But let us not confuse the media's insatiable 
hunger for scandal with morality. Let us not reduce morality to sex. 
And if we are going to condemn a president's follies, let us judge 
the actions of all 
politicians -- including our own Sen. Lieberman's -- to see whether 
they promote or undermine the stability and integrity of the family 
and the moral foundations of our nation.	 
</P>
<P>Is it ``moral'' that today's wages, adjusted for inflation, are lower 
than in 1960, even as the salaries of CEOs have risen to obscene 
heights during the eight years of the Clinton administration? Is it 
``moral'' that working parents often have little time for their 
children because they have to hold down several jobs to make ends 
meet? Is it ``moral'' that the combined assets of Bill Gates and his 
two lieutenants at Microsoft is $140 billion, while 1 out of 5 
American children grows up in poverty? Is it ``moral'' that criminal 
acts by corporations go unpunished, while poor people are jailed for 
stealing food or for victimless ``crimes,'' such as possession of 
marijuana?	 
</P>
<P>  Not all these inequities can be blamed on Clinton. But what steps 
has Joe Lieberman taken as senator to rectify this painful disparity 
in a nation predicated on opportunity for all? Certainly it does not 
help that he has back-pedaled on affirmative action, helped to 
dismantle the welfare system without providing supportive training 
programs, and joined with the religious right in promoting school 
vouchers to the detriment of public schools in districts that can 
least afford it.	 
</P>
<P>  He has also opposed medical insurance reform, except in 
watered-down industry-
friendly versions, and argued against permitting patients to sue HMOs 
for punitive damages. One of Lieberman's biggest campaign 
contributors is the insurance industry, from which he has collected 
$197,000 during this campaign. It is no wonder that Lieberman has 
been extolled by Republicans for his ``morality.'' His voting record 
is more Republican than Democrat.	 
</P>
<P>  To anyone from Connecticut who was 
listening closely to Al Gore's acceptance speech, it was clear that 
Gore was distinguishing his positions not only from those of the 
Republicans, but from those of his running mate. Lieberman will have 
to accept these positions, just as he will have to accept Hollywood 
money. Expediency will rule over ethics, as in his decision to run 
simultaneously for the Senate -- which could allow Republican Gov. 
John Rowland to appoint a replacement.	 
</P>
<P>  Is it ``moral'' that the U.S. arms industry's share of arms sales 
worldwide jumped from 16 percent to 63 percent in the 10 years 
following 1988? Is it ``moral'' that we currently sell $10 billion in 
weapons to nondemocratic governments every year? It's one thing to 
adjust George Washington's opposition to a peacetime army to the 
demands of the Cold War. It's quite another to extend the Cold War 
indefinitely, in the cold pursuit of profits.	 
</P>
<P>  That is precisely the intended effect of the destabilizing ``Star 
Wars'' missile defense system first promoted by Ronald Reagan, and 
now, in its latest version, supported by both Clinton and Gore -- 
even as billions go unspent on social needs on both sides of a world 
sorely in need of peace.	 
</P>
<P>Don't expect Joe Lieberman's concern for children and the moral 
foundations of our democracy to put any brakes on this tragic, 
avoidable slide into another arms race. Connecticut's own economy 
remains in thrall to the arms industry; Lieberman as senator has been 
as hawkish as he has been pro-business, and has received fat 
donations from the state's armsmakers.	 
</P>
<P>  These are the roots of violence and social breakdown, as surely as 
any sleaze from Clinton or Hollywood. These hypocrisies, along with 
the postponement of campaign finance reform, are the true 
obscenities, the deep challenges to our democracy.
