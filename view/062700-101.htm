In response to headlines about rising gasoline prices, presidential  candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore are competing to promise relief and  criticize foreign oil suppliers. Congressional leaders and Midwest  governors are also on the attack, denouncing environmental regulations,  suspending state gas taxes, and calling for opening the Arctic National  Wildlife Refuge and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
<P>
<P>Their rhetoric may be good politics, but it makes for lousy policy. Higher  gas prices are a short-term headache, but they also offer a window of  opportunity to walk the walk of environmental and economic progress. 
<P>
<P>More  expensive oil will rapidly push our economy to natural gas, fuel cells, solar units, and improved efficiency - the energy sources of the future.
<P>
<P>That, in turn, will help us cut air pollution and energy use, spur  meaningful action on climate change, and reduce our dependence on foreign  oil.
<P>
<P>For a generation, skeptics of alternative fuels have cited low oil prices  as a reason for the slow adoption of alternative energy. Now, as  politicians compete to stoke public outrage, we are seeing the latest  evidence of the real force at work behind low pump prices: political  intervention. Here are some of our government's favorite ways to keep us  hooked on cheap oil throughout the last century:   
<P>
<P><b>Tax policy</b>
<P>
<P>Former President Lyndon Johnson had an iron rule of politics - his allies had  to protect the oil depletion allowance. For 50 years, the depletion  allowance allowed oil companies to deduct more than a quarter of their  gross income before taxes. The companies could also deduct immediately all  expenses for drilling new wells. Together, these tax policies massively  subsidized the rapid development of United States oil reserves - and drove  down the price of oil.
<P>
<P><b>Public land policy </b> 
<P>
<P>Oil developers have long struggled to open ecologically vulnerable public  lands for oil development. From offshore Santa Barbara to northern Alaska,  each new political victory boosts supply, further reducing oil prices. To  make matters worse, the US government (and many other  governments worldwide) gave oil-development rights away at fire-sale prices,  charging meager royalties on rich proven oil fields.
<P>
<P><b>Environmental regulation</b>
<P>
<P><b> </b> Oil and automobile companies and their allies fight each new demand for  improved efficiency or environmental quality. In the case of the Exxon  Valdez oil spill, for example, powerful political opposition to  double-hulled tankers neatly severed social and environmental costs from  the price of gasoline at the pump.
<P>
<P><b>Public infrastructure </b>
<P>
<P>Public policy has not just shaped supply; it also created demand. Since  the early 20th century, local, state, and federal governments spent  hundreds of billions of dollars building a vast infrastructure for oil  consumption. Highways and airports are a taxpayer-financed juggernaut for  centering the economy around oil consumption. With gasoline and airport  taxes earmarked for further development, rising use automatically spurs new  construction, tightening oil's hold.
<P>
<P><b>Foreign policy </b> 
<P>
<P>Though we don't feel the cost at the pump, billions of our tax dollars fuel  diplomatic and military efforts to keep oil flowing from the Persian Gulf.
<P>
<P>We don't exactly spend similar resources to protect access to solar power  or fuel cells.
<P>
<P>If we are serious about a transition to new fuels, a more stable  climate, and less dependence on foreign oil suppliers, higher oil prices  are the most direct solution. Today, fuel cell, solar, wind, and other  energy companies can compete with the not-government-sponsored price of  petroleum. With the right push, mass production and improved technology  will make alternative fuel even cheaper.
<P>
<P>Blocking the way are a century of subsidies to the oil economy that have  artificially lowered prices, distorted the energy market, and kept us  addicted to oil. Politicians should quit demanding greater OPEC  production, threatening inquiries into industrial collusion, and suspending  gasoline taxes. Instead, they should allow US energy markets to find a  new equilibrium.
