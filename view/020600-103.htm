<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The economy is once again growing at a rate equal to that of the glory days that followed World War II and continued for nearly a quarter of a century. Back then, with 4 percent growth rates, the typical family would see its income double, in inflation-adjusted terms, in less than a single generation. Not only did the economy grow smartly, but also the distribution of income became more equal between 1947 and 1973.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today the so-called new economy has brought back a level of growth no one would have dared predict even five years ago. Still, this wondrous turn of events leaves three enormous questions: Why are we growing again? Can it last? And can it be teamed up with greater equity like the last time around?</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current conventional wisdom goes something like this: When the federal government was piling up deficits during the 1970s and 1980s, the economic growth rate slumped because public borrowing forced up interest rates and the private sector found it too expensive to borrow. Consequently, investment was sluggish, productivity suffered, and America's growth rate went south.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conventional wisdom holds further that only when President Clinton and the Congress aggressively attacked the deficit, beginning in the early 1990s, did this vicious cycle reverse. And the more we cut the deficit, the more the economy grew. The public sector's thrift and the resulting private sector's investment produced another period of glory days. As Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers put it recently, ''The new economy is built on old virtues: thrift, investment, and letting market forces operate.''</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This sounds right and the timing seems exquisite. Yet this story is largely wrong.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hard as it may be to believe, deficit reduction has had very little to do with the current economic recovery. Worse yet, the obsession with building up the federal surplus to the point of paying off the entire federal debt in the next 15 years will paradoxically almost surely sabotage growth over the long term and make income inequality even worse.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the revised growth statistics released by the Commerce Department late last year, deficit reduction has had much less to do with the economy's seemingly miraculous renaissance than first appeared. The revised numbers show that the economy actually began to pull out of its 1970s slump soon after the end of the 1981-82 recession during the Reagan era. Productivity growth, the basis for economic growth, increased from 0.8 percent during the Carter years to 1.6 percent during the Reagan presidency to 1.7 percent on Bush's watch, to the 2.1 percent we have enjoyed during Clinton's stewardship.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That means the economy was<i> already</i> beginning to improve when we were so profligately piling up triple-digit deficits year after year - and it continued to grow when we switched policies to sharply rein in the deficit. </font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Put simply, the size of the deficit has had almost nothing to do with the ability of the economy to expand. Surely, if we had continued to spend federal dollars as though there were no tomorrow, the mounting deficits eventually would have undermined growth. But it does not follow that cutting federal spending so sharply and then building up a bigger and bigger surplus is the sine qua non for economic health.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reason we are growing so rapidly today has instead everything to do with the technological revolution that has been underway for nearly three decades. Historical data tell us that whenever there has been a fundamental breakthrough in technology - say, the introduction of the steam engine or the introduction of electricity - the initial impact on productivity growth is minuscule or even negative. This is not surprising, for when a revolutionary new technology is introduced, it takes a long time to figure out how best to use the innovation, to work out its bugs, to train workers to operate it, and to diffuse it to more and more industries and applications.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What was true of steam power and electricity is true for the information revolution as well. It is not surprising that productivity slumped in the 1970s near the beginning of the computer revolution, nor that productivity began to pick up during the 1980s as more and more industries learned how to use computers and software more effectively. And it is not surprising that the full-scale productivity premium is just now being realized. With or without such sharp deficit reduction, the economy would be in pretty good shape today.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given this source of growth, the current White House policy to pay off the federal debt as quickly as possible could turn out to be fatal. Understanding how technological change occurs explains why.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One might think that the information revolution and the new economy were the brainchildren of scientists and engineers toiling away in university laboratories and the research facilities of private business. This is generally correct, but the initiative and financing for this research came from government spending, not Mr. Summers's ''market forces.''</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was the need for massive computing power to run modern defense systems that helped lead to the construction of powerful mainframe computers. It was the need for miniaturized guidance systems for ICBMs and NASA rockets that led to the development of microprocessors and the software they use. It was the federal government's investment in the ARPANET that led to the Internet, the World Wide Web, and the explosion in e-commerce. Moreover, investments in education and training helped prepare a workforce to operate the immensely profitable commercial applications these technologies made possible.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But here's the bad news. To build up massive budget surpluses, the federal government has been cutting its support of basic research, public infrastructure, and even education and training, as a share of gross domestic product. President Clinton's recent announcement of more money for the National Science Foundation and Defense Department research hardly puts a dent in this downward trend in government financing of basic research.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1979, the share of federal investment in public nondefense infrastructure, education, and research has fallen steadily. And such investments are destined to decline further under the Clinton budget and congressionally imposed spending caps. This spending is part of what the government calls ''total discretionary federal funding'' - that is, the budget excluding Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the federal debt.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back in 1968, discretionary funding was 13.6 percent of GDP.  Even as late as 1986, it amounted to 10 percent of GDP. Twelve years later, it was down to 6.6 percent and, according to the latest budget estimates, is scheduled to fall to only 5.5 percent by 2004. Hence, by the middle of the this decade, the federal government's role in underwriting economic activity will have been cut in half.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The steepest declines in the budget are for precisely what has been so important to growth in the past. According to the National Science Foundation, the federal share of support for the nation's research and development first fell below 50 percent in 1979, and it remained between 45 and 50 percent until 1988. After then, it fell steadily, dropping from 44.9 percent in 1988 to only 26.7 percent projected for 1999. This is the lowest it has been in almost half a century. </font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may not see the impact of this neglect of public investment for years to come, but if history has anything to say on the subject, we will pay for our fiscal conservatism dearly. What technological innovations might be missed or postponed, we will never know. But it is clear from an increasing amount of economic research that the single most important factor behind long cycles of prosperity is the level of technological advance - not whether we balance the federal budget.</font>
<P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, if growth does slow down, inequality will grow even worse. Back in the immediate postwar period, the gap between the rich and the poor was kept in check by strong unions, higher real minimum wages, and weak global competition. Today, the only factor keeping the gap between the rich and everyone else from exploding is a red-hot economy.  Hence, if we fail to sustain growth as a consequence of our dangerous obsession with federal ''thrift'' and pure ''market forces,'' we will surely sabotage equity along with prosperity.</font>
