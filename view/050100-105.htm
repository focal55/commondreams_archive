These are tough times for presidents of Oregon public universities, as their development programs hustle for private gifts to replace the massive loss of state tax revenues. No one knows that better than Dave Frohnmayer of the University of Oregon. 
<P>
	On behalf of his school and others of the Higher Education System, Frohnmayer swallowed his pride in March when he asked a special favor of the System Board: the privilege of offering anonymity to donors who request it. This got a quick reaction from the local daily, The Register-Guard, which editorialized that such anonymity could ransom higher education to some donors who might try to influence university policy. 
<P>
	Another reality not lost on the mass media was that such a request goes counter to the state's open-information rules. But board members said it sounded reasonable and indicated it probably would be approved. 
<P>
	Then the bombshell hit. When Frohnmayer, under pressure from students camped outside his office, signed the UO into the Worker Rights Consortium, the university's chief donor, Nike boss Phil Knight, went ballistic. 
<P>
	Knight threatened to withdraw the pledge of $30 million he had promised the UO Department of Athletics to help expand Autzen Stadium. And as his anger simmered, Knight raised the stakes Monday, announcing his alma mater should expect no more gifts from him. That was a staggering blow from a philanthropist who in recent years gave many millions for creation of the Knight Institute at the University of Oregon Law School and made possible expansion of the library. 
<P>
	 
<P>
	Knight and Frohnmayer had a more benign, yet telling, encounter a year earlier. As part of his gift for the Law Institute, Knight had asked that $40,000 go to bolster the annual salary of the university president. This resulted in criticism from some professors about the gift's conflict-of-interest implications. Frohnmayer chose to place the money, instead, in a student scholarship fund. 
<P>
	But Knight was not to be denied, as he cloaked the gift from public scrutiny by changing its form. Among the Knight gift's Law Chairs --money that customarily goes to teaching faculty -- was one that went to the president. I was among those who learned of the arrangement when Frohnmayer was introduced at the Institute dedication ceremony as holder of a Knight Chair of Law. Few begrudged the gift to a president whose annual pay ranks low in the Pac-10 Conference. But skeptical professors called it an end run, creating the impression of impropriety. 
<P>
	Even the near-fatal heart problem that hit Frohnmayer last year in Maryland wound up raising uncertainty about relationships with university donors. His flight back to Eugene was in the private Falcon jet of Oregon lumberman Aaron Jones. Normally, that would be viewed as what it seemingly was -- an act of generosity. However, state law prohibits state employees from receiving gifts greater than $100 from persons with legislative or lobbying involvement in state affairs. NBC News reported at the time that minimum value of a cross-country flight in a private jet was $25,000, one way. 
<P>
	The state subsequently ruled Jones fit neither identity, so reimbursement to him was unnecessary. What it chose to overlook was the fact that in the early 1990s, Jones and others in the lumber industry -- big donors to the university -- used high-pressure lobbying to get the UO Environmental Law Clinic removed from campus. 
<P>
	As the Knight disaster continues to crackle, maybe manipulators in UO Development still can salvage the money. They can borrow a cue from Oregon State, which changed the name of Parker Stadium to Reser for big money. Just change the name of Autzen Stadium to Knight. On the Eugene campus, it has a familiar ring. 
<P>
