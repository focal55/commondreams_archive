THE Wen Ho Lee affair gets "curiouser and curiouser." More and more, the
criminal case against the Los Alamos physicist who's accused of posing a huge
threat to national security emanates the smell of rotting fish.
<P>
    The government's case is falling apart. When Lee was arrested and
imprisoned without bail last December, he was accused of stealing highly
important government secrets about nuclear weapons and using them to hurt the
U.S. government. At the time, the Lee case sounded like the biggest spy case
since Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
<P>
    Then the government started changing its tune. In fact, federal prosecutors
said, Lee had simply illegally downloaded classified information from a secure
government computer onto his computer and left it where it could be stolen by
others.
<P>
    Now it appears that the top-secret information Lee supposedly stole wasn't
even that secret. Scientists have come forward to say that the information
could have been found by any halfway decent researcher in books or on the
Internet. Now the government says Lee's motive for taking the data was to
impress prospective employers during a job search.
<P>
    In essence, the 59 criminal charges against Lee have boiled down to
engaging in serial downloading and lying on his resume. Yet Lee, 60, remains in
a New Mexico prison, in solitary confinement, until recently in shackles, and
with severe restrictions on who can visit him.
<P>
    Last week, federal judge James A. Parker ordered Lee released to home
detention on $1 million bail.  Parker said he was doing this because he was no
longer convinced that the information Lee downloaded was as important as the
government claimed it was and because a government witness had admitted to
lying about Lee's allegedly suspicious behavior.
<P>
    Federal prosecutors have, however, blocked Lee's release by filing an
appeal, even though the case is beginning to look like a travesty.
<P>
    Yesterday members of the Asian-American community, including lawyers,
scientists, business people, community leaders, academics and one of Lee's own
attorneys painted a picture of an innocent man who's being framed basically for
political expediency and because of his Chinese heritage.
<P>
    "This case has huge political overtones," Brian Sun, one of Lee's many
lawyers, said at a New York City meeting in Chinatown yesterday to raise money
for Lee's legal defense fund. "It is Washington driven."
    But why would the government single out Lee and charge him with crimes for
which, if he's convicted, he could get life in prison? There are hundreds,
maybe even thousands, of Asian-American scientists in highly sensitive jobs.
<P>
    Margaret Fung, executive director of the Asian American Legal Defense and
Education Fund, attributes the government's treatment of Lee to a confluence of
factors starting in the late '90s. There was the campaign finance scandal of
1997-98, when Republicans attacked Democrats for accepting thousands of dollars
in illegal campaign contributions from Chinese Americans and charged that some
of the money came from China.
<P>
    Later came a series of articles in The New York Times about how China had
made great leaps in developing nuclear weapons by stealing secrets from Los
Alamos. In May, 1999, a congressional committee released a report confirming
that the Chinese had stolen secrets about the most advanced thermo-nuclear
weapons from Los Alamos. More recently, as President Bill Clinton tried to
negotiate new trade agreements with the Chinese government, he had to defend
himself against charges that he was trying to appease the Chinese.
<P>
    In the midst of all this, Fung said, federal investigators "began to target
their investigation on Lee."
    As attorney Sun describes it, people "began feeding off that anti-Chinese
phobia. They needed to find somebody to put the blame on."
    Meanwhile, there was Lee, who was born in Taiwan of Chinese heritage but
was a naturalized U.S. citizen, out at Los Alamos with his computer files. A
likely suspect? Robert Vroomen, the former director of counter-intelligence at
Los Alamos, has admitted publicly that investigators singled out Lee partly
because of his ethnic background.
<P>
    This is a scary scenario if, in fact, this is how it went down. But one
need only look back to Sen. Joseph McCarthy and his anti-communist reign of
terror to remember how public hysteria, racial prejudice and politicians' egos
can wreak havoc on the rights of ordinary people.
<P>
    An appeals court is considering Lee's bail application, and his case will
continue to develop. It could reveal some terrible things about how the
government works.
