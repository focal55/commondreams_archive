As they settle into their quarters in Sydney's Olympic Village this week, the 16,000 athletes from 199 nations may choose to satisfy their dietary needs by dining at one of the Olynpic Games' main sponsors (or, in the preferred jargon of the modern sports-industrial complex, "partners").
<P>
Two McDonald's restaurants will present the world's leading runners, jumpers, swimmers, riders, throwers and lifters with a menu based, according to the company, on experience gained at the recent summer and winter games in Atlanta and Nagano. It will "reflect athletes' favorites, including Big Macs, Chicken McNuggets, and Egg McMuffin sandwiches, along with McDonald's World Famous Fries."
<P>
You can't help chuckling at the preposterousness of the claim. How could anyone be credulous enough to accept the identification of junk food with world-class athletic performance? But although few are likely to believe that a mass-produced hamburger can help you run a sub-10 second 100 meters, the simple association of the product with a world of youth and health and success is enough to create the desired climate of acceptance.
<P>
McDonald's sponsorship executives know their job, as do those who, under the Olympian presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch, have spent the last 20 years building the Olympic Games into a vehicle for multinational commercial interests.
<P>
This time around, the 29th since Baron Pierre de Coubertin reinvented the games of the ancient Greeks, the pre-eminence of certain athletes in the showpiece track events &#151; the likes of Maurice Greene, Marion Jones, Michael Johnson and Hichamel Guerrouj &#151; means that the buildup has lacked a certain tension, with most of the headlines being grabbed by stories of Uzbeki coaches being caught at the airport importing human growth hormone in industrial quantities, or the sudden decision of the Chinese team to leave 40 of their athletes and coaches at home.
<P>
Inevitably, too, the overture has featured several false notes, particularly the initial attempt to ban the waving of the Aboriginal flag among the crowd, hastily amended once someone woke up to the absurdity of trying to suppress national pride in this festival of international competition.
<P>
But thanks to Australia's relatively neutral position in global politics, and to the local faith in sport as a legitimate expression of the human spirit, it seems probable that the atmosphere in Sydney will be closer to the exuberance of Barcelona in 1992 than to the fretful mood of Atlanta four years ago.
<P>
This should make it easier to ignore, at least for the next month, the fact that although the International Olympic Committee has been shamed into action in certain spheres, finally forfeiting some of its committee members' perks and belatedly making token strides in the battle against doping, it has done little or nothing to answer other criticisms. These include commercial priorities symbolized by McDonald's and its estimated $100 million investment in the Olympics.
<P>
Last week's announcement of a White House-financed study into doping in Olympic sports included a scathing dismissal of the committee's efforts to stamp out the use of performance-enhancing drugs. But the authors of the report went deeper, criticizing the relationship between the organizers of the games and its corporate sponsors.
<P>
The obvious target is television, which demands stars and a spectacle and is not particular how it gets them. But the committee's choice of other "partners" is also open to question.
<P>
Only a fortnight ago, a survey conducted in Saudi Arabia by British scientists reported that children who grow up on a diet including junk food from Western-style restaurants appear to be between two and three times more likely to contract asthma than those who stick to a traditional diet based on milk, rice, vegetables, lamb, chicken, dates and local fruits. In Britain children under 5 are now twice as likely to contract asthma as they were 10 years ago, an increase mirrored in other developed countries.
<P>
The International Olympic Committee's dubious record does not exactly encourage blind faith in its benign intentions. If its readiness to sell the soul and the symbols of the games to the highest bidder has long been apparent, the past four years have exposed the fondness of its members for expenses-paid junkets to exotic locations. But if the 29th games come to us bedecked, as usual, in the trappings of controversy, this is less a matter of putting five rings on a hamburger wrapping, or of five-star freebies for the chaps in blazers, than the systematic destruction of a belief in the evidence of one's own eyes.
<P>
De Coubertin's vision enabled the world to share the sight of many historic achievements, some of which transcended the petty allegiances of nationality and entered a sort of global folklore, each identified by a single surname &#151; Jesse Owens's four gold medals in Berlin in 1936, Emil Zatopek's astonishing triple of the 5,000 meter, 10,000 meter and marathon in Helsinki in 1952; Bob Beamon's space-leap (29 feet, 212 inches) in Mexico in 1968; swimmer Mark Spitz's record of seven golds in Munich in 1972; the 14-year-old Nadia Comaneci's seven perfect 10s in the gymnasium in Montreal in 1976.
<P>
It is hard to imagine comparable feats in Sydney attracting unconditional admiration, or even acceptance, from a public currently drowning in a tide of doping stories.
