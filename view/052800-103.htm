WASHINGTON <wbr>- The public is already tuning out a presidential race that hasn't
even started. There doesn't seem much to choose from: Vice President Al
Gore against Texas Gov. George W. Bush, two scions of privilege, St.
Albans versus Andover, Harvard versus Yale. The stiff versus the smirk.
Both incapacitated on the "vision thing." New Democrat versus New
Republican, jockeying for the center.
<p>In reality, more fundamental issues are at play in this election than
any since Ronald Reagan's run in 1980. Despite his compassionate
refrains, Bush marches to a conservative drum. He supports privatization
of Social Security. He embraces vouchers for Medicare, turning that
program from a guaranteed benefit to an HMO contract. He favors school
vouchers that would use public money to pay for private-school tuitions.
His tax plan largely benefits the country-club set, squandering an
opportunity for long-overdue investment in education, health care and the
environment.
<p>Consider his call to privatize Social Security. Bush says the choice
is "status quo against reform" and wants this to be a "defining
difference" between the two men. He masks his reform in generalities,
reaping praise for his courage while ducking all specifics. But the
thrust of his plan is clear: He would carve out private individual
accounts by raking off about one-sixth of Social Security payroll taxes.
By definition, his plan will cut shared security and increase individual
risk. He would reduce the benefits guaranteed for life against inflation
and increase the risks individuals would bear in the market.
<p>Bush claims this reform is needed because otherwise Social Security
will go belly up by the middle of the century. He plays off widespread
fears that the trust fund has been looted, and that the boomers'
retirement will break the bank. Three of every four young Americans think
they'll get lower benefits than their parents, or none at all.
<p>Reports of Social Security's demise are greatly exaggerated. What Bush
admits is the "most single most successful government program in American
history" is not broken. If the economy simply grows in the next 50 years
as fast as it has in the last 50, Social Security will meet its
commitments to the boomers without any reform whatsoever. Even if one
assumes, as official projections do, that the economy will grow about as
fast as it did in the 1930s Depression years, it will take only
manageable changes to fill a shortfall that might arise four decades from
now. The actual entitlement crisis is caused primarily by soaring
health-care costs, not Social Security.
<p>Bush's privatization would exacerbate the problem he purports to
solve: the challenge of paying for the boomers' retirement. Bush
reassures seniors and those near retirement that they would retain their
guaranteed benefits. But he would take away one-sixth of the money needed
to pay for them to create private accounts for the next generation. Bush
says he would use the projected surplus to cover the hole. But with
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan garroting the economy, Bush
committed to a major tax cut for the country-club set and more money
needed to bolster Medicare, he must be counting miracles, not money.
<p>When asked if people would fare as well under his system as the
current one, Bush said candidly, "Maybe, maybe not." Some will and some
won't, that's the nature of risk. Widows and the disabled may find their
guaranteed benefits cut. Working people may see the fees of Wall Street
investment firms eat up large portions of the returns on small accounts.
Bush has already conceded he would raise their retirement age to help pay
for his program.
<p>Social Security is known as the "third rail" of U.S. politics: Touch
it and fry. But Bush believes the stock market has more juice. He seeks
to reassure seniors that their benefits are safe, while attracting
support from younger voters looking for a chance to get rich. He offers a
dot-com market reform of a state program painted as on its last legs. And
he benefits from lavish support of a financial community panting to
handle 200 million private accounts. According to the Center for
Responsive Politics, the financial and banking community has anted up
about $5.7 million to Bush's election campaign.
<p>Now, it is a hoary Democratic Party ploy to cry wolf about Social
Security and Medicare. But, this time, the threat is real, and a lot of
Democrats are part of the problem. Bush has essentially adopted reforms
peddled by the money wing of the Democratic Party--the New and Blue Dog
Dems. They are already giving him bipartisan cover. If he's elected, they
may well deliver Republicans enough votes to overcome a Democratic
filibuster.
<p>Social Security is likely to remain a centerpiece of the campaign
because it fits the message each candidate is trying to peddle. Bush
presents himself as a bipartisan "reformer with results" willing to call
for needed change, while dismissing Gore's attacks as the scare tactics
of a partisan ready to say anything to get elected. For Gore, defending
Social Security and Medicare fulfills his pledge to "fight for you" and
reinforces his charge that Bush represents "risk."
<p>Bush is taking a big risk in putting Social Security, Medicare and
education vouchers up for debate. But to be credible, Gore will have to
go beyond simple defense of what is. True, he's implausible as a reborn
political reformer. Instead, Gore's best bet is to address the real
insecurities of working families struggling to make their way in the new
economy and the growing divide between rich and poor. Contrast guaranteed
affordable health care to the costs of private accounts, the right to a
doctor to Bush's promise of a broker. Campaign on investment in children,
education, college costs against Bush's tax cuts that go primarily to the
rich. Call Democrats back to their historic mission to "make work pay" in
contrast to Bush's desire to "make inheritance pay," by repealing estate
taxes.
<p>Beneath his centrist, compassionate cover, Bush is offering a
remarkably conservative economic agenda. To respond, Gore should shed his
New Democrat platitudes for some populist fire. If he's up to it, he just
might rouse people to realize there are real stakes in this election.
