<p>Dear Elian, 
<p>
    Please forgive me for writing to you in English.  Three 
semesters of Spanish, and I can't remember a thing! 
<p>
    Also, please forgive us Americans for standing back and 
allowing the child abuse you are now experiencing.  Normally, 
in this country, we arrest adults who put children through 
trauma and exploitation.  Normally, we arrest adults like the 
Mayor of Miami who call for violence and incite a riot.  Normally, 
in this country, we arrest terrorists and either jail or deport 
them. 
<p>
    Unfortunately for you, we are doing none of this.  I apologize.  
I can only imagine what you are going through.  You do not 
deserve this treatment. 
<p>
    You are being told that your mother died trying to bring you to 
freedom.  I am so sorry
to have to tell you, that's not true.   The Cuban court granted 
your father custody of you, and your mother decided to kidnap 
you.  She placed your life in horrible jeopardy by putting you in 
a leaky, overcrowded raft that eventually sank, killing everyone 
but you. History is filled with many people who risked their 
lives escaping to another country because, had they stayed, 
they would have been imprisoned or killed. 
<p>
    That's not what happened in the case of your mother.  Her 
life was not in jeopardy.  Her son -- you -- was in no danger.  
The worst that could be said is that, in Cuba, you were in 
jeopardy of receiving free health care whenever you needed it, 
an excellent education in one of the few countries that has 
100% literacy, and a better chance of your baby sister being 
born and making it to her first birthday than if she had been 
born in Washington, DC. 
<p>
    The truth is your mother and her boyfriend snatched you and 
put you on that death boat
because they simply wanted to make more money.   I can 
understand why they wanted a better life. Cuba is a poor 
country.  America, from 90 miles away, looks like a rich 
country.  The majority of people who have sailed to this country 
in the past have come for the same reason.   Often, they have 
come because they did not like living in a country, such as 
Cuba, where you cannot freely elect your president and your 
basic rights are limited.  I can understand that. 
<p>
    But your mother placed you in a situation where you were 
certain to die on the open seas (as the rest did) and that is 
unconscionable.  It was the ultimate form of child abuse, and I 
see now why the Cuban judge did not give your mother 
custody. 
<p>
    Now you are with "relatives" in Miami.  Normally, in this 
country, when we say, "I'm
going to stay with the relatives," we mean brothers, sisters, 
aunts, uncles, cousins,
grandparents. 
<p>
    You are with a "great-uncle" and a "second cousin."  It's not 
that they aren't
blood-related, but, let's face it, in our country they and the third 
cousins-once removed are usually not sitting at the 
Thanksgiving table and are only rarely heard from when they need bail money or part of the inheritance.  But in 
our country, no "relative" replaces the parent.  A brother, cousin 
or "great-uncle" who holds a child against the will of the parent 
is committing a major crime.
<p>
    You must really miss your daddy!  I hear he's coming soon.  
Those "relatives" are trying to prevent him from being with you.  
I know, that doesn't feel like love, does it?   Please don't take it 
personally.  They do love you.  They love having you to toss 
around in front of the TV cameras so they can further their own 
political agenda. 
<p>
    You are only six, so I know you can't understand what all of 
the politics are about. 
That's okay.  Some day, you will.  In time, you'll read how these 
former Cubans, who are abusing you, instead of staying in 
Cuba and fighting for freedom like our ancestors did for this 
country in 1776, they turned tail and ran to Miami.  Once here, 
they began demanding that we Americans fight their fight for 
them. 
<p>
    What did we do?
<p>
    Something stupid!  We fought their fight for them!  We based 
our entire foreign policy in this hemisphere on one thing -- 
eliminating Castro.  We tried to assassinate him.  We sent 
"troops" to invade at the Bay of Pigs.  We prevented medicine 
and food from being shipped to Cuba.  When I was nearly your 
age, we almost blew up the world over Cuba and Castro.  Can 
you believe that?  We had become as insane as those 
ex-Cubans in Miami! 
<p>
    And we've stayed that way for forty years.  We're still 
wacked-out over Cuba.  Last year, we fined an American 
citizen $10,000 because he went down to Cuba to tune 
pianos!  It's illegal in this "free" country to travel there.  Loopy, 
huh?  We've been driven crazy 'cause that we still can't get rid 
of Fidel Castro.  He's out-lived nine of our presidents! 
<p>
    We have allowed these ex-Cubans with the yellow stripe 
down their backs to operate
numerous terrorist missions from South Florida.  These same 
ex-Cubans were the ones
who broke into a place called Watergate (that eventually 
brought down a president), ran drugs for arms operations (that 
brought down a popularly-elected government in Nicaragua), 
and, according to some Americans, were behind the 
assassination of our president, John Kennedy (that puts us on 
a slippery slope we're still sliding down). 
<p>
    Now, these very ex-Cubans who were afraid to stand and 
fight Castro have suddenly
found the courage to fight...us!  That's right, they have made it 
clear that they will fight, with violence, any federal officers or 
troops who are sent in to enforce our laws (those outrageous 
ones which say a son should be with his father). 
<p>
    And you are caught in the middle of all this.  I am so sorry.  I 
wish there was something I could personally do.  I will write to 
our <a href="mailto:web@usdoj.gov">Attorney General</a> and tell her to stop this 
child abuse.  I will encourage others to do the same.  I wish I 
could convince our vice-president (who's running for 
president) to help, but he too has decided to abuse you by 
using you for his own political gain.  The governor of the state 
you're in, Jeb Bush, is the brother of a man running for 
president.  He wants to use/abuse you, too.  I just want you to 
know that 80% of the country doesn't like either of these men. 
<p>
    I guess that's the silver lining in your little cloud.  The 
majority of Americans are sickened by the way you are being 
treated.  Please understand that bad things are often done in 
our name and with our money and there is little we can do, 
as the choices on our ballots are nearly as slim as the 
choices your father has on his.
<p>
    It's not easy being six -- anywhere in the world.  I know this 
all too well.  My country, the one your mother thought you 
should be living in, allows its six-year olds access to guns, 
and a little six-year old girl in my hometown was killed last 
month by another six-year old.   This is the world we adults 
have created for you. This is the world I promise to do my best, 
in my own small way, to change. 
<p>
    I pray you'll be playing catch soon with your wonderful, loving 
daddy on a Cuban baseball diamond.  By the time you're 18, 
long after Castro and the Bushes and all this nonsense is 
gone, maybe you can come back to America on your own free 
will.  
<p>
    The Tigers, I can assure you, will still be in desperate need 
of some good pitching. 
<p>
Yours, <br>
Michael Moore<br>
