<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -  Some doddering print and  TV pundits think covering  the two presidential nominating conventions is a  waste of time. Still, there  are other folks who are  deeply and sincerely interested in the sessions. 
</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     For example, there are  United Airlines, US Airways, Microsoft and American Water Works Co. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Microsoft is donating $1 million  each to the Republican Convention in  Philadelphia (July 31) and the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles  (Aug. 14). </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Microsoft wants the government's  antitrust case to go away before the  company is cleft in twain. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     United Airlines is giving $500,000  to the Democratic meeting. US Airways has donated $500,000 to the Republican convention. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     These two monsters want to merge.  They want to create a dominant regional subsidiary, DC Air, that will  keep all of upstate New York's air  travelers paying through the nose, and  putting up with impromptu flight cancellations. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Remember these two huge, well-targeted gifts when you  hear your congressmen  making grand speeches  against the airline merger. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     American Water  Works is donating  $100,000 to each conclave. The company now  runs Buffalo's municipal  water works, and may  also have a stake in one  or two suburban Erie  County systems. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     According to the  Center for Responsive Politics, the private water works company wants to delay or kill proposed federal rules that  would make drinking water safer. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Back in 1913, you couldn't make  drinking water too clean. That was  when the people of Buffalo proudly  opened their Ward Pumping Station in  the wake of a murderous typhoid fever  epidemic. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     That idealistic notion is about to be  put to the test in the social rooms of  the two conventions, abetted by a six-figure payoff to each party. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     In all, corporate America is ginning  up nearly $42 million to help the two  political parties pay for their conventions and purchase influence, no matter who wins. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     The corporations can't be too careful. They don't want all their work buying up the Congress wrecked at something like a convention. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     The complaint from columnists and  from network talking heads - too often reflected by their brass back home  - is that there are no longer any surprises at the conventions. In a fit of  self-loathing, ABC's Ted Koppel  grandly walked out on the conventions  four years ago. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     All are signals from these pale riders that they have been too long in the  saddle, that they have become unused  to hard work and that they ought to  trot off into the sunset. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     The intensity they crave  - suspense over the name  of the presidential nominee  - offers an easy story, but  a story missing from the national conventions for 40  years. The last GOP convention where there was  any real indecision about  the nominee was in 1952.  The last Democratic convention of the type was in  1960. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     The greatest of all sports columnists, Red Smith, once wrote that the  heart of baseball is &quot;caring.&quot; Without  caring, baseball becomes a slow, repetitive exercise. So it is with political conventions. So it is watching Shakespeare, or listening to Bach's partitas  for solo violin. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     The heart of our democracy is &quot;caring&quot; enough to want a good, long, hard  look at our candidates, their families,  their spoken ideals, their supporters  and their enemies. Reporters and citizens who care about our national aspirations and believe in the Constitution  can't get enough of conventions. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     People who care will be watching  on CNN and C-SPAN to gauge for  themselves how the candidates and the  candidates' statements  hold up under the pressure of sustained exposure. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     In a way, the millions donated by corporations are a kind of expression of caring. But  this year, there will be  even more dramatic expressions of interest -  genteel and not so  couth. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     A coalition of reformers are holding  &quot;Shadow Conventions&quot; in Philadelphia  and Los Angeles. These will deal with  such issues as universal health care, reshaping the war on drugs and campaign finance reform. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     The sessions will be sedate compared to what is planned for the streets  by the folks who brought the World  Trade Organization meeting to a  standstill in Seattle and tried to disrupt  international finance meetings here a  few months ago. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Demonstrations involving between  30,000 and 50,000 dissidents have been  planned for July 29 and 30 in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Direct Action  Group's Web site invites viewers to  come and &quot;disrupt the Republican National Convention.&quot; </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     An allied group, calling itself  &quot;D2KLA&quot; is planning an equally large  &quot;Festival of Resistance&quot; in Los Angeles. Among the events listed on the  calendar are a number of marches and  workshops, including one by the North  American Anarchist Conference. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     All their slingers foreswear violence, destruction of property and the  use of drugs and alcohol. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     So there will be plenty to watch and  ponder during the only two national  political town meetings we are ever going to get - at least for the next four  years.. </font>
