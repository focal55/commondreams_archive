When I was a student, one of my closer friends was Darryl, a self-described black nationalist who was the crossover candidate for president of the student union at our predominantly white East Coast university. 
<P>
   Darryl won the election and also made university history. He was popular. You could find him, between classes, hanging out at the Student Union building with whites, Asian-Americans, Jews, other blacks, whomever. 
<P>
   Darryl was <i>for</i> black people -- that was clear -- but not at the expense of other people and their rights. He became active in both the black and general alumni associations. He rubbed elbows with the administration. 
<P>
   Science news last week made me think of Darryl, with whom I'd lost touch over the years. Darryl's studies were in the sciences, specifically genetics. 
<P>
   I recall asking him, "Why genetics?" as a career field. 
<P>
   Darryl responded with prophetic brilliance. 
<P>
   "One day," he said, pointing his beard with finger strokes, "they are going to be able to make people. And when they do, do you think they will make any more black people?" 
<P>
    The answer was obvious. 
<P>
   The conversation is a vision clear in my mind, as if it hadn't actually happened so long ago. The last memory-jog of our dialogue came with the announcement in the 1990s about Dolly, the genetically engineered sheep in Scotland. The latest jog came last week with the joint announcement by Francis S. Collins, head of the Human Genome Project, and J. Craig Venter, head of Celera Genomics. 
<P>
   Working separately and then together, these scientific efforts cracked the genetic code for human life. Using the DNA of an unidentified white male as primary donor -- <i>surprise!</i> -- scientists believe they have what has conservatively been called a "working draft" of the human genome. 
<P>
   Such news does boggle the mind, as well as stretch the imagination in good and evil directions. Will genetic discrimination be close behind? 
<P>
   Amid the giddiness following the announced alphabetization of humans -- the A, C, G and T -- there were warnings from others about the moral, legal and ethical consequences of the extraordinary find. 
<P>
   The day the genome genie was let out of the bottle, the Coalition for Genetic Fairness issued this statement: 
<P>
   "Today's announcement promises better health for millions of Americans, but that promise will be kept only if Congress passes comprehensive federal protection from genetic discrimination. ... Our legal system lags dangerously far behind the genetic revolution. A patchwork of state and limited federal laws leaves Americans vulnerable to genetic discrimination by health insurers and employers." 
<P>
   A person's gender, ethnicity, and disability already have been workplace disqualifiers. Employers already snoop into medical files. People who make it their business to know how many miscarriages you've had to what movies you've rented aren't likely to knock before entering the double-helix door. 
<P>
   Last month a Tennessee-based national insurer agreed to a $206 million settlement in a class-action suit in which it was disclosed that black policyholders were charged more for burial insurance than whites. Don't think some insurers wouldn't like to dive into the gene pool? 
<P>
   What if some people thought, as does syndicated columnist "Dr. Laura," that homosexuals are the result of "biological error"? If "they" won't make more blacks, do you think "they" will want more gays and lesbians? 
<P>
   The genetic fairness coalition includes the National Partnership for Women & Families, formerly the Women's Legal Defense Fund. Its Web site warns women about possible genetic profiling: 
<P>
   "There are now genetic tests for more than 400 disorders, and many of the most widely available tests are for women. Millions of women and families stand to benefit from improved prevention, detection and treatment of diseases like breast and ovarian cancer. However, all the advances in the world will not help women and families if -- by participating in genetic research or taking a genetic test -- they can be denied job opportunities, health care, or both, based on their genetic information." 
<P>
   Jamie Court, advocacy director of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights, issued a more frightening warning. The foundation, a constant burr under HMOs' saddles, last week raised concerns about genetic privacy. 
<P>
   "Today, banks typically utilize `credit scoring' to determine whether an applicant is approved for a loan and at what interest rate," Court said, in a written statement. "What if banks, insurance companies and other corporations could view genetic profiles of applicants, a genetic score based on a simple DNA test?" 
<P>
   Knowing Darryl, if he's no longer in genetics, he's probably in law. We, the people, will need experts in both. 
<P>
