OK, they're going to humor us again next week.
<P>Sure, they're giving us  Monday off. But the lakes  will be too crowded to fish.  And besides, we really  shouldn't be bought off that  easily, anyway.
<P>In fact, to be honest  about it, we should just be  honest and stop even calling  it Labor Day. Start celebrating Corporations Day and get it over with. After  all, the corporate culture has permeated this society far more than any idea  ever propagated by modern labor  leaders.
<P>Even unions themselves - despite  a few high-profile victories - haven't  found a way to rebuild membership or  infiltrate the so-called &quot;new economy&quot;  sectors where much of the job growth  is taking place.
<P>Union membership is only a paltry  16 percent. And it's only about 10 percent if you subtract government workers and count only private-sector employees.
<P>Changing the name to Corporations Day would reflect who really  runs the country. The change would  be especially appropriate in a presidential election year.
<P>Just think about it.  Corporate influence is  evident in everything  from sponsorship of  the two major conventions to the fact that  business is picking up  much of the tab for  the upcoming debates  - which helps explain  why corporate thorn-in-the-backside Ralph  Nader won't be coming soon to a TV  screen near you.
<P>But who's going to protest when we  keep hearing that half the country is  now invested in the stock market and  the other half wants to be, either directly or through 401(k) plans and the  like? Just who are the workers going  to rail against? Themselves?
<P>Which raises the obvious question:  Has labor lost its working class consciousness because the laborers are  also the owners? Has the growing corporatization of America changed what  the new workers/owners are concerned about?
<P>&quot;That's a very interesting question.  Five years ago I would have said it  should,&quot; said economist Margaret  Blair, research director at the Georgetown-Sloan Project on Business Institutions at Georgetown University.
<P>But she and others point to the  just-ended labor spat at United Airlines, where workers have invested  heavily in the company, as proof that  minds can't be changed at older industries simply through employee ownership. Or, to put it more bluntly, workers can't be totally bought off with  stock options.
<P>Still, if there's any real working-class consciousness surviving  in new-economy America, it  may be because the notion of  worker investment in the  economy has been oversold,  anyway. For the most part,  the same few people still own  the country.
<P>That's one finding that will  be outlined in the Economy  Policy Institute's &quot;State of  Working America&quot; report that will be  released this weekend. While still  guarding the details of the analysis,  co-author Jared Bernstein says that  despite the hype, most workers still  aren't invested in the stock market.  And for most of those who are, it's  such a small investment that it  couldn't possibly affect their outlook.
<P>Nearly 70 percent of the market's  recent gains have gone to just the  richest 10 percent of Americans, he  said. For most workers, their livelihoods still depend almost exclusively  on wages or salaries, and their health  benefits. 
<P>     &quot;The stock market boom has largely passed the middle-income households by,&quot; said Bernstein, an economist for the Washington-based think  tank. 
<P>     But that doesn't mean that corporate America hasn't infiltrated workers'  minds in other ways. 
<P>     From the public  television commercials  posing as sponsorship  messages, to the Channel One ads that tell  schoolchildren which  products they must  have, to the business  logos all over public  buildings, we are constantly being corporatized. 
<P>     So why shouldn't corporate America have its own holiday? 
<P>     I know what you're thinking: It already does; it's called Christmas. But  that period from the day after  Thanksgiving to Dec. 24, during which  buying becomes a religion, is not officially named after the folks who make  it all possible. 
<P>     With the Commerce Department  reporting that spending went up twice  as fast as incomes last month, and that  the personal savings rate was a <I>negative </I>0.2 percent - the lowest ever -  it's clear who's pulling the strings. 
<P>     Any sector that can talk us out of  our paychecks this effectively deserves  its own holiday. So does any sector  that can talk the Democratic Party into becoming a free-trade organization,  talk both parties out of changing the  campaign-finance system that makes it  all possible, and talk half of the country into staying home on Election Day  and letting it all happen. 
<P>     So stay home Monday, and celebrate Corporations Day.
