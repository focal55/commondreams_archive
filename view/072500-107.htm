On the last day of November last year, I was walking among the
swirling crowds and clouds of tear gas in Seattle and noticed Tom Hayden
standing on a corner, checking out the tens of thousands of anti-World
Trade Organization protesters--the Turtles and Teamsters together.
<p>Given that our organization, Public Citizen, helped organize the WTO
protests, I asked him what he thought about our mobilization against
corporate globalization. A yearlong international grass-roots campaign
had stopped a planned expansion of the WTO. He was impressed. Encouraged,
I went for it: "Tom," I asked, "how does this compare to, you know,
Chicago '68?"
<p>"The difference," he told me, "is that you're winning."
<p>Like many veterans of Seattle, I will be in Philadelphia for the GOP
convention and in L.A. for the Democrats'. I wish we were organizing a
massive street celebration of either party's post-Seattle epiphany that
the flawed and failed free trade agenda must be replaced. If we were
winning, the Democratic convention would ratify, in its party platform, a
fair trade plank that meets the legitimate expectations of workers and
family farmers and ensures that a living wage, the environment, health
and democratic accountability are not subordinated to the imperatives of
corporate managed trade.
<p>But we're not winning, and the current platform draft, prepared by the
corprocratic scriveners at the "Democratic" Leadership Council, includes
a call to revive the outdated "fast-track" model of trade negotiating
authority that gave us North American Free Trade Agreement and was
defeated twice by Congress. Since Seattle, the trade policy showdown was
a vote on China's permanent normal trade relations.
<p>The China business lobby spent an unprecedented amount of money
pushing PNTR. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Business
Roundtable (a corporate lobbying group) companies have poured $58 million
into the campaign coffers of both parties and members on both sides of
the aisle since 1999, including dozens of Democratic
"super-delegates"--elected officials. The business campaign spent tens of
millions more on lobbyists and TV and radio advertising.
<p>And, of course, transnational corporations are "sponsoring" the
conventions; Motorola, for example, which dropped a cool million on
pro-PNTR advertising, spent another million funding the DNC party next
month. Then Al Gore selected Commerce Secretary Bill Daley, perhaps the
biggest booster of corporate managed trade in any administration in
history, as chairman of his campaign.
<p>So, as I and my fellow activists don our protest puppets and the
Democrats put on their party hats, a few words of advice and admonition
are suggested by our experience in Seattle and a decade of grass-roots
travails in the cause of fair trade.
<p>To Democratic delegates: I urge you to walk off the Staples Center
set, put down your scripts, come outside, cross the police line and join
us in the street to share, for a few minutes, the spirit of Seattle.
Globalization and trade policy are marker issues now, canaries in the
mine shaft of Democratic policymaking, and this convention is an
opportunity to return your party to its progressive, pro-worker
antecedents. If you read the same polls I do, you should realize that
your standard bearer stands a better chance in November if you push him
to renounce his slavish devotion to corporate globalization.
<p>To the mainstream media: You have all our sympathy for trying to find
actual news in the predictable, scripted convention proceedings. You will
do your readers and viewers a favor by coming outside as well to find
some real stories. And please don't get distracted by protest tactics.
You should be asking why we are outside with our signs and chants, not
merely what we're planning to do to get our message heard.
<p>To Mayor Riordan and the LAPD: We've all read about your
baton-rattling preparations for protesters. Listen, nobody doubts that
you're "Tough Enough to Turn L.A. into a Battle Zone". But hey, you
invited the convention to L.A. (just as Seattle invited the WTO), and
political protest is part of the package. So spare us the bluff and
bluster about anarchists. We will be peacefully exercising our 1st
Amendment rights.
<p>To my fellow activists: Folks, we're holding our own against a much
better financed corporate lobby because its agenda hurts the majority of
people living with its results. Seattle was a battle in a larger war
between corporate rule and civil society, and the great and good
grass-roots of the international fair trade movement--workers, family
farmers, consumers, environmental and human rights activists--must fight
on united. The next skirmish, damn it, will be on the streets of L.A.
I'll see you there.
