&quot;Racial Disparities Pervasive in Juvenile Justice&quot; read a New York Times headline on April 26. But the story didn't even make the front page in the Washington Post. And the rest of the media -- so focused on the drama of Elian Gonzalez -- had no time to report on the tragedy of an entire generation of American children. The story was treated like a weather report, accepted with a shrug as part of the natural order.
<P>
 
&quot;And Justice for Some,&quot; the study by the Justice Department with six of the nation's leading foundations, detailed what many have feared. Minority youngsters -- African Americans and Latinos primarily -- are more likely than their white counterparts to be arrested, held in jail, sent to adult court for trial, convicted and given more severe prison terms.
<P>
 
The disparity in treatment is staggering. For those charged with crimes who have never been in prison before, blacks are six times more likely than whites to be sentenced to prison. For those charged with a violent crime for the first time, black teenagers are nine times more likely than whites to be sentenced to prison. For drug offenses, black youths are 48 times more likely than white to be sentenced to prison. 
<P>
 
Hugh Price, president of the Urban League, concludes that we are faced &quot;with a very serious national civil rights issue, virtually making our system (one of) juvenile injustice.&quot;
<P>
 
And the disparity begins before the kids get in trouble. Too many of these children are raised against the odds. They grow up on mean streets. Their mothers work, but they have no day care or Head Start. They go to school hungry. Their schools are falling apart, their classes crowded, their teachers inexperienced. Zero tolerance puts some on the street. Racial profiling targets those who are on the street. And then the system of juvenile injustice kicks in, making it harder for them to complete their education, to get jobs, to become decent husbands and fathers.
<P>
 
Juvenile injustice tags youngsters for life. Sending kids to prison too often gives them an education in crime. More than 7 percent of the black population has spent some time in jail. Almost half of young African American males in the nation's capital are in prison, on probation or parole. Locked up primarily for nonviolent drug offenses, blacks are disenfranchised, separated from their families, shorn of their jobs and hopes.
<P>
 
This is a national disgrace, demanding immediate action. The study's authors timidly ask for the Justice Department to be given $100 million to work on reducing racial disparities. Needed are a national inquest and state and local mobilization to change the system.
<P>
 
When Elian Gonzalez was taken forcefully back to his father, Republicans -- sensing political capital to be collected -- jumped to the defense of his Miami relatives. Senate Leader Trent Lott hauled Attorney General Janet Reno in for harsh questioning. Senate and House committees announced hearings. Republican politicians flooded the talk shows to express their outrage.
<P>
 
But when an authoritative report shows that the U.S. juvenile justice system is a disgrace, the legislators are nowhere to be seen. Lott has no comment. No hearings are scheduled. For all of his show of compassionate conservatism, George W. Bush has nothing to say on a juvenile injustice system in which his own state is deeply implicated. No politicians clamor to get on talk shows.
<P>
 
President Clinton has gained the loyal support of the African American community. But this juvenile injustice takes place on his watch. And some of the policies he has trumpeted -- three strikes and out, zero tolerance -- have had unintended consequences that contribute to mass incarceration. Now there are 2 million in jail, 500,000 more than the Chinese -- with minorities suffering disproportionately. He must take the lead in mobilizing officials at a local, state and national level to redress a disgrace that robs children of hope. A national inquest should be started. All governors should convene a special commission to investigate their own system.
<P>
 
This shameful injustice mocks the values the United States claims to represent in the world. It disgraces the rule of law. It cannot be accepted as natural or immutable. If the elected leaders of the nation will not lead, then the people must act on their own. Those whose children get privileged treatment will not challenge the injustice. The slaveholder did not end slavery. Those whose children are betrayed must challenge this systemic disorder. Surely, people of conscience of all colors and creeds cannot sit idly by and watch a nation spend more energy on a spectacle involving one Cuban child than on a scandal scarring the lives of an entire generation of American children.
