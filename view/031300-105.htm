<p>GOOD MORNING. As everyone in this state should know, I was elected 
governor of California as a strong advocate of law and order, and an 
equally strong proponent of our death penalty statute. A society as 
complex and diverse as ours can function only by the common 
acceptance, and adherence to, an easily understood code of behavior. 
A foundation of that code, spelled out clearly by the Legislature and 
upheld in numerous court decisions, states clearly that those who 
without conscience, remorse or mercy take the life of another forfeit 
the right to theirs.	 
</P>
<P>  I have carried out the mandate of California's death penalty on 
two occasions and stand prepared to do so again. As a lawyer and this 
state's 
chief executive, however, I recognize that the death penalty can work 
only when it is impartially invoked, and infallibly enforced. There 
is evidence that has come to my attention that shows these 
fundamental conditions are not always met.	 
</P>
<P>  All of us are aware of the steps taken by my colleague, Gov. 
George Ryan of Illinois. Following exoneration of 13 prisoners on 
death row, and evidence of police, judicial and prosecutorial 
misconduct and inadequate legal representation, Gov. Ryan halted all 
executions pending a comprehensive study of his state's use of 
capital punishment. I raise this not to compare our states on the 
issue of the death penalty -- we are vastly dissimilar. Our system is 
marked by caution, thoroughness and conscientiousness, theirs 
admittedly less so.	 
Nevertheless, I have asked for, and received, a preliminary report on 
our death penalty system in California. A summary of that report is 
in the packet before you. In it, you will find that as thorough, fair 
and effective as our death penalty system is, it is not without 
problems.	 
</P>
<P>  At least five men convicted of capital murder in California have 
been found to be wrongly accused and imprisoned since the death 
penalty was reinstated. The most recent was Dwayne McKinney, who was 
released from Lancaster State Prison on January 28 of this year after 
serving 18 years for a murder he did not commit. ``If jurors in 1982 
had voted to execute Dwayne McKinney, as the prosecutor in that case 
had wanted,'' the Orange County Register wrote, ``he probably would 
be dead by now.''	 
Rather than immunity from the possibility of executing the innocent, 
the recent Rampart Division scandal in the Los Angeles Police 
Department shows that our state may in fact be especially susceptible 
to it. That scandal in our state's largest city has led to the 
release of at least 99 inmates who were framed by officers who 
conducted false arrests, witness tampering, evidence planting and 
perjury in conspiring to put innocent people in jail.	 
In my investigations, I have learned that the U.S. Ninth Circuit 
Court of Appeals has rejected a request to `'fast track'' death 
penalty cases in California. The court ruled that our state provides 
neither adequate compensation for counsel, nor adequate resources for 
constitutional issues to be raised in death penalty cases. 
Approximately 180 prisoners on California's death row today -- almost 
one-third of all those condemned to die -- have no legal 
representation whatsoever. This is unconscionable.	 
</P>
<P>I have learned that California has no standardized guidelines for 
prosecutors to use in determining when a case should be tried as a 
death penalty case. Each district attorney is left on his or her own 
to pursue the death penalty for whatever reasons they choose -- and 
do. This is unacceptable.	 
</P>
<P> I have learned that whereas DNA testing has proven to be an 
effective means of establishing the guilt or innocence of the 
accused, a Los Angeles Times investigation has found that prosecutors 
in California routinely deny prisoners the right to DNA tests even in 
cases in which innocence is strongly suggested. This is unjust.	 
Many critics of the death penalty point to new opinion polls that 
show public support for capital punishment now below 50 percent. But 
opposition to the death penalty should not be based on opinion polls, 
any more than support should be. The death penalty should be 
supported -- or not -- because it is impartial, fair and effective -- 
or not.	 
</P>
<P>I have concluded that at this moment in California, it is not. 
Imposition of the death penalty is marked by arbitrariness in which 
race, ethnic origin and economic status are key determinants. 
Minorities, the poor and those without the means to mount an adequate 
defense are disproportionately represented on death row.	 
</P>
<P> Therefore, I am announcing the appointment of a bipartisan task 
force to investigate whether the death penalty in our state can be 
administered without posing the risk of executing the innocent. In 
the meantime, I am suspending all executions statewide and calling 
upon district attorneys in each of our 59 counties to cease seeking 
the death penalty in capital cases, and pursue instead life sentence 
without possibility of parole.	 
</P>
<P>  I want to assure all Californians that this moratorium presents no 
danger to themselves or their families. More than 2,300 convicted 
murderers have been given life sentence without parole in our state 
since 1977 -- not one has been released. Besides protecting the 
public's safety, this sentence removes any possibility that our state 
will execute an innocent person.	 
</P>
<P>  Today, 563 men and women are on California's death row, the most 
in the nation. If just one of them were to be innocent and die at our 
hand, we will have failed them all -- and failed ourselves. During 
this moratorium, we will use this time to study whether the death 
penalty can work as we hoped it could. If it can't, together we will 
discover what can.
