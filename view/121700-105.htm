THIS PAST WEEK, it seems, many Americans were shocked to discover 
that the U.S. Supreme Court is not at all immune to deep ideological divisions 
and -- gasp! -- nasty old, nonobjective partisan politics.
<P>  Supposedly concerned about equal protection rights (for the first time 
anyone can remember), the court's conservative majority jerry-built a ruling 
that disenfranchised possibly thousands of Florida voters and handed the 
presidency to George W. Bush. Legions of Americans were stunned and 
disillusioned.
</P>
<P>  Not among them were the women and men of the National Abortion Rights 
Action League in Washington, D.C. Said NARAL executive vice president Alice 
Germond: "There was a reason we handed out buttons during the presidential 
campaign that said, 'It's the Supreme Court, Stupid.' I don't think people 
truly appreciated the importance of the Supreme Court until now. Those of us 
in the pro-choice community have been aware of it for a long time."
</P>
<P>  Over the past two decades, thanks in large part to rabidly anti-choice 
political activists and presidents such as Ronald Reagan and the first George 
Bush, the modest federal protections of Roe vs. Wade have been whittled to the 
barest of bones. (If you question "modest," read the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court 
decision. It does not, as so many anti-abortion politicians like to pretend, 
sanction "abortion on demand.")
</P>
<P>  Since the 1994 takeover of Congress by the Republican right, 134 pieces of 
anti-abortion legislation have made their way into the House and Senate. This 
is more than six times the number of similar bills introduced between 1982 and 
1992. Of the 134, pro-choice supporters have prevailed in only 24.
</P>
<P>  Meanwhile, anti-abortion state legislators and governors, such as President-
elect Bush, have denied safe abortions to poor women and teenagers and reduced 
access for women who can afford them. According to NARAL, 264 anti-choice 
measures have passed state legislatures, 45 of them just this year.
</P>
<P>  Until his "compassionate conservative" quest for the White House 
necessitated a lower decibel level on the abortion issue, Bush was an 
outspoken enemy of legal abortion. He has not only pledged to help overturn 
Roe vs. Wade, he has signed into law 18 anti-abortion provisions during his 
six years as governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>  Next month, Bush will become president with the power to appoint 136 vacant 
federal judgeships and probably one or more justices to the high court during 
his term. His ideal judicial model: the most overtly anti-choice justice on 
the court, Antonin Scalia. His next-favorite: another man who believes women 
do not deserve domain over their own wombs, Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>  "Politicians come and go," said Germond, "but the Supreme Court is with us 
a long time. Both sides of the abortion issue are certainly aware that this 
court has a very fragile balance. The Carhart decision (which earlier this 
year upheld the essence of Roe) was 5-4. One more anti-choice justice and the 
balance will shift."
</P>
<P>  During his campaign, Bush insisted there would be no litmus test on 
abortion for Supreme Court nominees. If you believe that, be sure to look on 
Inauguration Day for that squadron of pink pigs that is scheduled to fly over 
the Capitol.
</P>
<P>  A more accurate indication of how it's really going to be came last week 
from a couple of radical right powerhouses.
</P>
<P>  In a New York Times op-ed piece, "family values" champ Gary Bauer told Bush 
to immediately "name a pro-life attorney general" and "also nominate Supreme 
Court justices who believe the same." In Congress, House Majority Whip Tom 
DeLay included the obliteration of Roe vs. Wade as one of "the things we have 
been dreaming about we can now do unfettered."
</P>
<P>  Some dream. Gone with Bill Clinton is the fetter of a pro-choice 
president's veto. And, if senators who support abortion rights do not stay 
true to their principles, gone too will be a razor-thin, pro-choice majority 
on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>  Of the 50 million plurality that voted for Al Gore, Germond said: "America 
is pro-choice. America voted pro-choice. George Bush can't possibly see this 
as an anti-choice mandate."
</P>
<P>  But, as Germond knows, Bush may not need to see any mandates. Not with the 
friends in high places that he has. As the vociferous anti-abortion Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist has put it: "Roe continues to exist, but only in the 
way a storefront on a western movie set exists: a mere facade to give the 
illusion of reality."
