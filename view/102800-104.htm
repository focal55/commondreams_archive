A new disease of the nervous system is afflicting millions of voting-age 
Americans: <I>Dubyaphobia. </I>The disease is characterized by paranoia, 
helplessness, cynicism, and a lack of perspective. Its victims are plagued by 
nightmares about a semi-literate doofus in a cowboy hat leading a pack of 
crucifix-wielding Inquisitors. Sufferers say repeatedly: "I'd like to vote for 
Ralph Nader but I don't want Bush to win." 
</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fortunately, there is treatment that can restore well-being. Side effects may 
include a loss of attachment to the Democratic Party and alienation from 
mainstream spin doctors. A nine-step cure is recommended:</font></P>
<B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Timely remedy</font></P>
</B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dubyaphobes say now is the wrong time for a protest vote. But Ralph </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader is the best progressive candidate since George McGovern. His 
credentials as a citizen advocate are impeccable, his critique of the corrupt 
political system and the economy is thorough and fact-based, and his proposed 
agenda is both visionary and sensible. Nader is well-known, respected, 
articulate, persistent and unflinching. He has little of the baggage usually 
associated with left-leaning politicians. He's not calling for an overthrow of 
the American political system  - just a return to the core principles of 
straight-arrow democracy. And, unlike career politicians, he's accomplished 
concrete things for real people throughout his life  - preventing death and 
injury by pushing for safer cars, food and other products.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader's candidacy comes during a time of growing unease with corporate 
influence over American politics. The candidacy of John McCain illustrated the 
breadth of that concern. Also, Nader's run follows the Seattle protests and 
other demonstrations against world government by corporate logo.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Far from being untimely, Nader's candidacy comes at a crucial moment, when 
there is a receptive audience for his challenge to the two-party system and his 
message of citizen empowerment. Yet, the American Left's most influential 
publication, <I>The Nation, </I>devoted two consecutive issues to scaring its 
readers into voting for Gore. For decades, commentators in <I>The Nation</I> 
have been decrying the bankruptcy of the Democratic Party and calling wistfully 
for a progressive alternative. Now that there is such an alternative, <I>The 
Nation</I> has decided the prospect is too terrifying. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When would be a better time to support a Third Party candidate? When will 
there be a better candidate? When will more people be so disenchanted with the 
two major-party choices? </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Corporations are running amok. Not only do they continue to operate unsafe 
workplaces, pollute the environment, and widen the gap between rich and poor, 
they own and control the media and the political process. They set the terms of 
the discussion. Nader alone speaks to this power grab.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seize the time, Dubyaphobes. Vote for a change while there is still the 
opportunity to do so. If not now, when?</font></P>
<B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Remedial math</font></P>
</B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dubyaphobes say: "A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush." This is "fuzzy math." 
Say G has 38 apples, B has 36 apples and N has 6 apples. Is our children 
learning that giving an apple to N means that B now has 37 apples? I don't think 
so, not even in Texas.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet extreme sufferers actually say: "I <I>can't</I> vote for Nader because 
I<I> </I>can't let Bush win." Talk about delusions of grandeur! No presidential 
election is decided by one vote. Adding a single vote to a pile of millions is 
like throwing a snowflake into a blizzard. It has no effect. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dubyaphobes moan about <I>wasting</I> their vote on someone who has no chance 
of winning. But a vote for Gore is a gesture of futility. A vote for Nader is a 
positive and meaningful contribution to building an alternative to the moribund 
two-party system. The size of the Nader vote is crucial. The Greens need five 
percent to qualify for federal matching funds in 2004. The higher the vote, the 
more impact it will have on issues such as campaign finance, and the stronger 
challenge the Green Party can mount. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Don't worry: If Gore loses, it won't be because you didn't vote for him. It's 
because he didn't earn enough votes to win.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></FONT><FONT size=2></font></P>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></FONT><B><FONT size=4>
</font></B><B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Supreme reality check</font></P>
</B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the heart of Dubyaphobia is Supreme paranoia. The nightmare scenario of 
Democratic spinmeisters is that Bush will pack the Supreme Court with clones of 
Clarence Thomas who will overturn <I>Roe v. Wade. </I>In its most alarmist form, 
this phony argument also envisions other devastating court rulings, including 
rollbacks of voting rights, disability rights, and affirmative action; approval 
of vouchers for private schools; no limits on campaign contributions; striking 
down gun control legislation, and a weakening of labor and environmental laws. 
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This scenario is far-fetched. First off, predicting vacancies on the court in 
any presidency is a crapshoot. Saying the next president will determine the 
course of law for the next 40 years is irresponsible hyperbole.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Secondly, though Bush has stated his admiration for Thomas and Antonin 
Scalia, his record of appointments in Texas is moderate.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most importantly, presidents <I>nominate</I> but do not <I>appoint</I> 
Supreme Court justices. Thomas and Scalia are on the court because Democrats in 
the Senate voted for them. If Democrats don't want clones of these guys, just 
hold ranks and kill the nominations, as they did with Robert Bork.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Is it really conceivable that <I>Roe v. Wade</I> is in imminent danger? 
Presidents Reagan and Bush had 12 years to overturn <I>Roe v. Wade</I> with 
their appointments, and they put six of their nominees on the Supreme Court. Yet 
<I>Roe v. Wade</I> holds firm. Public opinion and a large body of law are firmly 
behind abortion rights.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">George W. Bush is so respectful of the popularity of abortion rights that he 
is soft-pedaling his pro-life views. He wouldn't even grab the chance to 
bad-mouth RU-486 in the debates. Of course, Dubyaphobes assume this is a cover 
for his real agenda. They also take Gore at his word  - that all his judicial 
nominees will stand for a woman's right to choose.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But can Gore be trusted on abortion? As a Congressman, Gore endorsed a 
fetus's "right to life" and voted to define the fetus as a person from 
conception. He supported the Hyde amendment, which banned federal funding for 
Medicare abortions, and even voted against an exception in case of rape. He also 
voted to deny federal funding for any hospital or clinic that performed 
abortions. Gore has reversed course (as he has on many issues), but in the 
debates, he still made a point of saying he supports a ban on "partial-birth 
abortions." This is the champion of a woman's right to choose?</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other issues cited, rollbacks of voting rights and disability rights 
are unimaginable. The constitutionality of school vouchers is uncertain under 
any court makeup, as is affirmative action, which Gore's running mate Joe 
Lieberman consistently opposed -- until he was nominated for veep. As for gun 
control, campaign financing, labor issues and environmental laws, there is no 
sign the high court will decide these issues. </font></P>
<B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Anti-paranoia medication</font></P>
</B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">George W. Bush talks like a moderate, but Dubyaphobes are convinced he is a 
Trojan Horse for the Contract with America. Soon after Bush is in office, they 
say, the country will wonder: <I>Who let the dogs out</I>?</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But wait, wasn't the Contract with America one of the most unpopular things 
to hit the country since New Coke? Isn't the backlash against Gingrich's 1994 
"mandate" what has caused the GOP to go all gooey with moderates like Dubya? 
Well, say the conspiracy theorists, that's exactly why they're being so sneaky 
now.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, Republicans can read polls. They are not on a suicide mission to 
destroy their own party. If the GOP was controlled by its most right-wing 
elements, why did Pat Buchanan leave it?</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dubyaphobes still believe in the specter of Hillary Clinton's "vast 
right-wing conspiracy." But if the conspiracy is so vast and so powerful, why is 
it afraid to show its face?</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With Bush, the GOP is trying to regain the middle ground commandeered so 
slickly by Clinton. Far from conspiring with their own most Draconian elements, 
the GOP is doing to the Right what the Democrats are doing to the Left  - tossing 
them a few bones, making them empty promises, and lecturing them that they have 
no place else to go unless they want to lose the election to the evil 
opposition.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Laugh if you want at the phrase "compassionate conservative," but Dubya is no 
Ronald Reagan. He's just a shrub.</font><B>
</B></P>
<B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Goremyopia corrective vision</font></P>
</B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dubyaphobes are constantly trying to make silk purses out of sow Gore's ears. 
But contrary to liberal fantasies, the New Democrats are still in charge of the 
party, and Gore is a faithful center-right newbie. He crows about backing 
welfare reform, the Gulf War, NAFTA, capital punishment and sanctions against 
Iraq. His running mate is a moralizing religious zealot with a record of 
toadying to big business and arms dealers. Lieberman's views on culture and his 
propensity for invoking the deity could earn him good standing in the Christian 
Coalition, if only he were not Jewish. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What's the real Clinton/Gore legacy? Ending government support for millions 
of indigent women and their children. Now most of these families live the 
American dream of a minimum-wage job for mom and day care for the kids, and most 
of them don't have health insurance. Frighteningly, Gore says he wants to "take 
welfare reform to the next level."</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Forty-four million Americans are without medical insurance. During one 
debate, Gore called that a "national disgrace." It certainly is  - coming eight 
years after a president was elected who pledged to win universal health 
insurance, but ended up caving to the HMOs. Asked at a debate whether he favored 
universal health insurance, Gore said only by taking small steps. He didn't say 
whether they would continue to be steps backward. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are now more children in poverty and more children without health 
insurance than ever before, and personal debt is at an all-time high. The 
Democrats no longer strongly back a safety net for those left behind by the 
vaunted "New Economy." Yet Gore talks about "fighting for working families"! On 
his team's watch, there are two million people in prison and the death penalty 
is firmly entrenched; parents are working longer hours and spending less time 
with their kids; auto safety standards have been allowed to lapse, making 
corporate crimes like the exploding Firestone tires inevitable; and no progress 
has been made on gun control.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gore stayed a fan of Clinton even as it became plausible that Slick Willie 
was a serial rapist. He applauded when Clinton bombed a pharmaceutical plant in 
Sudan to distract attention from his zipper problem. Children are still dying in 
Sudan because of that callous and criminal act, but not at the rate of kids in 
Iraq, where the brutal sanctions have killed half a million children. Gore 
strongly supports the sanctions, which have only strengthened the power of 
Saddam Hussein. Gore loves to point out that he was one of the few Democrats in 
Congress to vote for the Gulf War.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for working families, Clinton/Gore's legacy includes the flight of 
countless jobs overseas, the relaxation of trade standards so that goods made 
with child labor flood our stores, and the erosion of labor rights in this 
country. A Human Rights Watch report says employers fired or punished more than 
125,000 workers for supporting a union between 1992 and 1997 -- without a peep 
from Clinton/Gore. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gore has betrayed his own environmental principles to allow corporations to 
continue to pollute and plunder. He supported opening the Alaska National 
Petroleum Reserve to oil drilling. Rather than pushing hard for conservation and 
fuel efficiency standards, Gore wants to solve the gas price crisis by dipping 
into emergency petroleum reserves. Gore supports logging forests on federal 
lands.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gore has been tough on welfare mothers but hasn't said one word about 
corporate welfare. From 1996 through 1998, 41 companies that should have paid $9 
billion in taxes on their incomes of $25.8 billion got rebates of $3.2 billion. 
The list includes Texaco, Chevron, Pepsi, Pfizer, J.P. Morgan, Goodyear, and 
General Motors  - and other donors to the Democrats.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When Gore pledges he will support reforms in campaign financing, after all 
his years of bending the rules to help pile up record amounts of big-business 
dollars in Democratic Party war chests, there is an appropriate one-word 
response: <I>hypocrite.</i></font></P>
<I>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></font></I><B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. Crash course in differential calculus</font></P>
</B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dubyaphobes defend their support for Gore by saying there are differences 
between the candidates. That's true. There are also more and less humane ways of 
administering capital punishment, but both have the same result. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here is a partial list of the things that Bush and Gore agree on: Supporting 
Israel and blaming Arafat for Middle East tensions. Free trade. Open markets for 
China, despite Beijing's human rights abuses. The war against Yugoslavia. More 
money for anti-ballistic missiles. The invasions of Grenada and Panama. The Gulf 
War. Supporting Indonesia in East Timor. Training Colombian troops in the Drug 
War. Bailing out Mexico. Not making loans to "corrupt governments." Prohibiting 
gays from marrying. 
Mandatory testing in schools. Capital punishment. 
Welfare reform. Curbing sex and violence on TV, the movies and the music 
industry. Suspending more civil liberties to lock up more criminals </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here are some of their main disagreements:</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nuclear weapons: Bush is promising to reduce nuclear weapons unilaterally, 
while Gore would do so only if the Soviets join in.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Military intervention: Bush would let NATO troops do peacekeeping in Kosovo 
and elsewhere in Europe without the U.S. military. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On education: Bush favors vouchers, Gore is opposed. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Abortion: The candidates may not be as far apart as Gore claims.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Minimum wage: Bush supports a $1 increase over three years, Gore wants a $1 
jump over two years. The difference is 17 cents a year.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Social Security: Bush wants to partially privatize the system. Gore wants a 
"lock box."</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Affirmative action: Gore supports it, while Bush waffles.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gun control: They agree that hunters and homeowners have the right to own 
guns, that there is a need for "gun-free schools," that there should be trigger 
locks and background checks at gun shows. They disagree on concealed weapons 
laws.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taxes: Bush wants a big tax cut, with everyone getting cuts and the wealthy 
getting the most. Gore says his tax-cut plan is fairer, but don't bet the farm 
on it.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prescription drugs for the elderly: Get your calculator out and first show 
what the differences are, and then prove they are meaningful.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Global warming: Bush thinks it's still not proven (a lunatic position). Gore 
was one of the first politicians to recognize the threat but hasn't done much if 
anything concrete about it (a hypocritical position).</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On almost all these issues, Ralph Nader has a more progressive and 
far-sighted position. He's against the death penalty, wants to withdraw from 
NAFTA and renegotiate trade agreements, favors a sharp reduction in military 
spending and a sharp increase in fuel economy standards, and has already 
instituted his own campaign finance reform by refusing special interest money. 
(See <A href="http://www.geocities.com/issuetree/">http://www.geocities.com/issuetree/</A> for more 
information on the Green Party platform.)</FONT><B>
</B></P>
<B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. A dose of accountability</font></P>
</B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Honest Dubyaphobes admit Gore isn't an ideal candidate. Some even endorse the 
strategy of voting for Nader in states where the race isn't close. While such a 
tactic will help build the Green Party, it lets the Democrats escape 
accountability. It's saying progressives will withhold votes from the Democrats 
only when it won't hurt. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Should the Left keep giving the Democrats a free ride? Each time around, the 
once-liberal party pays less heed to its progressive wing. Why should it do 
otherwise, when progressives keep bowing and scraping? The AFL-CIO endorsed Gore 
before the primaries even started. What leverage did that give labor?</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shouldn't the Democrats have to do something to earn votes beyond harping on 
how evil the Republicans are? Democrats will keep going rightward unless they 
are yanked left by a strong, meaningful protest vote.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Don't give away your vote. Make them earn it.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you are determined to be practical about this, try the idea floated at 
<a href="http://www.nadertrader.com">www.nadertrader.com</a>.</font></P>
<B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. Visualizing the future</font></P>
</B>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Compare the practical significance of the two scenarios at issue.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, the Dubyaphobes' nightmare outcome: Nader gets 10 percent of the vote 
and Gore loses. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If this happens, what Bush can accomplish will be constrained by whether the 
GOP controls Congress. But let's say the worst occurs: Democrats lose both 
houses and Bush implements a radical right agenda. In that case, public support 
for the Republicans will dwindle and they will lose the White House and Congress 
in 2004 and for years to come, the price of defying the majority on too many 
issues. A much more likely outcome is that the Republicans under Bush will be 
constrained  -- by their lack of control over Congress and their slim margin in 
the election -- to stay their middle-of-the-road course; after all, they like 
winning.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, the Democrats, chastened by the severe slap they've received from 
the left, may finally reject center-right candidates like Gore as losers. The 
Green Party will be an effective force, with the power to put progressive issues 
back onto the table. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What are the effects of the scenario endorsed by the Dubyaphobes?</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Say Gore wins and Nader gets less than five percent of the vote because most 
progressives hold their noses and vote for Gore. The Democrats will have to pay 
back all the favors they owe their big business sponsors. Dubyaphobes wistfully 
imagine they will have to pay back labor and liberal groups too. But what will 
compel the party to do so? A middling vote for a strong progressive candidate 
like Nader will prove to the New Democrat strategists that they need to do 
little to appease the docile Left.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The argument for a progressive alternative will weaken. The Green Party will 
again get shut out of federal funding, the debates, and the arena of acceptable 
political discussion. Hope for real change within the political system will 
diminish. Without a watchdog party, the big business cabal will strengthen its 
stranglehold on politics and the media.</font></P>
<P></P>

After two decades of Reagan/Bush/Clinton, American citizens are political

more nightmares. People who vote their convictions will feel more hopeful, more 
energized and more capable.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dubyaphobes argue that it is necessary to be practical. But they are the ones 
being impractical. There is no basis for their belief that if we simply hang on 
and wait, our choices will get better. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The New Democrats are deeply fearful of the challenge Nader poses. Their 
corporate sponsors are happy keeping half the electorate on the sidelines, 
discouraged and apathetic. The less the electorate is energized, the more power 
the big-ticket contributors have to peddle their influence.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Face it: The American two-party system is bankrupt, and presidential politics 
is a sham. Funded by big donors and shaped entirely by focus groups and image 
manipulators, elections are a corporate-sponsored war of television commercials 
that ignore most of the real issues.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A strong showing by Ralph Nader will provide hope for reviving a citizen 
movement in this country. At stake may be nothing less than democracy. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dubyaphobes, get a grip. Is voting for Nader a waste? Or is not voting for 
Nader a wasted opportunity?</font></P>
