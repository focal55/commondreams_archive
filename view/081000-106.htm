The news that the Republican vice presidential candidate has a
lesbian daughter confirms the obvious: Homosexuals are made that way, a
gift of God or nature, and not the result of liberal permissive parenting
or the policies of the Democratic Party.
<p>Mary Cheney is the product of a stern conservative upbringing under
the tutelage of a mother whose public work has centered on proclaiming a
standard of family values for the nation. In the main, her daughter would
seem an exemplar of those values--a hard-working, law-abiding, former
corporate spokeswoman for Coors. Mary Cheney is not a rebellious black
sheep but rather a loyal supporter of her father's political ambitions
who has said she will delay plans for graduate school in order to
campaign for the Republican ticket.
<p>Her example makes a hash of the denigration of homosexuality as a
capricious choice by willful, immoral hedonists who are being indulged by
a society that has abandoned traditional values. Once again, we have the
living proof that "they" are us, including a Republican convention
delegate, Brian Bennett, who was a key aide to the gay-bashing Robert K.
Dornan, the former congressman, and Pete Williams, who was Dick Cheney's
press spokesman during Cheney's days in the Pentagon.
<p>When Williams' homosexuality was revealed in the media several years
ago, Cheney said: "I have operated on the basis, over the years, with
respect to my personal staff, that I don't ask them about their private
lives. . . . As long as they perform their professional responsibilities
in a responsible manner, their private lives are their business."
<p>Why then did he later blast Bill Clinton for ever-so-tentatively
attempting to apply that standard of fairness to gays in the military?
How can Cheney run on a party platform that denies his own personal
experience with at least two thoroughly honorable homosexuals--his
trusted aide and his loving daughter?
<p>The platform approved by the same convention that nominated Mary
Cheney's father would bar her from military service, deny her civil
rights protection from discrimination and prevent any legal recognition
of the five-year relationship she has had with her partner.
<p>Implicit in that platform is a denial of Mary Cheney's fundamental
human right to define herself, because it assumes that being gay means
lacking the will to behave responsibly. That is why, when Dick Cheney was
secretary of Defense, he supported a policy of court-martialing even the
most battle-scarred hero of the military if he or she happened to be
homosexual. Does he think that his own daughter cannot be trusted to be
with heterosexual women in a barracks without molesting them?
<p>Do the Cheneys not believe that their daughter is capable of a
sustained loving relationship with her partner, Heather Poe, who has been
welcomed into their home? Alan Simpson, the ultraconservative former
Wyoming senator, met the lesbian couple at the Cheneys' home and,
according to the Rocky Mountain News, said that "the family not only
accepts Poe as their daughter's partner, but also embraces her as a
member, and outsiders shouldn't judge by what they don't see." He added,
"This is just one of those things the media lands on for a headline."
<p>Nope, not for a headline, but for a consistent statement of policy. If
the Cheneys can accept daughter Mary's companion as a member of the
family, why would they not accept a similar situation in another family?
Further, why would they deny their daughter, or anyone else's daughter or
son, the right to legally codify that partnership by accepting the
obligations normally associated with marriage?
<p>Why has it remained for the Democratic Party to affirm that gays are
entitled to full human rights? The reason is that the Republicans have
been drawn like moths to the flame of religious zealotry, thinking they
could bask in its glow without ever getting burnt. Which works just fine,
until one of your own falls victim to the forces of intolerance.
<p>At the Republican convention, Lynne Cheney bristled with anger when
ABC's Cokie Roberts asked her about her daughter being gay. The mother's
mood was understandably protective; it should have been none of the
reporter's business. But unfortunately, the moralizers, Lynne Cheney
prominent among them, have made intolerance the stuff of political
ambition, and it can't be easily turned off to suit their convenience.
<p>The proper answer to the snooping Roberts should have been: "Yes, and
it's about time we had more wonderful people who happen to be gay, like
my daughter, in the Republican Party."
