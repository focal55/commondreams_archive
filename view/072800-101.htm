WASHINGTON -- Asked this week why he voted 
against Head Start 
when he was in Congress in the 1980's, 
 Dick Cheney said he 
was "motivated by a 
concern for  fiscal responsibility in an 
era when the nation did not have the 
projected   surpluses it now has." 

<p> "I would not vote against Head 
Start today," Mr. Cheney, the expected Republican vice presidential candidate, said this week. When later 
pressed about some of his votes in 
Congress, he underlined the point 
that the Reagan era of the 1980's was 
a time "when we had huge budget 
deficits, no money and when we really had to be concerned about federal 
spending." 

<p> One can easily understand why 
Mr. Cheney might have worried 
about fiscal responsibility as a congressman in the deficit-ridden 1980's. 
But it's pretty hard to swallow his 
claim that such concerns were why 
he was one of only a handful of 
legislators to   oppose improving education opportunities for poor children.

<p>    In the early 80's, the Head Start 
program cost about $1 billion  a   year. 
That's small potatoes compared with 
Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax reduction 
act, which cost $870 billion over its 
first five years. Yet while Mr. Cheney says he saw the tiny Head Start 
program as unaffordable, he was 
able to put aside any fiscal doubts he 
may have harbored and enthusiastically support President Reagan's 
budget-busting tax plan. He voiced 
no objection to the measure's hundreds of billions of dollars in tax 
subsidies for oil companies, utilities, 
railroads and other corporate interests.

<p>    Mr. Cheney also happily voted for 
Mr. Reagan's big increases in defense spending,  which grew from 
$134 billion in 1980 to $273 billion by 
1986 --  almost a 50 percent increase 
adjusted for inflation.

<p>    The upshot of these Cheney-supported policies was to triple the 
budget deficit between 1980 and 1986, 
bringing it to its highest level as a 
share of the economy since the end of 
World War II. We've only recently 
climbed our way out of the enormous 
deficit hole that Mr. Cheney helped 
dig.

<p>    It wasn't blind loyalty to President 
Reagan that caused him to vote the 
way he did as a congressman. After 
all, Mr. Reagan supported the Head 
Start program. And in 1986, when Mr. 
Reagan pushed to undo some of the 
damage his earlier tax bills had 
wrought,  Mr. Cheney worked hard to 
try to defeat the president. In opposing the 1986 tax reform act, widely 
considered to be Mr. Reagan's finest 
accomplishment, Mr. Cheney once 
again allied himself with an array of 
special interests -- tax shelter promoters, oil and timber companies, 
tax-avoiding defense contractors and 
so on -- that  fought to defeat the 
reforms.

<p>    So, despite his revisionist concern 
about fiscal discipline in the 80's, Mr. 
Cheney's record shows that he is 
pretty much a big-deficit, tax-loophole-loving kind of guy. That, of 
course, makes him an ideal running 
mate for Gov. George W. Bush, 
whose $1.9 trillion upper-income tax 
cut plan would use up almost the 
entire projected non-Social Security 
surplus over the next decade -- even 
before Mr. Bush gets to his various 
expensive spending  plans, from the 
dubious missile defense system to 
the voter-friendly drug coverage for 
senior citizens. 

<p>    True, Mr. Bush  touts the fact that 
some of his   proposed tax cuts would 
go to low- and moderate-income 
working families. Never mind that 
only about 2 percent of those tax cuts 
are so targeted,   compared with 62 
percent of the  breaks that would go 
to the best-off tenth of all taxpayers. 
 

<p>  As Mr. Bush's running mate, 
Mr. Cheney seems to 
be trying to avoid the 
hardhearted image 
that voters might see 
in his congressional 
votes. But Newt Gingrich was right to 
note this week that when he and Mr. 
Cheney served  together in the House, 
"Cheney's voting record was slightly 
more conservative than mine." 

<p>  Or put another way, if the choice is 
between welfare for the rich and 
opportunities for the needy, Dick 
Cheney's record makes it pretty 
clear where he stands. By choosing 
him, Mr. Bush may have clarified his 
own stance as well.
