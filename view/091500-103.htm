On Tuesday, Vice President Al Gore described a television
advertisement that flashes the word "RATS" on screen for a split second
while discussing the Gore health plan as "a very disappointing
development."
<p>When questioned whether subliminal techniques had been used in this
advertisement, Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush stated that
he found these allegations "bizarre and weird."
<p>Bizarre and weird the whole situation surely was. But although most
commentators dismissed this as some sort of advertising frat joke gone
awry, few actually entertained the possibility that such a ploy, properly
used, could actually work. Americans are extraordinarily uncomfortable
with the possibility that others can influence their actions without
their knowledge; it brings to mind terms such as "brainwashing" or "mind
control."
<p>In an attempt to calm this national paranoia, pundits discussing this
advertisement have downplayed the possibility that manipulations outside
our conscious awareness can in any way affect our feelings or behavior.
Instead, they have focused on the questionable morality of using these
techniques.
<p>However, many of the "experts" we have heard on this issue are clearly
misinformed, as they quote outdated studies in an attempt to reassure an
edgy American public that no one can influence them without their
consent. They point to a famous hoax that took place in 1957, when James
Vicary claimed that he had increased moviegoers' consumption of Coca-Cola
and popcorn by flashing subconscious messages on the screen. Many experts
appear to stifle their laughter as they consider whether the dots on a
Ritz cracker in one famous advertisement actually spell out "sex," or
whether the design on the back of the old Camel cigarette packet was
actually a phallic symbol.
<p>Actually, while these urban legends are probably nothing more than
flights of fancy, research increasingly points to the fact that
subliminal messages, known as "primes," can and do affect us.
<p>Studies on subconscious racial attitudes have shown that subjects who
are primed with pictures of faces before participating in a competitive
game are rated as more hostile when the primes are of African American
faces rather than Caucasian ones. College students primed with words
associated with the elderly, such as "Florida," "Bingo" and "forgetful,"
walk more slowly than those in a control group.
<p>Subliminal messages also have been used to prime positive effects.
Students primed with the message "Mommy and I are one" before beginning
class performed better on their final exam than students in a control
group.
<p>These studies show that despite our discomfort with them, subliminal
primes can affect our behavior in powerful ways. If Bush's advertising
campaign managers were making a serious attempt to manipulate public
opinion, they somehow managed to bungle the media ploy. The amount of
time that "RATS" stayed on the screen was much too long for it to
function as a subliminal prime. At one-thirtieth of a second, it would
have had to be "masked" by another phrase or stimulus appearing
immediately afterward in order to remain undetected by the naked eye.
<p>It is hard to believe that the folks down in RNC headquarters would
not have had access to this research, had they wanted it. It's been
suggested that Alex Castellanos, who produced the commercial, planned it
as a (rather expensive) joke, never dreaming that, when properly
administered, such a device might very well affect voter opinion. Much of
the serious research in this area is still quite new. We are only at the
very beginning stages of understanding how subliminal activation works in
partnership with our conscious perceptions in helping to shape our
thoughts and actions.
<p>It would be a shame for the rats to chase us away from the stats we
need to understand these processes.
