MOST PROPONENTS of agricultural biotechnology assert that genetically 
modified crops are essential to feed the 840 million undernourished people 
in the world, and to reduce the poverty of the 1.3 billion people who live 
on less than $1 per day. They believe that the biorevolution can be 
harnessed to serve the food and nutritional needs of the world's poor. But 
will such potential benefits of genetically engineered food crops ever 
become practical enough to rid the world of hunger?
<P>  Pro-biotechnology scientists say that with new research methods, 
biotechnology can be used to develop new crop varieties that are drought 
tolerant, resistant to insects and weeds, able to fix nitrogen from the 
atmosphere and even increase the nutrient content in the edible portion of 
plants. Proponents say modern biotechnology offers enormous opportunities to 
poor farmers and low-income consumers in developing countries. 	 
</P>
<P> The first problem with that argument is that there is no relationship 
between the prevalence of hunger and a country's population. For every 
densely populated and hungry nation like Bangladesh, there is a sparsely 
populated (but also hungry) country like Brazil.	 
</P>
<P>  Even in the midst of superabundance in the United States, there are 
between 20 million and 30 million malnourished people. Thus, even though 
crop yields per acre improved dramatically between the late 1960s and the 
early 1990s, these advances in agriculture have only trimmed the ranks of 
the world's undernourished by 8 percent -- to 840 million from 920 million.	 
</P>
<P>  Poverty is the key reason why 840 million people do not have enough to 
eat. In the past 30 years, enough food was produced to feed everyone -- had 
it been more evenly distributed. Hunger is not a matter of agricultural 
limits, but a problem of masses of people not having access to food or the 
means to produce it.	 
</P>
<P>  Biotechnology proponents, however, argue that food production will not 
keep pace with the growth of the global population, which is expected to add 
73 million people every year from now until 2020. The biotechnology 
proponents say hunger will persist unless the potential of biotechnology is 
realized. I say, if the root causes are not addressed, hunger will persist 
no matter what agricultural technologies are used.	 
</P>
<P>  At most, biotechnology has the yet-unrealized potential to deal with the 
issues of quality and quantity of food but does not address distribution and 
access. Insisting on technological solutions to hunger ignores the 
tremendous complexity of the problem. It is too easy to fall into the 
``paradox of plenty'' -- more food accompanied by greater hunger. Any method 
of boosting food production that deepens inequality is bound to fail to 
reduce hunger.	 
</P>
<P>  This is particularly true for biotechnology, which is being promoted by 
private corporations to whom poor farmers (who produce most of the basic 
food crops in the developing world) do not represent an attractive market.	 
</P>
<P>  For example, the new strain of rice that is capable of producing 
provitamin A, which is being heralded as the best that agrobiotech can offer 
the developing world, constitutes a solution that ignores the root causes of 
why there are 2 million children at risk of vitamin A deficiency. In rural 
areas of the developing world, food preferences are culturally determined. 
Asians will not likely consume ``orange rice'' in the midst of abundant 
white rice.	 
</P>
<P>  In fact, Asian small farmers grow diverse rice varieties with varying 
nutritional content and adapted to a wide variety of environmental 
conditions. The resulting genetic diversity heightens resistance to plant 
diseases and enables farmers to derive multiple nutritional uses.	 
</P>
<P>  If, as expected, transgenic seeds continue to be developed and 
commercialized exclusively by private firms, poor farmers will continue to 
find them too expensive to purchase. The few that will have access to 
bioengineered seeds will be hurt by becoming dangerously ``dependent'' on 
the annual purchase of such seeds. Choices are surely also being denied to 
poor farmers when private industries insist upon protecting biotech patents 
that deny seed saving, an aspect that is of fundamental cultural importance 
to traditional farmers, who for centuries have saved and shared seeds.	 
</P>
<P>  Food production will have to come from agricultural systems in countries 
with the largest population growth. This poses a major challenge for 
biotechnology in these tropical countries where farmers are not only 
resource poor -- with no access to credit, technical assistance or markets 
</P>
<P>--but where about 370 million rural poor live in arid or semi-arid zones or 
in steeply sloped areas. In the past, such farmers were bypassed by advances 
in agriculture known as the Green Revolution because their soil, water and 
labor methods were unsuited to the demanding and costly management practices 
of improved seeds and accompanying need for pesticides and fertilizers. 
Biotechnology will exacerbate the problem even more. Some scientists and 
policymakers posit that a solution would be to increase government 
investments in biotechnology research.	 
However, larger investments may not yield the desired results. Corporate 
legal rights to biotechnology is affecting the development of transgenic 
crops by public institutions.	 
Moreover, the seed distribution channels and networks to reach farmers are 
being privatized, focusing on commercial farms rather than on poor farmers.	 
</P>
<P>Much of the needed food can be produced throughout the world by small farmers 
using agroecological technologies. In fact, new rural development approaches 
and simple technologies spearheaded by farmers groups and nongovernmental 
organizations around the developing world are already making a difference.	 
</P>
<P>These results are a breakthrough for achieving food security and 
environmental preservation in the developing world, but realizing their 
potential depends on investments, policies, institutional support and 
attitude changes on the part of policymakers and the international 
scientific community.	 
</P>
<P>Failure to promote such people-centered agricultural research and 
development will miss an historic opportunity to raise agricultural 
productivity in economically viable, environmentally benign and socially 
uplifting ways.
