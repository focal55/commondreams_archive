As the new millennium opens for real this time,
here are some New Year's resolutions for Congress that
would actually help the people of the United States and
the world:

<p>1.      Pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest
rates immediately, before it's too late, to
prevent a recession. The effect of the Fed's
last six unnecessary interest rate hikes seems
to have slowed the economy at a bad time,
with the bubble in tech stocks bursting.
Congress should lean on the Fed to undo its
damage before the economy really tanks and
millions of people are thrown out of work.

<p>2.      Leave Social Security alone. Social Security
can pay all promised benefits for 37 years if
left on automatic pilot. It will be fine
indefinitely beyond that, with only minor
additional revenues-- if any. The so-called
crisis of Social Security is a false alarm, like
the Y2K computer meltdown that never
happened. Time to bury this urban legend and
move on.

<p>3.      Provide universal national health insurance.
With 42 million Americans uninsured, it's
time we caught up with the rest of the
developed world and treated our citizens as
though their health mattered. Private health
insurance premiums are now rising at three
times the rate of inflation, and health care
reform is going to make an urgent comeback
soon. Democrats could carry this issue to
victory in 2002 if the Republicans won't co-
operate.

<p>4.      End the drug war and the incarceration
explosion: It's a national disgrace: two million
people behind bars, the highest rate of
imprisonment in the world, hundreds of
thousands in jail for non-violent drug offenses.
African Americans somehow end up with the
majority of all drug convictions, despite being
only about 15 percent of drug users nationally.
First step: provide drug treatment instead of
prison for all first-time non-violent drug
offenders, and repeal of federal mandatory
sentencing laws. Put an end to racial profiling
in drug arrests.

<p>5.      Equal protection in the ballot booth: State-of-
the-art voting machinery in every polling
place, regardless of voters' income. Enough
said.

<p>6.      Real campaign finance reform: A record three
billion dollars in 2000 got us the best elections
that money could buy. We could get much
closer to real democracy with full public
funding.

<p>7.      A tax cut for the people: Instead of yet another
windfall for the rich-- how about some relief
for those who gained little during the
economic boom but will certainly suffer the
brunt of the bust? Cut federal income taxes for
everyone below the median income, increase
the earned income tax credit for low-wage
workers, and raise the standard deduction.

<p>8.      Cancel the debt of the world's poorest
countries: Congress should demand that the
IMF and the World Bank cancel 100 percent
of the poor countries' debts, from these
institutions' own resources. There is no excuse
for forcing the poorest countries in Africa to
spend more on debt service than on health
care.

<p>9.      Leave Colombia to the Colombians: Our tax
dollars help finance the murder of thousands
of civilians in Colombia each year and the
creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees.
The blank check from Uncle Sam for the
Colombian government's military escalation is
prolonging the civil war there. It's time to pull
the plug.

<p>10.     New trade policy: Our old one hasn't worked--
it's given us a record trade deficit and stagnant
real wages for the majority of employees over
the last 27 years. First steps: scrap the Free
Trade Agreement of the Americas, a bigger
NAFTA in the making. And ban imports from
Burma, which employs forced labor under a
brutal dictatorship.
