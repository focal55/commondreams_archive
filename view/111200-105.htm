The establishment media is ignoring the growing opposition among 
Jews to what Barak (and his silent partner Sharon) are doing to the 
Palestinians. There have been a number of initiatives by Jews, in the United 
States, in France, in Israel, the United Kingdom, in Canada.
</font>

<P align=left></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(1) 
Internationally. A letter endorsed by over <STRONG>230 </STRONG>Jews 
called for the US Congress to suspend all foreign aid to Israel. About a quarter 
of the supporters are Israelis. Most are professional people including lawyers, 
professors, teachers, journalists and writers. Some of the more prominent 
signers include: Israeli/American lawyers Allegra Pacheco, Professors Cheryl 
Rubenberg, Yigal Arens, Daniel Boyarin, Mark Solomon, and Norman Finkelstein, 
Israeli journalist Tanya Reinhart, and Israeli anti-apartheid activist Jeff 
Halper. The text of the statement is as follows: "We Jews, citizens of the state 
of Israel and of other countries, are sickened that the Barak government would 
let the war criminal Ariel Sharon enter a Palestinian area and provoke terrible 
violence. Unfortunately this just illustrates the determination of the current 
Israeli government to keep Palestinians permanently separate, unequal, closed up 
in small territories, and exiled in foreign lands. We protest the ever 
escalating violence against Palestinians. We urge the US Congress to suspend all 
foreign aid to Israel." </font></P>
<P align=left></P>

</font></P>
<P align=justify><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(2)&nbsp;130 
French Jews published a statement in Le Monde. Among the 
better-known signers were Raymond Aubrac (World War II resistance fighter), 
Daniel Bensaïd (philosopher and political activist), Miguel Benassayag 
(psychoanalyst of Argentinian origin), Rony Brauman (former president of Doctors 
without Borders), Suzanne de Brunhoff (economist), Gisèle Halimi (feminist 
activist), Michaël Löwy (sociologist and intellectual historian), Maurice 
Rajsfus (author of several books on French and Mideast political history), 
Laurent Schwartz (mathematician), Daniel Singer (European editor of <I>The 
Nation</I>), Pierre Vidal-Naquet (renowned specialist of ancient Greece). Part 
of the statement reads:</font></P>
<P align=justify><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A possibly irreversible step has now been taken. The symbolic 
provocation by Ariel Sharon, by accentuating the religious character of the 
conflict at the expense of its political content, favors the rise of extremist 
religious forces and weakens supporters of peace and a secular Palestine and 
Israel. A race to disaster has begun. A civil war within Israel between Jews and 
Arabs is in the offing. </font></P>
<P align=justify><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not in spite of our Jewish origins but because of them, we 
oppose this suicidal logic based on identity-panic. We refuse the fatal spiral 
of ethnicization and confessionalization of the conflict. We support Judeo-Arab 
fraternity and call for a renewal of the peace process, which would require 
enforcement of the UN resolutions, the recognition of a Palestinian state and 
the right to return for Palestinians chased from their lands. Only in this way 
can the peaceful coexistence of different cultural and linguistic communities on 
a single territory can become a real possibility." </font></P>

website - <A

<P align=justify><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(3) In Israel 
there have been a stream of protest by Israeli Jews. Yom Kippur saw the first 
ever protest march in Israel. About 30 people held signs with slogans like: "Yom 
Kippur Protest March - Lives at Risk"; "Atonement"; "From the peace of the brave 
to a war of cowards"; "Barak and Ben-Ami are responsible for the pogrom"; 
"Barak+Sharon fail at peace" . People marched for three hours and were verbally 
harassed by police the whole way. </font></P>
<P align=justify><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the 15th a rally of 500 to 700 in Tel Aviv. There was 
another rally at the same time in Haifa. There were slogans calling for the 
Right of Return, against apartheid, against settlements, Stop the War, against 
Barak and the Labor government, end the bloodshed, yes to peace, peace or hell 
(it rhymes in Hebrew). People discussed forming teams that would go out into 
neighborhoods and serve as a Jewish buffer from attacks by Jewish mobs. The 
Alternative Information Center put "human rights patrol cars" on the streets a 
week later with large signs.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On October 21 Peace Now staged a demonstration of 500. . There were all 
manner of signs: "Kishinev 1903 - Nazareth 2000"; "Kristallnacht in Nazareth"; 
"Stop the Pogroms"; "Racist Police - Killer Policemen"; Rabbi Arik Asherman from 
Rabbis for Human Rights made a speech calling for exchanging the three Israeli 
soldiers for the Lebanese hostages held by Israel.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(4) In the United Kingdom 16 
Israeli Jews sent a letter to the media deploring "outrages" against the 
Palestinian population. They categorized relations in Israel/Palestine as 
"apartheid". The letter concluded:</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<i>"The Israeli barbaric response was 
not only confined to the Occupied
Territories, but was also directed against 
the Palestinian population within
Israel proper. The Israeli police 
participated or stood by as armed
Israelis went on the rampage. From Tel Aviv 
to Nazareth it was "open season"
on Palestinians. To-date, thirteen Israeli 
Palestinians were killed, among them, Asil Asalih, a Palestinian Israeli peace 
activist, who was murdered by Israeli police.</i></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>
The truth is now out and 
the Oslo sham cannot be resurrected. The imposition
of a peace unilaterally 
defined by Israel will not work: such a peace will
never hold. Only a genuine 
engagement with the Palestinians will end the
bloodshed. Israel must accept 
its obligations under international law, such
as the Fourth Geneva 
Convention, as well as UN resolutions and the immediate
and unconditional 
Israeli withdrawal from all the territories occupied 
in
1967."</i></font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(5) In Montreal, a group is 
forming called the Jewish Alliance Against the Occupation - JAAO. They are 
gathering signers for a statement entitled "Jews speak out against the 
Occupation". Organizers are: Robert Silverman, Scott Weinstein, and Abraham 
Weizfeld. Among signers are Noam Chomsky and Grace Paley. The statement reads in 
part: </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We who are Jewish must demand an end to the war on the Palestinians, a proper 
respect for the UN resolutions recognizing the rights of Palestinians, ending 
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, a guarantee for Palestinian 
self-determination, and the dismantlement of the Israel-style apartheid system. 
It is not in our interests that we continue enforcing unjust conditions that 
perpetuate resistance and bloodshed. Solidarity with the Palestinian people is 
also in effect -- solidarity with the Jewish people.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(6) In San Francisco a large 
group called "A Jewish Voice for Peace" called for an end to violence on both 
sides, but was especially critical of Israeli brutality. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Part of their statement reads: "We agree with the UN Security Council, 
Amnesty International, and the Israeli Human Rights Group B'Tselem that Israel 
has used excessive force against Palestinians. We deplore the Israeli use of 
snipers and the Israeli attacks on children, bystanders, unarmed persons, and 
rescuers. We are disgusted by reports that, of the more than 2000 Palestinians 
injured, 75% have been shot above the waist, and 40% have been shot in the head. 
We are angry that in disputes between Jewish aggressors and Arab victims, 
Israeli police and soldiers have reflexively sided with the Jews. And we are 
appalled that Israeli police and soldiers have killed Arabs for the same 
acts-such as blocking roads or throwing stones-that Jews are committing with 
impunity."
