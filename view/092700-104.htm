Columbia, SC -- Not since 1928 have the University of South Carolina and
Clemson University football teams gone 4-0 the same year.  The dramatic
turnaround from big losers to big winners for South Carolina's two major
universities saw South Carolina end a 21 game losing streak in their
season's opener and Clemson improve from a 3-9 record in 1998. Unlike the
all-white teams of 1928, African-Americans now comprise a vast majority of
their  rosters, and South Carolina and Clemson head coaches Lou Holtz and
Tommy Bowden have been working hard on team motivation. They have also
voiced concerns about the number of outstanding black players from South
Carolina high schools choosing to play at out-of-state universities.

<p>Seeds for such prodigious pigskin success were sown last April when South
Carolina and Clemson head coaches Lou Holtz and Tommy Bowden took a step for
racial justice by joining the "Get-In-Step" march from Charleston to
Columbia    The purpose of the march was to call for the removal of the
Confederate flag, the ultimate symbol of " The Lost Cause," from the
statehouse dome and the coaches' powerful statement of empathy for
African-Americans' history was clear. Their black players understand the
flag as a continuing symbol of racist oppression.

<p>A controversial Legislative "compromise" was reached this session to remove
the Confederate flag from the dome and the Legislative Chambers and place it
in front of the statehouse behind the Confederate Soldiers' monument.  To
protest the removal and the small step of progress for those who feel the
flag is a symbol of racism, barbecue baron Maurice Bessinger decided to
"further the cause of states rights, freedom of speech and Christianity"  by
removing his gigantic U. S. flag at his West Columbia headquarters and
replacing it with a Confederate and South Carolina state flag.  Bessinger
ordered the removal of Ol' Glory from his 8 Columbia area restaurants and
replaced it with the Rebel and State flags. 

<p>Reporters covering the story discovered that besides the barbecue Bessinger
sells tracts by ministers like "The Biblical View of Slavery." One excerpt
reads, "Many of those African slaves blessed the Lord for allowing them to
be enslaved and sent to America.  Because what they had over here was far
better than what the had over there."  Besides his drive-in and drive-thru
business, Bessinger delivers his barbecued pigs and chickens by air freight
all over the country and sells his famous Maurice's mustard based BBQ sauce
at major grocery chains.  

<p>Citing respect for the diversity of their customers and concern over the
racist literature Bessinger sells, seven grocery companies, including Bi-Lo,
Harris-Teeter, Food Lion, Kroger, Publix, Walmart Superstores, and Sam's
Club have announced the removal of  Bessinger's barbecue sauce from their
shelves.  Last Friday Bessinger said he could lose 40% of his business
because of the sauce removal.

<p>While grocery corporations and even nice Southern white folks who fight to
keep the Confederate flag flying on the statehouse grounds voice shock at
Bessinger's extremism and "Christian view" of slavery, Bessinger represents
the mainstream historical justification for slavery and continuing racism in
the South. Confederate President Jefferson Davis said, "We recognize the
negro--as God and God's Book and God's Laws, in nature, tell us to recognize
him-our inferior, fitted expressly for servitude...You cannot transform the
negro into one-tenth as useful or as good as what slavery enables them to
be."  

<p>In 1876, Wade Hampton, former Confederate General, South Carolina Governor
and then leader of the Red Shirts, told his quasi-terrorist group, "Treat
them(blacks) so as to show them you are the superior race, and that their
natural position is that of subordination to the white man."  South Carolina
State Senator John D. Long promised in 1944, "As for the Negro voting.....by
God, we'll fight him at the polls if I have to bite the dust as did my
ancestors." 

<p>In my 64 years of living in Alabama, Virginia, North Carolina and South
Carolina I've often heard that black folks are better off from being brought
here as slaves.  But, finally even barbecue barons are learning that the
Confederacy and the racism it epitomizes is a "Lost Cause."

<p>The winning gridiron heroics of Clemson and South Carolina, led by
African-American stars like Woody Dantzler and Derek Watson, have taken some
of the media attention away from the losing baron of barbecue.  At least for
now, Gamecock and Tiger flags are flying on some of the pickups and cars
where rebel flags once flew. 

<p><i>Tom Turnipseed, former President of the SC Trial Lawyers Association, is a
plaintiff's and civil rights attorney in Columbia, SC. He was co-counsel for
the Macedonia Baptist Church, an African American congregation in Clarendon
County, SC which won a $37,000,000.00 (Thirty Seven Million Dollar) verdict
in 1998 against the Ku Klux Klan for burning their church. A former SC State
Senator, he is active in state politics and has been the democratic nominee
for state Attorney General and Congress. Tom is President of the Center for
Democratic Renewal (formerly the Anti-Klan Network) a nationally recognized
civil rights organization based in Atlanta. In 1998, he received the
Holmes-Weatherly Award, the Unitarian-Universalist Association's highest
honor for the pursuit of social justice. For many years, Tom has spoken and
written on political and human rights. He has hosted radio and television
shows in Columbia, SC and recently appeared on PBS' American Experience in
"George Wallace: Settin' the Woods on Fire", April 23rd and 24th, 2000,
MSNBC's "Equal Time" with Oliver North and Paul Begala, February 18th, 2000,
C-SPAN's "Washington Journal" with Brian Lamb, January 14th, 2000 and Fox
Family Network's series "Courage", September 11, 2000. His work has been
published in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Atlanta
Constitution, The Charlotte Observer and other papers. </i>
