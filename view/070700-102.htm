To fix a baseball game, it helps to have the pitcher lob tosses that a hitter couldn't miss. To rig a football game, you might tip the defense that every running play would go inside left tackle.
<P>

   In sports, chicanery brings the wrath of district attorneys and howls from Las Vegas bookies. But in the surreal world of anti-missile defense -- with its big corporate bucks and political pressure -- a fixed game rates a shrug. It doesn't seem to bother anyone that today's ballyhooed flight test of a prototype missile interceptor over the Pacific Ocean is semiphony. 
<P>

   A flash of light and a direct hit will signal Bill Clinton to start moving dirt for a $60 billion missile shield in the remote Aleutian Islands. Fair enough -- if the test weren't as rigged as the 1919 ``Black Sox'' World Series.
<P>

   In real life, a nuclear ICBM attack might strike with dozens of warheads surrounded by decoys, giving defenders seconds to sort out the chaos. The test, however, has been dumbed down like a tee-ball for Little Leaguers.
<P>

   Let's see, a slowed-down, 37-year-old Minuteman II missile will fly a familiar route from California to the Kwajalein atoll. According to chief tester Philip Coyle, the intercept crew will know exactly the ``timing, direction and countermeasures.'' They'll even hear a countdown of the launch. And a radar beacon will be attached to the Minuteman. I guess they couldn't hang a red lantern around the target.
<P>

   In truth, most anti-missile tests are highly suspect. Back in the '80s, the Pentagon even had a bomb to blowup the target vehicle in case of a miss.
<P>

   The bigger truth is that success or failure in the ``Potemkin'' test will be a meaningless sham. If the defense blows it, there'll be 16 more tests at $100 million a shot. Nothing will stop what I'd call the ``Grandson of Star Wars.''
<P>

   Since Ronald Reagan's dreamy March 23, 1983, speech -- ``I call upon the scientific community to render these weapons impotent and obsolete'' -- Washington junkies have been hooked on Star Wars illusions. I heard Edward Teller, the Dr. Strangelovian father of the H-bomb, expound his nutty idea for a nuclear explosion in space to trigger a laser beam. I was once numbed by ex-Lt. Gen. Daniel Graham bloviating about Brilliant Pebbles -- hundreds of tiny interceptors floating in space like ping-pong balls. Reality never dampens fantasies.
<P>

   In her superb new book, Out There in The Blue -- Reagan, Star Wars and the End of the Cold War, Frances FitzGerald marvels at the unkillable anti-missile mojo: ``The persistence of the push for deployment was phenomenal. It survived declining defense budgets. It survived a fall-off of public interest so complete newspaper readers thought the program died. It survived the collapse of the Soviet Union.''
<P>

   What in 2000 keeps Grandson of Star Wars thriving? Well, politics surely. Newt Gingrich's Contract for America pushed missile defense. So Clinton and now Al Gore don't want to look soft on defense. George W. Bush has upped the ante to build a system that ``defends 50 states, our allies and our forces overseas.''
<P>

   Don't underestimate the lobbying muscle of defense contractors Boeing, Raytheon, TRW and Lockheed Martin, who love those multimillion contracts. Don't discount the hard-right think tanks.
<P>

    But if Clinton gives a ``limited green light'' to start building the Aleutian Island site, say goodbye to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty with Russia. Do Star Wars backers doubt that China, which supposedly has stolen U.S. high-tech magic, could build hundreds of missiles to overwhelm the system? 
<P>

   In the vicious circle, offense wins.
<P>

   More mystery: Grandson of Star Wars roars ahead with zero focus by public or Congress. ``There's no real debate,'' Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., says. ``Eighty percent of my colleagues are not paying attention.''
<P>

   It's a wasteland. Folly keeps repeating. Gentleman, start your rigged test countdown .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For ``Grandson of Star Wars,'' the fix is in.
