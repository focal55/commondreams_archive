<p>In the battle over whether 
to include prescription drugs under Medicare, some have questioned 
whether taxpayers can afford the price. But the real opposition 
to Medicare drug coverage comes from those who fear it would 
cost too little: the pharmaceutical companies. They are fighting 
this coverage because they fear that Uncle Sam would negotiate 
to buy medicines at a much lower price.	 
<P> Consider this:	 
</P><P> --  We spend nearly twice as much of our national income as 
other developed countries on health care, yet still have 44 
million people without health insurance.	 
</P><P> --  Half of all 
U.S. health care spending is paid for through government spending 
</P><P>-- either federal, state or local.	 
</P><P>-- Seniors who lack 
prescription drug coverage because they rely solely on Medicare 
and cannot afford Medigap or other complementary insurance -- 
</P><P>about a third of the elderly population --  are being gouged 
for their medicines. A recent congressional study found that 
they paid more than twice as much for the most common prescription 
drugs as the drug companies' most favored customers, such as 
HMOs. For example, a senior without prescription drug coverage 
would pay on average $188.96 per prescription for Norvasc, a 
high-blood pressure medication. The cost to a preferred customer 
would be $59.71.	 
</P><P> The elderly generally are not well off, 
so it is not surprising to find surveys that show as many as 
5 million senior citizens choosing between prescription medicines 
and food.	 
</P><P> Last June, President Clinton proposed adding 
very limited prescription drug coverage to Medicare, the government's 
health insurance program for senior citizens and the disabled.	 
</P><P> The pharmaceutical companies, whose rate of profit is more 
than three times the average of other corporations, have been 
using their enormous clout to block the plan, saying the industry 
could only accept it as part of a comprehensive plan to redesign 
the entire Medicare program. 	 
</P><P> To many people, it may not 
seem obvious why these corporate giants would care whether Medicare 
provides prescription drug coverage. But there is an important 
principle at stake: The drug companies don't want the government 
buying these medicines in bulk, and thereby negotiating for 
a lower price.	 
</P><P> In response to Clinton's proposal for limited 
Medicare drug coverage, the industry spent millions on tacky, 
misleading TV commercials. ``Flo,'' the arthritic Medicare beneficiary 
featured in these ads, predictably tells viewers that she doesn't 
want ``big government in my medicine cabinet.''	 
</P><P> Until a 
couple of weeks ago, the drug industry insisted that it would 
only allow Medicare to cover prescription drugs if these were 
provided through HMOs or other private plans. About 16 percent 
of Medicare beneficiaries are currently enrolled in such plans.	 
</P><P> Clinton hit back with a few jabs of his own, and then, according 
to the New York Times, Gordon M. Binder, chairman of Amgen and 
spokesman for the pharmaceutical industry, said that the government 
could make money available to private entities --  insurance 
companies and pharmaceutical benefit managers --  who could 
buy drugs and negotiate discounts on behalf of people who are 
covered by the regular fee-for-service Medicare program.	 
</P><P> This takes some nerve. Who elected these people, anyway? It's 
a little disturbing, to see them telling the president what 
he can and can't propose to ease the burden of health care spending 
on the elderly.	 
</P><P> Unfortunately, Clinton's plan does not 
provide much inspiration for people to rally around. Beginning 
in 2002, seniors who opt to pay $288 per year would get a benefit 
that would cover half of their prescription drug costs, but 
only costs of up to $1,000 a year (that is, a maximum benefit 
of $500).	 
</P><P> Some of the poorest beneficiaries --  about a 
fourth --  would get a waiver for either the premiums, co-payments 
or both. But the rest would not, and many seniors would probably 
not enroll in such a plan. In 2008, the coverage would go up 
to $5,000 (maximum benefit of $2,500), with the premium increasing 
to $528 per year.	 
</P><P> But even this limited coverage is much 
less than it appears --  more than half of the $5,000 benefit 
would be eaten away by projected increases in the price of prescription 
drugs. This is why any plan to include prescription drugs under 
Medicare needs to also include a plan for controlling prices. 
A logical step for this would be to use the government's buying 
power to bargain for lower prices.	 
</P><P> The Clinton plan stops 
short of this, but a reform bill currently before Congress would 
do it. The Prescription Drug Fairness Act for Seniors, sponsored 
by Reps. Tom Allen, D-Maine, and Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, 
has 138 co-sponsors in the House. But the drug companies are 
even more determined to kill this proposal in the cradle.	 
</P><P> Documents leaked from a recent strategy meeting of PhRMA (the 
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of America --  annual budget: $52 
million) reveal a packed calendar of grassroots lobbying campaigns 
and state media tours, as well as a slew of studies by industry-sponsored 
think tanks. Interestingly, this planning --  which included 
efforts to kill the Clinton proposal --  took place less than 
a week after industry spokesmen announced that they wanted a 
truce with the Clinton administration in the war over drug prices.	 
</P><P> The standard argument of PhRMA is that they need their monopoly 
profits in order to fund all the research and development that 
brings us new medicines. But this just raises more important 
questions about the whole process of funding medical research.	 
</P><P> From a strictly economic perspective, granting monopolies 
to patent-holders is not necessarily an efficient means of funding 
research and development. Unregulated monopolies are inefficient, 
leading to higher prices and less availability than would be 
best for society.	 
</P><P> That's one of the reasons our government 
allocates tens of billions of dollars each year to medical research. 
In fact, about three-quarters of cancer drugs were discovered 
with the help of government grants. But the drug companies still 
seem to end up with the patents --  and the ability to charge 
exorbitant prices.	 
</P><P> So American consumers are doubly exploited: 
First we get to subsidize, with our tax dollars, the research 
that creates the drugs. Then we get to pay the highest prices 
in the world --  twice what Canadians or Europeans pay. Yet 
we are not allowed to import these drugs from countries, such 
as Canada or Great Britain, where they are sold at a much cheaper 
price. (It seems that the principle of free trade is not sacrosanct 
after all).	 
</P><P> But it's even worse than that: The monopoly 
profits of the drug companies then cycle back to fund everything 
that keeps the system in place: lobbying ($148 million over 
the last two years), election campaign contributions and PhRMA. 
Not to mention the $8,000 to $13,000 per doctor that the industry 
spends each year peddling its wares, buying gifts and paying 
for travel and other favors in order to influence their choices.	 
</P><P> The other major obstacle to overall reform is the only industry 
that spends more on lobbying than the drug industry: insurance. 
Until we break the stranglehold these corporations now hold 
on public policy, the health care reform we need will remain 
out of reach.
