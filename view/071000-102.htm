Those inclined to tout the potential 
benefits of global warming would do 
well to take a look at the news items 
about the frightening weather in 
southern Europe last week.

<p> All week there were stories about 
the extreme heat and the raging wildfires it triggered. Temperatures 
reached as high as 120 degrees and 
dozens of people died. In some places 
the problems were worsened by 
drought. According to The Associated 
Press, "The sizzling weather accompanied the worst drought to strike the 
Balkans in 50 years, which has already caused record crop losses 
since it began in late May."

<p> Ambulances patrolled streets in 
southern Romania to pick up some of 
the many individuals who fainted in 
temperatures that were well over 100 
degrees. Soldiers were deployed in 
western Bulgaria to fight a major 
forest fire. At least 10 people were 
reported dead from the heat in Turkey. Intense fires raged on a number 
of islands in the Aegean. And wildfires in Italy consumed hundreds of 
acres of forest in the southern Gargano region.

<p> No single weather event can be 
attributed to global warming. But 
this is the kind of terrible weather 
that scientists have long predicted 
would accompany the warming of the 
planet. That warming is not only well 
under way, it is accelerating.

<p> There will be some benefits for 
some people from global warming. A 
study commissioned by the federal 
government said, for example, that 
the U.S. could see increased crop 
yields in some parts of the country 
and that they could lead to falling 
food prices. But that modest benefit 
would almost certainly be overwhelmed by the potentially devastating aspects of the warming that will 
occur here and around the world if 
nothing substantial is done about the 
buildup in the earth's atmosphere of 
heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide.

<p> That same federal study, released 
just last month, warned of destructive storm surges, chronic erosion of 
the U.S. coastline, extreme water 
shortages in some places, and frequent and severe flooding in others. 
The authors of the study said it is 
very probable that continued thawing 
of the permafrost and melting sea ice 
in Alaska would cause continued severe damage to its forests, buildings, 
roads and coastlines.

<p> A word of caution is in order for 
anyone who thinks global warming is 
a good thing: be careful what you 
wish for.

<p> "People who argue that global 
warming will be beneficial are missing two central points," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist of 
Environmental Defense, a national 
research and advocacy organization. 
"First, until the greenhouse gases 
are brought under control, the climate is going to continue to warm, so 
you're never going to be at your 
optimum climate for very long. If the 
balance of milder winters versus hotter summers is struck in a direction 
that's favorable to somebody at some 
particular time -- well, just wait. The 
benefits will be ephemeral because 
it's going to get warmer. In that 
situation, today's winners are very 
likely to be tomorrow's losers, which 
means nobody wins over the long 
term."

<p> The second point, said Dr. Oppenheimer, is the more important one. 
"Global warming is a problem that 
cannot be looked at from the point of 
view of a few individuals in a few 
isolated places. We are now one globalized world. If the climate in general 
is hurting large swatches of humanity, there is no way any particular 
group that thinks it's benefiting can 
escape from what is happening in the 
world as a whole. We are too interconnected for that.

<p> "For example, it's been projected 
that declines in agriculture, particularly in low-latitude areas, could create large masses of environmental 
refugees. The rest of the world will be 
affected by those movements of human populations.

<p> "The same thing can happen as a 
result of sea-level rise. Bangladesh is 
having terrible problems in this area. 
It has a population of about 120 million in an area the size of Wisconsin, 
and there is already border tension 
between Bangladesh and India. A significant chunk of Bangladesh is projected to go underwater in the next 
100 years. Where are those people 
going to go? There's no room left."

<p> It is possible -- not easy, but possible --  to mount an international effort 
to cut the emissions of greenhouse 
gases to an extent that would ward 
off a global catastrophe. It's possible. 
But there is not a lot of time left.
