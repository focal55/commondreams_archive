Establishment lefties are saying that Arianna Huffington has changed her 

tune. In her seventh book, How to Overthrow the Government‚ she endorses 

direct action, third parties, media boycotts and campaign finance reform. Has 

this former Gingrich girl turned into a progressive populist?

<p>The  Nation trio of Micah Sifry, Marc Cooper and David Corn thinks so. She 

has had a change of heart, they say, and she’s putting her money where her 

mouth is. Indeed, she’s wild for Public Campaign, the campaign finance reform 

group where Sifry is a senior analyst. She gave Cooper free copies of her 

book, which he promoted to entice contributions to his radio show on Pacifica 

in Los Angeles. She even invited her well-connected crowd to a Washington 

party promoting Corn’s political thriller, Deep Background. “She got a 

physical distance from the Republican crowd‚” Corn told the New York 

Observer’s Joe Conason.

<p>Responding to complaints from his colleague Katha Pollitt, Corn moaned, “Some 

lefties, alas would rather have targets than allies, maintain enemies rather 

than welcome converts.”

<p>I guess I’m one of those lefties, too. Try as I might to catch Huffington’s 

new tune, all I hear is a familiar drone.

<p>To recap: Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington—born in Athens, transplanted to 

London—first made waves attacking feminism. The Female Woman was commissioned 

by the publisher of Germaine Greer’s Female Eunuch as a conservative 

counteroffensive (which it was).

 <p>She stayed in the spotlight through the men in her life: Her dates have 

included est founder Werner Erhard, media magnate Mort Zuckerman, former 

California Gov. Jerry Brown and, of course, her ex-husband Michael 

Huffington, heir to the Huffco oil fortune. It is kind to attribute such 

liaisons to strategic rather than erotic choice. (She was divorced in 1997, 

and her ex-husband later came out in the pages of Esquire.)

<p>In 1994, after Michael’s failed Senate race, Arianna relaunched herself. 

Huffington won conservative influence in the capital and helped advance the 

Beltway career of Marvin Olasky, whose Tragedy of American Compassion 

inspired Newt Gingrich’s Contract with America.

<p>Huffington’s 1994 book‚ The Fourth Instinct is full of what Gingrich and 

Olasky were full of: pushing charities, not government, as the poor’s 

salvation. With Olasky, Huffington founded the Center for Effective 

Compassion, an innocuous-sounding conduit for right-wing dollars to reach 

strategic conservative causes like the Center for New Black Leadership 

(CNBL), a kind of media platform for conservative Blacks like Alan Keyes and 

Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Okla.) 

<p>Huffington now seems to have jumped ship. But her “transformation” is 

questionable. She’s still a conservative activist. She’s a pal of David 

Horowitz, whose magazine Heterodoxy has been a longtime outlet for her 

writing. Again this fall, she will address Horowitz’s “The Weekend” retreat. 

She’s still on the boards of CNBL and Hollywood Concerned—a group, founded by 

Watts among others, that supports “tax incentives for inner-city renewal” 

(that’s corporate tax breaks) and vouchers to help a handful opt out of bad 

public schools.

<p>Huffington’s also a borrower. In Overthrow it’s as if she trawled 

left-of-center Web sites and reprinted long tracts of research by the Center 

for Public Integrity, Public Campaign and the Sentencing Project to make her 

case that change is due. The “action directory‚” of groups in her book lists 

some progressive think tanks, but the “activist” groups she endorses are 

conservative, engaging in spiritual renewal, mentoring and charitable giving.<p>

Huffington’s plan? Bring “government dollars” together with “individual 

engagement.” She’s pretty specific about the individual—give to good causes, 

volunteer—but she barely touches government. There’s no talk here about 

workers rights, affirmative action, health care, income supports or, heaven 

forbid, income taxes. It’s like her “answer” to corruption in media: not 

restrictions on corporate dominance, but “civic journalism” (i.e. listing 

worthy organizations in newspapers).

<p>Huffington rails against “false speech,” but it was she who floated the 

allegation that former U.S. Ambassador Larry Lawrence was buried in Arlington 

because President Clinton slept with his wife (who sued her). She accused the 

author of a critical book about the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness 

cult she had belonged to of being a pedophile (he sued, too). Campaign 

manager Ed Rollins reports that during her husband’s 1994 Senate race, 

Arianna deployed private investigators to dig up dirt on opponent Dianne 

Feinstein, as well as a journalist writing for Vanity Fair.

<p>With her access to the media, Huffington is putting arguments for change out 

there. That’s good. But there’s a danger, too. Pro-status quo media are 

always looking to pad their center-right debates with acceptable alternatives 

to real progressives. Who is more acceptable than a conservative with lefty 

support like Huffington? Salon recently launched its campaign 2000 Web site 

with a banner ad that promised such a debate: Horowitz vs. Huffington.

Like that other Greek high-flier Icarus, Arianna too will fall from grace.
