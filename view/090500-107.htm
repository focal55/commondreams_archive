<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Here on Cape Cod, Labor Day means the end of the official summer tourist season. It also means that a round-trip to the "corner" store can be made in less than an hour.
<p>
For many, Labor Day is a day of rest, or at least a day off from work. (Me and my lady went to see the Red Sox play at Fenway yesterday. You know what they say about all work and no play).
<p>
Like many red-blooded Americans, I spent a little time over the weekend thinking about labor <IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>history. It wasn't long before I grabbed a book out of my stacks - "The Lexicon of Labor" by R. Emmett Murray. Brother Murray gave me a signed copy of his book after a talk I gave out in Wenatchee, Wash., last year. 
<p>
The book - with 500 key terms, biographical sketches and historical insights about labor in America - is intellectual medicine for the epidemic of historical amnesia that seems to flare up at this time every year.
<p>
Take the eight-hour day, for example. The Lexicon reminds us that the eight-hour day has been "a goal of the American labor movement ever since 1836. It is based on a holistic post-Enlightenment ideal that a man's day should be divided into three equal parts: eight hours for work, eight for sleep, and eight for recreation, leisure and family matters." 
<p>
Even though many of us take it for granted now, these (and other) improvements to life on the job had nothing to do with the benevolence of Big Business or enlightened entrepreneurs. It had everything to do with the struggle and sacrifice of organized activists - an important thing to remember, especially in a culture that clings to a harmful myth of rugged individualism; an ideological blinder masking the reality that individual initiative and collective action go hand in hand.
<p>
Intertwined in the story of labor and upward social mobility in America is the explosive issue of race. Whenever I write a column about economic injustice, I get a handful of letters and emails whose message is some variation on the following theme: "My forbears were immigrants to this country. They faced discrimination and made it. Why can't blacks?"
<p>
Frederick Douglass, the famous freed slave who went on to become one of America's distinguished champions of liberty, shines a light on this recurring question. He understood and empathized with the plight of immigrants, especially Irish immigrants, after having visited Ireland in the 1840s where he witnessed, first-hand, British oppression of the Irish.
<p>
Many, if not most, in Ireland considered themselves as "slaves" of the British and supported the abolition of slavery in America. In 1842, thousands in Ireland signed a petition and sent it to America, declaring: "Irishmen and Irishwomen! Treat the colored people as your equals, as brethren."
<p>
But white supremacy proved to be a formidable barrier to that message of solidarity. Faced with economic hardship and prejudice in America, Irish discontent was vented not insignificantly toward blacks. Douglass lamented that Irish Americans had, by and large, abandoned the idea of liberty they cherished in Ireland, becoming "the oppressors of another race" in America.
<p>
Even the noted Irish freedom-fighter Daniel O'Connell was appalled, declaring to his countrymen that "It was not in Ireland you learned this cruelty."
<p>
Between 1815 and 1845, the one million Irish who came to America began to displace black laborers - hackney coachmen, draymen and stevedores, according to the noted U.Cal.-Berkeley historian Ronald Takaki.
<p>
"Targets of nativist hatred toward them as outsiders, they (the Irish) sought to become insiders, or Americans, by claiming their membership as whites. A powerful way to transform their own identity from 'Irish' to 'American' was to attack blacks. Thus, blacks as the 'other' served to facilitate the assimilation of Irish foreigners," Takaki points out, giving just one infamous example of an Irish-led riot against black workers, their homes and orphanages in New York City in 1863.
<p>
The rioters warned employers "not to put any niggers to work," condemning abolitionism as "Niggerology," Takaki elaborates.
<p>
On the "liberal" side, an Irish newspaper, the Metropolitan Record, suggested that "a superior race should disdain to vent their passions on an inferior one."
<p>
Imagine how different black history would have been if blacks - the only non-Indian, non-immigrant population in America - didn't have to spend so much time and energy defending themselves against the attacks of immigrants. Imagine if workers of all colors had come together at the start of the Industrial Revolution.
<p>
It's not too late. Inter-racial organizing and collective action is a formidable weapon in the fight to make working life better.
