When President Clinton announced his trip to
Colombia, he said his purpose was "to seek peace, to fight
illicit drugs, to build its economy, and to deepen democracy."

<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.

<p>The Clinton administration seeks not peace but rather a
military solution to the 40-year old civil war in Colombia.
About three-quarters of its record-breaking aid package to
Colombia is for the military and police. Like Presidents
Kennedy and Johnson in Vietnam, Mr. Clinton is convinced
that superior firepower can destroy a deeply entrenched, armed
insurgency.

<p>If this requires the continuing murder of 3000 civilians
each year, or creating 300,000 refugees annually, that is a price
that Mr. Clinton is willing to pay.

<p>The term "human rights abuse" is a euphemism-- let's
be honest about what our tax dollars are paying for in
Colombia. "They drank and danced and cheered as they
butchered us like hogs," reports a survivor of a recent massacre
described in the New York Times. He was describing the
slaughter of 36 people in the town of El Salado, by 300
paramilitary troops in February. The troops began bringing
their victims to the town square on a Friday, and according to
the Times, "ordered liquor and music, and then embarked on a
calculated rampage of torture, rape and killing" that lasted until
Sunday. The victims included a 6-year old girl and an elderly
woman.

<p>The Colombian army stood by a few miles away,
setting up roadblocks that prevented human rights and rescue
workers from trying to help the villagers.

<p>Last month another mass killing of six people took
place in northwest Colombia while an army helicopter hovered
overhead and soldiers were on patrol nearby.

<p>Nonetheless, President Clinton has now waived most of
the human rights conditions that Congress attached to his
military aid package, making it clear that these types of
massacres would not affect US policy.

<p>This war is not about "illicit drugs," and it never has
been. According to our own Drug Enforcement Agency, there
is drug-related corruption in all branches of the Colombian
government, including its armed forces, which are now the
third largest recipient of US military aid in the world (after
Israel and Egypt). The paramilitary death squads, which are
closely linked to the Colombian military and-- according to
human rights groups-- responsible for the vast majority of
political murders, are up to their necks in drug trafficking.
Their leader recently admitted in a TV interview that 70
percent of their funding was from the drug trade. But our tax
dollars will not be used to go after them.

<p>Our money for Colombia will not help "build its
economy," which is suffering through its worst recession in
more than half a century. More than a fifth of the labor force is
unemployed, and millions of peasants have no marketable
alternatives to growing coca if they are to survive. Poisoning
their land, rivers and other crops with aerial spraying of
herbicides only adds further injury and more recruits for the
armed conflict.

<p>The same is true for the budget austerity ordered by the
International Monetary Fund: with Washington's backing, these
policies are likely to worsen the recession and increase
unemployment in Colombia.

<p>Widening the war will not "deepen democracy," but
will further destroy what little is left of it. By giving the
Colombian government and armed forces another enormous
blank check, the Clinton administration simply encourages
more massacres as well as impunity for the perpetrators. There
is no reason for Colombian officials to make the necessary
concessions to negotiate an end to the conflict if they know
they have unlimited support for war, including massacres of
civilians.

<p>The guerrilla groups are understandably wary of a
situation in which they have no guarantees that they or their
supporters could survive without their own armed forces. Their
last attempt, in the mid-eighties, to put down their arms and
participate in elections was met with the slaughter of thousands
of their supporters as well as candidates.

<p>Meanwhile, 37 human rights and other non-
governmental organizations in Colombia have stated that they
will not accept any funds from "Plan Colombia," the program
that our massive aid package-- $1.3 billion, with $860 million
for Colombia-- is partially funding. And neighboring states--
including Ecuador and Peru-- are beginning to worry that
continued escalation of the war will spill over into their
territories.

<p>We can only hope that the backlash against the
Administration's pursuit of a violent solution to Colombia's
civil war will continue to grow. When Colombia's fate is left to
the Colombians, then there will be a chance "to seek peace,
build the economy, and deepen democracy."
