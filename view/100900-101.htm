Anyone who points these days to the very large income gaps in the
United States risks being tarred as a proponent of class warfare. Such
gaps not only exist, they are continuing to widen. Startling new data
from the Internal Revenue Service show that in recent years, average
after-tax income rose nine times faster for those at the very top of the
income spectrum than for most other Americans.
<p>The IRS data indicate that the average after-tax income of the top 1%
of tax filers jumped $121,000, or 31%, just between 1995 and 1997, after
adjusting for inflation. That compares to an increase of 3.4% in the
average after-tax income of the bottom 90% of tax filers. Indeed, the
$121,000 average income gain enjoyed by the top 1% of tax filers during
this period was several times the total income of the typical
middle-class household.
<p>Since 1997, the incomes of virtually all groups have been improving.
The preliminary IRS data available for the period since 1997 suggest,
however, that income gains for those at the top of the income spectrum
have continued to outstrip income gains for other Americans. These data
indicate that capital gains income rose approximately 20% just between
1997 and 1998 and that 72% of all capital gains income in 1998 went to
tax filers with incomes exceeding $200,000. This virtually assures that
income disparities widened further in 1998. (The data on after-tax income
subtracts income taxes, but not other taxes.)
<p>These recent developments are part of a longer-term pattern.
Comprehensive information on after-tax income that the Congressional
Budget Office has compiled for the period from 1977 to 1995 shows
dramatic increases in income gaps. During this period, average after-tax
income dropped for the bottom two-fifths of the population, was stagnant
for the middle fifth and rose for the upper 40%, including an increase of
27% for the top fifth. Meanwhile, the average after-tax income of the top
1% of the population soared by 87%.
<p>The new IRS data, which take up where the CBO data leave off (since
the CBO data currently extend only through 1995), deserve especially
close scrutiny. Some recent assessments of income trends that are based
on Census Bureau data have suggested income disparities might have
stopped growing in recent years. But as researchers have long noted,
census data are inadequate for measuring gains at the top of the income
spectrum and consequently provide an inadequate assessment of income
disparities. For example, the standard census data do not include capital
gains income, thereby missing $426 billion in income in 1998.
<p>Recognizing the limitations of its data, the Census Bureau does not
publish income information for the top 1% of the population. The IRS data
are the sole reliable source of data on the incomes of these individuals.
<p>Should we care that income inequality is at an exceptionally wide
level? Should we care that just the gains in the average incomes of the
top 1% between 1995 and 1997 far exceeded the total incomes of the
typical family? Since most families are now better off than they were a
couple of years ago, are such observations merely incendiary?
<p>These observations do matter. Among other reasons, they provide a
context for some key governmental decisions, chief among which are
decisions about how to use the federal budget surplus.
<p>Although the surplus realistically available for program initiatives
and tax cuts is significantly smaller than many realize, substantial
resources are available. We have a historic opportunity to address some
of the nation's highest priority needs. Before deciding how to take
advantage of this opportunity, policymakers and the public need to debate
what our most pressing priorities are and which groups of Americans
should benefit.
<p>So far, such a debate has not occurred. Instead, Congress has charged
ahead with efforts to advance tax cuts that would largely benefit very
high-income taxpayers whose incomes are climbing much faster than
everyone else's. While it now appears that major tax cuts will not be
signed into law this year, tax cut proposals are sure to surface again
next year, regardless of the election's outcome.
<p>The new data on burgeoning income disparities suggest that a wiser
course would be measures such as extending health insurance to a sizable
number of the 44 million uninsured, providing an adequate Medicare
prescription drug benefit, strengthening efforts to combat child poverty
(which is higher in the United States than in most other Western nations)
and providing more modest tax reductions targeted primarily to low- and
middle-income working families. Such families, whose income gains in
recent years have been much smaller than those of the wealthiest
families, deserve to be our highest priority.
