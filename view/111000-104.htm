America's election result is no surprise. If two centrist parties compete for the same small group of independent voters, they are likely to split the result down the middle. That cursed arithmetic confronts Tony Blair as well and any other social democratic leader seeking to move toward the centre. 
<P>The American Democratic party began its trek rightward nearly 20 years back, convinced that "old democrats" - ecologists, believers in a strong welfare state, the young would remain, if unhappily, in the party. Elections would be won by capturing the affections of suburban "soccer moms", young professionals, and other voters with no strong political sentiments and so likely to vote either way.  
<P>For a while this strategy   seemed to work. Bill Clinton's amazing personal gifts made it happen. Indeed, the greater his troubles, the greater his hold over the imaginations of just these voters. For better or worse, Al Gore lacked Clinton's charisma; his only assets are his integrity and his competence. Absent a candidate who could arouse the emotions of "swing" voters, the raw arithmetic of splitting the middle has asserted itself.  
<P>Rightwing pundits such as William Kristol have long understood that this strategy could hold a political party hostage to a relatively small group of confused or indifferent voters in the centre. But the leaders of the republican revolution in the 1990s misread the American public. While we tend to hate government bureaucracy, Americans want the fruits of government: good schools, adequate pensions, a well regulated environment. The opportunities for the Democratic party lie just there, in making the government work better.  
<P>The current leadership of the Democrats has failed to respond to that desire. In the election, the New Democrats made two strategic errors. The first was obvious: they treated the Green party and its leader Ralph Nader as traitors. Rather than ask what had driven the Greens out, the New Democrats tried to tame them through guilt; a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush. Which was not news to the Greens. The guilt-trip failed, the demand for better government persisted - on Green terms - and this fringe group received an unprecedented 3% of the vote, making the contest for the centre all the more fraught.  
<P>The second error was more important and more subtle.   Only about half the American electorate votes; this past week the number is about 51%. A big slice of the non-voters consists of people who are apathetic, but another big slice comes from those for whom not voting is a political statement of sorts. They are "rejectionists," and most of them are young.  
<P> Young Americans who won't vote are your nice nephew or niece who believes the political system is corrupt. They aren't social isolates; many believe in, and many practice, volunteer work, which is their version of self-government. When I taught in America, I encountered them again and again - good citizens for whom politics has little to do with real life.  
<P>The New Democrats have largely ignored this pool of   young people. The effort to capture the middle ground instead sent politicians in pursuit of the middle aged. On the campaign trail Gore seemed baffled when asked about policies aimed at young people, and he retreated into banalities. The failure to connect particularly lost him young male voters, aged 18 to 30, perhaps the most disaffected group in the American political spectrum.  
<P>However the final result turns out, the Democratic party has set its own course   to become ever more fragile, ever more at the mercy of a relatively small group of the middle class, the middle aged and the muddled, ignoring in the process the aspiration for good governance which broadly marks the American public. Why, then, has New Labour in Britain, or the "New Middle" tendency in Germany, sought to follow in the path of the New Democrats in America, in obsessing about this unreliable middle?  
<P>The answer lies again in maths. All these centrist social democrats believe that the policies which appeal to the young, or have appealed to the old left, are likely to lose them votes in the centre. This is politics conceived as a zero-sum game: to gain new appeal you have to lose your old appeal. Certainly if Labour had retained clause four, it would not today be in power; not even Clinton   could have remained in office if he had run on the programme which kept Franklin Roosevelt in office.  
<P>But this way of doing the numbers has put nothing of new substance in place of the old. The zero-sum game is a confession of intellectual poverty, as well as a practical disaster; it assumes that a social democratic party can contrive no political programme which might appeal to the public as a whole, to the young as well as the middle aged, to Greens as well as to entrepreneurs. Roosevelt managed to do so. New Democrats, like New Labour, have not. The result is that we will see in the future, and here, repeats of the pathetic drama now unfolding in the United States.
