When the tobacco industry pushes for an "anti-smoking law," voters
are wise to retain a healthy skepticism. When the health insurance
industry leads the charge on "health care reform," it pays to read the
fine print. And when major business interests craft a policy designed to
secure a "living wage" for working men and women, you can be sure that no
startling act of economic altruism has occurred.
<p>The Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce and other business interests are
bankrolling a "living wage" initiative in a blatant attempt to undermine
a more far-reaching approach making its way through the Santa Monica City
Council. With a sizable war chest, the business-sponsored organization,
Santa Monicans for a Living Wage, has hired an experienced political
consultant and a politically connected downtown L.A. law firm to carry
out its plan.
<p>The group has sent expensive direct-mail pieces to voters. One of
these fliers claims that the proposal would pay Santa Monica workers a
wage high enough to make them "self sufficient." It also hired people to
gather signatures to get its initiative on the local ballot in November.
<p>More than 40 local living-wage laws have been enacted across the
country, and another 80 have been proposed. Business leaders across the
country see the battle in Santa Monica as a brush fire in a larger war
against local measures that require employers to improve wages and
benefits for the working poor. Business groups are using Santa Monica as
an experiment to see if strong living-wage laws can be stopped with an
expensive public relations and political strategy.
<p>Here's the catch: The business proposal is expected to cover only
about 200 city employees. It would exempt large employers that lease land
from the city, like companies that operate at the Santa Monica Pier and
the Santa Monica Airport. Most critically, the initiative would preclude
the elected City Council from ever directly enacting its own living-wage
policy.
<p>The business-sponsored initiative is a response to a proposal
advocated by Santa Monicans Allied for Responsible Tourism, or SMART, a
coalition of community, religious and labor groups. SMART's plan, which
is now being studied by the City Council, would require businesses with
50 or more employees within the "coastal zone"--the city's hotel,
restaurant and shopping district--to pay their workers a minimum of
$10.69 an hour. This amounts to a yearly income of about $22,000 for a
full-time worker with a family of four, slightly over the poverty line.
The proposal would cover an estimated 3,000 employees, most of them
low-wage service workers in luxury hotels, large restaurants and retail
outlets.
<p>This proposal, even if modified by the City Council, would change the
discussion about what constitutes a living wage and who should pay it. It
is a departure from other ordinances across the country that generally
only cover businesses that have contracts or subsidies with city or
county governments.
<p>SMART's logic for including private-sector businesses with at least 50
employees is compelling. Owners of large and small companies often argue
that they are independent operators whose success depends on their talent
and ingenuity. In reality, Santa Monica's private tourism industry is
heavily subsidized by local, state and even federal funding. Over the
years, government has invested large amounts of public dollars on
infrastructure and general improvements in the coastal zone.
<p>These investments have turned Santa Monica into a major resort
destination, attracting millions of tourists and travelers. Tens of
millions of dollars have been spent to renovate the publicly owned Santa
Monica Pier and popular beachfront park. Another $3.5 million in city
funds were used to renovate the Third Street Promenade. Increased police
presence on the pier and at the Promenade and the development of tourist
transit facilities have cost millions more.
<p>Government has played a critical role in improving the Santa Monica
business climate that makes local firms so profitable. Santa Monica's
booming economy has generated thousands of low-wage jobs. Yet while
businesses thrive, full-time workers remain dependent on public services
such as food stamps, housing assistance and public health care.
<p>Santa Monicans have a chance to show that they can see through the
business community's lavishly financed smoke screen. Like L.A.'s
janitors, Santa Monica's low-wage workers--and their allies among
religious and community groups--hope that grass-roots democracy will
prevail over Big Money.
