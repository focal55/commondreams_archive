&nbsp;The Clinton administration is relentlessly moving toward 
      an ill-informed decision this summer to deploy an untested and fundamentally 
      unworkable national missile defense (NMD) system. The administration claims 
      this technically flawed defense is needed to negate an unproven long-range 
      missile threat posed by "rogue" states.
<p><font color="black">The cost of this defense will not simply be measured 
        in dollars. It may include an end to further nuclear arms reductions with 
        Russia, an increased Chinese effort to expand its nuclear forces in response 
        to the defense, negative reactions from U.S. allies in Europe and East 
        Asia--who know that their security will also suffer from this ill-thought 
        out American initiative--and an eventual collapse of global arms control 
        and nonproliferation efforts.</font><font color="black"> </font> 
      
<p><font color="black">The Clinton administration, already confronted by 
        strongly negative and adverse public reactions from Russia and China, 
        insists that this defense system would not upset global efforts to reduce 
        the dangers from existing nuclear arsenals and potential nuclear proliferants. 
        </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Instead, the administration sticks to its false 
        claim that the proposed system will be sharply limited, and that it will 
        not compromise Russia's retaliatory deterrent forces. </font>
      
<p align="left"><font color="black"> Although Iran and Iraq have been named 
        as targets of this defense, North Korea is the alleged serious and immediate 
        threat. But if the proposed national missile defense system is to be aimed 
        principally at North Korean missiles, why is the United States deploying 
        a radar that is ideally suited for gathering intelligence for such a system 
        on the northern tip of Norway, less than 40 miles from the Russian border?

<p> 
      
<p> <font size="4" color="black"><b>Strawmen</b> </font>
      
<p><font color="black">On September 8 and 9 in Moscow, Deputy Secretary 
        of State Strobe Talbott presented Russia with a proposal to modify the 
        Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow the United States to deploy a light 
        but rapidly expandable national missile defense system. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Talbott told the Russians that if they did not accept 
        the U.S. proposal, the United States would simply withdraw from the treaty 
        and proceed on its own. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Not surprisingly, the Russians viewed Talbott's 
        statements as a threat and an ultimatum rather than as a proposal for 
        serious and honest discussion about matters of fundamental importance 
        to both nations. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Talbott's heavy-handed approach to the Russians 
        was another notch in a perfectly consistent record of Clinton administration 
        actions that add up to a coherent pattern of hostility and deception toward 
        Russia. This record has created throughout the Russian political system 
        a deep distrust of and anger toward the United States. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> In its seven-plus years, the Clinton administration 
        has piled blunder upon blunder in dealing with Russia. The administration's 
        initiative to expand NATO eastward has created a constant threat that 
        the United States and Russia will stumble into an unwanted crisis that 
        could easily escalate to nuclear alerts. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The administration's continued emphasis on maintaining 
        a hair-trigger nuclear strike force serves no constructive purpose and 
        endangers the United States, Russia, and the rest of the world by threatening 
        Russia's increasingly vulnerable nuclear forces. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> And now the Russians have been presented with an 
        insulting pretense that the United States is vulnerable to long-range 
        missile attacks from the likes of North Korea, Iran, or Iraq. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The latter two countries have no substantive long-range 
        missile programs. Although North Korea does have a program, it is based 
        on primitive, scaled-up Scud technology. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The Russian Scud is based on the work of German 
        engineers captured by the Russians at the end of World War II. The Scuds 
        themselves consist of modest improvements over the German V-2 missile, 
        first flown by Nazi Germany in the early 1940s. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Despite the vast resources available in Nazi Germany, 
        and the dedicated and well-supported national effort in the Soviet Union 
        that followed, the first ICBM was not achieved until 1957. The United 
        States now tells the Russians that it has an urgent need for a national 
        missile defense to protect itself from an imminent ICBM attack from a 
        state that has a gross domestic product smaller than Delaware's. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Against a backdrop of years of misrepresentations 
        by the Clinton administration, the North Korean, Iranian, and Iraqi "threat" 
        is seen as a strawman by the Russians and Chinese. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The Russians and the Chinese also understand that 
        the administration's "limited" defense is in fact a system that is indistinguishable 
        from one aimed at them. They correctly understand the full technical implications 
        of the administration's proposed battle-management upgrades of early warning 
        radars at Fylingdales Moor, Britain; Thule, Greenland; Grand Forks, North 
        Dakota; and Clear, Alaska. These upgrades are exactly those that would 
        be needed for a national missile defense system aimed at Russia and China. 
        </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> And now comes the most recent addition to the array 
        of misrepresentations to the Russians--installation of a state-of-the-art, 
        NMD-capable radar in Vardo, virtually on the Russian border. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The administration claims that the radar's purpose 
        is tracking space debris in earth orbit. It is obvious to any technically 
        informed person that this claim is simply another misrepresentation. </font>
      
<p> 
      
<p> 
      
<p> <font size="4" color="black"><b>A poke in the eye</b></font>
      
<p><font color="black">The certain principal use of this X-band radar, along 
        with a second one planned for Eareckson Air Station on Shemya Island, 
        some 1,500 miles south west of Anchorage, will be to collect detailed 
        intelligence data on Russia's long-range ballistic missiles. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> This data will cover the entire trajectory of the 
        missiles, including their powered flight, "bus" maneuvers, deployment 
        of warheads and countermeasures, and reentry into the Pacific near the 
        Kamchatka peninsula. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The data collected by these radars will be of primal 
        value to a U.S. national missile defense system. The information will 
        be fed into the NMD data base, which will increase the discrimination 
        capabilities of the proposed system against Russia's ballistic missiles. 
        </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> It is not clear that the Vardo radar, code-named 
        HAVE STARE, is a formal violation of the Antiballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. 
        But it is clear that the radar could be added to an NMD sensor system 
        in a way that would unmistakably violate the intent if not the letter 
        of the treaty. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> It is also clear, both to Washington and Moscow, 
        that the basic infrastructure of the proposed limited national missile 
        defense system could be rapidly scaled up to become an overtly anti-Russian 
        system. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The Vardo radar may be "treaty compliant." But it 
        is also one more threatening and insulting poke in the eye of the Russian 
        bear. </font>
      
<p> 
      
<p> 
      
<p> <font size="4" color="black"><b>Fingerprinting</b></font>
      
<p><font color="black">The HAVE STARE radar was developed in the early 1990s 
        by Raytheon, under the direction of the Electronic Systems Center, the 
        air force's lead organization for the development and acquisition of command-and-control 
        systems. According to the Defense Department, HAVE STARE is "a high-resolution 
        X-band tracking and imaging radar with a 27-meter mechanical dish antenna." 
        It became operational at Vandenberg Air Force Base on California's coast 
        in 1995, where it was used in early developmental tests of the national 
        missile defense program. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> In late 1998, HAVE STARE was quietly dismantled 
        and sent to Norway, where it is being jointly reassembled by the United 
        States and Norway under the Norwegian project name "Globus II." It is 
        located at a Norwegian military intelligence facility and its mission, 
        according to the U.S. and Norwegian governments, is to track and catalog 
        space junk in high earth orbit. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Space junk is no trivial matter. There are many 
        thousands of manmade objects orbiting earth, ranging in size from paint 
        flecks and nuts and bolts to booster rockets. But the new location of 
        the HAVE STARE radar, publicly revealed in April 1998 by Inge Sellevag, 
        a Norwegian newspaper reporter, is nearly the last place on earth one 
        would choose for a radar with the purpose of tracking space debris. Because 
        many objects of concern are in orbits that can never be seen from a far 
        north location, a space tracking installation is in fact best placed much 
        closer to the equator. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> But the location of the radar is ideal for collecting 
        very precise data on Russian missile tests. The Vardo machine is--at least 
        for now--the most advanced tracking and imaging radar in the world. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The HAVE STARE radar potentially has a resolution 
        of roughly 10 to 15 centimeters, which means it could provide detailed 
        radar images of Russian warheads and decoys. In contrast, U.S. early warning 
        radars have a resolution of--at best--5 to 10 meters. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> When a pulse from the Vardo X-band radar illuminates 
        a target, reflections are generated mostly by the numerous edges, surfaces, 
        and other geometric details of the target. These distinct reflections 
        are, in effect, a radar-fingerprint of the object. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Because the radar-fingerprint of an object varies 
        with the frequency of the radar, it is especially important that the Vardo 
        radar operate in the X-band, the same frequency range of the NMD X-band 
        radars. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> In addition, the radar signal will not simply be 
        a complex mix of the many individual reflections. The signal will fluctuate 
        in time as the targets of interest rotate and precess, providing yet additional 
        fingerprint data that could be exploited by the NMD X-band radars. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> In short, the Vardo radar can provide critical information 
        for a national missile defense system aimed specifically at Russia. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Further, the Vardo radar and the planned radar for 
        Shemya Island at the western end of the Aleutians could, operating together, 
        collect precision radar signature data on virtually every phase of Russian 
        tests of missiles and decoys, within minutes of launch from the Plesetsk 
        test range, about 150 miles south of the White Sea, to splashdown 4,000 
        miles away, near Kamchatka. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Of particular importance, HAVE STARE will be able 
        to obtain precision signature data at X-band frequencies and in mid-course--the 
        critical point at which warheads and decoys separate from the "bus." Previous 
        U.S. radars at Vardo and Shemya have lacked the ability to perform such 
        measurements at X-band frequencies. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Even though both the United States and the Soviet 
        Union (and now Russia) have long been capable of defeating missile defense 
        systems by deploying decoys and other devices along with warheads, this 
        well-focused intelligence-gathering activity understandably appears to 
        the Russians as a determined and planned step towards a U.S. National 
        missile defense capability aimed at Russia. The existence of this radar 
        at this location further adds to Russian perceptions that the Clinton 
        administration is again being deceptive about its true intentions. </font>
      
<p> 
      
<p> 
      
<p> <b><font size="4" color="black">What is "real time"? </font></b>
      
<p><font color="black">U.S. officials have said little about the export 
        of the HAVE STARE radar to Norway, leaving Norwegian officials to explain 
        its uses.  Sellevag, 
        a reporter with <i>Bergens Tidende</i> in Bergen, Norway, stirred the 
        pot in the spring of 1998 with stories revealing that HAVE STARE was moving 
        to Norway and that it had a potential national missile defense capability. 
        </font> 
      
<p><font color="black"> In response, Dag Jostein Fjarvoll, Norway's secretary 
        of defense, assured parliament that the Globus II radar (HAVE STARE) was 
        "under full Norwegian control." At best, that was misleading. Norwegian 
        personnel may man the system but the radar will be directly linked, according 
        to a viewgraph prepared by the air force's Electronics Systems Center, 
        to "Cheyenne Mountain and NMD." (The nerve center of the proposed national 
        missile defense system will be buried deeply within Colorado's Cheyenne 
        Mountain.) </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> This information clearly indicates that Fjarvoll's 
        assertions that the radar could not "contribute to any eventual American 
        defense" were false. Indeed, they seemed deliberately crafted to mislead 
        the Norwegian parliament. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The minister added that "only Norwegian personnel 
        have access to data in so-called real time." His use of "real time" was 
        repeated, perhaps for emphasis. "In other words, there was no connection 
        between Globus II and the U.S. Air Force in real time. . . . The radar 
        can therefore not contribute to any eventual American missile defense." 
        </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> To those not familiar with how acquisition and tracking 
        systems work--and members of the Norwegian parliament surely fit that 
        category--the no-real-time argument might seem compelling. From a commonsense 
        point of view, if a sensor system does not supply data in real time, it 
        is useless for missile defense. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> In fact, none of the existing U.S. early warning 
        and tracking systems, or those projected for the national missile defense 
        system, operate in "real time"--as the defense minister seems to define 
        it. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> They are not real-time systems because they collect 
        vast amounts of data that are not sent directly to the Cheyenne Mountain 
        Complex. All of these systems--in place and projected--extract critical 
        information from the mass of data after short processing delays. Once 
        the data are extracted, only then is it sent to operational command centers. 
        </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Each Defense Support Program satellite, for instance, 
        collects about 170 million bits of information per second. These data 
        are then sorted by a vastly powerful signal processing system on the satellite. 
        By the time the data sorting is completed, only one million bits per second 
        are actually transmitted to the ground. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Once on the ground, the data are further processed. 
        That processing takes place in 10-second batches, creating a vastly simplified 
        but supremely accurate surveillance "picture" of the earth below. In turn, 
        that information is updated and further processed every 10 seconds. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> In cases where there is very clear data indicating 
        a missile launch, it takes 20 to 40 seconds before the system can "initiate" 
        tracking of the launch. The operators of the system would not see this 
        information for 30 to 90 seconds, depending on specific circumstances. 
        </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Hence, the Defense Support Program satellites in 
        high earth orbit, currently the heart of the U.S. early warning array, 
        do not comprise a "real time" system according to the definition implied 
        by the statements of Norway's defense minister. </font>
      
<p> 
      
<p> 
      
<p> <font size="4" color="black"><b>Why Norway?</b></font>
      
<p><font color="black">What <i>is</i> the purpose of the HAVE STARE radar 
        at Vardo, which the Norwegians call Globus II? Its purpose is clear to 
        the Russian civilian and military analysts I have talked to. It is an 
        intelligence-gathering system optimized to collect data on Russian ballistic 
        missiles that can be directly used by a U.S. National missile defense 
        system aimed at Russia. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The technical information on HAVE STARE released 
        by the U.S. Air Force and the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization indicates 
        that it is a very capable tracking and imaging radar. Testimony given 
        in Congress and statements made elsewhere further confirm this. On June 
        18, 1996, for instance, Rear Adm. Richard D. West, then acting director 
        of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, testified before the House 
        National Security Committee about the NMD program. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> In his testimony, he described plans to upgrade 
        existing early warning radars "for inclusion in the NMD architecture." 
        He added, "If needed, other existing forward-based radars (such as Cobra 
        Dane or HAVE STARE) could also be used to support the NMD system." </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> More recently, Sellevag has tracked references to 
        HAVE STARE's potential usefulness to the NMD program. A mid-1990s air 
        force environmental impact statement provided by the U.S. Air Force Atmospheric 
        Interceptor Technology Program, noted: </font>
      
<p> <font color="black">"Two existing U.S. Air Force radar systems have 
        high potential for NMD application. The upgraded Precision Acquisition 
        Vehicle Energy-Phased Array Warning System (PAVE PAWS) radar located 
        at Beale Air Force Base (AFB), California is a wide-looking potential 
        target detection element of a future NMD system. The HAVE STARE tracking 
        radar located at Vandenberg AFB, California represents a candidate design 
        to perform the narrow-looking, target tracking radar role in a future 
        NMD system. </font>
      
<p> <font color="black">"To fully understand the utility of these radar 
        systems in an NMD role, the [air force] plans to integrate and test these 
        systems using realistic threat scenarios. California is the only location 
        where these radars are close enough to be tested together. The PAVE PAWS 
        radar initially detects an incoming target and hands over specific target 
        tracking to the HAVE STARE." </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The tests were carried out. Two Minuteman III launches 
        were picked up by the Defense Support Program's early warning satellites; 
        in turn, that data cued PAVE PAWS and HAVE STARE, which tracked the missiles. 
        </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Sellevag documents that HAVE STARE was later involved 
        in two test flights in the NMD program. In June 1997, a Minuteman II lifted 
        off from Vandenberg with dummy warheads and balloon decoys--targets for 
        sensor payloads aboard Boeing's Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle, launched 
        from Kwajalein. A similar test of Raytheon's entry into the Exoatmospheric 
        Kill Vehicle sweep stakes took place in January 1998. (Both tests were 
        of the sensors; no intercept of the target was attempted.) </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Occasional air force and Ballistic Missile Defense 
        Organization briefing viewgraphs and slides allude, directly or indirectly, 
        to HAVE STARE in future NMD architecture. <a href="http://www.bullatomsci.org/issues/2000/ma00/images/smokinggun.gif">One 
        December 1999 slide</a> produced by the Strategic and Nuclear Deterrence 
        Command-and-Control Program Office shows HAVE STARE clustered with a host 
        of "Global Awareness" sensors, all of which are linked to Cheyenne Mountain 
        &amp; NMD. </font> 
      
<p><font color="black"> Could HAVE STARE act as an early warning and tracking 
        radar if a national missile defense system is deployed? Yes--but <i>only</i> 
        as a backup to other sensors closer to home or parked in safe orbits. 
        </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The U.S. Air Force would have to assume that in 
        the event of an intentional missile attack by Russia, Vardo would be immediately 
        destroyed. (According to Sellevag, the idea that the Vardo radar might 
        put northern Norway at the top of Russia's nuclear target list has unsettled 
        at least a few members of the Norwegian parliament.) </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> But the real value of the Vardo radar and of the 
        not-yet-built Shemya radar is that they can do critical advance work for 
        the national missile defense system. They can collect radar signatures--"fingerprints"--from 
        a host of Russian missiles, warheads, decoys, and other devices as they 
        are tested in east-west flight high above the Russian hinterland. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> These fingerprints constitute vital information 
        for any system designed to counter the Russian missile "threat," which 
        must function perfectly within minutes of the need to do so. A system 
        that cannot quickly separate warheads from everything else is fatally 
        flawed. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> If the purpose of a national missile defense system 
        is to protect the United States from North Korean missiles, why is the 
        world's most advanced tracking and imaging radar about to go online at 
        the northern tip of Norway instead of northern Japan? </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Why Norway? is an especially intriguing question 
        in the context of the threats made last September by Strobe Talbott to 
        the Russians, when he said that the United States was considering unilateral 
        withdrawal from the ABM Treaty </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Meanwhile, the administration may soon make a decision 
        to deploy a national missile defense that could well end whatever momentum 
        is left in the U.S.-Russian strategic arms reduction process. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The truth is that domestic politics in the United 
        States has led to false claims about the promise of missile defense technology--as 
        well as fantastic claims about "emerging threats." </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Both the Republicans and the Democrats have been 
        involved in a charade trying to make each look less concerned about national 
        defense while they together drive the United States toward a disaster 
        of historic proportions. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> If the administration decides this summer to deploy 
        the national missile defense system, it should at least be honest about 
        it. The Pentagon still defines the principal missile threat as Russia, 
        not North Korea. That is why HAVE STARE is in northern Norway instead 
        of northern Japan. </font>
      
<p> 
      
<p> 
      
<p> <b><font size="4" color="black">A new arms race? </font></b>
      
<p><font color="black">In his visit to Russia last September, Talbott assured 
        the Russians that the proposed system would only be capable of handling 
        "tens of missiles." Apparently Talbott thought that would reassure the 
        Russians and not alarm the Chinese. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> But the Chinese have, according to the CIA, only 
        20 missiles capable of reaching the United States. The Chinese have long 
        said that the proposed "limited" system has an anti-Chinese face. And 
        the Russians clearly believe that a system that could be rapidly expanded 
        and upgraded looks like an anti-Russian system. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Talbott's words got an immediate response from Russia 
        and China. When I was in Moscow in October, only a few weeks after Talbott's 
        visit, I was told by several government officials about a meeting in Beijing, 
        from which they had just returned. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The meeting was sponsored by the foreign ministries 
        of Russia and China. However, most of the participants were from the Russian 
        and Chinese ministries of defense. The purpose of the meeting was to begin 
        Russian and Chinese political and technical cooperation to deal with the 
        threat of a U.S. National missile defense system. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> George N. Lewis, John Pike, and I published an article 
        in the August 1999 issue of <i>Scientific American</i>, which attempted 
        to show that the proposed U.S. National missile defense system could be 
        defeated by the simplest of countermeasures. I personally know missile 
        experts in Russia and China, and they agree. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> A U.S. decision to deploy will nevertheless result 
        in a strong negative, coordinated, and unequivocal reaction from Russia 
        and China. This is because there will be constant concerns that the United 
        States may eventually expand and modify the defense with nuclear-armed 
        interceptors instead of the pitiful hit-to-kill interceptors now planned 
        for the system. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> A modified and expanded nuclear system could also 
        be readily defeated, but the Russians and Chinese would have to dedicate 
        more resources to the task. Most important: They might want to expand 
        their offensive capability, following the Nuclear Age dictum that a good 
        offense beats any defense. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> The Russians and Chinese also will not want to agree 
        to a cutoff in the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. 
        After all, they may need these materials to expand their nuclear arsenals 
        in response to upgrades in U.S. missile defenses. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> They will want to reserve the option of nuclear 
        testing, so that new nuclear weapons designs--hardened to the effects 
        of U.S. nuclear interceptors--can be tested. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> And they will certainly not be interested in engaging 
        in further arms reductions. Instead, they may need to expand their forces 
        in response to changes in the U.S. National missile defense system. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> While this game is going on between the United States, 
        Russia, and China, the non-weapon state signatories to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
        Treaty will be watching their security erode along with that of the three 
        great competing powers. Some states may choose to withdraw from the treaty 
        while others may choose to stay. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> However, some of the states that withdraw may create 
        pressures on neighboring states to also withdraw, especially if there 
        are traditional tensions between these states. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> Thus, a decade after the end of the Cold War, the 
        Clinton administration has put us on the path to a new arms race and a 
        breakdown of the entire international regime of treaties that has been 
        built over the past 30 years. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> It is bad enough if the administration simply does 
        not understand what it is doing. </font>
      
<p><font color="black"> It is even worse if it <i>does</i>.</font>
