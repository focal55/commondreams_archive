Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen, R-Waukesha, is not a gentleman with whom I
usually find myself in agreement. But he had a point when he suggested Tuesday
night that Arianna Huffington, the featured speaker at this year's Wisconsin
Women in Government recognition dinner, did not exactly qualify as a
&quot;Republican'' speaker.
<p>There's a quiet little competition between Democrats and Republicans over
guest speaker slots at the amply-attended annual event, and Jensen keeps tabs.
After Huffington's speech, in which she savaged both parties with equal energy,
condemned the current campaign finance system as legalized bribery, and called
on her audience to address the widening gap between rich and poor, Jensen
allowed as how &quot;I think they still owe us a Republican.''</p>
<p>On paper, Huffington, the former wife of a former Republican congressman who
was once the toast of Newt Gingrich's Washington, looked to have the right
credentials; but the woman who came to national prominence as a so-called
&quot;conservative commentator'' delivered an address that was far more radical
than anything you'll hear from most of Wisconsin's leading Democrats.</p>
<p>That's because Huffington has evolved from her conservative roots to a
rabble-rousing stance that more closely approximates the direction in which
American politics is headed. Jensen is smart enough to recognize as much; as was
Barbara Lawton, just about the only prominent Wisconsin Democrat who is Jensen's
intellectual equivalent.</p>
<p>A lot of Democrats in the crowd couldn't see beyond Huffington's entirely
appropriate criticisms of the lamentable Al Gore; indeed, one top Democrat even
told me, &quot;I didn't really listen to her; she's just a Republican.''</p>
<p>Lawton did listen, and the 1998 candidate for lieutenant governor heard in
Huffington's speech the rough outlines of a new politics. Huffington's core
points were these: It's time to drive special interest money out of our
politics, to address the widening gap between rich and poor, and to rein in the
prison-industrial complex by ending the monumentally failed war on drugs.
Lawton, who actually gets around Wisconsin and talks to real people, quickly
recognized that these are issues that citizens talk about much more than the
silly agenda items advanced by both the Democratic and Republican parties these
days.</p>
<p>After Huffington finished speaking, she and Lawton chatted amiably and
energetically with an ideological focus that would have confirmed all of
Jensen's fears.</p>
<p>I only wish Attorney General James Doyle would have stuck around to talk with
Huffington. Doyle, in particular, would do well to imbibe some of Huffington's
wisdom before formally launching his much anticipated campaign for the 2002
Democratic gubernatorial nomination.</p>
<p>Doyle is a smart man with great progressive roots, yet he runs the risk of
being the gubernatorial candidate of the murky Democratic center -- a
circumstance that will guarantee his defeat.</p>
<p>If Doyle runs for governor as a drug war-battling, lock-'em-up-and-throw-away-the-key,
prison-building Democrat -- a whiter shade of Tommy Thompson's pale, so to speak
-- he will lose. On the other hand, if he recognizes the swing of the political
pendulum that Huffington and others like her are riding, he will be a contender,
and very possibly the winner.</p>
<p>Politics in America is changing, rapidly. People who were listening on
Tuesday night -- especially Jensen and Lawton -- heard the sound of the future.
Jensen didn't exactly like the message; Lawton did.</p>
<p>But they were smart enough to understand that they were tapping into a
significant dialogue that's going on in America -- a dialogue that is far more
important than the middling mush of non-ideas being traded by George W. Bush, Al
Gore and their minions on both sides of the political aisle.</p>
