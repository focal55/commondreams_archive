<p>Dear friends,
<p>
I tried to write this letter to you last night, but the level of
sadness in me would not allow me to sit at this keyboard and
compose these words.
<p>
How much more can my hometown take? How much more do
the people we love have to suffer? How much? How much??
HOW MUCH!
<p>
Isn't it enough that tens of thousands of lives in Flint have been
wrecked, destroyed by the greed of General Motors? Isn't it enough that
my wife and I and tens of thousands of others who love our
home -- love it more than any of you will ever know -- have had
to leave Flint in the past 20 years to find work far from family
and friends? Isn't it enough that Flint suffers the
highest or near-highest per capita rates of murder, rape and
theft in the nation?
<p>
What else do the people of Flint have to go through while the
rest of country mouths the propaganda of the evening news
claiming "the economy is the best ever!"? The top 10 percent
just get richer and richer and the next 30 percent of you keep
the CNBC stock ticker on your screens all day and toss out all
sections of the daily paper but the pages that tell you how well
your portfolio did yesterday.
<p>
I thought there was nothing else left for Flint to go through.
Like Job, it seemed that every imaginable sorrow had been
visited upon its people. I guess I was wrong.
<p>
I look up at the TV and a helicopter is hovering over a school
while the words "Buell Elementary" flash on the screen.
<p>
Buell? Buell! At the end of "The Big One," when I twisted Nike
chairman Phil Knight's arm to match my $10,000 contribution
to the kids of Flint -- that $20,000 went to Buell Elementary.
<p>
Yesterday, a 6-year old boy brought a semi-automatic gun to
that very school in Flint and killed a 6-year old girl in their first
grade classroom.
<p>
Six years old.
<p>
A little girl whose name was Kayla Rolland.
<p>
That's about the only thing the national media got right about
the story. Twenty satellite trucks now ring the school, but with
all that technology, they cannot find the way to bring you the
truth. Of course, they have been spun and snookered by the
local officials in Flint who try to hide from the responsibility
they share in Flint's destruction any time a tragedy like this
happens.
<p>
You have probably heard that this school shooting took place out in the
"suburbs," in a place called "Mount Morris Township"...
"somewhere near Flint." 
<p>
There is no such place.
<p>
Buell Elementary, where the shooting took place, is in the Flint
Beecher school district, the poorest school district in Genesee
County, Michigan, and perhaps the poorest in the entire state.
Eighty-two percent of its children, according to the federal
government, live below the "official" poverty level (meaning the
number of kids in total poverty is even higher).
<p>
Beecher is Flint's dump. It is where you go when you have
nothing left to your name. 60 percent black, 40 percent white.
No municipality in Genesee County wants to govern Beecher,
so it exists as a No Man's Land on the northern city limits of
Flint. It covers a small portion of two different townships 
(one of which is where my wife Kathleen is from). But folks, when
you hear the word "township" used in the case of Beecher,
those of us from Flint mean it in the way the word was used in
South Africa. Buell Elementary in the Flint Beecher school
district has a Flint address and a Flint phone number, but 
the black officials from Flint on the news yesterday tried to point
out that "this school really isn't in Flint!" It is amazing how
deep oppression takes its roots when even black leaders find
themselves in bed with General Motors and, like Peter in the
Garden of Gethsemane, repeatedly deny that people of their
own race have anything to do with them.
<p>
Poor, poor Flint. The media blowhards babble on about how
"this is the youngest child to kill another child in a school
shooting" and the few anchors who started to look at their own helicopter
shots showing the school sitting in the middle of a bombed-out
neighborhood commented that "this is actually the first of all
these school shootings we've had lately that has taken place in
an 'urban' school." Wow. Two records for Flint in one day.
<p>
When I was a senior in high school, the assistant principal of
Beecher High -- the first black man in the area to hold such a
position -- became despondent over his inability to quell the
racial disturbances in the school, so one night he went home,
wrote a heartfelt letter to the kids in the district, then put a gun
in his mouth and blew his brains out. As my friend, Jeff Gibbs,
who went to Beecher, told me last night, it's sad that the only
two times that Beecher receives the attention of the nation is
because of a gun (Click <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/jgibbs.html">here</a> to read Jeff's letter).
<p>
I heard from relatives last night that the family of the little boy
who killed the girl had been evicted from their home just last
week. Evicted, I wonder, by Deputy Fred, who 10 years after
"Roger & Me," still spends his day at the behest of Flint's
landlords.
<p>
Homeless and fatherless (his dad is in jail as 30 percent of all
black men in America will be at some point in their lives), the
boy was staying at his uncle's. In the house were guns, as there
are in virtually every home in this devastated and desperate area.
The gun, that the boy found and took to school, was not some
"junk gun," the kind that Al Gore promises to get rid of. It was
a gun with a brand name bought initially at a sporting goods
store (I wonder, were the bullets bought at K-Mart, as they were
at Columbine?).
<p>
How do Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush feel this morning? Just
seven days prior, John McCain's "Straight Talk Express" bus
rolled past Beecher on I-75, but it didn't stop. It rolled on down
near Ann Arbor where McCain blasted those who seek gun
control, saying that he opposes ANY ban on ANY assault
weapon, and opposes ANY waiting period for a background
check when one purchases a gun. Mr. Bush never stopped in
Flint either.
<p>
I guess we all feel sorta proud that they both avoid
us like the plague. There is not -- and has not for nearly thirty
years -- been a single Republican state or federal representative
elected from Flint. Another reason, I suppose, for our neglect
and punishment. But we're proud of how we've made it almost a
crime to support a Republican in Flint, proud of the fact we
elected the country's first black mayor in the '60s, proud that we
voted for Jesse Jackson 9 to 1 over Michael Dukakis in 1988
(and 4 to 1 for Jesse in Flint's all-white suburbs). So I guess
the gun crazy presidential candidates made the right decision to
take their hate-filled campaigns elsewhere. And, in the end, I
was proud to see that the people of Michigan, like the people in
Minnesota, have kept their sense of humor intact as a way to
express their sense of outrage. 51 percent of those who showed
up to vote in the Republican primary were Democrats and
Independents! They took the time to go the polls to plunk down
for McCain just to, in good ol' working class fashion, stick it to
the Bush with the silver spoon in his mouth.
<p>
I'll end by repeating what I have said many times before -- the
handguns have to go. 16,000 gun murders last year in the US and
15,500 were killed by someone they knew (husband, boyfriend,
neighbor) or by someone at work. Approximately 500 were
killed by a stranger who broke into their home and 300 of those
were killed by their OWN gun. Those are the facts. Easy
access to guns by a species that often responds irrationally and
with intense emotions is a lethal combination. Great Britain, a
nation of 60 million people with a violent history of conquering
the world at the barrel of a gun and now full of drunks and
hotheads who eat up violent American movies and TV shows --
last year they killed a grand total of 12 -- that's TWELVE! -- of
their own citizens with handguns. That's because handguns are
TOTALLY banned. Let the hunters keep their rifles after a
serious background check, but the handguns, whose only
purpose is to take a human life, must go. The Brits have done it,
the Australians have done it, the Canadians have done it. Even
New York City mostly did it -- and the number of murders
there has dropped from 2,200 a year to 600.
<p>
We look like a bunch of idiots. Let's do something about it and
about the poverty in which so many of kids still dwell. We have never
been in a better place to make it happen than right now.
<p>
What are we waiting for? Another Kayla Rolland? God help
you if you ever have to live in a township that no town will
claim and is forgotten by everyone else as
soon as the next gun nut enters a McDonald's and a Burger
king on the same day.  Fried or flame-broiled, it's all our
own unique American Hell.
<p>
On behalf of the six of us from Flint who work on The Awful
Truth,
<br>
Michael Moore
