As the race to decipher the human genome ends its first phase, we are quite properly amazed watching our genetic map unfold before our eyes. But it is far too early to conclude that understanding our genetic substance will trigger a leap in human "progress." One thing is certain: We are not spending nearly enough time or money considering how society will cope with what scientists are unleashing.
<P>Darwin taught us that progress from survival of those organisms most fit occurs over thousands of years, as nature weeds out weaknesses. Now we threaten to change the human organism virtually all at once, without affording the time to reach balance and harmony. As science-fiction writers love to speculate, we may even generate a war within our own bodies.</P>
<P>Might genetic interventions inadvertently trigger more trouble than success? Look at the fine line between disaster and rescue that thalidomide illustrates. In the past this drug disfigured newborns; now we hope it will help with cancer and AIDS.</P>
<P>Consider HIV therapy, how it alters cells and too often induces resistance. Will genetically altered cells make good or bad neighbors to those in adjoining tissues? Clinical investigators using genetically engineered substances in Boston and Philadelphia have already watched death come to patients before rescue.</P>
<P>Genetic knowledge will never abolish all disease and suffering, and Americans don't like to address rationing explicitly. We already spend about 15 percent of our gross domestic product on health care, and there is no way our economic resources can keep pace with the new technologies. Virtually every new diagnostic and therapeutic manipulation adds costs. The rush by biotechnology companies to profit from the new genetic discoveries makes it likely that the new maneuvers will be the most expensive of all, and rarely do new discoveries replace existing expensive tests and interventions.</P>
<P>Who will have access to the new technologies, and who won't? Will we end up further widening the gap between rich and poor? When the United States has 45 million people without health insurance and many more who can't afford therapies already proven worthwhile, how can we -- and should we -- find the money for new genetic therapies that will cost a fortune?</P>
<P>Consider how poorly our society is dealing with the elderly, the beneficiaries of extended life expectancy that scientific, behavioral and social changes have already provided. As doctors urge their patients to throw away cigarettes, we rarely pause to take stock of the paradox that if everyone were to stop smoking tomorrow, the burden on society from increased longevity could prove enormous.</P>
<P>Take that thought a step further. If genetic therapies that increase life expectancy arrived tomorrow, they might bankrupt our health-care system or siphon vital resources away from education, human services and other essential functions of society. Are we ready to deal with this kind of success?</P>
<P>Will mapping genes intensify discrimination and loss of privacy? How will society address genetic tests for health insurance, jobs and life insurance? What role is there for the marketplace vs. governmental regulation? And consider the next step: full-blown eugenics. In today's narcissistic society, people aspire increasingly to their notion of perfection: the cherished height, gender, skin color. How will we build moral consensus, a code that stymies those who would create a master race or a Frankenstein?</P>
<P>Think about the anguish of those deciding whether to learn if they or their children have genes that forecast Huntington's disease, or increase the likelihood of breast cancer or dementia. Reflect on the uncertainties that already attend the relatively primitive genetic tests that amniocentesis offers the pregnant woman, and multiply those dilemmas a thousandfold.</P>
<P>How will we feel when fantasies of genetic perfection are destroyed? May we not end up with loss of ambition, depression or even a shattered persona? Learning about one's genetic map may induce far more pain than pleasure.</P>
<P>What about responsibility, voluntary behaviors, the old-fashioned idea of choosing right over wrong? Will we rush to "blame the gene" for every human failure or transgression? Will genetic determinism weaken our will? Will it stop our search for mystery, community, art, spirituality and the deepest pleasures? Will the genetic map replace the dream?</P>
<P>The human quest for knowledge will never abate, and we must mobilize quickly to address the consequences of what we learn. Our government, universities, industry, communities, schools, clergy and each of us must prepare for some exceedingly tough decisions, lest we end up expressing ex-post-facto doubts like those of the Los Alamos physicists who, having detonated an atomic bomb, looked back in horror at what they had wrought.</P>
<P>It's time to build a national "Genome Commission" that is well supported and broadly representative, and that has strong bipartisan teeth. , It would be analogous to the Atomic Energy Commission, which helped us live with the consequences of splitting the atom. We should also form an international counterpart that is truly global in its reach.</P>
<P>For every dollar we spend on the genome project and the attendant frantic race for discovery, we should spend an equal amount to prepare for what we find. The rush for that kind of enlightenment has hardly begun.</P>
