After George W. Bush's presidential campaign splashed his proposed  health-care reforms, the national news media zoomed in on his record as Texas governor.
<p>
  Bush said that everyone should be able to see a doctor, and he proposed that low-income Americans get cut-rate prescriptions and hospital care.
<p>
 Also, those who don't qualify for Medicaid and earn $30,000 or less -- but aren't insured by employers -- should get a tax credit of as much as $2,000 per family to help them pay for their own insurance.
<p>
  Of course, a $2,000 tax credit will mean little to those who can't afford to pay for insurance. And what about the growing number of employers who are continuing to insure their workers but are shifting to the employees a growing portion of the cost for covering other family members?
<p>
 Has Texas, several national reporters have asked me, with compassionate-conservative George W. Bush at the helm, provided good, affordable health care for all Texans?
<p>
 "In most national health-care rankings, Texas ranks in the bottom three states," says Dick Lavine of the Center for Public Policy Priorities. "We're not always No. 1, but that's because there's always Mississippi."
<p>
 In 1998, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that one in six Americans was uninsured, but Texas' percentage was 27 percent. Plus, we rank No. 1 in the percentage of uninsured children.
<p>
 A major factor in our bad rankings is demographic: Texas has high poverty levels and very high rates of underemployment. 
<p>
 Another factor key to Texas' poor showing, says Anne Dunkelberg, a CPPP senior policy analyst, is that "Congress passed child care insurance in August 1997, but since the Legislature wasn't in session, and we didn't get a special session, we didn't get CHIP legislation until 1999." 
<p>
 The Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, is funded with federal block grant money and matching state dollars to insure children in families that make too much money for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance.
<p>
  When the 1999 Legislature convened, Bush said little about insuring kids, focusing instead on tax cuts.  But his budget made his position clear: While child-care advocates pushed to open CHIP eligibility to kids whose families earn as much as 200 percent of the poverty level, the Bush budget called for limiting eligibility to 150 percent.
<p>
 When the Legislature heartily approved the 200 percent level, Bush quietly signed the measure. 
<p>
 As national attention focuses on Texas' large number of uninsured kids, Bush surrogates are putting a positive spin on a report released Wednesday by Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander. The state, the report says, has spent $4.7 billion treating uninsured Texans.
<p>
 Wait a minute. If our taxes are paying to care for the uninsured in state-supported hospitals, that care is coming too late and, because of that, at a very inflated cost. 
<p>
 Universal health-care insurance that provides regular, preventive care and a primary care physician will cost a fraction, per patient, of what we'll spend for emergency room visits.
