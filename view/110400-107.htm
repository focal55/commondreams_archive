<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->This week Napster, the upstart online music-swapping service, announced that it has joined forces with Bertelsmann, one of the world's leading music and entertainment companies, to create a global "membership based service" for downloading music. Bertelsmann, in turn, has agreed to drop its lawsuit charging Napster with illegally distributing copyrighted music via the internet. Other music companies involved in the landmark litigation have not yet decided whether they will withdraw in the wake of this development. 
<P>The Napster decision represents a turning point for dot.com commerce. What we're witnessing is the beginning of a struggle between two great economic systems. On one side of the divide lies the old market-based economy, made up of sellers and buyers. On the other lies the new network-based economy, made up of servers and clients. In markets, the parties exchange property. In networks, they share access to services and experiences.  <P>The new information and telecommunications technologies, e-commerce and globalisation are facilitating a new economic era. By the middle of the 21st century, markets, the hallmark of conventional capitalism, will have largely disappeared, replaced by a system based on network relationships, contractual arrangements and access rights.  <P>Napster is the first of a new genre of businesses that operate by a network mentality rather than by market logic. And it is the Napster model which is likely to set the pace for the way companies in every field do business.  <P>There are a number of reasons for this. First, the near warp-speed of distribution and exchange on the web makes direct market-based transactions too slow. With a simple click, one can distribute music around the world and exchange whole libraries of songs before a cash register can even ring up a sale.  <P>Second, web distribution reduces transaction costs toward zero, virtually eliminating the traditional profit margins on sales-related activity. Compare the transaction costs of producing, packaging, inventorying, transporting and merchandising a CD with the cost of producing a single music track and distributing it instantaneously to millions of people, at no appreciable additional cost.  <P>Third, in markets, the emphasis is on maximising production and profit is made on the volume of the sales. In networks the emphasis is on minimising production and profit is made by pooling risks and sharing savings. Everyone in the Napster network swaps music with each other. But because the music has been reconfigured digitally as pure information, it can be shared without any loss to the holder.  <P>So how do companies like Napster make money? They build up their network of users by providing a free service. Then, they transform their main asset, their network of millions of users, into paid subscribers or members. That's what the Napster-Bertelsmann deal is all about. Napster is proposing to charge a monthly fee of $4.95 to secure unlimited access to the Bertelsmann music catalogue.  <P>Already, EMI Recorded Music, the Universal Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment have announced similar plans. A Jupiter Communications study projects that by 2005, online subscriptions for music will account for $980m in revenue, while individual market-based transactions of CDs online will account for less than $531m.  <P>Finally, sophisticated new technologies allow for a perpetual flow of feedback activity, turning the economy from "discrete" market transactions to continuous non-stop access in networks. One pays to be always connected to a steady stream of virtually unlimited music rather than to buy an occasional CD. Commercial life is non-stop now.  <P>Napster is only the tip of the iceberg. The film industry is locked into a similar court battle with hackers who have created a code that cracks the digital video disk format, allowing anyone who has access to the code to make copies of DVD movies and exchange them free of charge.  <P>More than 300,000 movie downloads are taking place each day and observers expect the number of downloads to reach a million or more copies per day by the end of the year. There may be little the film industry can do to stem the tide. In the long run, film companies are likely to follow the lead of the music industry and make their peace with the net by setting up their own sites and providing access to films by turning users into paid subscribers and members.  
<P>While there has been a great deal of angst over how to protect copyright, little attention has been paid to where the whole network process and access relationships is leading society. Short-term access between servers and clients operating in networks is going to redefine our social dynamics. Today, the Napster-Bertelsmann way of doing business is an oddity. In the future, it will be the norm.
