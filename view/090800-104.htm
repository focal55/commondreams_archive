PARIS - The $1.3 billion U.S. grant of police and military aid to Colombia's counter-narcotics program, which President Bill Clinton launched during a flying visit to that country Aug. 30, has three things in common with the American plan for a national missile defense.
<P>
 First, both are inspired by ongoing U.S. electoral politics, not by serious policy analysis.
<P>
 Second, neither can succeed in terms of its avowed objective. The Colombian program can't really reduce the supply of drugs to the United States or make a real difference to America's drug crisis. And limited national missile defense can't really protect the United States from "rogue" or terrorist mass-destruction weapons. (The president has just postponed a decision on deployment, leaving it to his successor to decide.)
<P>
 However, success or failure in their avowed purposes makes no difference to the political sponsors of the two projects. They ask only that the issues serve as electorally potent symbols of action against drugs and protection against rogue states - allowing the programs' opponents to be characterized as "soft" on drugs or weak on defense.
<P>
 The final common element is that both are essentially unconnected to the possibilities the real world affords, and both could have serious negative consequences. Aid to Colombia might contribute to regional destabilization and possibly draw the United States into deeper Latin American military engagement. A national missile defense could easily subvert the existing international balance of nuclear deterrence and restraint.
<P>
 The missile defense project, as even supporters concede, is of extreme technological difficulty. The likelihood is remote that in the next decade it could provide even limited effective defense against "rogue" missiles.
<P>
 Even if it proved able to do so, the security of the United States would not measurably be improved. The rogues or terrorists from whom the missiles are meant to defend the United States know that nuclear devices, anthrax bacteria or containers of lethal gases with timing devices can be shipped to New York or Los Angeles in easier ways than by expensive, complicated and conspicuously identifiable intercontinental missiles.
<P>
 The program is fundamentally meant to exploit a potent image of national security for electoral advantage. It provides a second electoral benefit to its supporters. Aerospace manufacturers want the program because it promises them important government contracts. Therefore, the aerospace firms are willing to contribute a great deal to the re-election campaigns of congressional backers of NMD.
<P>
 The aid program for Colombia is likewise an essay in illusions. For Colombians themselves, the problem created by drug producers protected by rebel bands constitutes a terrifying threat to national unity and security. But as the Clinton administration has repeatedly stated, U.S. military trainers, equipment and funds are not going to Colombia to fight a war against Colombia's rebels. They are only there to support the campaign against drug producers and traffickers.
<P>
 But once again, the program cannot succeed. It can't do what the United States ostensibly expects of it, which is to resolve America's own drug crisis. Again, its backers understand this. So long as the United States provides an enormous and lucrative market for drugs, the drugs will be supplied. That is the reality of market economics. The demand will be met. 
<P>
Even if Colombian President Andrés Pastrana's ambitious anti-narcotics and political pacification policies should succeed inside Colombia, drug production would simply move to another country. As Pastrana said during President Clinton's visit, "What we are talking about is the most lucrative business in the world."
<P>
 Production would move across the frontiers to Peru, Brazil or Ecuador. Asian producers would take up the slack. Narcotics production in Africa has already begun to expand.
<P>
 Foreign intervention to fix America's drug problem once again offers voters an illusion to distract them from the politically unpalatable reality that the drug crisis is caused inside the United States, not beyond its borders.
<P>
 Washington externalizes the problem by sending soldiers, helicopters and money to Colombia. It knows no politically acceptable way to deal with addiction and the drug traffic inside the United States. Therefore, it does what it knows how to do. The illusion of action is thought to make voters feel better.
<P>
 The United States is not the first country, nor are these the first occasions, in which politicians have manipulated foreign threats to deceive the electorate. It nonetheless should be understood that this is what is going on.
