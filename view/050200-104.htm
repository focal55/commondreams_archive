GETTING TOUGH on crime has taken a new high-tech turn. Those who claim 
to sell safer streets now have a new product on the market -- it is a 
high-
tech video surveillance camera. Today's purveyors of safety are 
claiming to clean up the streets but it's at a price, and the price 
is our right to privacy. The proposal, to install high-tech video 
cameras, is gaining in popularity, from commuter trains in the Bay 
Area, too rural school districts in Mississippi, and all the way to 
Times Square in New York City.
<P>  Unfortunately, this new product is not all that it claims to be, 
and in fact there is no evidence that cities and school districts 
that are buying this equipment will make us any safer, but there's 
plenty of proof that the right to privacy, the right to be left 
alone, will surely be diminished under the watchful eyes of highly 
sophisticated snooping devices.	 
</P>
<P>  Today's high-tech entrepreneurs are selling new and improved 
equipment to spy on people -- people walking on the street, 
passengers on BART trains or even students going to their high school 
lockers. This is not the stationary video camera you've grown 
accustomed to at your local 7-Eleven store. What is being marketed 
now, as the fix-all solution to crime, are cameras that are able to 
zoom in from more than 100 yards away and read the print on political 
flyers being distributed on the public sidewalk, even if it's dark 
outside. These are cameras that also tape your conversation, even if 
you're whispering. Indeed, the new video cameras, which 
are referred to by the manufacturer as CCTV (Closed Circuit 
Television), have the capability of peering through the windows of 
private homes and businesses.	 
</P>
<P>  If you're starting to feel a little bit safer at the potential to 
secretly ferret out lawbreakers (after all, you've got nothing to 
hide, right?), a little look at the recent experience with the 
current surveillance technology is instructive.	 
</P>
<P>So far, there is no indication that CCTV is a fierce crime fighter. 
In New York City, after an expensive 18-month experiment, the cameras 
were removed, having resulted in only 10 arrests. A more 
comprehensive study in Britain found that the use of CCTV cameras 
provided no deterrent to criminal activity. However, the study did 
show that the cameras certainly were not left idle. In fact, the 
surveillance cameras and the team of in-studio staff responsible for 
monitoring, were directly engaged in violations of civil liberties.	 
</P>
<P>  The study found that the surveillance cameras had a discriminating 
eye, focusing almost exclusively on people of color, gays and young 
people. In addition, the British authorities used CCTV to track the 
movement of individuals and to monitor public meetings, marches and 
demonstrations.	 
</P>
<P>  In New York City, a lawsuit was recently brought by unions against 
the City University of New York, where a campus security director 
conceded that a surveillance camera had been concealed in a student 
meeting room to monitor campus political groups.	 
</P>
<P>  Also in New York, we saw the extensive video monitoring of the 
Million Youth March in Harlem. Police recording of people exercising 
their constitutional right to speak can have a chilling and 
intimidating effect. Ordinary people may shy away from political 
activities if they believe they will be monitored in this way.	 
</P>
<P>  The potential to violate the right to privacy, a right deeply 
valued by Americans and guaranteed directly to Californians under our 
state constitution, is threatened by the growing use of surveillance 
cameras. Federal and state laws have long created criminal penalties 
for illegal wiretapping, and in order to wiretap in the first place, 
law enforcement is required to show individualized suspicion in order 
to obtain a warrant.	 
Yet in many ways, CCTV is an even more intrusive form of search than 
audio wiretapping. CCTV can and has been grossly abused by recording 
the intimate conduct of citizens and marking innocent people for 
tracking solely on the basis of racial, gender or other 
characteristics. No other technique can record in such graphic detail 
personal and private behavior.	 
</P>
<P>  Yet this is a technique that is not explicitly controlled by any 
law; even wiretapping is subject to greater legal restrictions. The 
growing sophistication of and power of technology is outpacing 
already inadequate privacy and criminal laws.	 
</P>
<P>Laws analogous to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which 
prohibits unauthorized snooping into electronic communications, are 
needed to protect us from the dangerous and watchful eye of Big 
Brother, as the new technology creates an almost Orwellian potential 
for surveillance and invites abuse.	 
</P>
