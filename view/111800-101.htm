The Gods of Bloviation have spoken. It's the Florida Fiasco. It's thisclose to a Constitutional Crisis. Maybe, declared ABC's Cokie Roberts last Sunday, it's "the most partisan time that we have seen in our lives." Or, as the Dean of D.C., David Broder, sermonized, "This nation has rarely appeared more divided than it does right now." 
<P> Oh, please. A more partisan time than the impeachment of less than two years ago? A more divided America than that of Vietnam or even the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings? Then why has just about everybody except Al Gore, George W. Bush and their fiercest partisans had so much fun? </P>
<P> Whatever else may be the legacy of the Clinton years, one thing is certain: The disconnect lives on. The apocalyptic shrillness generated by the Washington establishment, and amplified 24/7 by TV's latest media thon, is utterly askew from the mood in the country. As the talking heads were shocked by polls revealing that Americans didn't want Bill Clinton sent packing at the height of Monicagate, so they were taken aback by polls revealing that the benighted citizenry has the patience to wait out a deadlocked election. </P>
<P> The reason for this national equanimity is obvious. Collectively Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have succeeded in uniting the country in exactly one bipartisan belief — that neither of them deserves to be president. The election result, a tie, was the perfect, indeed patriotic outcome to the cynical, scripted campaign they both ran: Let them both lose. And now, thanks to the political, legal and media histrionics of the post-election campaign, our unspoken wish has come true. Both will lose — no matter who is the nominal winner.</P>
<P> Even were the entire country able to conduct a "re-vote" of the election, it's hard to imagine vastly different results. Since Nov. 7, both candidates have only ratified the voters' judgment that neither man is deserving of a mandate or capable of rising above his considerable limitations. </P>
<P> Mr. Gore's public protestation that what he is "focused on" is "not the contest, but our democracy" offers yet further confirmation of his unctuous disingenuousness. (And who but Mr. Gore would ostentatiously pay a visit to the movie "Men of Honor" when trying to prove he is one?) Mr. Bush, who chose to start a transition while ballots were still being counted and then hid for days behind the heavily pomaded visage of Daddy's old consigliere James Baker, is still the entitled rich kid who relies on family retainers and old-boy connections to carry him through a crisis. But as Mr. Gore's touch-football photo op didn't turn him into a Kennedy, neither did Mr. Bush's facial bandage transform him into John McCain. These guys are interim leaders for an interim age, and all the recounts in the world are not going to alter either's DNA.</P>
<P> This is why voter turnout was what the election expert Curtis Gans characterized as "very low," despite the buckets of money spent and the widespread expectation of a historic photo finish in which every vote might count. As late as Election Eve, Harvard's Vanishing Voter measure of "voter involvement" in the election stood at 50 percent, with 48 percent deeming the race "boring." </P>
<P> The only antidote to the boredom was the merciful departure of the candidates from center stage. Once they did exit, on Election Night, America tuned in. The TV audience for the returns jumped 63 percent from four years ago — even clearing the crucial cultural threshold of outnumbering the audience for the final episode of "Survivor." Within days, the Vanishing Voter involvement index skyrocketed to 73 percent, with only 17 percent declaring themselves bored. "This is better than the Subway Series," one New York voter told The Washington Post — and he's right. What makes it better is that the election now has become an extra-inning sports event being played by ever-changing rules more complicated than those of championship bridge. At last we have the Olympics competition we were deprived of in the fall, being played out in real time.</P>
<P> Like a post-season sports competition, the post-election is not a fierce partisan civil war so much as a nearly substance-free battle over the single, non-ideological issue of who will win and who will lose. What else is at stake here? Not a civil rights debate, or the prosecution of a war, or the prosecution of a president, or even the ascendancy of liberalism or conservatism. In the gridlocked, divided Congress at hand, Mr. Bush isn't going to be able to bring off a mammoth tax cut or appoint a new Justice Thomas; Mr. Gore won't be able to bloat entitlements. If this is a partisan fight deeply dividing a nation, as our pundits purport, it's all form and no content. Instead of the Blue vs. the Gray, we have a scorched-earth war between two prescription-drug plans.</P>
<P> Another cliché of the moment has it that, whatever else is happening, we are at least witnessing a fine civics lesson that will benefit the nation's callow youth. Well, everyone now knows what the Electoral College is, but beyond that lies P.R. and legal wrangling more redolent of a class-action lawsuit than the Continental Congress. When the Republicans start championing federal authority and the Democrats the autonomy of the states, it's clear that there are no principles at stake beyond those of Vince Lombardi.</P>
<P> For all the self-congratulatory talk about our civics lesson, the one real civic crisis to emerge from Decision 2000 is played down on TV: the erroneous manipulation of the public by false and premature predictions on Election Night. The stampede to award Mr. Bush Florida — and the presidency — began on Rupert Murdoch's Fox News Channel at 2:16 a.m. and was uncannily echoed by all the other networks in the ensuing four minutes. Thanks to Jane Mayer of The New Yorker, we now know how the Fox call setting off this avalanche was engineered in part by John Ellis, a Bush first cousin in charge of the we-report-you-decide network's prediction desk. Billy Tauzin, a Republican from Louisiana, is calling for Congressional hearings on the entire panoply of network behavior of Nov. 7. This could be the best Congressional circus of its genre since Charles Van Doren starred in the game-show investigations of the 50's. </P>
<P> It may certainly prove more scintillating than what appears to be the election's litigious endgame. Tedium is the great leveler in America's news epics, and in the past 48 hours you could feel the nation putting itself to sleep by counting Florida judges. By Wednesday night MSNBC was so desperate to find partisan clowns other than the omnipresent camera-hog-without-portfolio Alan Simpson that it dug up former Senator Dennis DeConcini, a long-departed Arizona Democrat, and the cryogenically preserved Steve Forbes. By Thursday my local NBC affiliate was trying to hold viewers with stories like "Learn why Cher refused to take part in Jesse Jackson's protest!" and by yesterday MSNBC had added what soon proved to be a gratuitous absentee-ballot countdown clock, a perfect segue into today's real sports event in Tallahassee, the Florida-Florida State game.</P>
<P>  This is going to play out on television for the entire next four years," said NBC's Tim Russert. Not when the ratings tank. Unlike the impeachment mediathon, this one lacks the crucial crowd-pleasing element of sex.</P>
<P> Whatever the election's outcome, the result is likely to be the same anyway. If Mr. Bush wins, especially without taking the popular vote, the Democrats will delegitimize the election in any way they can, taking particular delight in pursuing that Sunshine State Evita, Katherine Harris — a political gift who will keep on giving. Should Mr. Gore win, that old band of Vincent Foster conspiracy theorists will reunite to target Palm Beach County Commissioner Carol Roberts and the rest of her chad- counters; Dan Burton will lead the investigation into what The Wall Street Journal has already labeled an attempted Democratic coup d'état. Two years from now, the party that controls the White House is likely to lose untold seats in Congress as well, frustrating the "winning" president's ability to govern even further. If an economic downturn is thrown into the mix, the president who presides over it may find himself and his party consigned to long- term political oblivion.</P>
<P> This is one year when it's probably better to be a sore loser than a sore winner. But such is the narrow vision of both contenders that they may be the last people in America to figure that out. </P>
