Israel's defeat in southern Lebanon, its hasty withdrawal and the
still-turbulent situation created after 20 years of a wasteful,
incredibly destructive and, in the end, useless displays of military
power requires sober analysis free of the distortions imposed by the U.S.
media. The Israeli military presence in Lebanon was never really about
the "defense" of Israel's northern border but about political objectives
designed originally to defeat the Palestine Liberation Organization, then
to change Lebanon's political structure to its advantage and finally to
pressure Syria into accepting its diktats.
<p>The first of these succeeded partially, and in 1993 ended up
delivering an exiled and sidelined Yasser Arafat as a docile partner with
Israel in ending the intifada, policing the still-occupied Palestinian
territories and attempting (so far unsuccessfully) to conclude the
Palestinian quest for self-determination to Israel's advantage. The other
two policy objectives were abject failures, as witness the crumbling of
Israel's mercenary South Lebanon Army (routinely described by the media
as "Christian," whereas it was equally if not predominantly Shiite), the
emergence of Hezbollah with a successful policy of resistance and
counterattack and the continued refusal of Syria to accept Israel's terms
on less than complete withdrawal before making any peace deals.
<p>The stranglehold on U.S. media perspectives maintained by the
supporters of Israel has produced an astonishingly reductive view of
reality. Consider the use of the word "defense" to describe Israeli
tactics, when it has the Middle East's only offensive air force, nuclear
arsenal and a military-political apparatus totally supported by the
world's only superpower. How can it be "defense" when for 22 years Israel
has persisted in its military occupations, in bombing Arab capital
cities, in destroying civilian infrastructures and, in Lebanon alone,
causing at least 20,000 deaths and uncounted thousands of wounded? Or
take the terms "peace" and "peace process." Israel has tried to force
"peace" on subjugated leaderships in the Arab world, and at the same time
has continued aggressive policies of colonization and annexation that
have earned it opprobrium everywhere, except in the U.S. media, where its
ethnic cleansing and systematic discrimination against non-Jews are
either overlooked or justified cynically by exploiting Holocaust
memories.
<p>There is a wider and wider gap between U.S. supporters of Israel and
Israeli citizens, a sizable majority of whom know that in the end Israel
must acknowledge a realistic view of its own history and actuality before
it can even nominally be accepted in the Arab and Islamic world.
<p>No matter how many times deflating phrases like "Iranian-backed" or
"terrorist" are affixed by Israel and its media allies to the militias
that beat the fabled Israeli Defense Forces in Lebanon, there is no way
to explain away that entirely local campaign that Israel so conclusively
lost. Israel's retreat from Lebanon was clearly the result of a
determined popular resistance willing to take punishment and make
sacrifices. Hezbollah was mobile (where Israel's huge armored and air
preponderance were both cumbersome and ineffective, despite the damage
they caused), braver and far more resourceful than the disillusioned and
frightened foreign troops they faced alongside their treacherous local
allies.
<p>Since the U.S. media concentrated so one-sidedly on Israeli travails
in Lebanon, it was forgotten that Israel had for more than 20 years
defied the U.N. resolution enjoining it to leave and had for years
imposed a dreadful regime of torture, collaboration and pillage on the
Lebanese citizens there. Rid of this reign of terror at last, liberated
southern Lebanon is the first challenge to the region's future that
neither Israel nor the Arab regimes are likely to meet successfully.
<p>The notion that the Arab-Israeli conflict might be ended has so far
been based exclusively on what Anwar Sadat openly expressed and embodied,
the idea that charismatic official leaders could negotiate a new peace
between old enemies. This has been disproved by the examples of Egypt,
Jordan and the PLO, whose leaders have gone all the way toward Israel
without persuading their populations to follow suit. With only an
insignificant number of exceptions, no cultural or political figure of
independent national stature, no popular or really autonomous
nongovernmental organization among those Arabs whose leaders have made
peace with Israel has in any serious way accepted the peace. Israel has
remained "unnormalized" and basically isolated at the only level that
counts in the long run. Resistance to its presence (not to its
existence--the difference is important) is still strenuously displayed.
<p>Certainly, Arab and Israeli businessmen continue their limited
association, and there seems to be no sign of arresting globalization,
but that is all. In other words, the conventional wisdom about
peacemaking in the Middle East has essentially been disproved, which is
not to say that it will now cease or that present peace tracks will be
abandoned. They won't. However, an unexpectedly prominent landscape of
opposition and resilience has been revealed and will not now quickly
resubmerge. We must not forget either that the structures of power in
Israel and the Arab countries are the oldest in the post-World War II
period, they are still extremely militarized and largely oligarchical,
and therefore unresponsive to change of the sort the Hezbollah victory
represents.
<p>The United States historically has done business with obvious
interlocutors and counterparts in the Middle East, despite occasional
attempts either to co-opt the Islamic opposition (as in Afghanistan) or
to promote an American-style civil society (through foundations, business
school programs and academic exchange). A vast sector of life sits just
beyond the view offered by the regimes and the U.S., and for the first
time since the PLO emerged and was defeated in Jordan in 1970, this
unofficial aspect of life geopolitically threatens the old, mostly frozen
structures.
<p>Islamic movements are part of this unofficial sector, of course, and
what they offer is one intellectual and cultural alternative to the
conventional one. Many of these Islamic currents contradict one another,
but they all speak of resistance to U.S.-style cultural conformity and
consumerism. They oppose what Israel represents: an arrogantly alien
force that must be de-Zionized and defeated or stopped rather than
negotiated with supinely. And they all claim a connection to "authentic"
popular forms of cultural and civil tradition.
<p>There is a healthy secular opposition as well, fighting the regimes on
several fronts--for example, journalistic opposition to repressive press
laws across the Arab world; the human rights movement against torture and
politicized judiciary branches; the women's rights and burgeoning
environmental associations. These exist in every Arab society today.
There also are academic, labor union and writers' and artists'
organizations that are vocal and active.
<p>These secular forces provide stiff competition to their religious
counterparts. The situation is especially heated now, not only because
Hezbollah liberated southern Lebanon without official state support, but
because all the front-line regimes face huge succession problems. Think
of Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine. The first thing that comes
to mind is how the old order cannot easily pass itself on as a new and
ever-changing realignment of forces is galvanized into opposition by the
failure of what most people regard as unpopular, isolated and aging
leaderships. For the first time since independence, Middle Eastern
politics will be more influenced by how these seething internal currents
play out than by outside powers or prominent figureheads. Whatever peace
arrangements are made will therefore be subject to what in the Arab world
and in Israel will come out on top, such as political parties like Shas,
Hezbollah and Hamas, plus a whole slew of secular opponents who will
battle for a larger say.
<p>I am convinced that the secular opposition will ultimately win out
over its religious opponents. The Middle East is far too heterogeneous,
politically aroused and modernized a region to submit to what are in
effect backward-looking, absurdly anachronistic visions that aim at
establishing Muslim and Jewish theocracies. A rigorous contest over such
matters as citizenship, identity and political authority is the one that
counts, and it is this that will determine the future in the long run.
Meanwhile, we can expect volatile times ahead.
