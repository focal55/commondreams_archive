The whales are dying.
<P>
    In the last few years, we have lost about one-fifth of our local orca population. This last winter, in the first-ever sighting of our local whales south of the Columbia River, K and L pods traveled at least as far south as Monterey.  
<P>
    At a time when many local residents and business owners appear unaware that there is a problem, local scientists are already labeling these orca "goners." 
<P>
     Perhaps you, too, were unaware that the southern resident orca population, already labeled "threatened" by Canadian authorities, is in complete crisis. Marked by a large and increasing death rate, first-ever prey switching, increasingly erratic feeding behaviors and, quite often, "wasting" before death, it appears that our local whale population is in mid-collapse.
<P>
     There are no other symptoms of this that one would expect to see than those we are now seeing.
<P>
    Biologists throughout the Northwest universally agree that, like a stool with three legs, the whales are being stressed in three ways: a sharp decline in salmon stocks, pollutants and boat interactions.
<P>
     Some local scientists think it is already too late to save these whales. Personally, I take the somewhat more optimistic view that we might have two or three years.
<P>
      We might call this a window of time we have to prevent this catastrophe; unfortunately, during that period we will not be able to appreciably change salmon or pollution levels -- extremely worthy enterprises that will take decades. What we can do, working together, in weeks or months, is to greatly reduce the third source of stress, caused by boats.
<P>
    As recently as, say, seven years ago, there was no commercial whale-watching activity; even private whale boat activity was low. Today we have the world's largest commercial whale-watching fleet, which is commonly outnumbered by private craft. It is not unusual to have over a hundred boats on the whales on a summer holiday weekend.
<P>
     Whether by coincidence or cause, this popularity has come in tandem with the "Free Willy" movie series.
<P>
     To the degree that boat stress is contributing to the whales' demise, these movies might have better been named, "Kill Willy." In a very real sense, the whales are being loved to death.
<P>
   Imagine the impact on business -- on all of us -- if the orca disappeared.
<P>
    For the last few years, the whale-watching industry and the Whale Museum's Soundwatch program have worked hard to self-regulate this problem, producing better results than federal laws. Unfortunately, this is exactly the period of time of the population's collapse: Their best efforts are not enough.
<P>
    Three years ago, in a meeting of all local whale researchers and watchers, I suggested we might be seeing the first indications of a population crisis. Little was done then: Now it's our last chance to act.
<P>
     For that reason, the non-profit Orca Relief is circulating a petition to the San Juan County commissioners, urging them to make the chasing of whales -- defined as "serially moving a boat in order to maintain contact" -- illegal. This is an approach that would allow a new (and enforceable) kind of whale watching, while just possibly assuring there will be whales left to watch.
<P>
     I would urge you to get a copy, at <a href="http://www.orcarelief.org" target="_new">www.orcarelief.org</a>, and sign it.
