 LAST MONTH, a private corporation announced that it was winning the 
race with the public scientific team, the Human Genome Project, to 
decipher a human volunteer's genome. This corporate bid to own and 
control information about the human genetic code is an omen of the 
next great struggle facing humanity. Will corporations be able to 
know and control human destinies based on their intimate knowledge of 
a person's DNA, a possible road map of their future?
<P>  The mapping of the genome opens a Pandora's box for the balance of 
power between corporations and humans, as well as for the meritocracy 
Americans have strived to create. If corporations can read a person's 
DNA, they can control their fate. The threat demands one of the 
strongest privacy privileges ever enacted -- an absolute seal on 
every DNA test that is administered and establishing criminal 
penalties for corporate trafficking in such information.	 
</P>
<P>  Today, banks typically utilize ``credit scoring'' to determine 
whether an applicant is approved for a loan and at what interest 
rate. The score is a composite of reasonable factors, such as the 
person's timeliness in paying bills, and more arbitrary factors, such 
as how many times a credit report on the applicant has been 
requested. What if banks, insurance companies and other corporations 
could view genetic profiles of applicants, a genetic score based on a 
simple DNA test? These corporation could know the person's likeli 
hood of developing chronic or fatal diseases, how old they will 
probably be when they die, and the potential their children have of 
developing diseases. Such power in the hands of today's Goliath 
corporations, which freely share personal information about human 
beings, could restrict a person's employment, educational, insurance 
and other financial opportunities.	 
</P>
<P>  Absent a genetic privacy seal, banks could make a compelling case 
to view an applicant's DNA before making a loan. If you are likely to 
die soon, the bank should know to have a co-signer. Already, life and 
health insurance companies require that medical records be shared, 
and blood work be performed, before a policy is issued. If DNA 
testing can accurately depict any medical state in the future, why 
should Americans not be required to submit the results of those tests as a 
condition of coverage, just as people today have to provide a urine 
sample?	 
</P>
<P>  American society's answer will say everything about the state of 
human vs. corporate rights. For the purposes of law, corporations 
have already won the same rights as people to the Bill of Rights -- 
freedoms of speech, due process and association. Despite such legal 
fictions, the founding fathers had in mind only the human being's 
guarantee to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.	 
</P>
<P>  However, California corporations have already invoked their 
constitutional protections in opposing recent state legislation that 
requires people to affirmatively allow the sharing of their private 
financial information before corporations do so.	 
</P>
<P>  Genetic privacy is the ultimate stakes in the fight between 
corporations and people for protection under the Bill of Rights. An 
American's fundamental right to liberty should include never being 
forced to submit to a DNA test as condition of commerce. The people's 
rights to control their lives should trump any corporation's right to 
knowledge about them that could predetermine their future.	 
</P>
<P>  Genetic disposition is certainly not within a human being's 
control and diet, environment and other behavior more determinative. 
Matt Ridley, author of Genome, writes, ``Unless you are unlucky 
enough to have a rare and serious genetic condition, and most of us 
do not, the impact of genes upon our lives is a gradual, partial, 
blended sort of thing.''	 
</P>
<P>  Unfortunately, insurance companies, banks and other corporations 
do not operate on the basis of such subtleties. They try to hedge 
their financial risks, often based on the most unreasonable 
stereotypes, in the same way that insurers have based auto insurance 
premiums on where people live, grouping them by their ZIP code, 
rather than how they drive.	 
</P>
<P>  Even if a person has a 99 percent chance of contracting a deadly 
disease, the power to know or not know, share or not share, must 
always reside with the human being, not the corporation. Otherwise, 
the California Constitution's guarantee in Article 1, Section 1 -- 
the right to privacy -- will be hollow.	 
</P>
<P>Penalties for genetic crimes should be the corporate equivalent of 
dealing crack at an elementary school. There is no reason for a 
corporation to have information about your DNA, except to 
discriminate. The ultimate test for our society's commitment to 
privacy, and its dedication to human rights over a corporation's, is 
whether people can be guaranteed a private audience with intimate 
knowledge about their potential fate.
