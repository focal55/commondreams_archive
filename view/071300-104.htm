The Democrats have been quiet since the failure of the latest nuclear missile defense test. It's good news, but they are not sure whether the president sees it that way, and they don't want to press him while he's conducting delicate negotiations at Camp David. <P>
In the meantime, the air is filled with sophistries from missile defense fans, who are busy translating the failure into a "disappointment" and assuring us that the humiliating setback will not make the slightest difference in the mad rush to pour concrete now to meet a self-inflicted deadline of 2005, when, according to Pentagon calculations, North Korea will be targeting Detroit. <P>
The lessening of that likelihood, evident in a summit meeting of North and South Korean leaders, was brushed aside. "There are other rogue states," they snap. The only official reaction was to change the designation of "rogue states" to "states of concern." North Korea hasn't tested since 1998, and plans are going forward for massive north and south family reunions. <P>
Nuclear missile defense is not about foreign policy. Neither is it about technology. It's about religion. It's about being a Republican, about being an American. Belief in a defensive shield is an article of faith, a litmus test. A heretic in the GOP is someone who insists that the system work and be needed.<P>
Republican demagoguery and presidential triangulation have taken the heart out of Democrats who know better. Republicans roar, "You don't want to defend your country against missile attacks?" and Democrats cower. The answer from 25 Nobel laureates is not that we don't want to but that we can't.<P>
The scientists have stepped into the political vacuum left by the Democrats. They have organized forums and seminars and letters to editors. They have formulated a reply to the GOP charge that it is immoral not to erect defenses against incoming missiles. Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist Ted Postol says it is more immoral to assure people that they will be entirely safe under a nuclear umbrella that will not protect them.<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen, a Republican, emitted a striking sophistry about the fiasco: "The test itself was a disappointment but it was one of those failures that was least expected. . . . That happens from time to time--that you have a failure of something that's fairly routine."<P>
That is a kind of logic that you can't apply at Wimbledon, which was happily going on at the same time. Say Venus Williams had tripped over a tennis ball and missed a shot. Would the judges have discounted it because it did not involve her backhand or serve or other basic elements of her game? I don't think so.<P>
Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) made a more sensible comment: "It's hard to see how they can recommend a deployment decision on a missile system that doesn't work." Dorgan is a forthright skeptic. He invited Frances FitzGerald, author of "Way Out There in the Blue," the history of Ronald Reagan and Star Wars, to address a group of dubious Democrats. She told them that Reagan had found the inspiration for the shield from the silver screen. In "Torn Curtain," a 1966 Alfred Hitchcock movie, Paul Newman pledges: "We will produce a defensive weapon that will make all nuclear weapons obsolete, and thereby abolish the terror of nuclear warfare." That is almost precisely the phrasing Reagan used in presenting his Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars.<P>
Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan (D-N.Y.) points out that the failure of the kill vehicle to do its stuff gave President Clinton the perfect out. But Democrats don't know if the president wants it. He likes to have it both ways. While Clinton would like to avoid the opprobrium of being the Democratic commander in chief who broke ground for a space extravaganza historically resisted by his party, he does not want to give the Republicans a free shot at his chosen successor, Al Gore, for being "weak on defense." And although old Democrats have trouble watching Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbot--who as a journalist was a stellar proponent of arms control--over in Moscow negotiating his heart out to sabotage the central arms control scroll, the ABM treaty, Clinton seems to expect some credit for resisting George W. Bush's grandiose scheme for a real, all-out Star Wars scenario. <P>
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle (S.D.) expects Democrats to speak up now, to preach the old Democratic gospel of diplomacy and deterrence. And Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) introduced a measure that calls for future tests to be conducted under conditions more truly representative of space when all hell is breaking loose. Rep. John Tierney (D-Mass.) is pushing for hearings in the House so that Democrats can finally talk back.
