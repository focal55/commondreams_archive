<p>In an unprecedented twist in the bitter struggle at the Pacifica radio network,
a group of 42 prominent progressives signed a <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views/022400-104.htm">letter</a> this week calling
for a truce between management at the alternative broadcast network and workers
at its flagship station in Berkeley -- but in doing so, they may
have only escalated the conflict.

<p>"I'm looking for peace," says filmmaker Saul Landau, the <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views/022400-104.htm">letter's</a> author and a fellow at
the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank. While the letter calls for  reconciliation, it also castigates the network's critics for "Pacifica bashing" and calls
a recent strike by free-lance contributors to the Pacifica News Network "unconscionable." Other prominent signers include Oakland
mayor Jerry Brown, actors Ed Asner and Mike Farrell, and David Corn, Washington
editor of The Nation.

<p>"I keep asking (Pacifica critics), what is the strategy?" says Landau. "How are we going to get past
this?  And I hear accusations:  They did this, and they did that.
I say that may be so, but what's the strategy to move on?"

<p>Many KPFA supporters, though, see the letter more as a call to arms than a call for peace.
"It's not conciliatory," said Andrea Buffa, executive director of Media Alliance and a vocal KPFA supporter. 
"It's a veiled
attack on Pacifica critics."

<p>The dispute has proven deeply divisive among the progressive community.  The conflict began with the abrupt dismissal in March 1999 of
Nicole Sawaya, the popular general manager at KPFA, which shocked long-standing
employees and listeners. When Larry Bensky, a KPFA talk show host sometimes called
the station's "signature voice," criticized the dismissal on the air, he was fired.
KPFA staff cried censorship.

<p>Listeners and supporters picketed the station, drawing national media attention.  The level of vitriol escalated in July when "Flashpoints" host Dennis
Bernstein was pulled off the air and forcibly removed from the premises for
criticizing Pacifica management on his show.  The following month saw a lockout of
station staff by Pacifica management, live programming replaced by taped shows and
music, and nonstop demonstrations.  Names like Joan Baez, Noam Chomsky and others chimed in to support the protest.

<p>Landau says he was impelled to write the letter after the conflict's latest flare-up: In early
February Dan Coughlin, news director for Pacifica National News, was removed from his
duties after running a piece that addressed a conflict between Pacifica management
and 16 Pacifica affiliates.  A group of news free-lancers for PNN called for a work
stoppage in protest.  Pacifica said Coughlin was moved for other reasons.

<p>While affirming the free-lancers' right to disagree with Pacifica management, Landau charges that, "They do not have a right to cloak their
grievances in the language of a bona fide labor dispute," traditionally a powerful
symbol among those on the left.

<p>Striking Pacifica free-lancer Robin Urevich disagrees.  "Many strikes don't have to do with
working conditions and wages, but have to do with workers' ability to have some
control over their work," she says. She compares the striking free-lancers to nurses who
strike out of concern that patients get good care.

<p>Landau says
he's simply out to calm the debate.  "This is an act of faith -- faith in the reasonableness
of people on both sides," he says.

<p>That's not how it sounds to Nicole Sawaya, the former KPFA general manager whose
dismissal started it all.  She credits Landau with good intentions, but says, "Now is not
the time to join hands and sing 'Kumbaya.'"  She puts the blame on Pacifica management, saying
KPFA's efforts to negotiate "have been rebuffed every step of the way."

<p>Though the letter decries the "veritable war on Pacifica" which "could lead to the
death of the only alternative radio network progressives possess," Landau insists that the letter does not support management. "Pacifica made terrible
mistakes.  I don't think (in the letter) I've said anything good about how the board has
handled things," he says. 

<p>As the free-lancer strike continues, the February 27 meeting of Pacifica's board in
Washington promises to be acrimonious, amid charges that new nominees for the board are
continuing what Pacifica critics say is a trend toward stacking Pacifica's board with
non-progressive, corporate-friendly members.
