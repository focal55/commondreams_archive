This time a year ago, a truly prescient person monitoring bus, car
and plane traffic into Seattle could have predicted that Al Gore's
presidential bid faced serious trouble on its left.
<p>The mostly young people pouring up Interstate 5 from Oregon and
California and other states were the Green Street Warriors who managed to
paralyze downtown Seattle and shut down the opening ceremonies of the
World Trade Organization conference. And these same young people made up
the core organizers of Ralph Nader's Green Party candidacy, which denied
Al Gore the crucial margin in Florida and New Hampshire.
<p>As the WTO delegates abandoned Seattle in defeat at the end of that
tumultuous week last year, many on the left hailed the coming of age of a
new coalition. Among its supposed components: the militant greens in the
form of Earth First!, Rainforest Action and Direct Action Network; more
mainstream green groups such as the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth;
Ralph Nader's citizens' trade campaign; labor's legions mustered in
Seattle under the banners of the AFL-CIO.
<p>With the advantage of nearly 12 months' hindsight we can now see that
these months have offered us a political parable of a very different
nature, a parable about the ability of a relatively small number of
militant people to shake the system by sticking to their principles.
<p>After all, what happened to the labor legions after the WTO was run
out of Seattle? It was not long before the Clinton administration thumbed
its nose at the AFL-CIO by pushing through Congress permanent trade
normalization status for China, a campaign led by then-Commerce Secretary
Bill Daley, now Al Gore's campaign manager. Big Labor fumed, but the
fuming was impotent, as Clinton and Gore had reckoned from the start it
would be. After getting a sound kick in the teeth over China, the AFL-CIO
threw itself into the task of electing Al Gore.
<p>Like the AFL-CIO, the big green groups rallied to the Gore campaign,
demanding nothing in return. Indeed, the ties between mainstream
environmentalism and the Democratic Party are so enduring that even
Friends of the Earth, which vigorously opposed Gore in the Democratic
primaries and endorsed Bill Bradley, came crawling back into the fold. By
late October, Friends of the Earth's executive director, Brent
Blackwelder, was touring the Pacific Northwest urging Nader supporters to
back Gore.
<p>But a huge gulf now separates the official leaders of America's green
groups from activists across the country. Carl Pope could get his board
to commit the Sierra Club's financial resources to Gore, but that didn't
mean that the group's activists obeyed Pope's call to fall into line and
abandon Nader. The young folk on those Seattle streets who locked down
and awaited the gas, pepper spray and batons a year ago were not of a
mood to be intimidated into supporting the Democrats.
<p>There is a new breed of green: people who have come of age during the
Clinton-Gore years, and who have cut their teeth as activists fighting
projects that had been given the OK by the Clinton-Gore administration.
<p>After Seattle last November, these green militants went on to protest
against the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington
D.C. And then they decided it was important to organize protests at both
political conventions.
<p>One would have thought that Gore and his strategists might have
scented danger as the L.A. police trampled green activists at the
Democratic convention and sprayed them with gas and rubber bullets. But
they never woke up until it was too late, because they had been operating
so long under the assumption that these green activists had nowhere but
the Democratic Party to turn to.
<p>Now the Democrats gnash their teeth as they look at those 97,000 green
votes in Florida that went to Nader. In a Southern state like Florida
this defection was as inconceivable to Democratic Party regulars as was
the prospect to the mayor of Seattle of having the WTO meeting shut down.
Democratic leaders and their friends at the top of the big green outfits
had done business amiably for so long that they entirely missed the
reality of a new generation for whom these accommodations were entirely
repugnant.
<p>A year has passed since Seattle and they remain deluded. One of the
environmentalists' top lobbyists recently warned Nader's supporters that
he'll be looking for them "on the front lines in D.C." when Bush takes
power. But the front lines aren't in Washington D.C. They're in the
forests of the Pacific Northwest; in the chemical plants and oil
refineries of Cancer Alley; in the wildlands of Montana; the strip mines
of Appalachia.
