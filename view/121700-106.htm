LET ME tell you why I believe that every vote in Florida 
should count.
<P>  In 1965, as a 19-year-old college student, I was part of a mid-20th century 
children's crusade, the second Freedom Summer. Hundreds of white students 
headed South to join local civil rights activists to register black voters, 
integrate the schools and desegregate public accommodations.
</P>
<P>  Today's younger voters cannot begin to imagine what some people had to go 
through to cast a ballot, or how important a vote was to their lives. Thirty-
five years ago, the Florida Panhandle surrounding Tallahassee belonged to the 
Deep South. In some places, blacks had not voted since Reconstruction. Many 
high school students didn't know that blacks had ever voted in the Deep South.
</P>
<P>  Few Southern whites welcomed our arrival. The summer before, members of the 
Klan, in collusion with local sheriffs, had killed three civil rights workers 
in Mississippi and buried their bodies in an earthen dam. The names Andrew 
Goodman, James Cheney and Michael Schwerner were added to those of Medgar 
Evers and all the other civil rights workers murdered in the South. We had no 
idea what lay in store for us.
</P>
<P>  I ended up in Gadston County, west of Tallahassee, working with the 
Congress On Racial Equality, or CORE. Blacks were in the majority in that 
county, and several had registered to vote as early as 1962. In some ways, 
registration was relatively easy. There was no literacy test and no poll tax, 
as was the case in other Southern states. All you had to do was go to the 
registrar's office at the county courthouse, which was open only Tuesday 
afternoons. You filled out a form, and in front of God and everyone, signed 
your name.
</P>
<P>  But people who registered lost their jobs. Their families were threatened. 
Nightriders fired bullets into their homes. They couldn't get credit to plant 
their crops.
</P>
<P>  Meanwhile, we CORE workers knocked on doors, spoke in churches, held 
meetings, passed out flyers and organized car pools. And every Tuesday 
afternoon a small line of folks formed at the county courthouse, where they 
dared to register to vote.
</P>
<P>  Gadston provided a stark vision of what happens to people whose votes don't 
count. The economy of the county was based on plantations which grew shade 
tobacco. Many black workers lived in isolation in company-owned houses. Their 
bosses paid them in company scrip, good only at the company store. They rarely 
saw real money, and they never were out of debt.
</P>
<P>  These conditions existed in other parts of the South, but in Gadston they 
were even more oppressive. If workers left the plantation Sheriff O. C. Wade 
arrested them and brought them back to work off their debt.
</P>
<P>  This kind of coerced labor still exists in some parts of the world, and 
pops up occasionally even in the United States, usually in some sweatshop 
stuffed with illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>  There is a precise term for it. It is called slavery.
</P>
<P>  Violence and intimidation pervaded the culture in the Florida Panhandle. 
After six weeks, another CORE member and I transferred to Jefferson County, 
east of Tallahassee, where we stayed in a farmhouse with a family of 
sharecroppers.
</P>
<P>  As CORE workers, all of us, black and white, embraced Rev. Martin Luther 
King Jr.'s philosophy of non-violence. In some ways this was an easy stance 
for us. The mother of the family slept with a pistol under her pillow to 
protect us, and her three small children, from nightriders enraged at the 
thought that blacks might vote.
</P>
<P>  During the daytime, however, we were on our own. More than once, armed men 
in pickup trucks chased us down the red-dirt roads, past sharecropper shacks 
with no electricity or running water, over earthen levees in the swamps, past 
children whose legs were bowed with rickets.
</P>
<P>  At the end of the summer, I returned home to Berkeley, finished college, 
then graduate school and medical school, and eventually became a public health 
physician. I never knew what happened to those people who remained in Florida.
</P>
<P>  But the stories coming out of the state over the last month are haunting. 
African Americans purged from voter lists. Old Votomatic machines jammed with 
chads in predominantly black precincts. Police roadblocks in African American 
communities on election day.
</P>
<P>  All this brings back memories of a time I had wished was long gone but 
realize is still with us in different ways.
</P>
<P>  I still see those proud, courageous black people lining up to register and 
now, in the aftermath of this election, I stare at the U.S. Supreme Court's 
words with disbelief, the majority babbling about equal protection, and I 
cannot believe that every vote was not counted.
