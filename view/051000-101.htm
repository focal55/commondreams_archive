In this season of a million marching mothers for the cause of gun-control legislation, we would do well to remember the powerful history of mothers' activism on issues related to violence and children. 
<P>

 As a historian, I have learned that violence against children is part and parcel of American history. We need only recall the horrors of slavery and the massacres of American Indians, often including children.
<P>

   Routine physical punishments of children lasted well into the 20th century. Many social critics have seen poverty, too, as a kind of violence against children.
<P>

   Today is different. Children's often-fatal brutality toward one another is occurring because guns are widely available. This manifestation of violence against children has prompted Sunday's Million Mom March and related rallies.
<P>

   Women have been in the forefront of social policy and social movements related to protecting children. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, women conducted politics generally in the name of motherhood. The international peace movement then and the creation of a U.S. Children's Bureau in 1905 were justified on the basis of women's responsibility to and knowledge about children. 
<P>

   In the same period, the progressive activist Jane Addams began a movement to bring playgrounds, libraries and clean milk to poor immigrant neighborhoods -- what we would call today ``violence prevention.''
<P>

   Addams claimed women as mothers had to look beyond their households, and that the public needed the vision of mothers. Addams and others justified women's suffrage on this basis.
<P>

   Thus motherhood, in national mythology considered to be a private experience, has often led to public demands for justice for children. And mothers drawing attention to children's victimization has often been part of broader visions of social justice. 
<P>

   The 1955 murder of a 14-year-old African-American boy, Emmett Till, for allegedly whistling at a white woman in Mississippi is often remembered as a catalyst to the civil-rights movement. What is less remembered, as historian Ruth Feldstein has noted, is that when the all-white jury delivered a not-guilty verdict for Till's murderers, Till's mother chose to open his casket because, she said, ``I wanted the whole world to see.''
<P>

   Mamie Till became an outspoken advocate for racial justice, and she helped draw massive public attention the effects of racism on African-American children. Another often forgotten example is Women Strike for Peace. Connecting children's issues with opposition to nuclear weapons, an estimated 50,000 women held a one-day ``strike for peace'' in 1961.
<P>

   As historian Amy Swerdlow observes, when WSP women were called before the House Un-American Activities Committee as suspected communists, they brought their children with them to Congress, and explained, ``This movement was inspired and motivated by mothers' love for children.''
<P>

   In the 1980s, women mobilized nationwide in the Mothers Against Drunk Driving movement, which helped enact tougher legislation against intoxicated drivers. 
<P>

   The Million Mom March recalls the power of this long tradition of maternal politics. As a slogan, it recalls the limitations of that perspective, too. 
<P>

  The women who organized these events deserve a salute. As we listen to tragic media accounts about violence against children, we need the ``good news'' of a movement of concerned mothers (and others). 
<P>

   And we need to consider the march not as an example of single-issue politics, but as part of the history of maternal politics, a politics which has continually resurfaced to protest violence, protect children, and offer a vision of a more compassionate and just social order.
<P>
