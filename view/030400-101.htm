<p>DALLAS -- John McCain has voted consistently in the Senate for the causes of 
the Christian right. He has opposed 
abortion rights, gun control and anti-discrimination laws protecting gays 
and lesbians. He voted to convict 
President Clinton. 

<p> Yet the National Right to Life 
Committee and Pat Robertson, the 
right-wing evangelist, have bitterly 
opposed him in the Republican primaries. Why? 

<p> Senator McCain asked himself 
that question in his extraordinary 
Virginia Beach speech the other day. 
He answered: "Because I don't pander to them, because I don't ascribe 
to their failed philosophy that money 
is our message."

<p> <I>Money is our message.</I> In that 
memorable phrase Senator McCain 
caught what has happened to the 
conservative movement and the Republican Party.

<p> Conservatives used to take pride in 
themselves as the movement of 
ideas. But the ideas that propelled 
them to control of Congress are now 
mostly stale or irrelevant.

<p> Fighting Communism waned as a 
theme with the crumbling of the Soviet Union and its allied regimes. The 
budget deficit, decried by  Republicans for so many decades, has been 
transformed by President Clinton 
into a surplus. Slashing taxes, as 
 George W.   
<p>Bush has learned to his 
regret, is now viewed by most of the 
public as a threat to present prosperity and future Social Security retirement benefits. 

<p> Without ideas in which they have 
confidence, most conservatives have 
focused increasingly on money as 
the way to get the public to vote for 
them. That is why they are so furious 
at Senator McCain. His proposal for 
campaign finance limits would take 
away the overwhelming financial advantage they get from their affluent 
backers. 

<p> The Republican Party has traditionally been the party of the well-to-do. But in the past its conservative 
leaders -- men like Senator Robert 
A. Taft -- were not so obsessed with 
money. They had strong policy views 
that they believed would persuade 
the public. 

<p> Governor Bush has said that the 
McCain campaign finance bill would 
be "unilateral disarmament" by the 
Republicans. He did not mean his 
words this way, but what he really 
seemed to be saying was that the 
armament of the party these days is 
not ideas but cash.

<p> In the current issue of the liberal 
biweekly The American Prospect, 
John B. Judis describes how conservative luminaries set out to maintain 
control after Republicans won the 
House in 1994. Ideological lobbyists 
like Grover Norquist of Americans 
for Tax Reform met weekly with 
Republican Congressional leaders 
and business lobbyists. The aim was 
to get so-called soft money flowing 
from corporate political action committees. And it has flowed heavily 
toward the G.O.P. 

<p>    Soft money, which is money contributed to political parties, is not 
regulated by current federal law as 
is money given to candidates. The 
legislation sponsored by Senator McCain and Senator Russell Feingold, 
Democrat of Wisconsin, would bring 
soft money under limitations. 

<p> "I have called for the reform of 
campaign finance practices that 
have sacrificed our principles to the 
demands of big-money special interests," Senator McCain said in Virginia Beach. "I have spoken against 
forces that have turned politics into a 
battle of bucks instead of a battle of 
ideas. . . . America is greater than the 
accumulation of wealth, and so our 
party should be."

<p> In those words Senator McCain 
sounded like Theodore Roosevelt decrying "malefactors of great 
wealth." Indeed, he said at the end 
that Republicans should be "the party of Theodore Roosevelt, not the 
party of special interests." 

<p> It may be that Senator McCain's 
campaign crested in Michigan. His 
losses in Virginia and Washington 
make his prospects look bleak unless 
he can pull off a miracle next week in 
New York and California. 

<p> The odds against upsetting the 
conservative powers that be were 
always daunting. But in challenging 
their money culture, and in particular what he called the Christian 
right's "agents of intolerance," Senator McCain has had a powerful impact on our politics.
