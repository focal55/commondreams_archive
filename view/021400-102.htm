<p>Much has been made of allegations of possible youthful use of
illegal drugs by Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush.
Meanwhile, his chief GOP opponent, Arizona Sen. John McCain, has admitted
that his wife not only illegally used drugs but walked away from criminal
charges. The McCains have worked to make Cindy McCain's addiction into a
political asset--despite the fact that she stole the drugs from a charity
she directed and used them while mothering four young children.
<p>In 1994, Mrs. McCain admitted that she had solicited prescriptions for
painkillers from physicians who worked for an international charity that
she founded, the American Voluntary Medical Team. She then filled the
prescriptions in the names of her staff.
<p>There are two ways to react to this behavior. According to the Betty
Ford model, people can sympathetically respond to the oppressed and
ignored wife of a busy politician who has bravely come forward to admit
her overpowering addiction. Mrs. McCain took this posture when she first
tearfully confessed her addiction. She and her husband repeated this
performance in October on the NBC program "Dateline."
<p>The other possible public reaction is one of anger. Americans are
prosecuted every day for such drug use. While most drug abusers purchase
their drugs from street dealers, Mrs. McCain used her status as a charity
director and senator's wife to cajole the drugs she wanted.
<p>In fact, Mrs. McCain was investigated by the Drug Enforcement
Administration after the agency was approached by a former staff member
of her charity. The investigation resulted in no charges or prison time
for her, and she entered a diversion program. While these records were
not made public at the time, Mrs. McCain eventually confessed her drug
use when she learned that a reporter was investigating the story.
<p>Is Mrs. McCain to be judged as a pitiable victim or as a criminal
felon? This debate is at the heart of the discussion of American drug
policy. Should we deal with illicit drug users as victims or as
criminals?
<p>Let's examine Mrs. McCain's position in these terms. She was the
privileged wife of a prominent family and spouse of an important
politician, a person who had her own position of prestige and power.
Should she not be held at least as accountable for her actions as an
uneducated inner-city drug user? After all, she could enter drug
treatment at any time she chose, unlike many drug users who find
themselves in prison.
<p>Moreover, Mrs. McCain was violating a position of trust by stealing
from a charitable organization, using its money and medical expertise to
fuel her drug use. Is this not morally more reprehensible than simply
purchasing drugs illegally?
<p>Finally, Mrs. McCain was the mother of four children at the time she
admits to using drugs--between 1989 and 1992. Her children were born in
1984, 1986, 1988 and 1991. In other words, Cindy McCain was using drugs
while raising small children, one of whom she adopted while she was an
addict. In most states, family services will remove children from a woman
who is known to be an active drug addict, and she would certainly not be
allowed to adopt a child while addicted.
<p>John McCain is a hawk in the drug war. He advocates stricter drug
laws, penalties and enforcement against drug sellers. He has had nothing
to say about redressing our punitive approach toward drug users. Of
course, McCain also supports family values. Yet if John and Cindy McCain
were not well-off and influential, they might not have a family at all.
McCain's lack of concern for street drug users contrasts sharply with the
support and understanding his wife received. It's the old American double
standard. For "straight-shooter" McCain, charity begins at home--and ends
there.
