When my alma mater, Rainier Beach High School, was built in the early 1960s, a different name was proposed. Samuel Gompers. Who, we asked? Virtually no one knew who he was. 
<P>
 They don't teach much about people like Gompers in our public schools. That's sadly ironic since he was one of those labor leaders in the late 19th century who advocated more free schools for the children of the working class. He also wanted shorter work weeks, better work conditions, higher wages, medical care and vacations. 
<P>
We don't learn about people like that in our schools because we all know them there kinda folks is known as yer basic commie pinkos. We don't teach that kinda socialist "dignity for the masses" garbage to our young'uns. Ain't that right, Bubba?
<P>
 Gompers wanted all those things so people had the time and money "to cultivate our better natures." Hmmm. Interesting comment.
<P>
 It seems that the French have a booming industry in books that bash our good old American, uh, culture. One guy called us a bunch of loud-mouthed cretins who wear Bermuda shorts with black socks and sandals and have no idea what it means to live the good life.
<P>
 Ouch! I, for one, have <i>never</i> done the black socks with shorts and sandals. I'll admit, however, my big mouth got me into trouble once - uh, or twice, maybe. But what really hurts my feelings is that crack about "living the good life."
<P>
 A great friend of mine since kindergarten made the decision long ago not to have kids. He and his wife now spend several weeks a year traveling the globe. Train trips through South America, boat rides down the Nile, hiking in Thailand. They eat exquisitely prepared meals, drink fine wine and spend leisure time reading books in the hot tub on their deck overlooking the Snoqualmie River. Sounds nice, huh? But, of course, that takes money, and he and his wife have worked hard to create the opportunities they have.
<P>
 For others, the good life is simpler. I told a co-worker about the playhouse I was building for my little girl and how she'd run outside in her pajamas first thing in the morning to play in it before the roof was even on. He told me about a swing set he built for his 5-year-old and how excited she was when he finished. She jumped in the swing and started gently rocking back and forth singing, "I love my daddy, 'cause he treats me so nice."
<P>
 "That," he said, beaming, "is what it's all about." Waving his hand dismissively at our work place he said, "We just do this so we can do the other stuff."
<P>
 There's no question my friend and his wife are living the good life and cultivating their better natures by exposing themselves (not literally) to other cultures and ideas.
<P>
 But let's face it. If you're old enough to have had a crush on Sky's niece Penny, you've pretty much been sown, cultivated, harvested and burned out for the next crop. Maybe "cultivating our better natures" actually means what we're growing. What we're bringing into the world.
<P>
 My co-worker and I are some of the lucky ones whose union wages and benefits allow us to build playhouses and swing sets for our children in our own backyards. Those same wages also allow our wives to stay home with toddlers and spend these beautiful summer days at the beach or petting zoo or museum. But many hardworking Americans don't have those opportunities.
<P>
 Columnist Bob Herbert recently wrote about parents with two children and two minimum-wage jobs. The man said he was like any other father and wanted his children to have the chance to "soar." How can kids possibly soar when their home environment is one of constant economic stress from pinching pennies just to eat? Does anyone believe those kids will grow up thinking they can go to college and become anything they want to be in this great land of opportunity? 
<P>
 Obviously, having two children when all you can swing is a minimum-wage job is not the wisest financial planning, but there are millions of families who do much better than minimum wage and still have no time or money to cultivate anything.
<P>
 Early in his first term, President Clinton said his congressional critics "lacked vision." He was quickly derided as having obviously inhaled.
<P>
 But it is a vision thing.
<P>
 It's about the vision to see the futility of spending billions of dollars to educate children without having first demonstrated the value of that education - how integral it is to living the good life in ways far more important than just economics.
<P>
 It's seeing the incredible ignorance of spending billions of dollars arming Colombian paramilitary groups to fight a hysterical drug war instead of investing in American families so they can raise children who choose not to use drugs.
<P>
 But those choices require vision that won't yield results for a generation. Instead, we have "leaders" who can't see past the next quarterly report and can only legislate mindless punishment with virtually no thoughtful prevention.
<P>
 In the United States of America in the year 2000, we have no problem finding billions of dollars to build prisons to lock up pot smokers yet we can't find the cash to provide textbooks for all our school children! What kind of fruitcakes are running this program?
