<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So it all came out right in the end: gridlock
      on the Hill and Nader blamed for sabotaging Al Gore.

      </font>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First a word about
      gridlock. We like it. No bold initiatives, like privatizing Social
      Security or shoving through vouchers. No ultra-right-wingers
      making it onto the Supreme Court. Ah, you protest, but what about
      the bold plans that a Democratic-controlled Congress and Gore
      would have pushed through? Relax. There were no such plans. These
      days gridlock is the best we can hope for.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now for blaming
      Nader. Fine by us if all that people look at are those 97,000
      Green votes for Ralph in Florida. That's good news in itself.
      Who would have thought the Sunshine State had that many progressives
      in it, with steel in their spine and the spunk to throw Eric
      Alterman's columns for The Nation into the trashcan?</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they had plenty
      of reason to dump Gore. What were the big issues for Greens in
      Florida? The Everglades. Back in 1993 the hope was that Clinton/Gore
      would push through a cleanup bill to prevent toxic runoff from
      the sugar plantations south of Lake Okeechobee from destroying
      the swamp that covers much of south-central Florida. Such hopes
      foundered on a &quot;win-win&quot; solution brokered by sugar
      barons and the real estate industry. Clinton signed off on it
      , in a conversation with Alfonso Fanjul overheard by Monica Lewinsky
      as her the commander in chief deferentially accepted his marching
      orders.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another issue prompted some of those 97,000 to
      defiantly vote for Nader: the Homestead Air Force Base, which
      sits between Biscayne National Park and the Everglades. The old
      Air Force base had been scheduled for shutdown, but then Cuban-American
      real estate interests concocted a scheme to turn the base into
      a commercial airport. Despite repeated pleas from biologists
      inside the Interior Department as well as from Florida's Greens,
      Gore refused to intervene, cowed by the Canosa family, which
      represented the big money behind the airport's boosters.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just to make sure
      there would be no significant Green defections back to the Democratic
      standard, Joe Lieberman made a last-minute pilgrimage to the
      grave of Jorge Mas Canosa, once the godfather of the sinister
      Cuban-American National Foundation.. You want one final reason
      for the Nader voter in Florida?</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Try the death penalty,
      for which Gore issued strident support in that final debate.
      Florida runs third, after Texas and Virginia as a killing machine,
      and for many progressives in the state it's an issue of principle.
      Incidentally, about half a million ex-felons, sentences and probation
      fully served, are disenfranchised permanently in Florida. A crucial
      number of these would have voted for Gore the crime fighter and
      supporter of the War on Drugs.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other reasons many Greens nationally refused to
      knuckle under and sneak back to the Gore column? You want an
      explanation of why he lost Ohio by four points and New Hampshire
      by one? Try the WTI hazardous-waste incinerator (world's largest)
      in East Liverpool, Ohio. Gore promised voters in 1992 that a
      Democratic administration would kill it. It was a double lie.
      First, Carol Browner's EPA almost immediately gave the incinerator
      a permit. When confronted on his broken pledge, Gore said the
      decision had been pre-empted by the outgoing Bush crowd. This
      too was a lie, as voters in Ohio discovered a week before Election
      2000.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">William Reilly,
      Bush's EPA chief, finally testified this fall that Gore's environmental
      aide Katie McGinty told him in the 1992 transition period that
      &quot;it was the wishes of the new incoming administration to
      get the trial-burn permit granted. The Vice President?elect would
      be grateful if I simply made that decision before leaving office.&quot;</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't think this
      was a picayune issue with no larger consequences. Citizens of
      East Liverpool, notably Terry Swearingen, have been campaigning
      across the country on this scandal for years, haunting Gore.
      So too, to its credit, has Greenpeace. They were particularly
      active in the Northeast, during Gore's primary battles with Bill
      Bradley. You can certainly argue that the last-minute disclosure
      of Gore's WTI lies prompted enough Greens to stay firm and cost
      him New Hampshire, a state which, with Oregon, would have given
      Gore the necessary 270 votes.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And why didn't Gore
      easily sweep Oregon? A good chunk of the people on the streets
      of Seattle last November come from Oregon. They care about NAFTA,
      the WTO and the ancient forests that Gore has been pledging to
      save since 1992. The spotted owl is now scheduled to go extinct
      on the Olympic Peninsula within the next decade. Another huge
      environmental issue in Oregon has been the fate of the salmon
      runs, wrecked by the Snake River dams. Gore thought he'd finessed
      that one by pretending that unlike Bush, he would leave the decision
      to the scientists. Then, a week before the election, Gore's team
      of scientists released a report saying they thought the salmon
      could be saved without breaching the four dams. Nader got 5 percent
      in Oregon, an amazing result given the intensive carpet-bombing
      by flacks for Gore like Gloria Steinem.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, Nader didn't break 5 percent nationally,
      but he should feel great, and so should the Greens who voted
      for him. Their message to the Democrats is clear. Address our
      issues, or you'll pay the same penalty next time around. Nader
      should draw up a short list of Green non-negotiable issues and
      nail it to the doors of the Democratic National Committee.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By all means credit
      Nader, but of course Gore has only himself to blame. He's a product
      of the Democratic Leadership Council, whose pro-business stance
      was designed to regain the South for the Democrats. Look at the
      map. Bush swept the entire South, with the possible exception
      of Florida. Gore's electoral votes came from the two coasts and
      the old industrial Midwest. The states Gore did win mostly came
      courtesy of labor and blacks.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take Tennessee,
      where voters know Gore best. He would have won the election if
      he'd carried his home state. Gore is good with liberals earning
      $100,000-$200,000. He can barely talk to rural people, and he
      made another fatal somersault, reversing his position on handguns
      after telling Tennessee voters for years that he was solid on
      the gun issue. Guns were a big factor in Ohio and West Virginia
      too. You can't blame Nader for that, but it's OK with us if you
      do.</font></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for Nader holding the country to ransom, what's
      wrong with a hostage taker with a national backing of 2.7 million
      people? The election came alive because of Nader. Let's hope
      he and the Greens keep it up through the next four years. Not
      one vote for Nader, Mr. Alterman? He got them where it counted,
      and now the Democrats are going to have to deal with it.
