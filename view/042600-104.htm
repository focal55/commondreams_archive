The calculated racism and financial corruption of the George Wallace regime in Alabama has been 
amply recorded in Dan Carter's 1995 
biography, "The Politics of Rage," 
and in a new two-part television documentary, "George Wallace: Settin' 
the Woods on Fire." The documentary, broadcast earlier this week as 
part of the Public Broadcasting 
Service's "American Experience" 
series, is particularly good on Mr. 
Wallace's decision to abandon the 
progressive racial views he espoused 
in a 1958 campaign for governor and 
to re-invent himself as a segregationist in time for his successful candidacy in 1962. Mr. Wallace's own daughter, Peggy Wallace Kennedy, even 
provides an explanation for this cold 
sacrifice of principle: "He loved the 
power."

<p> Of course, Mr. Wallace was not the 
first politician to trade core principle 
for power. What sets him apart is the 
price in blood that other citizens paid 
for what was, to him, a simple matter of narcissistic political gamesmanship. For many of us who came 
of age in Alabama during his heyday, 
that part of Mr. Wallace's legacy 
deserves continuing emphasis.

<p>  George Wallace should not be allowed to walk into history as an 
unusually gifted regional demagogue 
who helped usher in a new conservative era in American politics. He was 
also a chief law enforcement officer 
whose public comments incited violence and whose years in office produced a string of political murders -- 
many of them unsolved and unprosecuted.

<p> On the stump, Mr. Wallace always 
had a ready answer for the murder 
epidemic that hit Alabama after his 
election. He personally did not condone violence. But as civil rights 
leaders pointed out, that begged the 
question of the impact Mr. Wallace's 
rhetorical violence had on the gross 
and simple minds of back-alley racists. 

<p> In a personal meeting in 1965, the 
Rev. Joseph L. Lowery of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference 
reminded Mr. Wallace of their 
shared Methodist religion and 
warned the governor that his defiant 
demand that Alabamians "stand up 
for segregation" gave moral permission for thugs to use their pistols, 
lead pipes and dynamite. Mr. Wallace responded to such preachments 
with what Dan Carter correctly labeled a "reckless disregard" for the 
impact of his words on public safety 
in Alabama.

<p> It was a point that Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. made repeatedly. In 
"George Wallace: Settin' the Woods 
on Fire," we see Dr. King on Sept. 16, 
1963, one day after the church bombing that killed four black girls in 
Birmingham. "The governor said 
things and did things which caused 
these people to feel that they were 
aided and abetted by the highest 
officer in the state," Dr. King said. 
"The murders of yesterday stand as 
blood on the hands of Governor Wallace."

<p> After 37 years, there may be a 
tendency to regard Dr. King's words 
as hyperbolic. But the statistics bear 
him out. Non-fatal beatings and 
bombings were common during the 
terms of Mr. Wallace's predecessors, but investigations of Klan perpetrators went forward energetically under Mr. Wallace's mentor, Gov. 
James E. Folsom.

<p> Things changed when Mr. Wallace 
came in. By my count, 12 people died 
in Alabama in civil rights slayings in 
Mr. Wallace's first term between 
1963 and 1966.   
There were only five 
state trials resulting from these 
deaths and only two convictions. After compiling this remarkable 
record of inability to prevent mayhem on the public roads, Mr. Wallace 
then offered himself for the presidency as a law-and-order candidate.

<p> The incompetence of law enforcement in Alabama under Governor 
Wallace was mind-boggling. District 
attorneys, many of whom owed their 
election or appointment to him, felt 
little pressure to prosecute civil 
rights murders. When forced to do so 
by national opinion, they often favored manslaughter over murder indictments. 

<p> Most tellingly, Mr. Wallace turned 
the highway patrol over to Albert J. 
Lingo, whose lack of law enforcement expertise made him a laughingstock even among segregationists 
within his own department.   
Colonel 
Lingo was famously close to many 
violent citizens. In one notorious incident, a segregationist gunman reportedly called Mr. Lingo directly 
from a Black Belt town to say, "I just 
shot two preachers. You better get on 
down here." The shooter was acquitted.

<p> In the 1963 church bombing, Colonel Lingo destroyed the promising 
investigations being conducted by 
two seasoned homicide detectives, 
Ben Allen and James Hancock, by 
ordering the premature arrest of 
their chief suspect, Robert (Dynamite Bob) Chambliss. It would be 13 
years before Mr. Chambliss could be 
convicted.

<p> All this is simply to say that there 
is a part of the Wallace legacy that 
needs to be remembered alongside 
his colorful oratory, his racial pandering and his impact on the national 
political scene. He was also a lawyer 
who fomented a lawless environment 
with regard to the Constitution and  a 
governor whose failure to demand 
enforcement of basic criminal law in 
highly publicized capital cases will 
not, one hopes, be matched again by 
any future state executive.
