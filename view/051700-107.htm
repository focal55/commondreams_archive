      it's Al Gore, crime fighter, outlining his plans in a recent
      speech in Atlanta. The erstwhile dope smoker from Tennessee fears
      the erstwhile cocaine user from Texas has the edge on the crime
      issue. Hence his dash for the low ground. Among the Atlanta pledges:
      The minute he's settled into the Oval Office and signed a pardon
      for the former incumbent, President Gore will be calling for
      50,000 more cops (more half-trained recruits like the ones who
      shot Amadou Diallo) and for allowing off-duty cops to carry concealed
      weapons (which almost all of them do anyway).
      
<p>No, it's unlikely President Gore
      will endorse medical marijuana, despite his erstwhile post-Vietnam
      therapy with opium-laced marijuana in the days when he worked
      for The Tennessean. In the words of his friend John Warnecke
      (who imported the Thai sticks from the West Coast), Al &quot;smoked
      as much as anybody I knew down there, and loved it.&quot;</P>
<p>Gore is promising prisoners &quot;a
      simple deal: before you get out of jail, you have to get clean.
      And if you want to stay out, then you'd better stay clean.&quot;
      Not only does he want to test prisoners for drugs while they're
      in jail, he wants to test parolees twice a week and return them
      to jail if they fail. Other features of Al's war on crime: He
      wants to put Tommy Hilfiger out of business. How else can we
      interpret Gore's call for gang-free zones, banning &quot;gang-related&quot;
      clothing? What about gang-related music? Hmmm, Tipper tried that
      last one, and it didn't work out too well.</P>
<p>Among Gore's other big plans to
      combat crime: He wants to target telemarketers who prey on seniors.
      What about telemarketers who prey on people sitting down to dinner?
      George W. says he'll put them on death row. Where are you on
      that one, Al?</P>
<p>Here
      we are in a time when a sizable chunk of the population think
      there are some serious flaws in the justice system. Governor
      of Illinois George Ryan, a believer in capital punishment, suspends
      the death penalty in his state because he no longer believes
      it can be fairly administered. New York and Los Angeles are in
      an uproar over trigger-happy and corrupt cops. That AP photo
      of the INS snatch of Eli&aacute;n stirs Republicans in the House
      to start talking about federal goons. Sphinxlike silence from
      Gore on most of these matters, except of course a tip of his
      hat to the Miami Cubans. The only difference between him and
      George W. on the death penalty is that George W. actually laughs
      when he's quizzed about state poisoning in the Texas death house
      outside Huntsville.</P>
<p>As for Al's favored drug of the
      early seventies, last year about 700,000 were arrested for marijuana
      offenses, about 87 percent for possession. That's more than double
      the equivalent number for the early nineties. Of the federal
      prison population of 118,000, about 60 percent are in for drug-law
      violations, the largest proportion for marijuana. So Al should
      feel a special kinship with these inmates. Drug offenders constitute
      about a quarter of the 1.2 million in state prisons and the 600,000
      in local jails. Most state drug prisoners are in for heroin-
      or cocaine-related offenses, so maybe George the coke snorter
      should save his tiny reserves of compassion for them.</P>
<p>The
      other day we were at a meeting in Berkeley organized by people
      who want cities to shift gears on the drug war. One of the other
      speakers was Ethan Nadelmann of the Lindesmith Center, which
      pushes for drug-policy reform.</P>
<p>Nadelmann made some good points
      at the event and later, when we asked him about Gore's crime
      proposals. &quot;The idea that when people relapse the punishment
      should be prison is both antiscientific and fundamentally inhumane,&quot;
      Nadelmann said. &quot;The whole motto of twelve-step is 'one
      step at a time.' Relapse is part of the recovery process. The
      notion that people should be reincarcerated based on dirty urine,
      even when they are getting the rest of their life together, is
      bad public policy, costly, inefficient and, again, inhumane.&quot;</P>
<p>America is so hooked on prisons
      that right now, as Nadelmann points out, the easiest way to get
      treatment for drug addiction is to commit a crime and get yourself
      arrested. Of course, it's the worst place to get drug treatment,
      but finding it outside the criminal justice system is very tough,
      unless you have plenty of money. Someone should tell Al that
      the surest place to get drugs is prison, where it's brought in
      by the guards, the very folks who are supposed to be supervising
      punishment and cleanup. Gore won't have anything to say about
      that. He's far too chicken to take on the correctional officers'
      associations.</P>
<p>Is there a way out of the insane
      drug war, which is debauching the Bill of Rights, filling our
      prisons and failing in all its professed aims (though not its
      tacit one, of social control)? Nadelmann is thinking along the
      right lines: &quot;an alternative drug-control regime, based
      on individual sovereignty-control of your body and what you put
      into it-plus a public health program. People should not be punished
      for what they put into their bodies but for the harm they do
      to others.&quot;</P>
<p>Gore
      knows all about addiction. His sister Nancy, as he reminds us
      from time to time, was killed by cigarettes, unable to kick the
      habit even as she was breathing with one cancerous lung. He also
      knows about congenital dispositions. His wife, Tipper, is a depressive.
      He knows about therapy too, having communed with shrinks when
      he was having the midlife sag that partly prompted his 1992 book
      Earth in the Balance.</P>
<p>Suppose tobacco someday becomes
      a criminalized drug. Booze too. Suppose Sister Nancy were still
      around and got put in prison for manslaughter while driving under
      the influence of alcohol. How would brother Al feel if she were
      given more jail time because she couldn't quit smoking? How would
      he feel if she were out on parole, then put back in jail because
      nicotine or alcohol showed up in her blood in a routine test
      when she applied for a job? How would he like it if someone told
      Tipper that she should just &quot;snap out of&quot; her depression?</P>
<p>We
      doubt Al will connect the dots between Nancy's smoking habit
      and his stupid anticrime proposals. He's slow to see connections.
      After all, he stayed addicted to subsidies for his own tobacco
      farm and to tobacco-industry cash for seven years after Nancy
      died, before finally claiming that he'd tested clean.
