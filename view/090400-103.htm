If any explorers had been hiking to the North
Pole this summer, they would have had to swim the last few miles. The discovery
of open water at the Pole by an ice-breaker cruise ship in mid August surprised
many in the scientific community.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This finding, combined with two recent studies, provides
not only more evidence that the Earth's ice cover is melting, but that it is
melting at an accelerating rate. A study by two Norwegian scientists projects
that within 50 years, the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free during the summer. The
other, a study by a team of four U.S. scientists, reports that the vast
Greenland ice sheet is melting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The projection that the Arctic Ocean will lose all its
summer ice is not surprising, since an earlier study reported that the thickness
of the ice sheet has been reduced by 42 percent over the last four decades. The
area of the ice sheet has also shrunk by 6 percent. Together this thinning and
shrinkage have reduced the Arctic Ocean ice mass by nearly half.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, Greenland is gaining some ice in the higher
altitudes, but it is losing much more at lower elevations, particularly along
its southern and eastern coasts. The huge island of 2.2 million square
kilometers (three times the size of Texas) is experiencing a net loss of some 51
billion cubic meters of water each year, an amount equal to the annual flow of
the Nile River.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Antarctic is also losing ice. In contrast to the North
Pole, which is covered by the Arctic Sea, the South Pole is covered by the
Antarctic continent, a land mass roughly the size of the United States. Its
continent-sized ice sheet, which is on average 2.3 kilometers (1.5 miles) thick,
is relatively stable. But the ice shelves, the portions of the ice sheet that
extend into the surrounding seas, are fast disappearing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A team of U.S. and British scientists reported in 1999
that the ice shelves on either side of the Antarctic Peninsula are in full
retreat. From roughly mid-century through 1997, these areas lost 7,000 square
kilometers as the ice sheet disintegrated. But then within scarcely a year they
lost another 3,000 square kilometers. Delaware-sized icebergs that have broken
off are threatening ships in the area. The scientists attribute the accelerated
ice melting to a regional temperature rise of some 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5
degrees Fahrenheit) since 1940.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These are not the only examples of melting. My colleague,
Lisa Mastny, who has reviewed some 30 studies on this topic, reports that ice is
melting almost everywhere--and at an accelerating rate. (See <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/alerts/000306.html">Worldwatch
News Brief, March 6, 2000</a>) The snow/ice mass is shrinking in the world's
major mountain ranges: the Rocky Mountains, the Andes, the Alps, and the
Himalayas. In Glacier National Park in Montana, the number of glaciers has
dwindled from 150 in 1850 to fewer than 50 today. The U.S. Geological Survey
projects that the remaining glaciers will disappear within 30 years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scientists studying the Quelccaya glacier in the Peruvian
Andes report that its retreat has accelerated from 3 meters a year between
roughly 1970 and 1990 to 30 meters a year since 1990. In Europe's Alps, the
shrinkage of the glacial area by 35-40 percent since 1850 is expected to
continue. These ancient glaciers could largely disappear over the next
half-century.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shrinkage of ice masses in the Himalayas has accelerated
alarmingly. In eastern India, the Dokriani Bamak glacier, which retreated by 16
meters between 1992 and 1997, drew back by a further 20 meters in 1998 alone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This melting and shrinkage of snow/ice masses should not
come as a total surprise. Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius warned at the
beginning of the last century that burning fossil fuels could raise atmospheric
levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), creating a greenhouse effect. Atmospheric CO2
levels, estimated at 280 parts per million (ppm) before the Industrial
Revolution, have climbed from 317 ppm in 1960 to 368 ppm in 1999--a gain of 16
percent in only four decades.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As CO2 concentrations have risen, so too has Earth's
temperature. Between 1975 and 1999, the average temperature increased from 13.94
degrees Celsius to 14.35 degrees, a gain of 0.41 degrees or 0.74 degrees
Fahrenheit in 24 years. The warmest 23 years since recordkeeping began in 1866
have all occurred since 1975.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Researchers are discovering that a modest rise in
temperature of only 1 or 2 degrees Celsius in mountainous regions can
dramatically increase the share of precipitation falling as rain while
decreasing the share coming down as snow. The result is more flooding during the
rainy season, a shrinking snow/ice mass, and less snowmelt to feed rivers during
the dry season.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These &quot;reservoirs in the sky,&quot; where nature
stores fresh water for use in the summer as the snow melts, are shrinking and
some could disappear entirely. This will affect the water supply for cities and
for irrigation in areas dependent on snowmelt to feed rivers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the massive snow/ice mass in the Himalayas--which is
the third largest in the world, after the Greenlandic and Antarctic ice
sheets--continues to melt, it will affect the water supply of much of Asia. All
of the region's major rivers--the Indus, Ganges, Mekong, Yangtze, and
Yellow--originate in the Himalayas. The melting in the Himalayas could alter the
hydrology of several Asian countries, including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh,
Thailand, Viet Nam, and China. Less snowmelt in the summer dry season to feed
rivers could exacerbate the hydrological poverty already affecting so many in
the region.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the ice on land melts and flows to the sea, sea level
rises. Over the last century, sea level rose by 20-30 centimeters (8-12 inches).
During this century, the existing climate models indicate it could rise by as
much as 1 meter. If the Greenland ice sheet, which is up to 3.2 kilometers thick
in places, were to melt entirely, sea level would rise by 7 meters (23 feet).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even a much more modest rise would affect the low-lying
river floodplains of Asia, where much of the region's rice is produced.
According to a World Bank analysis, a 1-meter rise in sea level would cost
low-lying Bangladesh half its riceland. Numerous low-lying island countries
would have to be evacuated. The residents of densely populated river valleys of
Asia would be forced inland into already crowded interiors. Rising sea level
could create climate refugees by the million in countries such as China, India,
Bangladesh, Indonesia, Viet Nam, and the Philippines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even more disturbing, ice melting itself can accelerate
temperature rise. As snow/ice masses shrink, less sunlight is reflected back
into space. With more sunlight absorbed by less reflective surfaces, temperature
rises even faster and melting accelerates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We don't have to sit idly by as this scenario unfolds.
There may still be time to stabilize atmospheric CO2 levels before continuing
carbon emissions cause climate change to spiral out of control. We have more
than enough wind, solar, and geothermal energy that can be economically
harnessed to power the world economy. If we were to incorporate the cost of
climate disruption in the price of fossil fuels in the form of a carbon tax,
investment would quickly shift from fossil fuels to these climate-benign energy
sources.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The leading automobile companies are all working on fuel
cell engines. Daimler Chrysler plans to start marketing such an automobile in
2003. The fuel of choice for these engines is hydrogen. Even leaders within the
oil industry recognize that we will eventually shift from a carbon-based energy
economy to a hydrogen-based one. The question is whether we can make that shift
before Earth's climate system is irrevocably altered.
