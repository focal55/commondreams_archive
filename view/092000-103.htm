WHILE THE UNITED STATES pressures countries around the world to 
respect the internationally recognized rights of workers to form 
trade unions, bargain collectively and strike, a new yearlong study 
by Human Rights Watch found that these basic rights are 
systematically violated here at home.
<P>  From apple pickers in Washington state to home-care workers in 
Florida, workers who try to form trade unions are spied on, harassed, 
pressured, threatened, suspended, fired or deported, according to the 
study ``Deck Is Stacked Against U.S. Workers.'' An astounding 10,000 
to 20,000 workers lose their jobs each year for simply exercising the 
right to organize a union. When workers do manage to unionize, 
employers often refuse to bargain in good faith, dragging out legal 
proceedings for years with the knowledge that the penalties are 
minimal -- no fines, no jail time -- just back pay and possibly 
reinstatement. And the legal fees employers pay are all 
tax-deductible.	 
The effectiveness of government agencies entrusted with enforcing 
workers rights is weakened by enervating delays, budget cuts and 
understaffing, obstructive laws and remedies too weak to deter 
unlawful conduct. The deterioration of workers' rights so 
meticulously detailed in the Human Rights Watch report coincides with 
the free-trade agenda promoted by both the Democrats and Republicans. 
It's an agenda that encourages employers to move jobs overseas where 
workers have even less power.	 
</P>
<P>While most unions still cling to the Democrats as the ``lesser of two 
evils'' (and provide the Democratic Party with funds and foot 
soldiers), the Democrats have now joined the Republicans in filling 
their campaign coffers with corporate donations and abandoning 
working people. It was, after all, a Democratic administration with a 
Democratic-controlled Congress that passed the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993, the first of a series of trade 
agreements that put downward pressure on wages and environmental 
standards.	 
</P>
<P>  As workers rights are eroded and bargaining power declines, it is 
no wonder that union membership in the United States has plummeted to 
the lowest level in 60 years and the lowest rate in the 
industrialized world -- a mere 14 percent of the total workforce. If 
unionized government workers are excluded, the percentage drops to 
just about 9 percent.	 
While business sectors portray unions as ``old-fashioned'' and out of 
step with today's economy, surveys show that one-
third to one-half of all workers would welcome the opportunity to 
join a union.	 
</P>
<P>  The precipitous decline in unions, which historically have been 
the engine that pulled workers into the middle class, has been 
particularly devastating at the lower end of the wage ladder. In 
California, more workers earn poverty-level wages now than a decade 
ago. The minimum wage nationwide has fallen from about $7 an hour in 
1969 (in today's dollars) to the current level of $5.15 an hour or 
$10,712 a 
year, leaving millions of full-time workers and their families living 
in full-time poverty. In Europe, where union membership is 
considerably higher, the typical low-wage worker earns 44 percent 
more than in the United States and has government-provided health 
care and a host of other benefits.	 
</P>
<P>  The obscene inequality in compensation between workers and CEOs is 
another reflection of the shifting balance of power between workers 
and employers. In 1980, chief executives made 40 times more than the 
average worker's wage. Today, that figure is 475. If production 
workers had experienced the same proportional gains over the past 
decade as CEOs, their wages, on average, would be $114,000, not 
$23,750, and the minimum wage would be $24 an hour!	 
</P>
<P>The present disequilibrium between workers and employers represents a 
serious danger to our democracy. We need to fight for changes in our 
labor laws that will shift the scale to restore workers rights. These 
include: requiring employers to remain neutral during union 
organizing drives with a card-check system through which workers can 
show their support for a union simply by signing authorization cards; 
swift and severe penalties for unfair labor practices; an end to the 
permanent replacement of striking workers; and granting agricultural, 
domestic, contract workers, and others currently excluded from 
coverage by federal labor law, the same rights as other workers.	 
</P>
<P>  In addition to reforming labor laws, we need to enforce existing 
wage, hour, health and safety laws, which means giving the 
enforcement agencies adequate funds to monitor compliance and to 
prosecute offenders.	 
</P>
<P>  To demonstrate to the world our renewed commitment to workers 
rights, we should ratify the many International Labor Organization 
conventions we have thus far failed to ratify, especially the 
Convention on Freedom of Association and Protecting the Right to 
Organize.	 
</P>
<P>  As a society, we must understand that respecting workers' rights 
and achieving a more equitable balance of power between 
workers and employers will go a long way toward reversing the 
troubling and dangerous economic polarization that now exists.	 
</P>
<P>  It will give workers a voice in the public debate over economic 
and social policy, make elections more relevant to workers' needs, 
and reinvigorate our democratic process. Indeed, it is essential for 
the long-
term health of our country.
