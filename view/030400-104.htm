<p>These are not happy days for global arms-control advocates. This 
summer, the Clinton administration may approve the deployment of a 
national missile-defense system - a move that could prompt a renewed 
arms race with Russia and China. Last fall, the U.S. Senate stunned the 
world with its rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
And the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty may be the next pact 
headed for the chopping block. 
<P> Defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty crystallized the mantra now popular among 
conservatives: Distrust treaties, increase defenses, and assert 
American authority. Now that the era of superpower rivalry is over, 
critics assert, the U.S. strategy of negotiated arms reductions must 
change to confront "a world of terror and missiles and madmen," to 
borrow a phrase from presidential hopeful George W. Bush. 
<P> But those who wish to reinvent arms control for the 21st century 
are turning their backs on history. As far back as the early 1960s, 
policy-makers warned that the true threat to the United States was not 
only that Third World despots might acquire the bomb but that advanced 
industrial countries might do so. 
<P> Nuclear weapons in "the hands of countries large and small, stable 
and unstable," President John F. Kennedy warned, would create "the 
increased chance of accidental war and an increased necessity for the 
great powers to involve themselves in what otherwise would be local 
conflicts." 
<P> Kennedy understood what many today seem to forget: Rather than 
attempt just to limit the spread of advanced-weapons technology, 
policy-makers must seek to build political firewalls that preclude the 
need for nuclear arms, so that even nuclear-capable nations would 
choose not to develop or deploy such weapons. 
<P> Unfortunately, these firewalls are now crumbling in much of the 
world - particularly in Asia, where declining faith in arms control is 
prompting advanced and developing countries alike to contemplate the 
acquisition or development of nuclear weapons. Like neutrons splitting 
from an atom, one nation's actions may trigger reactions throughout 
the region, which in turn stimulate additional actions. Asian nations 
form an interlocking nuclear reaction chain that vibrates dangerously 
with each new development. 
<P> South Asia is the region most likely to see the combat use of 
nuclear weapons. India and Pakistan - two nuclear-armed nations 
sharing a common border and a history of aggression - are developing 
new missiles and crafting nuclear-deployment doctrines. The disputed 
Kashmir region, the cause of two past wars between these nations, 
remains a frightening flashpoint. 
<P> But it is Japan that may well be the critical element in this 
chain. In 1998, the Japanese were caught by surprise when the 
Indian-Pakistani tit-for-tat nuclear tests suddenly doubled the number 
of Asian nuclear-weapon states. Many Japanese were disturbed by how 
quickly the world accepted India and Pakistan's de facto status as new 
nuclear powers. This was not the bargain Japan had agreed to when - 
after a lengthy internal debate - it joined the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1976. 
<P> North Korea's launch of a long-range Taepo Dong missile in August 
1998 further agitated Japanese policy-makers, stirring new debates over 
security policies. Vice Defense Minister Shingo Nishimura argued 
that Japan "ought to have aircraft carriers, long-range missiles, 
long-range bombers. We should even have the atomic bomb." 
<P>Nishimura was forced to resign over his comments, but if 
nuclear-weapon deployments increase in Asia, Japan may well conclude 
that its security is best served by building its own nuclear arsenal. 
And Japanese withdrawal from the NPT would almost certainly trigger 
the collapse of the treaty. 
<P> Finally, there are two new emerging risks in Asia: Russia faces the 
prospect of fragmentation into separate, nuclear-armed states, while 
the possible unification of Korea - though solving one set of 
problems - could create a single country with nuclear ambitions and 
capabilities. If these new nations find themselves in a world with an 
increasing number of nuclear-weapon states, they may well opt to join 
the club. 
<P> In this environment, it would be foolish to let the 
nonproliferation and arms-reductions treaties unravel, thereby 
disarming the United States of its most effective weapons for fighting nascent 
nuclear threats. Some critics, such as Henry Kissinger, argue that the 
United States can pick and choose which particular arms treaties it finds most 
advantageous. 
<P> Unfortunately, an arms control a-la-carte strategy will not work - 
the non-proliferation regime functions only as an integrated whole. 
<P> Provocative U.S. actions, such as the deployment of national missile 
defense, could well set in motion a chain of events that diplomacy 
will be powerless to stop. Only by expanding the resources devoted to 
international negotiations and leading by example in reducing nuclear 
dangers can the United States hope to prevent a nuclear tsunami from sweeping out 
of Asia.
