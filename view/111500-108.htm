I cried on the day President Kennedy was shot. I was lying in my cot and I'd dropped my rusk through the bars. Next week sees the anniversary of that infamous assassination, and America looks set to commemorate it by killing off another rightful president. 
<P>For years the debate will rage - was the Florida judge acting alone or was it part of some wider conspiracy? Was there a second judge hiding behind the grassy knoll? Show that film again - there's definitely a second hole going into that ballot paper.  
<P>There is of course a difference between Kennedy and Gore. Kennedy won the presidency by only 100,000 votes, whereas Gore beat Bush by more than twice that. We keep being told that America is the greatest democracy in the world. Well yes, apart from the minor quibbles that less than half the electorate voted and the bloke who got least votes looks set to win. Deciding who's actually been elected could not be taking longer if Edward Heath was in charge of it all. And soon the billions spent on the election will be as nothing compared with Jeremy Paxman's hotel bill for his extended stay in Washington.  
<P>Immediately it became apparent that neither candidate had won decisively, all sorts of accusations and recriminations started being thrown about. Gore was told he blew it by not being enough like Clinton. Instead of going around shaking people's hands he should have locked himself in the stationery cupboard with his secretary.  
<P>Then it was claimed that some ballot papers were so confusing that less intelligent electors voted for the wrong person. So at least Gore got Bush's vote. Meanwhile careful analysis of the figures show that the governor of Texas has been seeking to gain an unfair advantage over the past few years by executing more Democrats than Republicans.  
<P>It must be said that as political dynasties go, they don't come much less glamorous than the Bush family. If the original President Bush had been a film, would anyone have bothered with a sequel? But now in the land where anyone is supposed to able to reach the White House, the son of the last Republican president looks set to inherit it because of dubious electoral practices in the state where his brother is governor. So that's why George W Bush went into politics. He wanted to spend more time with his family.  
<P>There must be a simple way to sort this all out. Can't we get Anne Robinson to ask both candidates a few general knowledge questions and then say, "George W, you are the weakest link. Goodbye!" Or maybe a more American way would be for the two candidates to fight it out in the style of the World Wrestling Federation. Al "The Jogger" Gore versus George "The Executioner" Bush. It would still look less fixed than the result in Florida.  
<P>"It could never happen here of course," we all say smugly. Except it has happened here twice since the war, most spectacularly in 1951, when Attlee's government got the highest percentage poll of any political party since the advent of universal suffrage and yet Labour were thrown out of office. And who can forget the things that Churchill's 1951-55 government then did without a proper mandate? Well, we all can as it turns out.  
<P>Events across the Atlantic should make us look again at our own political system. We can hardly laugh at the Americans, when our own head of state was chosen by dint of being the eldest daughter of an accidentally crowned king, descended from a foreign prince who was brought in at the last minute to keep out the Catholics. (I don't why the Tories are so paranoid about us being ruled by the Germans, when they've been sitting on the British throne since George I.) Maybe in this area we should seek to be more like the Americans - the Queen and Prince Charles should have televised debates to decide on the top job. Charles would be accused of being pro-gun-control as the Queen shouted "God Bless the Good ol' United Kingdom!" and everyone would whoop and cheer as red, white and blue balloons descended from the ceiling.  
<P>The unsettling reality is that it is in exactly this type of constitutional deadlock that the Queen would wield genuine political power. And you could bet your bottom billion dollars that the people advising her would be arguing for a Conservative administration rather than Labour. The American constitution might be showing its age a bit this month but at least they've actually got one.  
<P>We still have an unelected second chamber, an unrepresentative House of Commons and a voting system that leaves millions of people feeling that their votes simply don't count. We'll only realise how deeply flawed our political system is when William Hague walks through the door of Downing Street after most people have voted against him. And then we'll wish we had a more liberal and intelligent leader - someone like George W Bush.
