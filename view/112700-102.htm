<p>By the time you read this, we might know the Florida vote totals and,
perhaps, the identity of the new president.
<P>
   If Vice President Al Gore is awarded the thousands of "pregnant" chads,
he'll gain Florida's 25 electoral votes and lose his "vice." If Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's lead survives the varied recounts, the air of inevitability
that pervaded his campaign will settle in --big time. He already had been
choosing a Cabinet until dogged by criticism that picking an administration
before being declared president was a bit, shall we say ... premature.
<P>
But in the uncharted regions we now roam, even those outcomes are not
assured. Without precedent to steady our course, we find ourselves engaged in
a grand act of improvisation--like a jazz composition. We know the broad
themes: democracy, rule of law, fairness, timeliness, etc. But how those
themes are measured, blended and harmonized is a work in progress. And we all
are involved; like a jazz performance, players and listeners are linked
through a dense interplay of expectation, tradition and chance.
<P>
   There has been one consistently discordant note in this composition,
however. The combative rhetoric of the Republicans, including the Bush
campaign, is too shrill. Effective democracies demand the loser accept the
winner's legitimacy. But the Bush folks are acting as if their designated
candidate already has captured the presidency and Gore's pesky, but
inauthentic, supporters must learn to live with that reality. Republican
attacks on the Democrats' electoral tactics seem designed, maliciously, to
undermine Gore's legitimacy.<P>
   And Gore Democrats aren't the only targets of the GOP's imperious
self-righteousness. These fire breathing supporters of America's foremost
"compassionate conservative" seem willing to deny the legitimacy of any U.S.
institution that gets in the way of Bush's ascension.<P>
   This intemperate tone was cued early on when former Secretary of State
James Baker--widely billed as a "wise man" with the gravitas needed for such a
somber task-- quickly went on the offensive. Perhaps he was provoked by the
early bellicosity of Gore campaign manager William Daley, but Baker's
insolence set the mold for the GOP's defiant reaction to this dispute.<P>
   These GOP overreactions are difficult to understand unless seen as
components of an overall Republican syndrome that links Bush inevitability to
an almost metaphysical hatred for the wily lame duck, Bill Clinton. The same
hatred that blinded the impeachment lynch mob to public sentiment is blinding
these rabid Bush partisans to the negative consequences of their irresponsible
rhetoric.<P>
   The Bush campaign has pushed the notion of their man's inevitability since
the post debate days when the governor began leading in the polls. It's an
attitude that casts Gore as an inconvenience, at best. And it has worked. How
else to explain the rush of "advice" urging Gore to drop out, even though he
received the most popular votes and, absent Florida, the most electoral votes
as well. Unfortunately, it's also an attitude adopted by the media. Bullied by
the right-wing canard that the corporate media are liberal, the Fourth Estate
has been intimidated into irrelevance during a time when journalistic ballast
is needed to calm the dangerous bluster of the GOP. Wary of being pegged as
Gore supporters by GOP "liberal-baiters," the media also failed to follow-up
on very credible reports that African-American voters were harassed and their
votes suppressed in several Florida cities.<P>
   The notion of journalist as an impartial chronicler of events also took a
dive when it was revealed that John Ellis, who was responsible for Fox News
Channel's projection of Bush as Florida winner, is a cousin of the Bushes.
Rupert Murdoch, the right-wing media mogul who owns the channel, reportedly
found nothing improper in Ellis' behavior. Murdoch's Fox News Channel is
boldly conservative in tone and delights in flouting television news'
hidebound traditions. As of yet, there are no unapologetically "liberal" news
channels with Fox's admirable audacity.<P>
   If any did exist, they would be complaining loudly about the GOP's perilous
tactics. They would note the reappearance of those "angry white men" who
seemingly disappeared during the Clinton boom years. We would be advised that
C-Span again is all a-crackle with veiled and unveiled threats from 2nd
Amendment revolutionaries.
<P>
   Perhaps even Republicans would begin to understand that without respect for
the common themes, jazz becomes noise.
