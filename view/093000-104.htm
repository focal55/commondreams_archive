Thanks to you, dear sheiks, we get to have a Really Important Debate over 
energy policy this fall. A discussion that shows us just how Deep and 
Critical are the differences between the two presidential candidates when it 
comes to the burning question of how to keep Cheap Gas in the SUV and Cheap 
Oil in the basement heater.
<P>  You, oh grand cartel, have given us a gift: the ability to see clearly 
our choice between inveterate panderer and incorrigible profiteer.	 
</P>
<P>  Vice President Al Gore, chilled that the onset of autumn has coincided 
with exorbitant home-heating oil prices, fretted he could lose his political 
hold on the Northeast. So Gore did what he always does when he gets a little 
spooked.	 
</P>
<P>  He flipped out.	 
</P>
<P>  Now he has given us a few drops of oil from strategic reserves and with 
it the great oil-price brouhaha.	 
</P>
<P>  In a reverse double-flip, Gore not only has abandoned his previous 
opposition to using the oil reserves to tamp down prices, but also his own 
record as one of the few politicians who once had the guts to promote higher 
energy taxes, lower consumption and alterna 
tive fuels as the best long-term energy solutions.	 
</P>
<P>  George W. Bush thinks Gore's latest flip is a fabulous flop.	 
</P>
<P>  He gets to brand Gore as a politician who would do anything to get 
elected, while simultaneously crowing that finally the campaign has shifted 
to a subject he actually knows something about. Oil.	 
</P>
<P>  Bush had a long career as a failed oilman. This was before he got bailed 
out of his failures by more successful oilmen. He used his oil-
bailout money to buy a stake in the Texas Rangers baseball team, which 
eventually made him richer than he was at birth. This might suggest that 
Bush's real expertise is not exactly in oil.	 
</P>
<P>  Anyway, Bush's energy policy can pretty much be summed up in the immortal 
words of that 1970s bumper sticker, once seen so frequently in the South: 
``Drive Fast. Freeze a Yankee.'' Like everyone else from Texas, Bush does 
not believe in conservation. Or in forcing domestic oil producers to refine 
enough home-heating oil to 
get the Yankees through the winter. Or, heaven forbid, in taxing gas more 
heavily to make people start to think: Gee, maybe I should buy a basic sedan 
instead of an SUV.	 
</P>
<P>  In the fine tradition of oilmen, Bush believes in drilling. Everywhere. 
Most especially, Bush believes in drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge. If and when it were fully exploited over, say, a decade, this might 
give us a six-month supply of fuel.	 
</P>
<P>  Six months, folks, and we'd be right back where we are now.	 
</P>
<P>  Now, if there is one thing we know about OPEC and oil, it is that energy 
experts who aren't running for office or making money in the oil industry 
agree on what has to be done. We need to stop acting like we are entitled to 
gulp down 19.5 million barrels of oil a day.	 
</P>
<P>  We need to stop tooling around in SUVs when a station wagon, or less, 
would do just fine. We need to stop building new housing developments an 
hour's commute or longer from jobs -- unless the development comes with a 
mass-transit link.	 
</P>
<P>  We have met the enemy. And it is not OPEC.
