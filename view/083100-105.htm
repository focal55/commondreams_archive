U.S. 
              Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. is a loyal Democrat with a theory about what 
              ails the Democratic Party.
<P align="left">"The 
              problem with the Democratic Party is that they (party leaders) haven't 
              figured out that no one is going to vote for a moderate conservative 
              when they can get the real thing,'' says the third-term congressman 
              from Chicago.</P>
<P align="left">There's 
              not much question that Bill Clinton and Al Gore have governed for 
              the past eight years as moderate conservatives. This is the administration 
              that ripped the aid to dependent children safety net for urban America 
              and farm support safety net for rural America, that advanced and 
              implemented Wall Street's agenda on free trade with NAFTA and GATT, 
              that increased defense spending at the same time it was crying poor 
              when calls came for increased social spending on the domestic front.</P>
<P align="left">As 
              long as Newt Gingrich and his mean-spirited minions advanced an 
              extreme right-wing agenda, Clinton and Gore were able to get away 
              with governing pretty much as Gerald Ford or George Bush the Dad 
              did. Now, however, with a "compassionate conservative'' challenge 
              coming from George Bush the Son, however, Al Gore is suddenly finding 
              that there may be a political price to pay for the tepid agenda 
              of the Clinton-Gore administration.</P>
<P align="left">New 
              television advertising campaigns from the Bush campaign and the 
              Republican National Convention don't just criticize Gore's campaign 
              promises on issues such as health care and the development of a 
              prescription drug benefit program for seniors; they note that during 
              the Clinton-Gore administration things got worse on both the health 
              care and prescription drug fronts.</P>
<P align="left">"Under 
              Clinton-Gore, prescription drug prices have skyrocketed -- and nothing's 
              been done,'' claims a new Republican Party ad. A new Bush ad notes 
              that, during the past eight years, the number of Americans lacking 
              health care benefits has risen dramatically.</P>
<P align="left">Both 
              ads are disingenuous. The Clinton-Gore administration has tried 
              to address both issues, only to be hamstrung at every turn by a 
              Republican Congress that has been militant in its opposition to 
              efforts to extend health care protections and to take on the pharmaceutical 
              corporations. The GOP attempt to blame Bill Clinton and Al Gore 
              for a lack of progress on these issues represents the worst sort 
              of political deception.</P>
<P align="left">And, 
              yet, for many voters the GOP messages will ring true -- not because 
              they're accurate but because, well, it is true that during the Clinton-Gore 
              years America's health care crisis steadily worsened. And, for too 
              much of the past eight years, Clinton and Gore seemed to be far 
              more concerned about delivering on corporate America's trade and 
              economic agenda than on leading the fight for real health care reform.</P>
<P align="left">Now 
              that he is locked in what may turn out to be the tightest presidential 
              campaign since 1968, Al Gore is starting to sound like a fighter. 
              He is talking about taking on HMOs and drug companies, and promising 
              to tackle the health care deficit and provide a real prescription 
              drug benefit.</P>
<P align="left">
When 
              all is said and done, Gore may succeed in convincing American voters 
              with his newly populist message on health issues. But the task would 
              be a far easier one if the Clinton-Gore administration had governed 
              as progressive Democrats -- rather than as moderate conservatives.
