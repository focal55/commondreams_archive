BEFORE CONGRESS ADJOURNS this year, it may pass a bill that would have 
a devastating impact on workers. A vote is expected next week.	 
<P>  The proposal would dramatically expand a current program that 
allows big Silicon Valley electronics companies to recruit employees 
outside of the United States and obtain H-1B immigration visas for 
them.	 
</P>
<P>  Current law limits the number of the H1-B visas this year to 
115,000, and next year to 105,000. The companies want to increase 
that limit to 300,000. One proposal would remove the cap on visas 
entirely.	 
</P>
<P>  In June, the AFL-CIO held a hearing in Silicon Valley about 
proposals for immigration reform, at which one H1-B contract worker, 
Kim Singh, described his experiences. When he left India for Silicon 
Valley, Singh said, he thought he would find a good job. Instead, he 
found a high-tech sweatshop.	 
</P>
<P>  Singh worked for three different companies. Each got him an H1-B 
immigration visa, allowing him to work in the United States as a 
software engineer. One company, he says, withheld from each of its 
immigrant engineers 25 percent of their pay. ``After each of us left, 
none of us received the money,'' Singh alleges.	 
</P>
<P>  At a second company, immigrant engineers worked seven days a week, 
with no overtime compensation. A third company rented a San Jose 
apartment for four H1-B engineers, charging each $1,450 a month in 
rent.	 
</P>
<P>One might think workers would protest such conditions, but when the 
company holds their visas, such protest becomes risky. If H1-B 
workers are fired for objecting to illegal conditions, for organizing 
a union to change them, or simply because their employer no longer 
has work for them, they not only lose their job, but their 
immigration status as well. According to Singh, one company 
``threatened to send some back to India if they didn't get contracts. 
These workers were in tears. They were nervous wrecks, ashamed to ask 
for money or help from their families back home.''	 
</P>
<P>  AFL-CIO executive vice president Linda Chavez-Thompson charges 
that ``because 
these workers are often hired under individual contracts, U.S. labor 
law says they don't even have the right to organize.''	 
</P>
<P>  Meanwhile, African American and Latino engineers, who have made a 
protracted effort to break down discriminatory barriers in high-tech 
hiring, also protest the program's expansion. Increasing the number 
of H1-B visas will make it more difficult to open up jobs for 
engineers of color in an industry where the percentage of African 
American and Latino engineers is very low.	 
</P>
<P>  For India and the Philippines, the source countries for most H1-B 
workers, the continued loss of high-skilled engineers contributes to 
brain drain. ``These programs are selling our human potential,'' says 
Anuradha Mittal, Indian-born co-director of Oakland's Food First, a 
food policy organization. ``Our educational system produces highly 
skilled workers who then leave to become the working poor in 
America, while breaking down our ability to industrialize our own 
country. We wind up subsidizing U.S. industry.''	 
</P>
<P>Countering these arguments, high-tech lobbyists claim the industry 
faces a debilitating labor shortage, threatening U.S. economic 
growth. The problem isn't an absolute scarcity of labor, however, but 
a shortage of people willing to provide high skills at the salary 
industry wants to pay.	 
</P>
<P>  Industry also claims that U.S. universities don't turn out enough 
qualified graduates. But downward pressure on salaries discourages 
young people from becoming engineers. And, ironically, U.S. 
universities train many students from abroad who then become H1-B 
workers.	 
</P>
<P>  Silicon Valley is not the only industry that wants to recruit 
immigrant workers under contract. Congress is now debating a similar 
bill for farm workers, which would 
take a big step toward the old, discredited bracero program of the 
1940s and '50s. Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta were only able to 
begin organizing the United Farm Workers Union when workers became 
free of the bracero contract labor system.	 
</P>
<P>  The last thing farm laborers, or any other group of workers, need 
today is to reinstitute and expand this discredited program. But as 
it stands, other industries are also lining up for contract workers.	 
</P>
<P>While Congress quarrels over the details of these bills, many 
legislators accept the false logic behind the proposals -- that U.S. 
immigration law should be revamped in order to supply contract labor 
to U.S. industry. Some seek to soften the proposals by tying them to 
other reforms, including proposals to end discrimination against 
Central American and Haitian refugees, and bids for fair treatment of 
late applicants for the last immigration amnesty.	 
</P>
<P>  This is a bad deal. The United States desperately needs 
immigration reform, but more contract labor will only increase the 
number of workers unable to organize and exercise their rights. It 
will drive down wages for immigrants and native-born alike.	 
</P>
<P>  Instead, the AFL-CIO proposed last February a much 
farther-reaching reform -- a general amnesty to give undocumented 
families the right to come out of the shadows. It proposed ending 
employer sanctions, so that all workers can exercise their right to 
organize and protest unfair treatment. Legal immigration and family 
reunification should be made easier, so that immigrants don't have to 
choose between crossing the border illegally and becoming contract 
laborers.	 
</P>
<P>  In the era of the global economy, immigrants are going to continue 
to arrive in the United States, driven from their homes by war and 
poverty. But instead of turning them into indentured servants, 
immigration law should ensure that all workers enjoy the same rights, 
free of discrimination and second-class status.
