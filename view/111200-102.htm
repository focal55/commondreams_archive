<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->The rest of the world's traditional joke about democracy in the United States, a crack of both mockery and admiration, is that Americans even elect their dog catchers. The rest of the world's new joke about democracy in the United States is that Americans can't even elect a President. 
<P>In the best home-grown quip of the night, Bill Clinton remarked that the people had spoken, but it would take a while to decide what they had said. Actually, so long as you are not a politician, a TV anchor or a lawyer, it is really quite easy to name the man who should become the most powerful person on the planet. I know who has won the election. So do you. My six-year-old daughter can figure it out. She may be no electoral expert, but she has a firm grasp of fairness and natural justice. Elections are won by the man with the most votes. Al Gore has won the American election.  
<P>Block your ears against the cacophonous cascade of blither and blather about the convolutions of the American constitution and voting papers apparently designed to test for membership of Mensa, that wall of noise which has bludgeoned our senses since they began bungee-jumping for the White House. Shut out that din. Fix your compass by a simple fact, the one straightforward thing to emerge from this tragi-farcical morass which transfixes the world. On the latest count across America, George W. Bush has some 48,890,000 votes. Al Gore has some 49,110,00 votes. Al Gore has won the American election, by a narrow margin for sure, but emphatically win it he did. Ignore all that tosh saying that whoever emerges as the next President will lack a mandate. It is true that Bush will not have a mandate - he lost. Gore has a mandate - he won.  
<P>In fact, the Vice-President has won more votes, whether you are counting ballots or counting share, than Clinton did in either 1992 or 1996. In a smoothly organised democracy, George Bush would already have made a pretty little speech from Texas gracefully accepting defeat and Al Gore would be in Washington preparing to take office.  
<P>There would be no room to wrangle but for the arcanities of the antique electoral college, the workings of which, even the existence of, were a mystery to many Americans until the closeness of Tuesday night's results suddenly made an issue of its curious mechanics. It turns out that the world's only superpower and proudest democracy has a Heath Robinson contraption for a constitutional engine.   
<P>Now, I have read the learned disquisitions which have been rolling out from the professors and the pundits. I understand that the Founding Fathers, who enjoy a demigod status in the United States and whose constitution is still treated as if it were a tablet that Moses returned with from Mount Sinai, wanted to protect the rights of the states. Less nobly, they designed the electoral college as a filter against the possibility that the vulgar masses might do something wild. Remember, this system was constructed in 1787, a time when you would be marked as a lunatic for suggesting that women should have the vote, never mind blacks. Even so, the intention of the Founding Fathers never seems to have been to deny office to the man who had won and confer power on the man who had lost.  
<P>That is the perverse outcome that threatens to happen in the United States. Should George Bush be awarded the 25 electoral college votes of Florida - and he gets every one of those votes, however close and contested the result in that state - then he will have a majority in the national electoral college even though he lacks a majority from the people. It is highly suspect whether he even deserves to carry the votes of the Sunshine State. Bad smells are wafting from the Florida swamps. Thanks to a ballot paper which was an eyesight test cum brainteaser, thousands of votes in Palm Beach County, almost certainly more than enough to make the difference, were either spoilt or accidentally cast for Pat Buchanan. That Hitler-admiring right-winger cheerfully says that he got votes from elderly liberal Jews that were meant for Al Gore. The real and present danger for Americans is that they will be landed with a President whom the majority did not want as a result of rotten ballots in a crucial state and a malfunctioning mechanism giving the first prize to the runner-up.  
<P>There are those who say that, however eccentric and perilous its effects, the letter of a constitution must always be followed. This misses the bigger picture. The most important element of any constitution is its spirit. And the animating spirit of America is supposed to be democracy. No one can exactly predict the reverberations for an advanced country of making the loser the leader. But I think it is a pretty sure guess that the consequences are all going to be bad.  
<P>The shockwaves will be first felt in America itself. Government there   already suffers from a crisis of legitimacy as less and less of the public can be bothered to engage with a political process that seems to mean and do nothing for huge swathes of the electorate. All the mature democracies are diseased by this. In America, it is pandemic. This election was accounted a good one because, after the tightest of races upon which the candidates blew a cool one billion dollars, they managed to attract just over half of the potential electorate to a polling station. If the result is to give the White House to the man who came second, the payback from the voters is not hard to imagine. Greater still will be bitter cynicism about the system, and angry alienation from it. George Bush will be an unPresident.  
<P>This will be a woeful outcome for the cause of democracy in the rest of the world. America is not the paragon republic of its self-conceit. The shining city on the hill is built on quagmires of corruption and besmirched with special interests. For all that, America has had   a better idea of freedom and justice than most other nations for most of history. The enemies of liberty gloat already. Those to whom America preached the virtues of democracy are returning the sermons to sender. The foreign minister of Cuba, making delicious mischief at the expense of those who have long lectured the Castro regime about its abuses, says he will send observers to the Florida count. A similar suggestion comes from that byword for human rights, Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe. Vladimir Putin, the old KGB hand, makes a sarcastic offer of Russian assistance in conducting elections. The Moscow method is to choose the President before they have the vote. We are now just waiting for Baghdad to dispatch to Washington a team of independent Iraqi scrutineers.  
<P>This isn't fair on America, but it is inevitable. If George Bush becomes President, he will be seen to have seized the position on the back of a murky vote in a state governed by his brother. The   truth may be more complex, but that is how it will look in the eyes of the world. President Dubya will be barren of legitimacy at home and devoid of moral authority abroad. The Saddam Husseins of the planet, every petty, vicious dictator around the world, will scoff in the face of America.  
<P>Anyone who cares about the wider cause of democracy has to hope that the United States can find an exit off this freeway to disaster. Fortunately, their arrangements do provide time to untangle the impasse. Talk of a constitutional crisis, talk of America without a President, talk promoted by the acolytes of George Bush to bounce Al Gore into surrendering his claim to the White House - all that talk is specious. America has a President. Bill Clinton remains Chief Executive until the date when he is scheduled to hand the seals of power to his successor. That date is 20 January, more than two months away. Resolution could come within a week if the votes from overseas put Florida into the Vice-President's column. In the event they don't, Gore should fight on. He has a right to challenge the dodgy balloting in the state, as have those who were cheated of their choice. I'd say he has more than a right. He has a duty.  
<P>For the contest to go to court, perhaps all the way to the Supreme Court, will not be edifying. It would, though, be an appropriate denouement for the most litigious nation on Earth. There is an alternative and more elevated way out of this mayhem which is both consistent with the will of the people and the oddities of the US constitution. It is open to members of the electoral college to exercise their consciences. Two of them could switch allegiances and that may turn out to be enough to put the right man in the White House.  
<P>The cleanest and swiftest escape from weeks of rancorous deadlock is for one of the protagonists to act the gentleman. America can be spared prolonged agony - and the rest of the world denied further fun at the expense of the United States - if one of the candidates steps aside. The pressure is presently on Al Gore, whom the Republicans are trying to paint as the bad loser, to concede to George Bush. This is precisely the wrong way round. Bush is the loser; Gore is the winner. Any other outcome will be a violation of the popular will, a disgrace on the United States, and a disaster for the wider cause of liberty.  
<P>If Dubya steals the White House, American democracy will be a joke.
