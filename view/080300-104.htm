This just in: A dispute-settlement panel of the World Trade Organization has ruled that Japan's traffic laws constitute a barrier to trade and must be changed.
<P>The judgment is considered a major victory for North American and European auto producers, who argued before the WTO that Japan's requirement that vehicles drive on the left side of the road established an unfair barrier to imports of cars and trucks.</P>

<P>As one auto-industry lobbyist explained, &#34;The Japanese government literally forces its citizens to drive on the wrong side of the road. It's the major reason why they don't buy our left-hand-drive vehicles.&#34;</P>
<P>The WTO panel is similar to those that forced Canada to abolish the auto pact, its pharmaceutical patent laws, its domestic magazine policy, an aerospace technology program, and several agricultural marketing boards.</P>
<P>The Japanese government must now enter into negotiations with other countries to determine a timetable for reforming its traffic laws. Sales of imported vehicles in Japan are expected to enjoy an immediate boost as a result of the WTO decision. Large North American sport-utility vehicles, such as the Dodge Durango and the tank-like General Motors Hummer, are likely to experience the greatest increases in market penetration thanks to their enhanced ability to withstand head-on collisions.</P>
<P>International Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew hailed the WTO's decision as a victory for free trade. &#34;Sure, there will be short-run adjustment costs,&#34; he admitted, referring to the temporary increase in head-on crashes. &#34;But, in the long run, the Japanese will start to focus their skills and resources in those industries where they are more efficient.&#34;</P>
<P>Emboldened by the WTO decision, foreign automakers plan to launch other complaints against Japanese trade practices. Sources within the industry hint that the next challenge may target the unfair use of the Japanese language. &#34;Japanese customers can hardly make sense of North American owner's manuals,&#34; said one Detroit-based auto analyst. &#34;They're much less likely to buy a vehicle when they can't figure out how to make it work.&#34;</P>
<P>It's widely expected that Japan would resist any WTO demands to abolish Japanese by claiming a cultural exemption to normal trade rules. But a WTO official scoffed. &#34;There's even less genuine cultural value to a Japanese-language owner's manual than there is in the Canadian edition of Reader's Digest.&#34;</P>
<P>China's trade ministry, meanwhile, expressed pleasure at the WTO decision, suggesting that it enhances the likelihood that Beijing will soon be admitted to the world trading club. &#34;Sure, our country is still nominally run by Communists,&#34; said one official. &#34;But we drive on the right side of the road. This clearly indicates our readiness to accept the discipline of world market forces.&#34;</P>
<P>The implications of the WTO's ruling on traffic laws may extend to other industries. An association representing U.S. beef growers is already planning a trade challenge against the Japanese sushi industry. &#34;Japanese consumers are indoctrinated to eat raw fish from the time they are toddlers,&#34; one beef lobbyist said. &#34;No wonder they won't buy our meat. That's completely unacceptable.&#34;</P>
<P>The beef challenge may be backed by powerful support from the pharmaceutical industry, which has long complained of a lack of Japanese demand for U.S.-made cholesterol-reduction drugs.</P>
<P>The latest WTO decision represents another expansion in the scope and breadth of the trade body's dispute-settlement system. What was initially intended as a means of arbitrating relatively narrow and arcane questions of trade law has evolved into an authority with the mandate to challenge any law, policy or practice found to inhibit the pre-eminent goal of expanded world trade.</P>
<P>The worldwide economic and cultural harmonization thus being encouraged by the dispute-settlement mechanism is a normal side-effect of globalization, said a top U.S. trade official assigned to the WTO. &#34;Basically, it won't stop until foreigners think like Americans, act like Americans and shop like Americans.&#34;</P>
<P><I>When not reporting on WTO decisions from Geneva, Jim Stanford is an economist with the Canadian Auto Workers</I> <I>union.</I></P>
