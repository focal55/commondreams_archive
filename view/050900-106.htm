Ho Chi Mingh City, Vietnam -
  The War Remnants Museum in Vietnam was almost too much for this tough old retired war correspondent returning for a look at the country that defeated the United States in America's worst and longest war.<BR>
<BR>
  If you think some Americans are still fighting that war, consider how the Vietnamese government is doing it.<BR>
<BR>
  What hits you first at this museum, a collection of buildings in the center of what everyone still calls Saigon, is a huge U.S. tank, still intact, with its big turret gun and powerful caterpillar treads, just as the American forces and their South Vietnamese allies abandoned it in headlong departure 25 years ago.<BR>
<BR>
  The yard is packed with other military vehicles including a tank-like flame-thrower and guns ranging from mortars to huge howitzers. A bomb the size of a Dumpster stands upright with a sign that says it could destroy every hut or tree in an area as big as several football fields in the American search-and-destroy operations.<BR>
<BR>
  Two fighter-bomber planes, armed with bombs and rockets, look ready for new combat. So does a big &quot;Huey&quot; helicopter, once used to drop squads of U.S. troops for quick raids against supposed Viet Cong forces and pick them up again -- if all went well. I sometimes flew on such missions, hoping that the low hedge-hopping route would save us from guerrilla ground fire. In case it didn't, I usually sat on a flak jacket.<BR>
<BR>
  Much of this equipment looked brand new, and much of it was, indeed, new -- left behind in the rout of defeat and withdrawal.<BR>
<BR>
  Inside were wall after wall of pictures intended to demonstrate communist Vietnamese courage and persistence and American brutality. Perhaps the most shocking showed a U.S. soldier lugging as a trophy the head -- eyes still staring -- of a Vietnamese decapitated by an American bomb. Another showed an American tank with a Viet Cong soldier tied behind, being dragged to his death.<BR>
<BR>
  Another picture showed American GIs burning a thatched hut thought to contain guerrilla fighters.<BR>
<BR>
  One room was filled with showcases of the various pistols, rifles, machine guns and grenade launchers used by the American forces. A souvenir shop offered rows of American sheath knives, binoculars and field compasses used by the Americans in the jungle campaign.<BR>
<BR>
  A replica of a South Vietnamese prison, which a sign says was operated in cooperation with U.S. authorities, featured a dark, windowless cell with a gaunt, naked figure of a staring man, his ankles shackled permanently to a rude bed.<BR>
<BR>
  A sign pointed to a replica of the &quot;tiger cages&quot; operated by the South Vietnamese government for hard cases on the island of Con Son. The sign said political prisoners were held indefinitely in underground cells with bars across the top, through which guards would drop daily rations of a little rice, some rotted fish, and a small can of water.<BR>
<BR>
  The tiger cages, I knew, would be too much for me, just as the pictures of Vietnamese babies burned by napalm and deformed by chemical warfare were too much for my wife, Helen. We had reached our limit, or maybe a little beyond.<BR>
<BR>
  Partly it was jet lag. We had flown for two days, including a 14-hour leg from Los Angeles to Taipei. Partly it was the heat -- 95 degrees and humid -- so soon after chilly early-spring days in Down East Maine.<BR>
<BR>
  Partly it was the shock of seeing the waste of so many U.S. weapons of war, sent for a grossly mistaken conflict and finally left behind in humiliating defeat.<BR>
<BR>
  But mainly it was the massive evidence of what our country did to Vietnam and its people.<BR>
<BR>
  Sure, I know that all war is hell, that atrocities are a standard component of every side of every war. We had just been treated to a recital of communist Vietnamese atrocities in a Wall Street Journal editorial and accompanying article by former Navy Secretary James Webb.<BR>
<BR>
  But this museum was a reminder that the American intervention in Southeast Asia was from start to finish an ill-considered enterprise that mistook anti-colonialist nationalism for a tentacle of &quot;international communism.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
  It hurt to be reminded so dramatically of our country's folly<BR>
