Many pundits are worried about the delay in finding out who will 
become the next occupant of the Oval Office. "That's probably the most 
crippling blow I've ever seen to a new president," David Gergen lamented on 
national television. Whoever the next chief executive turns out to be, he 
has "been denied or robbed of the romance that we have that we associate 
with the selection of a new president, the crowning of a new president."

<p>For decades, Gergen has spun through the revolving door between 
government and media elites, working as an image-crafter for presidents and 
as a commentator for major news organizations. He understands vital 
dynamics of propaganda. So, it's no surprise that Gergen sounded distraught 
the other night when he declared: "There's always been an anointment 
process as we lift that figure up and put him up on a pedestal. There's no 
pedestal with this election."

<p>Appearing with Gergen on CNN, a reporter for Time was quick to 
add: "I think David's absolutely right that, you know, at the magazine and 
other news outlets we're so used to this being a honeymoon period, roll out 
the red carpet, get into the biography, let's look at who's this next great 
president."

<p>Indeed. It's a hoary media ritual -- so deeply ingrained that 
journalists don't seem the least bit embarrassed when they use fawning 
terms like "romance," "put him up on a pedestal" and "roll out the red 
carpet" to describe their usual approach. As a matter of time-honored 
routine, from early November to Jan. 20, the president-elect basks in the 
mythic lights of intense media glory.

<p>A dozen years ago, a dazzling blaze of deification accompanied 
George Bush the elder as he moved into 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. On 
inauguration day, few eyebrows were raised when the New York Times strained 
to set the proper tone on its front page. "George Bush embodies the 
patrician ideal of responsibility begotten by privilege," reporter R.W. 
Apple Jr. wrote, an "American tradition reaching back through the many 
presidents more at home in mansions than log cabins, from Washington of 
Mount Vernon to Jefferson of Monticello to Roosevelt of Hyde Park."

<p>Days later, in the nation's largest-circulation news magazine, 
Time's Michael Kramer was slinging the sanitized manure with the best as he 
narrated the inaugural moments for posterity: "Kind words. Gentle words. 
Nothing flashy or particularly memorable. Just good, plain talk from the 
heart." And, as if to reassure Americans that no imposter had reached the 
throne, Kramer explained: "Perhaps it was only the trappings, but George 
Bush finally looked presidential."

<p>Ordinarily, the transition involves a media process by which 
Americans are encouraged to believe that the dubious fellow becoming 
president has swiftly ascended to historic heavens. The rocketing rhetoric 
often overheats.

<p>When voters elected a new president in 1992, numerous media 
outlets seized on fabulous prophesy in footage of 16-year-old Bill shaking 
hands with President John Kennedy on a sun-drenched White House lawn. 
Newsweek made ecstatic noises about "JFK reaching across the years to a boy 
he did not know -- and to whom the torch of leadership now passes in an 
emphatic statement of America's desire for change."

<p>After 10 weeks of obsequious blather in mainstream news outlets, 
the president-elect has usually been able to count on a profuse overflow of 
media adulation saturating his inauguration. But this time around, 
frustration is growing among journalists who yearn to tell fanciful tales 
and put out political versions of Hallmark cards. Post-election events 
continue to preempt the standard unctuous reporting.

<p>In the next couple of months, the amount of syrupy media swill 
about the incoming president's greatness is apt to be significantly 
curtailed. Schlockmeisters are wringing their hands -- but the rest of us 
ought to applaud.

<p>"Our presidents at their inaugurals...make us the dupes of our 
hopes," the incisive journalist I.F. Stone wrote in early 1969. Today, as 
in previous decades, countless reporters and commentators are eager to 
assist in the duping. But right now the task looks difficult.
