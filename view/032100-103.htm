<p>``Look for young feminists where they are, not where we used to be.''	 
</P>
<P>
</P><P>WHAT COULD FEEL more historic than celebrating Women's History Month 
in Gloria Steinem's New York apartment? More than 40 women and men 
gathered there, on the evening after International Women's Day, to 
pay special tribute to the newly emerging women's movements that have 
taken root in Central and Eastern Europe since the collapse of 
communism a decade ago.	 
</P><P>  Looking around the happily crowded living room of international 
and intergenerational feminists -- American second-
wave pioneers, Croatian and Serbian peace activists, thirtysomething 
human rights lawyers and Webmistresses from many countries -- I 
recalled the questions I often hear from friends and acquaintances: 
Where are the younger generations of feminists? Is the women's 
movement fading?	 
</P><P>  With 30 percent of American women identifying as feminists, and 70 
percent saying they support equality between men and women, should we 
worry that feminism is disappearing? Perhaps these questions signify 
that our understanding of feminism, rooted in the American experience 
of the 1960s and '70s, needs to catch up with where the women's 
movement is today. In this age of globalization, feminism has also 
gone global. 	 
</P><P>  Look on the World Wide Web or in the halls of the United Nations, 
and you'll be certain to find women's rights activists of all ages 
and nationalities lobbying their respective governments to uphold 
international human rights conventions. Women today are engaged with 
governments and international institutions in unprecedented ways that 
enable them to collaborate in solving complex and universal problems 
such as violence, economic disparity, reproductive rights and sexual 
health.	 
</P><P>  In the United States two decades ago, it seemed a backlash against 
feminism was dangerously depleting the women's movement. However, 
within the ranks, Ameri
can feminism was reinventing itself, reaching out to newer women's 
movements worldwide, and adopting human rights language to more 
clearly articulate the complexity of violations against women's 
rights. In fact, the notion that ``women's rights are human rights'' 
transformed feminism, strengthening the capacity of activists and 
their organizations to promote gender awareness, protect women's 
entitlements and join forces with the human rights community.	 
</P><P>  Historic advances were made: At the 1993 Vienna World Conference 
on Human Rights, women's advocates organized a global tribunal, which 
succeeded in connecting violence against women to laws dealing with 
human rights abuses that governments are supposed to uphold. 
Moreover, for the first time, in the 1990s, the rape of women was 
recognized as a war crime and is being prosecuted in the former 
Yugoslavia and Rwanda tribunals.	 
</P><P>The U.N. women's conferences, which began in the 1970s, exemplify 
both the power of global organizing and the opportunities for passing 
along the torch from one generation to the next. In 1975, 
International Women's Year, the first U.N. World Conference on Women 
was held in Mexico City and inaugurated the U.N. Decade for Women. By 
fostering a global feminist dialogue and agenda, these assemblies 
were important catalysts in the struggle to achieve gender equality 
worldwide.	 
</P><P>  The fourth U.N. World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 
1995, drew greater international participation from women activists 
</P><P>--many of whom were in their 20s and 30s -- than any of the 
gatherings that had preceded it. Thirty thousand representatives of 
nongovernmental organizations constituted both the largest gathering 
of this kind at a world conference and the largest international 
meeting of women ever. The breadth of participation and the specific 
goals that governments agreed upon to institutionalize equality 
signified that women's movements had reached a new level of maturity 
and strength. No longer were they being treated as special-
interest factions, but now, finally, as key players in shaping the 
global agenda. 	 
</P><P>  Since 1995, women's nongovernmental organizations have been 
organizing to 
pressure their governments to carry out their commitments to the 
Beijing Platform for Action, which established that women's rights 
are human rights; that poverty affects women disproportionately; and 
that health care and education have historically marginalized women. 
This June, a major five-
year, intergovernmental assessment will take place at the United 
Nations. nongovernmental organization leaders worldwide, including 
those gathered at Gloria Steinem's, are preparing to take their 
governments to task.	 
</P><P> International feminism has roots in the early 20th century. By the 
outbreak of World War I, women in many Western countries had 
organized transnational organizations to promote suffragism, peace 
and security. They came together across national boundaries to form 
an international identity for women's rights advocates. With ties to 
the League of Nations and other major international organizations of 
the first half-century, they launched a ``first-wave'' global women's 
movement, winning the vote for some, and lasting up to World War II. 
Just imagine -- a women's rights diplomacy had fanned out across 
continents, even in the absence of fax machines, frequent-flier miles 
and the Internet.	 
</P><P>  A ``second-wave'' of global women's organizing efforts developed 
in the decades following World War II and, drawing inspiration from 
its predecessor, is today multiplying around the world. It is no 
wonder, then, that this year's commemoration of Women's History 
Month, which comes at the start of a new millennium, is fostering 
optimism that the 21st century will build upon the last century's 
foundation of progress to fulfill the still unrealized ideal of full 
equality between women and men. It will take new generations to carry 
out this legacy, and the good news is they are already doing so. You 
simply have to know where to look for them.
