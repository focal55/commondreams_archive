I was born too late. Too late to hear Maria Callas sing live. Too late to see Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev dance in their prime. And too late to appreciate the infancy of the National Endowment for the Arts for what it was -- a glorious moment when government supported and nurtured the fine arts with pride and without apology.
<P>

   I was just a kid when Congress built on the enthusiasm of the late President John F. Kennedy and sitting President Lyndon Johnson by creating the NEA with these words: ``Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens. It must therefore foster and support a form of education, and access to the arts and the humanities, designed to make people of all backgrounds and wherever located masters of their technology and not its unthinking servants.''
<P>

   But as that technology has become all-important in our lives, our unthinking government has shoved public funding for the arts to the shadows.
<P>

   Not that the NEA's funding has dried up entirely, to be sure. The NEA came to be in 1965 with a modest $7 million budget, growing over the years to the 1991 peak of $176 million. On their way to a failed goal of eliminating arts funding entirely, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and his followers hacked the NEA's budget down to just under $100 million.
<P>

   Even though President Clinton won't get the $150 million he asked for in fiscal 2001, the $105 million for the NEA in the Interior Department bill before the Senate last week would represent the agency's first significant budget bump in five years. For arts lovers, that news is reassuring.
<P>

   The 1980s and '90s battles over a few problematic grants continue to haunt us, though. In 1990, Congress received more mail on the NEA, which then cost each citizen 68 cents, than on the savings-and-loan scandal, which cost each of us at least $2,000.
<P>

   A decade later, politicians still tend to veer around the intersection of art and government. That doesn't mean they don't support the NEA, just that they'd rather not say they do.
<P>

   Take presidential candidates Al Gore and George W. Bush. Just as the issue was a no-show in last Tuesday's debate and is unlikely to arise in their remaining showdowns, it's scarcely found on their Web sites.
<P>

   Early this year, though, the candidates answered an Associated Press inquiry about federal subsidies for the arts.
<P>

   Bush put it this way: ``I believe we should continue federal funding for the arts, but give states a greater say in how the funds are spent. I don't believe we should spend public money to support obscene material or denigrate religion.''
<P>

   Gore's answer: ``I strongly believe in encouraging and supporting the arts and would continue the current policy of support. The arts are an important part of our life and our history and should be supported.''
<P>

   Those words count for something, as do the congressional voting records in support of the NEA of Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. But can Gore be expected to be less reticent than Clinton to expend any political capital fighting for the agency? (''Stay out of the headlines,'' then-NEA chairman Jane Alexander was told by a Clinton aide.)
<P>

   On the Republican side, one also must consider Texas' 50th-place ranking in per-capita state funding for the arts; Bush's stated desire to hand arts matters to his wife, Laura; and the long-standing opposition to the NEA by running mate Dick Cheney and his vocal wife, former National Endowment for the Humanities head Lynne Cheney.
<P>

   In its 35 years, the NEA has saved ballet companies, launched careers, tapped children's creativity, and brought culture to the nation's most remote places. It's just that nowadays, the words ``often controversial'' seem to have been grafted onto the NEA's name.
<P>

   I recognize that I'll probably never hear an American of the stature of Winston Churchill declare, as he did when someone suggested that England's arts budget be cut to help fund World War II: ``God, no. What the hell have we been fighting for?''
<P>

   Still, I eagerly await the day when a presidential candidate will speak up on behalf of the arts in general and the nation's arts agency in particular.
<P>

   May I live so long.
