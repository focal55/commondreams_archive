On Wednesday, prosecutors in Russia will try to reopen an espionage
case against Russia's most prominent environmental dissident, Alexander
Nikitin. The bizarre grounds? That the government violated Nikitin's
civil rights the first time it tried to convict him.
<p>Halfway around the world, in Mexico, no less absurd a dilemma faces
Rodolfo Montiel, who organized fellow villagers in the southern state of
Guerrero to nonviolently resist the clear-cutting of forests. The
peasants formed human chains to block logging roads, angering local
timber barons and attracting death threats. In May 1999, Montiel and a
friend, Teodoro Cabrera, were captured at gunpoint by Mexican army
soldiers and tortured for days into making phony confessions to drug and
weapons violations. Last month, a federal court found the two men guilty
and sentenced Montiel to six years and Cabrera to 10 years in jail.
<p>Environmentalism can be dangerous. While activists in wealthy
democratic nations like the U.S. pursue their causes from the comfort of
their middle-class lives, their counterparts in less-fortunate countries
pay a fearsome price for speaking out. But people like Nikitin and
Montiel are defending the Earth we all share. We need them to succeed if
we want to reverse deforestation, toxic contamination, global warming and
other threats to our future. It is time, therefore, to expand our
definition of environmentalism: Defending the Earth also means defending
human rights.
<p>Nikitin's troubles with the authorities began in 1996, when he made
world headlines by exposing what he called "a Chernobyl in slow
motion"--the Russian navy's reckless dumping of mothballed nuclear
submarines in the Barents Sea and Kola Peninsula. A former submarine
captain, Nikitin included only previously published information in his
expose. Nevertheless, the Federal Security Service, Russia's recast KGB,
charged him with espionage--on the basis of a law written months after he
was imprisoned.
<p>Nikitin spent 10 months in jail and three years fighting his way
through the court system. After 11 separate trials, Nikitin was acquitted
of all charges last December by the City Court of St. Petersburg. The
court criticized the Federal Security Service's violations of Nikitin's
rights--the very finding prosecutors now shamelessly cite to justify a
retrial, even though the Russian Supreme Court upheld the acquittal in
April.
<p>Nikitin was lucky in one respect: Besides courage and determination,
he had friends outside Russia with the money, skill and dedication to
help him. The Bellona Foundation, a group based in Norway that published
his expose, organized an effective legal defense team and international
publicity campaign. Vice President Al Gore and French President Jacques
Chirac were just two of the world leaders who talked to former Russian
President Boris N. Yeltsin about Nikitin.
<p>"We made sure that whenever Russian officials and diplomats traveled
abroad, they had Nikitin, so to speak, in their cocktail glasses,"
Bellona's Siri Engesaeth said. Engesaeth made this remark in July at a
meeting of former winners of the Goldman Environmental Prize, at which
Nikitin, who won the prize in 1997 but had been prohibited from leaving
Russia to accept it, was the guest of honor. Montiel won the Goldman
prize this spring but was only allowed to receive it in prison. To free
him, Engesaeth said, outsiders will have to mount a campaign similar to
that for Nikitin.
<p>That campaign is now underway, buoyed by a new alliance between the
Sierra Club and Amnesty International--evidence that environmental and
human rights leaders at last recognize a need to collaborate. Montiel's
case has received media attention, and dozens of members of Congress have
written to Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo urging his immediate
release. Zedillo made no reply, but his successor, President-elect
Vicente Fox, requested a meeting with Sierra Club, Amnesty International
and Goldman officials when he visited Washington in August. Meanwhile,
however, Montiel was convicted.
<p>Clearly it will take added pressure to win justice for Montiel, just
as Nikitin still needs support as he faces the Russian Supreme Court on
Wednesday. In a Sept. 5 interview in New York, former Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev told me, "Some of the Russian institutions are going
overboard on this issue, and we must help put an end to this
prosecution."
<p>Russia and Mexico have each spent 70 years under the thumb of
one-party domination; the rule of law remains weak in both nations. But
even authoritarian states are susceptible to outside pressure--if
outsiders care enough to exert it.
