<p>BOSTON -- In 1873, the Supreme Court  declared in Bradwell v. Illinois  
that the state was justified in 
denying Myra Bradwell a license to practice law on the 
basis of her gender. The court 
informed Bradwell that despite her 
education and skills, as a woman her 
best roles were wife and mother.

<p>  More than 100 years later, New 
Yorkers may give Hillary Clinton that 
same message.

<p> The court's decision in Bradwell 
gave legal recognition to the idea that 
men and women operated in "separate spheres" --  ideology that permeated upper- and middle-class society 
at the time. According to the court, 
"God designed the sexes to occupy 
different spheres of action," and "it 
belonged to men to make, apply and 
execute the laws." The "domestic 
sphere" was women's proper domain.

<p> Such thinking seems quaint today. 
Or does it? 

<p> Hillary Clinton's approval rating as 
first lady was at its lowest when she 
tackled health reform, rose steadily 
when she confined her activity to the 
traditional role as White House hostess, and was at its highest when she 
stoically stood by her husband despite 
his marital infidelity.

<p>    Current reactions to Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign suggest that 
although many approved of her performance in the private sphere, this 
approval won't necessarily help her 
win in the public sphere. 

<p>  Look at the case of Elizabeth Dole. 
When her husband was running for 
president in 1996, she was recognized 
as a great campaigner. There was 
even talk about whether she should 
have been the Republican nominee. 
But when she declared her own presidential bid in 1999, everything 
changed. True, the political landscape 
was not the same, but does that completely explain why her champions in 
1996 suddenly disappeared? Her own 
husband undermined her candidacy 
when he said he wanted to send a 
donation to John McCain. Elizabeth 
Dole, like Hillary Clinton, was only 
popular when she was seen as a wife.

<p>   Historically, women have crossed 
the line from wife of elected official 
to being elected themselves. But in 
those cases,  women typically became 
surrogates for husbands who died in 
office or were ineligible to run.

<p> It is true that the United States has 
made incremental advances over the 
years. Today, women make up some 
20 percent of elected officials. But 
the experience of Hillary Clinton 
shows that these gains aren't complete. Female candidates must deal 
not only with their own personal inadequacies (as every candidate 
must), but also with the larger question of whether their roles as  wives 
and mothers would hurt their role as 
policymakers.

<p>   Indeed,  questions from the media 
further consign Hillary Clinton to the 
domestic realm. Will she and Bill 
Clinton stay married? Was she ever 
unfaithful to him? How does she feel 
about Monica Lewinsky? Putting 
aside the debate over whether such 
questions are appropriate in any circumstance, it is hard to imagine such 
deeply personal questions being 
asked of Rudolph Giuliani.   
<p>

<p>  Of course, Hillary Clinton has 
made her own mistakes. For instance, when she announced her candidacy this week, she proudly stated 
that she made wonderful salads and 
omelets. And she has certainly misinterpreted her popularity  if she 
thought it could be automatically 
converted to a position of public leadership. But if Hillary Clinton can 
make the issues the focus of the 
campaign, the gender barrier might 
come down for good.
