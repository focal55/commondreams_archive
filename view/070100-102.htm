When I came to Canada as a Vietnam War draft dodger on my 25th birthday, in 1968, I had the idea that my new home was equal parts safe haven and self-exile. It took another 31 years before I decided it would also be my country of citizenship.
<P>Initially, I believed I would stay because I would never be able to go back without going to prison. After the 1977 amnesty, I stayed because the only place I truly loved in the world was Montreal. A few years later, the city convulsed and ejected me, when the newspaper I worked for folded. In the bar where the newly unemployed gathered, everyone told me how lucky I was, because I could look for work anywhere on the continent. True, I thought, why maroon myself any further?</P>
<P>I eventually drifted to Toronto, where I felt less like an ex-American than like other ex-English Montrealers, exiled from a gilded time and place. I already had begun feeling like a Canadian whenever work or family took me to the United States: I marvelled at America's energy and openness, and then recoiled at its violence and its refusal to shut its national mouth about almost everything. Still, there was no need to change formal status. My internal status had already changed.</P>
<P>It sounds silly, but what changed my mind was the O.J. Simpson trial. Watching the verdict come in, I was transported back to that cold March day nearly 30 years before, when I felt betrayed by the country that had taught me to believe in transcendent truths.</P>
<P>To be an American of a certain generation is to be born idealistic in ways Canadians almost never are. It was pounded into some sub-subconscious part of the American brain that here, people had made a great political system. As in classic Hollywood films, there would be happy endings, because the democracy launched by revolutionary patriots was good and self-correcting.</P>
<P>But here on television was the O.J. jury and defence team, looking not ashamed but smug. It struck me as much more likely that justice would be done in Canada, because Canada didn't blithely think it was ordained to do good. If Canada was ordained to be anything, it was to be snowy and reasonable. I wanted to remove myself forever from American morality plays. I wanted to live a snowy and reasonable life.</P>
<P>So I got my pictures, filled in the forms, sent in the money, and waited. Eventually, there was a citizenship test (I think I had a perfect score, the fruits of 31 years of study) and awhile later a letter arrived telling me where and when to come in. If there was anything I had learned in life, it was that rites of passage must be marked. So, on the morning of oath day in September, I observed a Canadian rite: I had a flu shot.</P>
<P>&#34;None too soon,&#34; said the nurse who injected me. &#34;We had 200 people in here last week.&#34;</P>
<P>&#34;It's never too soon to fight the flu in Canada,&#34; I joked back.</P>
<P>Then I walked up Yonge Street in Toronto and encountered a beggar girl sitting on the street, with a nose stud, and a German Shepherd resting on her dirty, purple sleeping bag. I remembered that shortly after I arrived in Canada, I lived in a crash pad in Vancouver with people who were spare-changing their way through life -- when begging was an extension of being groovy, not a desperate pseudopod growing on a harsh economy.</P>
<P>I gave her my pocket change. &#34;Thank you, sir,&#34; the girl said, reminding me that in 31 years I had also changed from a hippie &#34;other&#34; to a &#34;Sir Them.&#34;</P>
<P>&#34;Thank you, Canada,&#34; I thought, remembering when dinner was often leftover french fries my street-entrepreneur roommates bought with matchbooks of marijuana.</P>
<P>Architecturally, the citizenship court was a disappointment, a tall, stone, bureaucratic building. But inside, the world was becoming Canadian. There were turbans and veils and ponytails and saris and jeans and sneakers and $1,000 suits. There were people from islands in the Caribbean sitting next to people from the former Soviet Union, next to priests from South America. There were Chinese families with teenagers chewing gum who looked as though they found this so boring it would have been better to stay in school.</P>
<P>It was announced, without explanation, that the National Film Board was going to film the occasion. Anyone who didn't want to be filmed could change to a future date, said the six-foot-tall, very blond clerk of the court, in her provocatively slit skirt. After we'd signed release forms and sat down, she led us through a kind of citizenship pep rally.</P>
<P>&#34;Welcome to citizenship court!&#34; she told us, in the voice third-grade teachers use to greet classes on the first day of school. Everyone, she told us, would have to raise their right hands -- &#34;you know what your right hand is,&#34; she joked, waving hers around. The judge would read the oath of citizenship in English and in -- &#34;what is the other official language of Canada?&#34;</P>
<P>&#34;French,&#34; said some of the brighter inductees.</P>
<P>Yes, and we would repeat the French words too. &#34;That means you are bilingual,&#34; she joked, passing on the myth of language as an official Canadian coating, if not an unofficial seal.</P>
<P>She then confessed that she might mispronounce some names of citizens-to-be, but that we shouldn't take that as diminishing us. It was her problem -- that is, the country's problem. And pictures could be taken of all events except the oath to the Queen.</P>
<P>Ah yes, the Queen. Her picture was up on the wall, one of the older ones, where she looked as if she had just won first prize in the peach-pie-judging contest. It was next to the crest of Canada, with its <I>A mare usque ad mare</I> motto. (Not bilingual enough, I thought, not really Canadian.)</P>
<P>I wondered if I could swear allegiance to the Queen. I admit, I had been astonished to learn she was still the head of Canada. If there was anything I was to the bone, it was a republican. In the unalloyed American part of my brain, the Queen was a relic who didn't unify us multiethnic Canadians any more. Would the court officials noticed if I lip-synched? Was Canada a country that could accept people from every inlet and hollow on the face of the Earth, but not republicans? I wasn't sure what I was going to do.</P>
<P>The thigh-showing, pep-talking clerk warned that if the citizens-to-be didn't like the pictures on our citizenship cards, &#34;It's not our fault. You sent the pictures in to us.&#34;</P>
<P>The film crew went about its business, looking bored. They were largely black, which seemed strange in Canada -- until the judge came in. He was also black, or rather a kind of pale coffee colour. He was wearing a chestful of ribbons, the kind worn on the parade grounds in British war movies. He was slight, grey-haired, walking the way old people do, with half their energy devoted to going forward and half to not falling down. The documentary was about him.</P>
<P>The citizens-to-be rose. The judge greeted the room -- &#34;Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls&#34; -- sounding not unlike P. T. Barnum (&#34;Ladies and gentlemen, and children of all ages&#34;).</P>
<P>I remembered that he was a figure of some importance in Toronto's black community, a railway porter who had become a union leader and then that most problematic of modern things, a role model -- &#34;a credit to his race.&#34; And I was suddenly hoping that, if becoming a Canadian had any transformational quality, it would be to purge the pus of racism I became aware of whenever I encountered black people.</P>
<P>In the racially obsessed country I was born into, ambient prejudice was fed into your veins until the day you awoke to the fact that you did not react to black people rationally. I remembered being at university at a party with one of the few black people I had known. He spoke intelligently, and I had said to myself: He's not black, he's human. And I was immediately deeply ashamed, because I knew that I had discovered something fetid and dank inside myself.</P>
<P>If life was about raising consciousness, I realized, this conjunction of O.J. and the role-model judge was supposed to teach me something. Even if it didn't.</P>
<P>The judge began reading an explanation of what would follow, in both languages. His was the handmade French of the person who learns it in mid-life and never quite gets the rhythms or sounds. At one point he stumbled over a word. Would they edit this out, I wondered, in the filmed hagiography? The word was <I>citoyennet&#233;</I>, a difficult but important one to pronounce -- the French for &#34;citizenship.&#34; Yet the civic message was clear: While not truly bilingual, the judge was trying to respect in words something he couldn't comprehend in fact.</P>
<P>The 80 potential citizens rose and said the oath. Without a stumbled word, I swore loyalty not only to the Queen but to <I>tout ses heritiers</I>, all her heirs. I wondered if that included the grandchildren who look as if they would give anything just to be anonymous.</P>
<P>Canadians haven't found anything better to pledge loyalty to, I thought. What would that be? Winter? We all could swear an oath to winter, promise to endure it and to hope it will be mercifully short. And mosquito repellent. We could honour not just the repellents on the market but their heirs. We could swear an allegiance to doughnuts, or to the wilderness. But, lacking consensus, we make do with the Queen.</P>
<P>&#34;My fellow Canadian citizens,&#34; the judge then said. &#34;That is the first time anyone has ever said that to you.&#34; He commended the group on our skin colours, our various religions and cultures. We were 80 people from 25 countries. He was Toronto-born, he told us, but early on people would say to him: &#34;Where are you from?&#34;</P>
<P>In that time and place he was a Canadian by passport only. All black or even pale-coffee-coloured people were placed in some corral of elsewhereness in the Canadian psyche. He recounted how insular the Toronto of his youth had been, with just a few islands of ethnic differences in his neighbourhood. He spoke about being taunted daily then, and said a few words in some of the languages he had heard in his youth -- Yiddish, Italian, and Chinese from the Chinese laundries -- to gasps of recognition from the new citizens.</P>
<P>His pronunciation of all of these other languages seemed better than anything he said in French, but it hardly mattered. You felt he was happy -- happy as he admonished us to be tolerant, and happy he could describe the more tolerant Toronto where he and his <I>heritiers</I> now live. Behind him the motto of Canada seemed to change. &#34;From elsewhere to here,&#34; it seemed to say, &#34;from a them to an us.&#34;</P>
<P>We all lined up to shake the judge's hand as he gave us our citizenship cards. Just as the clerk had warned, my picture looked awful -- like a drug-dazed, former hippie who now could beg on the street without fear that it was a deportable offence. The new citizens sang <I>O Canada</I>, bilingually, and then the judge delicately picked his way out, and the cameras followed him.</P>
<P>The clerk stood and welcomed us, too, as someone who said she was ninth-generation Canadian on her father's side and seventh-generation on her mother's side. I thought, I am no generations on either side. But I do feel welcome. I do feel, after a trip through cyclonic political and personal seas, that I have arrived. Like the rest of the country, I want to go south for the winter, but I always want to return.</P>
<P>I took my flag pin and returned to The Globe's offices to participate in a group interview with Preston Manning, who may not have recognized the Canada he grew up with in the group that had sworn its allegiance alongside me.</P>
<P>That night, I found myself reading Kipling, the bard of the old Empire, who described this new citizen's adopted country as &#34;our lady of the snows&#34; and who made Gunga Din human, just like the black man at that party so long ago. Kipling was also snowy and decent, and much undervalued.</P>
<P>I read a poem I had never read before, once, and then again, and vowed to memorize it out of respect for the day I became a Canadian citizen. The last verse said what I most deeply felt when the non-bilingual, dark-skinned, silver-haired role model of a truly Canadian judge handed me my citizenship certificate, with the awful picture on it: 
<BR>
    <I>And all people agree,</I> 
<BR>
    <I>And all people say,</I> 
<BR>
    <I>All nice people like Us are We</I> 
<BR>
    <I>And every one else is a They.</I> 
<BR>
    <I>But if you cross over the sea,</I> 
<BR>
    <I>Instead of over the way,</I> 
<BR>
    <I>You may end by (think of it) looking on We</I> 
<BR>
    <I>As only a sort of They.</I></P>
<H4>IT'S OFFICIAL - HOW TO BE A POLITE CANADIAN</H4><P>Upon arrival, landed immigrants are handed a charmingly gauche introductory pamphlet from Citizenship and Immigration Canada, which elucidates for newcomers such items as: What the phrase &#34;bundle up&#34; means; what a mall is; how to use the telephone; how to avoid getting snowed by advertising and salespeople; and how to conduct yourself like a polite Canadian.</P>
<P>Here we provide some highlights from the section entitled The Canadian Way of Life:</P>
<P><B>On Canadian families:</B> &#34;Many people in Canada find that it takes two incomes to raise a family and achieve their goals. This is true of people at all income levels, from factory workers to doctors and owners of companies. . . .</P>
<P>&#34;Many adult children who have completed their education do not live with their families. Many people believe it is important to live by themselves for several years.&#34;</P>
<P><B>On the generation gap:</B> &#34;Teenagers sometimes have difficult relationships with their parents. They explore and test their independence in ways that can challenge their parents' values and traditions. This is called the generation gap. Parents from all backgrounds can find this stage in parenting stressful.&#34;</P>
<P><B>On authority: </B>&#34;In Canada, a person's authority is related to his or her position and responsibility. Women occupy the same range of positions as men and have the same kinds of authority. People do not have authority just because of their name, status, social class or sex.</P>
<P>&#34;It is a good idea to treat all persons with courtesy and respect, especially people with authority. However, you should not act too humble. Most Canadians value confidence and sincerity.&#34;</P>
<P><B>On visiting: </B>&#34;Visiting someone without an invitation is not common -- and sometimes not welcome. Arrangements are usually made in advance, except between very close or informal neighbours and friends. . . .</P>
<P>&#34;Being polite in social situations does not mean accepting everything that is offered or proposed. It is acceptable to say, &#39;No, thank you.' However, if you do want something, say &#39;Thank you,' and accept it the first time you are offered.&#34;</P>
<P><B>On lining up or queuing:</B> &#34;People normally line up or queue according to the principle of first-come, first-served. Others will strongly resent you if you push ahead in lineups.&#34;</P>
<P><B>On modesty and discretion:</B> &#34;Showing moderate affection in public offends very few people in Canada. However, passionate kissing or touching are considered impolite and offensive.&#34;
