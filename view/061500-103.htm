Some weeks ago, a doctor I know received a mail solicitation from a
company that promised to help him manage managed care. The secret to
success? Physicians need to learn how to pick the right patients--healthy
people who rarely, if ever, visit their doctor--and shun the unprofitable
sick.
<p>In the growing competition for health care market share, it is
becoming clear that there is a group of customers the nation's managed
care companies definitely don't want to attract. If patients are too sick
and vulnerable, health maintenance organizations would prefer that they
stay out of their marketplace.
<p>One of the most effective ways to dump such patients is to drive the
most ethical and compassionate physicians out of practice. A recent
article in the New England Journal of Medicine explained why so many
California physician groups are going bankrupt. Today, many HMOs use a
system of "capitated" payments to control costs. Under capitation,
physicians receive a small fixed rate per patient per month, no matter
how sick the patient is and how much treatment and care he or she needs.
Under this system, sick patients can literally bankrupt their physicians.
<p>In Grand Rapids, Mich., pediatrician Beatrice Murray and her three
partners devoted part of their practice to caring for children paralyzed
in accidents or suffering from metabolic diseases, cancer, cystic
fibrosis, cerebral palsy and kidney failure. These children must take
multiple medications, may have breathing or feeding tubes, often need
frequent visits to the hospital and will be severely, chronically ill for
the rest of their lives.
<p>Over the years, the HMOs in Murray's area began to capitate her
practice. With variations based only on sex and age rather than disease
severity, all now pay fixed fees for all patients. Murray and her
partners received from $6 to $30 per child per month to provide for all
their out-patient needs.
<p>To become more efficient, Murray's practice hired a nurse to help
coordinate care. The doctors also scheduled longer visits to provide more
comprehensive and, they hoped, less costly care. Patients and their
parents loved these additional services. But this very customer
satisfaction and loyalty was, as Murray puts it, "the knife to the heart"
of her practice. Parents of sick children told the parents of other sick
children about the practice. More sick children came as patients. All
these satisfied customers were bankrupting the group.
<p>Under even the most generous health care system, caring for sick
people is a difficult job. Doctors can't always figure out what's wrong
with a sick patient and aren't always certain about the proper course of
treatment. Even under the best of circumstances, sick people can be
angry, afraid, irritable, in pain or denial and resistant to following
their doctors' advice. This makes them a drain on the empathy of the most
compassionate doctor.
<p>Add to this managed care micromanagement of every clinical decision
and you have a recipe for turning the care of the sick from a difficult
mission into an intolerable burden. Under the 1-800-Mother-May-I system
of HMO utilization review, doctors must get pre-approval for every
treatment they prescribe and action they take. To really care for their
patients, they must spend hours on the phone arguing with insurance
company bureaucrats.
<p>After a while, many doctors just burn out. "A sick patient comes into
my office, and I wonder how much time it will take to care for them," one
doctor told me. Some physician practices refuse to fight insurance
company denials of care for their patients. Some are unwilling to accept
HMO patients and will take only those who can pay for their services out
of pocket--a strategy that rewards HMOs and punishes the sick.
<p>A recent PBS "Frontline" show about a group of physicians in Boston,
"Dr. Solomon's Dilemma," chillingly documented just how HMOs turn
physicians against the sick. HMOs now send physician groups weekly
accountings of the cost of every pill a patient takes, test he receives,
day in the hospital he uses or home care or physical therapy session he
consumes. Any cost that is not covered by the increasingly parsimonious
rates physicians receive for each patient comes directly out of the
groups' coffers. Not surprisingly, doctors begin to view a patient who
has diabetes or heart disease or cancer not just as a sick person who
needs compassionate care but as a financial loss.
<p>In a truly remarkable feat of financial alchemy, insurers and other
advocates of market health care argue that there isn't enough money in
the $1.2-trillion American health care system to care for the sick. The
U.S. spends $4,600 per person per year on health care--four times as much
as we do on national defense and twice as much as is spent by Western
European nations, most of which have better health outcomes. A publicly
coordinated universal system is the only way this country will ever save
money on health care. As health care economists like Alan Sager at the
Boston University School of Public Health have demonstrated, the
administrative and clinical savings and cheaper drug prices that result
are more than enough to buy care for everyone.
<p>Which is why action on universal health care is increasing at the
state level. Legislative or ballot initiatives supporting universal
health care are being considered in Massachusetts, Maryland and
Washington. Also, U.S. Rep. John F. Tierney (D-Mass.) has introduced in
Congress a bill that would encourage states to develop their own systems
of universal care by removing federal regulatory obstacles and providing
planning and implementation grants.
<p>Americans have a clear choice. We can continue using our premium
dollars and taxes to finance an ever-increasing war against the sick. Or
we can create a health care system that does what it's supposed to do:
Keep us healthy as long as possible and then care for us when we get
sick.
