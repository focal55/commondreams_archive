George W. Bush and the Republican Party have been left dazed by the
sudden turnaround in the campaign. The resurgence of Al Gore seems to be
based on the appeal of his populist message. This caught the Republicans
off guard because the conventional wisdom has been that such a strategy
could not work in times of prosperity. As usual, the conventional wisdom
is wrong.
<p>In reality, it is generally in periods when the middle class feels
financially secure that Americans have been willing to address social
problems.
<p>The Republicans showed just how wedded they are to their view of the
public mood last week when they sent their repeal of the federal estate
tax to President Clinton for an expected veto. They still think they have
the Democrats just where they want them on this issue. "A signature is a
win for families . . . who are haunted by this unfair tax," a gleeful
Rep. Bill Archer (R-Texas) proclaimed.
<p>The Republicans see this giveaway to the children of the super-rich as
an issue that cuts in their favor with voters. We shall see. No issue
more squarely shows the difference between the parties and their
presidential candidates. If the public is ready for the sort of appeal
that Gore made in his acceptance speech, the estate tax repeal will prove
to be a wonderful gift to the Democratic candidate.
<p>Apart from their misreading of the history of the relationship between
public support for reform and economic prosperity, the main reason the
Republicans think this issue will help them is the success they have had
thus far in defining it. The Republicans' deceptive marketing has
succeeded in persuading a substantial portion of the electorate that the
estate tax adversely affects the middle class, taxes the dead and is an
unfair penalty on industry, talent and achievement. All three of these
perceptions are totally wrong--and it shouldn't be hard for Gore and the
Democrats to prove it so.
<p>Currently, the first $675,000 of an individual's estate is exempt, and
small businesses and family farms can pass $1.3 million tax-exempt to
heirs. So the first important fact is that only the very wealthy--the
richest 2%--leave estates large enough to be affected by this tax.
One-tenth of 1% of the American people would get half the benefits of
repeal.
<p>Aside from real problems for small, family-run businesses and family
farms (which can be addressed without repealing the tax), the estate tax
has zero adverse effect on the middle class.
<p>The critical point about this tax that has been obscured by the
skillful disinformation campaign waged by its opponents is that it is not
a tax on the dead. Estate taxes do not take a penny from the deceased.
These are taxes on their living heirs. Far from a tax on industry, talent
and achievement, the estate tax often falls on those whose only talent is
selecting industrious and successful parents. We all know of
ne'er-do-well children of rich people who never worked a day in their
lives but drive new sports cars and spend with reckless abandon.
<p>During the Ronald Reagan years we used to hear a great deal about
"welfare queens." In fact, trust fund princes and princesses are far more
common. They are the real beneficiaries of repeal of the estate tax. Of
course, many heirs of very wealthy people are themselves talented and
industrious. But why not let them use their talents to make their own
fortunes instead of handing them an unfair advantage? We have taken
welfare away from many of the poor; why give welfare (money they did
nothing to earn) to the children of the rich?
<p>Republicans assert that the estate tax is "un-American." They have it
backward. As Americans and heirs to the revolution we commemorated last
month, we ought to be philosophically opposed to repeal of the estate
tax. Our ancestors fought against the concept of inherited position. The
inheritance ethic runs completely counter to the work ethic that is a
cherished American principle. If we believe that the United States should
be a meritocracy in which people earn their own rewards, we have to
prevent some of the competitors from being given a huge head start in the
economic race. Ours is a nation of self-made people, not people who
inherited their position from their ancestors.
<p>This Republican legislation is designed to facilitate the
establishment and perpetuation of an American aristocracy. Americans have
traditionally looked with disdain on inherited wealth and position. We
are a people who think that each person should make his or her own place.
If the Gore campaign uses this gift from its opponents wisely, it can
make clear to middle-class Americans whose side the Republicans are
really on--and plainly it's not theirs.
