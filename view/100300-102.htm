We have seen them, and we will see them again -- jarring images of black-masked, weirdly attired demonstrators battling police, creating havoc in Davos, Seattle, Prague and other pleasant venues where guardians of the world's money gather. Misleading images, too, as the camera captures only the most violent or outrageous of what are mostly peaceful manifestations of dissent. But dissent from what? Why are these people on the streets? Why are they so angry? 
<P>

   They say they are mad about globalization. They are angry because millions of people in poor countries are starving, and they believe the rich countries are doing very little about it except to make darned sure they pay back every dime they ever borrowed to keep alive in the first place. 
<P>

   Globalization is a word that moves easily on the lips of taxi drivers in Latin America and students in Africa. But you are not likely to hear it in tonight's presidential debate because it's a word that still means nothing to most Americans. But don't feel bad, scholars don't agree on what it means, either, or whether it is really new, or even if it's cause for celebration or despair.
<P>

   The English poet John Donne (1572-1631) wrote: ``No man is an island, entire of itself.'' Today, globalization means, among other things, that these words are literally true, even for nations. Worldwide markets, fast transportation, instant communications, the Internet and institutions that span the planet -- from the World Bank to Firestone to Amnesty International -- make it so.
<P>

   Globalization also means we know instantly, live and in color, ``for whom the bell tolls.'' It tolls for three billion people, almost half of humanity, who attempt to survive on $2 or less a day, often without success. It tolls for the 19,000 people for whom a mass funeral procession was held in Prague, where the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) met recently. The symbolic funeral was organized by Jubilee 2000 (<A HREF="http://www.j2000usa.org/">http://www.j2000usa.org/</A>), a group that advocates debt forgiveness for poor nations. Nineteen-thousand is the number of lives Jubilee 2000 says are lost every day because international lending institutions controlled by rich countries squeeze huge debt payments from desperately poor countries. They then have nothing left for health care and other basic human needs. Do the math: It amounts to a staggering yearly toll, about seven million, most of them children.
<P>

   
<P>

   But are these claims true, and can anything be done about it? The claims of anti-globalization protestors are hardly the fantasy of romantic revolutionaries or nostalgic leftists. Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist famous for advising Poland and other Eastern European countries to employ hard-nosed free-market policies to replace socialist economics, recently wrote in The Financial Times that the international financial institutions ``are the instruments of a few rich governments, which hold a majority of the dollar-based votes and would rather pretend that all is well in the world than ask taxpayers to address the urgent problems of the poor.'' Moreover, ``they ignore the needless deaths of millions of people for want of access to basic medicines and nutrition. Money that could be directed toward public health is instead siphoned off to pay debts owed to western governments and the IMF and World Bank.'' Sachs adds that among those avid to collect, ``The United States is the most egregious.''
<P>

   The rich countries can afford to do a lot to decrease death and suffering among the world's poor, beginning with canceling the debt of poor countries that commit to spending the savings on health, education and other human needs. That won't happen unless citizens are better informed about how little we are doing, and our leaders are willing to tell us that unpopular truth. We think our country spends a fortune on foreign aid; actually we spend less per capita than any other rich nation. The average American pays less than 9 cents a day in taxes spent on foreign assistance, down from 11.5 cents in 1993. Is that the best we can do to save the first generation of the new millennium?
