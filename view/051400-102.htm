WASHINGTON -- On this Mother's Day, 
thousands of mothers 
will march on Washington to demand 
tough new gun control legislation, but it 
is unlikely that the Million Mom 
March will prove effective in getting 
Congress to act. Americans have 
been marching on Washington to demand change ever since the populist 
Jacob Coxey led his ragtag army of 
the unemployed from Ohio to Washington during the depression of the 
1890's. Some of these marches have 
had lasting and visible effect, but 
others have been quickly forgotten.

<p> The most successful marches 
have made straightforward, but far-reaching, demands that the president or Congress could conceivably 
meet. Participants in the August 
1963 civil rights march demanded 
that Congress pass the civil rights 
bill that had already been introduced; the antiwar marchers in October 1967 demanded that the Johnson administration get out of Vietnam.

<p> The effective marches have also 
attracted not just unexpectedly 
large numbers, but usually the participation of important and powerful 
public figures. Walter Reuther, the 
head of the United Auto Workers, 
had a prominent role in the 1963 
march, along with Martin Luther 
King Jr. and the N.A.A.C.P.'s Roy 
Wilkins. The 1967 antiwar demonstration featured leading literary 
lights, including Robert Lowell,  Allen Ginsberg  and Norman Mailer, 
who celebrated the march in "The 
Armies of the Night."

<p> Perhaps most important, 
marches that have won the most 
serious attention have embodied, 
implicitly or explicitly, the threat of 
nonviolent civic disruption and national embarrassment. They carried 
an intimation of chaos, if not in the 
demonstration itself, then from what 
could occur afterward. This sort of 
threat was obvious in the 1932 Bonus 
March of World War I veterans, 
which helped discredit President 
Herbert Hoover, and in the 1967 and 
1969 antiwar marches. 

<p>   This last characteristic has held 
true for the most successful civil 
rights demonstrations. The massive 
 1963 march was entirely peaceful, 
though its leaders included three 
proponents of civil disobedience: 
 King, James Farmer of the Congress of Racial Equality and John 
Lewis of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. The march 
didn't just make a moral appeal; it 
sent a warning that the more obstreperous parts of the movement 
would not accept defeat.

<p> One of the most successful 
marches on Washington never happened at all. In 1941, as the country 
began preparing for war, A. Phillip 
Randolph, the chairman of the 
Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, began to organize a huge 
march on Washington to demand 
that President Franklin  Roosevelt 
issue an executive order banning 
discrimination in defense industries 
and the armed forces. Roosevelt, 
fearful that the demonstration would 
weaken support among blacks for 
the coming war effort, capitulated 
and signed the executive order five 
days before the march was to occur.

<p> The less successful demonstrations of recent years have all fallen 
short in at least one crucial respect. 
Civil rights marches in 1983 and 1993 
attracted as many people as the 1963 
march, but they lacked either a 
clear and achievable demand or the 
threat of disruption. They functioned 
largely as uplifting social events, as 
have Earth Day demonstrations, 
which have become little more than 
concerts on the Mall. The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Solidarity Day in 1981, which 
attracted 260,000 demonstrators, 
and the 300,000-strong abortion 
rights march in 1989 were forgettable because it was not clear what 
was being demanded or what exactly would happen if the demands 
were not met.

<p> Today's Million Mom March 
promises to be a stirring event. It 
has certainly inspired political discussion and reflection, and it may 
contribute to making gun control a 
more salient issue in the fall elections. The leaders are calling for 
handgun registration and licensing 
-- a reasonably dramatic demand -- 
but they are not even insisting that 
the president sign on. And the only 
threat is far off: the marchers' opposition at the polls in November. 
(Won't most of them be voting for 
pro-gun control candidates anyway?)

<p>  Moreover, there is no hint of disorder. The marchers are not contemplating picketing gun stores, 
clogging the aisles at gun shows or 
sitting in at the offices of recalcitrant politicians -- activities that 
would raise the costs of not taking 
the moms seriously.

<p> These tactics may not be necessary for getting controls on guns. It 
might make more sense to create a 
national organization of mothers 
who can walk precincts and run ads 
against politicians who oppose gun 
control. That's the way much of politics is conducted today, and there is 
nothing wrong with it. But if that is 
what the proponents of gun control 
want to do, then the Million Mom 
March, no matter how wonderful an 
occasion, is only a small, and perhaps not even needed, step.
 
<P>Organizations rarely 
grow out of marches, 
as Bayard Rustin, the 
organizer of the 1963 
civil rights march 
learned when he tried 
to sustain the coalition. 

<p> If the moms marching today are 
serious about winning the battle 
over gun control, they will have to 
show the allies of the National Rifle 
Association that if they continue to 
block legislation, they may have to 
face opposition more daunting than 
Sunday marchers or precinct walkers.
