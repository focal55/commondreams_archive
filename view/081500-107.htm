I'm writing this column one week after a very interesting breakfast experience. One of my very white and very conservative friends invited me to "break bread" with five members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans during their recent national convention in Charleston.
<p>
   I found refreshing common ground on many present-day issues with four of the five men at that breakfast table, four men who were obviously sincere about honoring their ancestors who fought for the South in the War Between the States. One of those five, however, came to breakfast in a combative mood.
<p>
   He immediately rattled off many of the tired and self-serving rhetorical justifications that I've come to expect from those who seek not dialogue, but acceptance of their view of "Southern Heritage."
<p>
   He lectured me on the role of Africans in the slave trade, the historical documentation of African-American Confederate soldiers, the strange concept of "benevolent" slave owners, the existence of slavery in present day Sudanese Africa and the present-day "social problems" that he narrowly saw as problems of race rather than problems of economic class. He made it plain that he came to breakfast to defend what he called "the Southern way of life."
<p>
   I had to remind that one Confederate apologist of something that his four comrades readily understood and accepted - I am also a lifelong Southerner who finds no affinity whatsoever to "way of life" embodied in the Southern Confederacy.
<p>
   I acknowledge the history of the Civil War, but the heritage of those who fought to preserve the right of states to maintain an economic system based on people owning people is something that I cannot embrace. That lone Confederate apologist could not or would not understand that heritage means different things to different people, that one person's revered hero is another person's war criminal.
<p>
   I thought of that Confederate apologist in the midst of the ongoing media frenzy surrounding the recovery and preservation of the Confederate submarine Hunley. There have been no pickets, protests or cries of injustice about the Hunley project from the state NAACP or any other civil rights organization.
<p>
   That lack of protest should speak volumes to those who erroneously allege that the ongoing effort to remove the Confederate battle flag from positions of sovereignty at the Statehouse is but one step in an insidious plot to erase Southern history and heritage.
<p>
   The Hunley is a legitimate historical artifact, and is an object of reverence for those whose heritage embraces the Confederacy. The Hunley was also, however, an ingeniously designed killing machine used by those who were seen as traitors by their Union opponents.
<p>
   Those who celebrate the raising of the Hunley for reasons of heritage should also understand why I strongly support and would celebrate the erection of a monument to Denmark Vesey in Charleston's Hampton Park, for heritage means different things to different people.
<p>
   The editorial page of The Post and Courier has included numerous letters from those who vehemently oppose a monument to Vesey. They note that Vesey's ill-fated rebellion against slavery would have caused the deaths of many white Charlestonians and label Vesey as a butcher and insurrectionist.
<p>
   They fail to note that our nation came into being by way of violent insurrection led by those labeled as treasonous rebels by Great Britain. They fail to note that many of the monuments on the grounds of Charleston's City Hall celebrate the deeds of those who rebelled against the United States of America; created and fought for a nation that condoned the buying, selling and brutal treatment of my ancestors, and carried those traditions forward in the Jim Crow laws of the American South of the early 20th century.
<p>
   My heritage tells me that Vesey was a complex and committed man who saw armed rebellion as the only way to combat a brutal and indefensible economic system based on chattel slavery.
<p>
   My heritage is that of a pastor in the church of Vesey's choice, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, a church that was persecuted in Charleston following the Vesey incident and forced to worship in secret until the end of the Civil War. The congregation that I am blessed to serve as pastor, Morris Brown AME Church, is named for Vesey's pastor, who fled Charleston for his life after the Vesey incident and later became the second elected and consecrated Bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.
<p>
   I do not personally celebrate the recovery of the Hunley, but I raise no objection to its recovery and do not condemn those who find its recovery to be an occasion to celebrate their heritage. Those who celebrate its recovery, however, should not object to my celebration of the memory of Denmark Vesey by means of a monument to his cause and memory. Heritage, after all, means different things to different people.
<p><i>Darby is senior pastor at Morris Brown AME Church and 1st vice president of the S.C. Conference of branches of the NAACP.</i>
