WASHINGTON -- There are no easy measures of success or failure for protest

demonstrations. Concessions by entrenched powers are seldom choreographed to

illustrate the precise impact of street-level challenges to the status quo.

<p>Thus the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Civil Rights did not bring an

immediate end to the state-sponsored segregation that defined the American

South. Nor did 1969's moratorium marches, which repeatedly filled the streets of

Washington with hundreds of thousands of anti-Vietnam War activists, cause

Richard Nixon to instantaneously pull the plug on American adventurism in

Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>But today it is broadly accepted that demonstrations on the streets of the

nation's capital moved the center of political gravity in the 1960s and early

1970s.</p>

<p>What history will say of this spring's Mobilization for Global Justice, and

the related protests of the last week, won't be known for a good long time. But

there is no denying that a movement no one would have predicted even six months

ago succeeded in shaking up official and unofficial Washington. Nor should there

be any doubt about the value of this series of loosely linked demonstrations

seeking relief of debts that prevent progress in developing countries, opposing

the Clinton administration's efforts to grant permanent most-favored nation

trading status to China, and challenging the pro-corporate bias of World Bank

and International Monetary Fund lending and development policies.</p>

<p>"If you think about where the dialogue was on a whole host of these issues

just a few months ago, and then look at it today, you can see that we are

changing the direction of the debate,'' says Multinational Monitor editor Robert

Weissman, who worked with Essential Action and dozens of other groups to

organize the mobilization, which ended Monday.</p>

<p>Weissman is a savvy activist, who is justly cautious about claiming symbolic

victories. But he had plenty to crow about following the culmination of a week

of hastily organized protests that had a total organizational and promotional

budget of around $120,000.</p>

<p>Consider the record:</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">l </font><i>Jubilee 2000 campaigners rallied April 9

to demand cancellation of international debts with interest payment requirements

so oppressive that governments of impoverished nations must pay off bankers

rather than provide food, shelter, health care and education.</i> President

Clinton actually sent a letter to the organizers of that event, embracing the

cause. Members of Congress stepped up efforts to provide U.S. funding for debt

relief. And World Bank officials said they would support more -- through

certainly not enough -- debt cancellation.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">l </font><i>Labor unions and environmental and human

rights groups rallied April 12 in opposition to the Clinton administration's

efforts to end annual reviews of trade between China and the United States</i>.

Granting China permanent most-favored nation status was referred to by one union

leader as "the international sweatshop development and growth act'' because it

would ease the way for multinational corporations to expand their use of Chinese

prison labor camps to produce goods for U.S. consumption. Within days of the

rally and lobbying by thousands of union members from across the country, House

Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who had been wavering, broke with

Clinton and sided with labor's position on the issue.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">l</font> <i>Throughout the week, AIDS activists from

Philadelphia ACT-UP campaigned aggressively to focus attention on the failure of

the World Bank, the IMF and the U.S. government to address the growing AIDS

crisis in</i> <i>Africa.</i> The World Bank's Development Committee on Monday

issued a communique promising major new initiatives against AIDS, while the

Clinton administration is scrambling to adjust Africa trade policy to better

respond to the crisis.</p>

<p><font face="Wingdings">l </font><i>On April 16, activists from around the

world filled the streets to challenge World Bank and IMF policies that place a

greater emphasis on creating new sources of cheap labor and resources for

multinational corporations than on ending</i> <i>poverty.</i> They argued that,

for all the official talk of noble purposes, the World Bank and the IMF have

done more harm than good in much of the world. On April 17, no less a figure

than U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers admitted: "The overall benefits of

(World Bank and IMF) aid have been disappointing, particularly in the poorest

countries.'' Too often, Summers added, "there remains a gap between the banks'

policies and development aspirations and actual results on the ground.'' At the

same time, IMF officials claimed -- in the face of understandable skepticism --

that they are going to place a new emphasis on anti-poverty initiatives.</p>

<p>If that's a record of failure or misdirection, please let's see more of the

same.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best measure of the success of the protests came in the rapid

response of conservative commentators with a history of defending the interests

of multinational corporations. Rush Limbaugh and Tony Snow raced to their radio

studios to dismiss the activists as "know-nothings'' and "Marxists.''</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal editorial page wrote off the protests by organized

labor, mainstream church groups, human rights organizations and thousands of

newly energized students as "underwhelming.'' The protesters were nothing more

than "global village idiots,'' the Journal editorialists suggested; the

demonstrations in Washington, the paper added, represented nothing more than an

alternative spring break that allowed "ragtag packs of well-to-do kids'' to let

off a little steam before final exams.</p>

<p>The Journal editors somehow missed the presence of environmental activists

who had traveled from as far away as India and Nigeria to join the protests,

along with church leaders from Latin America, Chinese dissidents such as Harry

Wu, steelworkers from Gary, retirees from Santa Barbara, veterans from Portland

and anti-sweatshop activists from Madison. It should come as no surprise that,

to the defenders of all things corporate and conglomerated, those who campaign

for economic and social justice really do "all look alike.''</p>

<p>To those who actually witnessed what went on in the streets and in the

corridors of political and economic power in Washington last week, however, it

was impossible to dismiss the protests. Indeed, Tuesday's Washington Post

concluded: "By grabbing media attention, the protesters managed to put before a

broader public a debate (over) whether globalization, the rapid integration of

national economies, is enriching a few nations by impoverishing others.''</p>

<p>Says C. Fred Bergsten, an economist who served on a congressional commission

that studied the World Bank and the IMF: "Both are trying to deal directly with

the most cogent and legitimate concern of the critics, including the critics in

the street -- that they are not addressing themselves to the alleviation of

poverty.''</p>

<p>No single week of activism is going to make right all the wrongs of the

world, and this past week certainly did not. Indeed, the coalitions that will

make up this movement are still getting to know one another, and still getting

to know their potential.</p>

<p>Yet, by any honest measure, this mobilization has tipped the balance in the

direction of global justice.
