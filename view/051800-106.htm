My friend Chuck Collins speaks with some authority on the subject of giving
away money.
<p>The great-grandson of a bologna maker named Oscar Mayer, Chuck grew up as one
of many heirs to a not inconsiderable fortune. When the Madison-born,
Michigan-reared son of privilege reached the age of 21, he inherited a cool
$275,000.</p>
<p>This was almost 20 years ago, back before the days of dot-com billionaires. In those days, $275,000 went a long way. And Chuck stretched it further as the go-go economy of the 1980s heated up. Lending credence to the old bromide that "the best way to get rich is to be born rich,'' Chuck watched his fortune grow to roughly $500,000 by the time he was in his mid-20s.</p>
<p>It wasn't hard. Chuck went to college in Michigan, played ultimate frisbee, read history and economics and banked the interest payments on his ever-expanding largesse. As the saying goes: "The rich get richer.''
</p>
<div align="left">
  
</div>
<p>That's not a particularly bothersome notion to some wealthy folks, who
convince themselves that they are earning interest because they're smarter or
because they play a better game of frisbee than the rest of us. But it bugged
Chuck.</p>
<p>So he decided to really <i>stretch</i> his good fortune. Indeed, Chuck did
something with his money that some of his fellow heirs would say was downright
crazy.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * *</b></p>
<p>
In the midst of the greed-is-good Reagan era, Chuck gave his fortune away.</p>
<p>Every penny.</p>
<p>It was, he explained, an investment in a better world. Chuck handed 40
percent of his money to the Funding Exchange, which directs major donations to
groups working for economic and social justice across the United States. Chuck
turned the remainder of the money over to organizations that fund progressive
activism in New England and the Southern United States.</p>
<p>Chuck said it was &quot;something I felt that I had to do.''</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, he didn't believe he was rich because he was necessarily
smarter, or better bred or even more agile with the frisbee than his fellow
Americans.</p>
<p>To be sure, Chuck says, children of wealthy parents are &quot;fed a whole lot
of myths'' about how they are deserving heirs. Chuck can tick the myths off:
&quot;People have worked hard.'' &quot;They've taken risks and succeeded.''
&quot;They're smarter.''</p>
<p>But growing up in the upscale Detroit suburb of Bloomington Hills, he found
himself asking a lot of questions. It all started after the Detroit riots of
1967, in which impoverished African-Americans shook the very foundations of that
great industrial city with a cry for change that echoed 'round the world. Young
Chuck was smart enough to see that economic disparity was at the root of most
objections to the status quo. While his parents and their wealthy friends tended
to be white, he observed, &quot;I noticed that poor people tended to be black,
like our housekeeper ... who came from downtown Detroit to work at our house.''</p>
<p>Youthful idealism can be very inspiring. But more than 30 years after Detroit
exploded in that long hot summer, Chuck is still battling the economic injustice
he first recognized as a youth.</p>
<p>After earning a master's degree in business and community economic
development from New Hampshire College, he moved to Boston and co-founded United
for a Fair Economy, the single most effective group in the country when it comes
to publicizing issues of economic injustice, income disparity, the racial
underpinnings of the gap between rich and poor, and, above all, the yawning
chasm between the salaries of corporate CEOs and those of working Americans.</p>
<p>One of Chuck's big projects has been the push for what he refers to as
&quot;responsible wealth.'' No, he's not telling everyone else who ever
inherited or earned a fortune to give it all away. But he is encouraging wealthy
Americans to give more of their money to social-change groups, which are less
about the Band-Aid of charity than the cure of economic development and
community transformation. He has even gotten some of America's wealthiest
citizens to support capital gains taxes and other progressive formulas that
ensure that the rich pay their fair share.</p>
<p>This year Chuck is traveling the United States to promote a new book on
giving money to promote social change, &quot;Robin Hood Was Right'' (W.W. Norton
and Co.). Co-written with two of his longtime allies in the struggle for
economic justice -- Pam Rogers, a UW-Madison School of Social Work graduate who
for many years was special projects coordinator with the Haymarket People's Fund
and now works with United for a Fair Economy, and Joan Garner, executive
director of the Atlanta-based Southern Partners Fund -- the book is a call for a
mixture of progressive philanthropy, government action and personal commitment
on behalf of real change.</p>
<p>The authors pay homage to Robin Hood -- who stole from the rich and gave to
the poor -- because, as Rogers says, &quot;Robin Hood was right because he
rocked the status quo.'' And there can be no question that the authors want to
see all Americans direct their giving in the most powerful of directions.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time to re-evaluate what our money can and cannot do,'' the
authors argue, adding, &quot;We believe that giving can be one of the most
joyous and rewarding experiences. Done consciously, and with one eye always on
the goal of attaining social and economic justice, it can be one of the most
satisfying of ways to spend money.''</p>
<p align="center"><b>*  </b><b>*  *</b></p>
<p>This weekend, Collins and Rogers will be all over Wisconsin, pushing the idea
that Robin Hood really was right, and that all of us can join in the process of
transforming society, not by giving away our fortunes -- such as they are or
aren't -- but by giving to groups like the Wisconsin Community Fund that in turn
guide money into groups working for democracy, justice, and economic and social
equality.</p>
<p>Typically, Chuck won't be talking much about himself. He and Pam will be
talking instead about the generosity of people such as Madisonians Art and Sue
Lloyd, about the good work of the Wisconsin Community Fund and similar groups,
and about the very real possibility that America can be transformed by a new way
of looking at charity and contributing to change.</p>
<p>Listen up. Chuck Collins is a man with something to teach us all -- about
ourselves and about our ability, no matter what our economic circumstances, to
play a part in transforming the world around us.</p>
