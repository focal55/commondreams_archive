<p>Denis Hayes is back. The menace he's stalking this
time: dirty energy, which contributes to global
warming and befouls the air in the world's cities.
The last time Denis Hayes organized Earth Day, in
1990, 200 million people turned out -- and a
recycling craze swept America. Before that, Hayes
and then-U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson (D-WI) made
history by getting 20 million people to rally for
clean air and water for the first Earth Day in 1970,
a groundswell credited with spurring Nixon-era
passage of the landmark Clean Air Act, the Clean
Water Act and formation of the federal Environmental
Protection Agency.</P>

<P>Now Hayes has returned for a third time to put on
what promises to be the world's biggest
environmental event ever. Earth Day 2000 -- the 30th
anniversary of Earth Day on April 22 -- is expected
to rile up 500 million people on all continents and
in more than 160 nations. People from hugely
divergent backgrounds all seem to be getting
involved somehow, from Chicago college kids devising
ways to avoid trash problems at what they hope will
be the first sustainable rock concert, to Afghani
refugees learning about better wastewater disposal
in their temporary refugee camps.</P>

<P><B>Working for a Watershed</B></P>

<P>Will the 2000 Earth Day change history, as did its
predecessors? From schoolkids to priests, lots of
people have their own hopes about that, and have
already started the Earth Day countdown with
intriguing energy-saving projects sprouting up
around the nation. Given that every time we turn on
a light switch, car ignition, lawn mower or electric
can opener we contribute to the greenhouse gases
going into the atmosphere, this Earth Day message
hits close to home for consumers as much as for
politicians and businesses. The event's rally cry:
"Clean Energy Now!"</P>

<P>Environmental deep thinkers are saying that the next
big trade and business revolution could be sparked
if the U.S. and other nations would only ratify the
Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 treaty hammered out in
Kyoto, Japan, to get countries to agree to take
specific steps to reduce the output of greenhouse
gases. In a not-so-subtle nudge to federal
legislators, Earth Day festivities host and actor
Leonardo DiCaprio is to walk on stage at the
nation's main Earth Day event in Washington, D.C.
wearing a T-shirt that reads simply, "Kyoto."
Meanwhile, Hayes, a mild-mannered man who seems an
unlikely ringleader, is on a mission to combat
global warming, person by person. He is pushing the
Earth Day 2000 Clean Energy Agenda, a document
developed by a consortium of such major
environmental organizations as the Natural Resources
Defense Council. It demands what some call "The Four
Cleans" -- clean cars, clean power, clean air and
clean investments.</P>

<P>Consumers should be able to buy sport-utility
vehicles and pick-up trucks, for instance, that are
subject to the same air pollution standards as cars,
adherents say. New cars and trucks should get an
average 45 miles per gallon by 2010 and 65 miles per
gallon by 2020. And instead of spending tax dollars
subsidizing coal, oil and nuclear power, there
should be a fourfold increase in federal investments
in renewable energy and energy efficiency over the
next five years. A good goal, they say: By 2020, at
least one-third of the nation's energy should come
from the sun, wind or other renewable sources
(excluding hydro power, which has caused damage to
wild rivers and fish populations).</P>

<P>And while we're at it, say Earth Day organizers,
let's clean up the air by setting progressively
tighter pollution limits on power plants. A current
loophole lets old coal-fired plants pollute much
more than newer plants. Organizers are asking the
public to jump aboard the Clean Energy Now! campaign
by endorsing it at www.earthday.net or signing up at
Earth Day events. "No issue is more critical to our
future than global warming," contends John Adams,
president of the Natural Resources Defense Council
and board member of Earth Day Network. "That's why
our campaign focuses not only on the problem of
global warming, but also on the solution -- clean
energy."</P>

<P>"We know how to solve this problem. Global warming
is something we know how to solve," adds Hayes, who
was a Harvard Law intern working in the office of
U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson (D-WI) when Nelson
tapped him to organize the first Earth Day in 1970.
Now, 30 years later, Hayes is chair of the Earth Day
Network, based in Seattle.</P>

<P>"At this point, all we need is the determination to
do it," says Michelle Ackermann, Earth Day Network
spokesperson. "Let's not get held up by what elected
officials will or won't do, "Let's just start doing
it. If we want more fuel-efficient cars, we can
start asking American car manufacturers to go ahead
and make those fuel-efficient cars available to us."
(Japanese carmakers don't need that message: They're
selling both the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius,
highly fuel-efficient "hybrid" cars with both gas
and electric motors, on the U.S. market this year.)</P>

<P><B>A Broad Coalition</B></P>

<P>Changing the world, one person at a time, is an
appealing idea that so far has attracted at least
3,200 green-minded, religious, government or other
organizations worldwide to jump aboard the Earth Day
2000 bandwagon. Taking to heart the idea of being
God's good stewards of the Earth, the Reverend Sally
Bingham hopes to entice Episcopal congregations all
over California to switch to green power by Earth
Day 2000, just as her Grace Cathedral in San
Francisco has.</P>

<P>"The cathedral is saving money," says Bingham, who
is also co-director of a program she started called
Episcopal Power and Light. The cathedral shaved at
least 10 percent off its power bill with
energy-saving efforts such as installing sensors
that automatically switch off lights when a person
leaves the room. Too warm? She opens windows instead
of turning on the air conditioner. Regular
lightbulbs are gone. Cool-burning, energy-saving
compact fluorescent bulbs have taken their place.
Plus, renewable energy costs one to two percent less
than regular electricity, Bingham says.</P>

<P>When she preaches on her bully pulpit, though, cost
savings aren't her overriding concern. Encouraging
the new green power industry also creates jobs. This
way, she says, people "walk a little lighter on the
land. You wouldn't love God and destroy what God
created...Our parishioners can save money, save the
world and create green jobs, all by making a phone
call." At first, however, Bingham adds, "We
certainly did have lots of skeptics -- people we
called the Doubting Toms."</P>

<P>Global warming isn't an issue, some of these
skeptics counter. Others simply resist change. Still
others fear that a breakup of the electricity
industry would result in a confusing consumer
morass, like the telephone industry. But Bingham --
who takes her consciousness-raising slide show from
church to church (just as a compatriot does in
Pennsylvania churches) has ready replies. "I've only
had one case where people decided they didn't want
to switch power companies," she says, adding that 25
Bay Area churches switched by December.</P>

<P>Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley is preaching from a
bully pulpit of his own, backing efforts to clean up
the city's dirty air and testing ways to lessen the
heat island effect by greening rooftops -- including
that of City Hall. By Earth Day, 21,000 different
plants, including two oaks, are to take root atop
the 11-story building's black tar roof. Most are
low-maintenance groundcover plants rooted in
four-inch-deep soil. Butterflies are expected to
eventually flutter amid shrubs and prairie grass
planted in deeper soil. The  city expects to save
$4,000 a year in heating and cooling costs from the
20,000-square-foot garden since plants are better
insulators than merciless black tar.</P>

<P>According to Hashem Akbari, a scientist at Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley,
California, Chicago could save even more money,
considering the square-foot cost of $10 to $20 to
plant gardens, if it simply painted the roof white,
which would cost 60 cents to $1 per square foot.
Cheaper yet -- listen up, homeowners -- the city
could wait until it's time to reroof, then order a
white roof instead of dark. "At that time, you won't
pay anything extra," Akbari says.</P>

<P>But pleasant green rooftops make a statement in a
high rise-dominated downtown. Greenery also does a
better job insulating during fabled blustery winters
and reducing stormwater runoff (easing the load on
sewers), argues Bill Abolt, Chicago's environment
department commissioner. Plus, "it makes the point
about air quality -- cities are getting hotter."</P>

<P>Business considerations are driving Chicago's zest
to slow down its smoggy contribution to global
warming. Air pollution is so bad that the federal
government calls the Windy City a "severe
non-attainment area for ozone," which  translates
into bigger hurdles for industries that want to
relocate to the city. The price of compliance --
including hiring consultants and other costs -- is
as much as 50 times higher, and takes at least twice
as long, if a factory wants to relocate to a
brownfield in Chicago instead of head to virgin land
just outside the zone, says Abolt. Hoping also to
shake an unhealthy, smoggy image to attract more
white-collar jobs, the city is working on several
ideas to clear the air -- including a lawnmower
buyback program to remove notorious carbon-belching
polluters. Residents ideally would switch to
easy-care natural landscaping.</P>

<P><B>Creative Approaches</B></P>

<P>Yet, Earth Day is about empowering everyone, big and
small, and an amazing array of folks are jumping
aboard with unusual projects. Take the tens of
thousands of Clevelanders who will learn en route
about Cuyahoga River pollution on a walk/run that
ends at a huge EarthFest at the zoo.</P>

<P>But Earth Day is no longer solely an American event.
Around the world, celebrations take unique cultural
coloration. In Great Britain, for instance, the
Rainforest Foundation-UK is taking over a commercial
space in central London for a renewable energy fair,
complemented by exhibits that tie together
environmental and human rights issues. The
Conservation Foundation is organizing Australia's
energy-related event, while New Zealand's Department
of Conservation is focusing on recruiting women to
work on natural resource conservation projects.</P>

<P>Perhaps because it's one of the world's leading
carmakers, Japan will create a car-free zone in
Tokyo on Earth Day, with parades and fairs around
the reknowned Rainbow Bridge. Earth Day Japan is
campaigning to end production of ozone-damaging
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the country. In India,
a women's group will use solar panels to create
crafts on Earth Day. Tel Aviv, Israel was the site
of a huge event in 1999, and Green Action there
promises that the 2000 festival will be much bigger.
In Jordan, Queen Noor herself is heading an Earth
Day celebration coordinated by the Royal Society for
the Conservation of Nature. And in Hanoi, Vietnam a
bird-watching club is being organized.</P>

<P>Some 30,000 students will plant trees in Mexico
City, and schoolchildren in Brazil will decorate
United Nations buildings with woven cloth gathered
from other classrooms around the world. In
environmentally threatened Madagascar, a concert
will be coordinated with a capital city cleanup and
the release of a special film. In Ghana, a three-day
workshop will focus on medicinal plants, conserving
fresh water, renewable energy and desertification.
And in what is surely a sign of our times, Afghanis
in refugee camps will learn about wastewater
management, an important topic for people living in
crowded conditions.</P>

<P><B>Greening Schools</B></P>

<P>Passion is evident. Erin Porter did an environmental
audit of the photography lab at her Pittsburgh High
School as part of her environmental club's
schoolwide green audit for Earth Day 2000. Porter
searched to see: Is the fixer recycled? Are
chemicals properly handled? "The teacher was
slightly hesitant at first," says Porter. But for
naught. If the green survey were a report card, she
says, the lab would get an A. What Porter really
noticed, however, was how she started to view
chemicals back home. Now, she says, "I'm much more
conscious of what I'm dumping down the sink."</P>

<P>Students across the country are sleuthing around
schools to see if they're using the right lightbulbs
for energy efficiency or recycling to save landfill
space. They're doing it with help from Earth Teams,
a program based in Contra Costa, California, that
provides teachers relevant fun projects for what
they already need to teach while jumping aboard the
Earth Day theme.</P>

<P>Kids can chat online about what they're learning and
get materials at www.earthteam.net. "It is going
beautifully," Earth Teams founder Sheila Fish says,
happy about the demand. "It is almost more than I
can handle because people are loving the project."
Kids don't consider it painful work. Instead, she
says, "They're eager."</P>

<P>"What they really like is the fact that it's tied to
other students at other high schools," notices Dan
Hanel, science coordinator for Pittsburgh Unified
School District. Not that the Clean Energy Now!
message of Earth Day is a slam dunk, an event
certain to change all our lives. While nearly nine
out of 10 Americans say they are concerned about the
nation's environment, the question is whether
they're willing to make changes personally. Roper's
"1998 Green Gauge Report" found that consumers at
both ends of the green scene -- the activists and
the unconcerned -- say they won't pay a premium for
greener goods. Activists who use more Earth-friendly
products don't think they should pay extra to do so,
and people who couldn't care less about the
environment don't see why they should pay more for
products, according to the poll reported in American
Demographics magazine. All this suggests that
products had better be competitively priced if
greenhouse gases are to be curbed.</P>

<P>"We're not out of the woods," says David Brower, 87,
dean of America's modern environmental movement.
Fearing that he spent his years at the helm of the
Sierra Club, Earth Island Institute and Friends of
the Earth simply "slowing down" destruction instead
of stopping it cold, Brower nonetheless says we may
be on the verge of an initial turnaround. The best
sign, he says, is the new alliance of labor and
environmentalists protesting publicly together at
Seattle's World Trade Organization meeting in
November. "That started something that I think is
catching power," says Brower, who predicts the WTO
protests will be looked on as a watershed event.
Echoing the battle cry of the Alamo, he now tells
people: "Remember Seattle."</P>

<P>Organizers hope people will also be saying,
"Remember Earth Day 2000" -- a happier,
let's-put-on-a-show kind of event. Hayes sees Earth
Day as a catalyst to encourage people to incorporate
what they've learned during the event in their daily
lives throughout the year. As a guy who rides his
bike to work and uses compact fluorescent bulbs at
home, Hayes practices what he preaches. He figures
changing the world starts with each of us. Him. You.</P>

<P>Asking what one thing a person could do to most help
lessen the amount of greenhouse gases sent into the
atmosphere, Hayes and actor DiCaprio were mulling
over a few of the thousands of ways people impact
the Earth. "The obvious answer is buy the right
car," said Hayes. Honda's new two-seat,
80-mile-per-gallon Insight, for instance, will sell
for less than $20,000. And for slightly more money,
there's the four-seat, 60-mile-per-gallon Toyota
Prius, which claims to cut gas consumption and
carbon-dioxide emissions by half, plus slice
pollutants by 90 percent.</P>

<P>DiCaprio already knew about hybrid cars, and by the
end of the conversation, he'd promised to buy one
within the year. DiCaprio made his intentions clear
in an online chat last November. "You fill it up at
any service station [and] it gets 60 miles per
gallon," he told Yahoo fans. That's a start. For
Hayes, that's one person down, millions more to go.</P>

<P><B>Organize Your Own Event!</B></P>

<P>It's not too late to organize your own Earth Day
event, says Earth Day Network spokesperson Michelle
Ackermann. Need ideas? Organize a tree-planting
project in your neighborhood. Arrange for a
native-plant display at your school. Present a slide
show on energy issues to groups in your area. The
Union of Concerned Scientists (617-547-5552) offers
two slides shows, complete with scripts. Or maybe
set up an Earth Day exhibit at your church or
library.</P>

<P>If water pollution is a dire issue in your
community, adopt a local river or stream to protect
it from pollution or development; for help, try the
Save Our Streams program at the Izaak Walton League
of America (800-284-4952). Better yet, organize a
water-quality monitoring project for a local
waterway. An easy-to-use water monitoring kit is
available from the Global Rivers Environmental
Education Network (734-761-814); order online at
<A HREF="http://www.earthforce.org/green">www.earthforce.org/green</A>.</P>

<P>Whatever your pressing issue, the national
clearinghouse for support and ideas is Seattle-based
Earth Day Network. Through the network, for
instance, 75,000 teachers have obtained free "Earth
Day Education Program" materials for kindergarten
through 12th grades. Visit the network online at

<P><B>Seven Things You Can Do</B></P>

<P>John Ryan calls them the Seven Sustainable Wonders
of the World. They're seven things that you -- and
six billion other people -- can use to get your
needed task done without overtaxing the planet, says
Ryan, research director for Northwest Environment
Watch in Seattle:</P>

<P>1. Bicycle. More than a quarter of car trips are
less than one mile. That's less that four laps
around a football field. So ride a bike. Bonus:
Great exercise.</P>

<P>2. Condom. More than half of U.S. pregnancies are
unintended, and a baby born here is equal to about
25 kids in the developing world considering all the
resources he or she will use over the course of a
lifetime. Bonus: Avoiding AIDS.</P>

<P>3. Ceiling fan. Air conditioners use one-sixth of
the nation's electricity, and electricity generation
emits 35 percent of the nation's climate-changing
carbon dioxide. But with a ceiling fan, you can set
the thermostat nine degrees higher -- you'll feel
just as cool. Bonus: Save about one-third off your
cooling bill.</P>

<P>4. Clothesline. A typical family of four devotes
five percent of the electricity bill to drying
clothes (six loads weekly). Bonus: Clothes last
longer when dried on a clothesline.</P>

<P>5. Pad Thai. Livestock outnumbers humans three to
one on the planet, and if everyone in the world ate
a meaty American diet -- 260 pounds of meat annually
-- farmers would need to grow nearly three times as
much grain as they do now. Where would that happen
in an era of shrinking farms? Pad Thai is mostly
rice and veggies, and, therefore, a sustainable
meal. Bonus: Less likelihood of heart disease,
stroke and diabetes.</P>

<P>6. Public library. The average American library
loans 100,000 books a year, saving nearly 50 tons of
paper and 250 tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Your
personal bonus: Saving money on books you'd
otherwise buy.</P>

<P>7. Ladybugs. Sales of polluting pesticides total
about $30 billion a year worldwide, but the pest
control services of natural enemies -- like ladybugs
-- is worth four times that. Bonus for going the
organic route: You'll encourage the return of
butterflies, bees and other critters that pollinate
90 percent of the world's flowers.</P>
