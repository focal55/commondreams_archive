THEIR NAMES are Chandrika, Hamida, Amod, Madhuri, Maria or Jenny. And as 
varied as these children's names are their nationalities: Indian, Bangladeshi, 
Nepalese, Nicaraguan or North American. What unites them is that they have 
been made to work as prostitutes and, in the process, have endangered their 
lives and well-being and seriously compromised their future.
<P>  It is estimated that 4 million women and girls worldwide are bought and 
sold each year -- either into marriage, prostitution or slavery. Approximately 
1 million children enter the sex trade every year. (Although most are girls; 
boys are also involved.)
</P>
<P>  As many as 50,000 women and children from Asia, Latin America and Eastern 
Europe are brought to the United States and forced to work as prostitutes or 
servants. In the United States during the past two years, the government has 
prosecuted cases involving fewer than 300 victims. In other countries where 
this problem is frequent, the prosecution rate is even lower.
</P>
<P>  According to UNICEF, 10,000 girls annually enter Thailand from neighboring 
countries and end up as sex workers. And between 5,000 and 7,000 Nepali girls 
are transported across the border to India each year and end up in commercial 
sex work in Mumbai, Bombay or New Delhi.
</P>
<P>  Although the greatest number of children working as prostitutes is in Asia, 
Eastern European children from Eastern European countries, such as Russia, 
Poland, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic, are increasingly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>  As a social pathological phenomenon, prostitution involving children does 
not show signs of abating. In many cases, organized groups kidnap children and 
sell them into prostitution, with border officials and police serving as 
accomplices.
</P>
<P>  In her 1997 report to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, the U.N. Special 
Rapporteur on Violence Against Women called attention to the levels of state 
participation and complicity in the trafficking of women and children across 
borders. Because of their often undocumented status, language deficiencies and 
lack of legal protection, kidnapped children are particularly vulnerable in 
the hands of smugglers or corrupt and heartless government officials.
</P>
<P>  Commercial sexual exploitation of children is increasing worldwide. There 
are several reasons. These include increased trade across borders, poverty, 
unemployment, low status of girls, lack of education (including sex education) 
of children and their parents, inadequate legislation, lack of or poor law 
enforcement and the eroticization of children by the media, a phenomenon 
increasingly seen in industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>  There are also special social and cultural reasons for children entering 
into the sex trade in different regions of the world. In many cases, children 
from industrialized countries enter the sex trade because they are fleeing 
abusive homes. In countries of Eastern and Southern Africa, children who 
became orphans as a result of AIDS frequently lack the protection of 
caregivers and are, therefore, more vulnerable to sexual abuse and 
exploitation. In South Asia, traditional practices that perpetuate the low 
status of women and girls in society are at the base of this problem. Children 
exploited sexually are prone to sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS. In 
addition, because of the conditions in which they live, children can become 
malnourished, and develop feelings of guilt, inadequacy and depression.
</P>
<P>  Besides the moral and ethical implications, the impact that sexual 
exploitation has on children's health and future development demands urgent 
attention.
</P>
<P>  Throughout the world, many individuals and nongovernmental organizations 
are working intensely for the protection of children's rights. Many times, 
their work puts them in conflict with governments and powerful interest groups.
</P>
<P>Among the U.N. agencies, UNICEF has been particularly active in calling 
attention to this phenomenon and in addressing the root causes of sexual 
exploitation by providing economic support to families so that their children 
will not be at risk of sexual exploitation, by improving access to education --
</P>
<P>particularly for girls -- and by becoming a strong advocate for the rights of 
the child.
</P>
<P>  The work of such nongovernmental organizations and U.N. agencies should be 
a complement to governments' actions to solve this problem. Those actions 
should include preventing sexual exploitation through social mobilization and 
awareness building, providing social services to exploited children and their 
families and creating the legal framework and resources for psychosocial 
counseling and for the appropriate prosecution of perpetrators.
</P>
<P>  Only when this phenomenon is eliminated, will we be able to say that the 
world's children are exercising their right to a healthy, and peaceful, life.
