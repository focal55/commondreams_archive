During the recent protests in Washington against the World Bank and

International Monetary Fund, the leading cable news network became

fascinated with "independent media." Journalism free of huge economic

interests -- what a concept!



	<p>"Modern-day demonstrators say you just can't trust folks like us, the

so-called corporate media," a CNN anchor explained, introducing a report

that aired repeatedly over a two-day period. Correspondent Brooks Jackson

took it from there. "They call themselves the independent media," he said,

and that means working without ties to the large corporations of the media

world.



	<p>"Global corporate media? Gee, that would be us," Jackson deadpanned, "CNN,

owned by Time Warner, soon to be merged with America Online. They don't

like us very much. They want to tell their story their way."



	<p>Naturally, CNN proceeded to tell their story CNN's way. The report allowed

the "independent journalists" just a few tightly snipped words in edgewise.

But at least one incisive remark made it through the network's editing

gauntlet: "We believe that objectivity is, in fact, a myth -- that everyone

has a bias, everyone has an agenda -- and that corporations like major news

corporations have a corporate bias."



	<p>Well, getting even a few seconds to make that point on CNN amounted to a

bit of a breakthrough, although the correspondent's narration was intent on

maintaining a bemused tone. Meanwhile, as usual, self-satire on CNN's part

appeared to be inadvertent.



	<p>Midway through the report, one of the independent journalists complained

that on television, "Usually the corporate folks get the last word." Sure

enough, a minute later CNN's Jackson got the last word, reading the end of

the script as he noted "some unintended irony -- a protest against

globalism covering itself on the World Wide Web."



	<p>It was the kind of quip that goes over big in network studios, a smirky

tag line with insight more apparent than real. In this case, the

correspondent provided an easy cliche -- obscuring the vast distinction

between international solidarity and corporate globalization.



	<p>Gathering in the nation's capital to take action on behalf of human

rights, economic justice, labor rights and environmental protection,

thousands of protesters understood from the outset that mainstream news was

unlikely to illuminate the key issues. Efforts by independent journalists

have made alternative coverage available at www.indymedia.org and other

websites.



	<p>These days, news stories about "independent media" often emphasize the use

of digital technology. But the most important successes are human rather

than technical. No matter how modern the streaming audio and video, it

wouldn't matter much if people across the country and around the planet

weren't eager to find out what anti-corporate demonstrators are doing and

why they're doing it.



	<p>Within the appreciable constraints of corporate journalism, the mass

media's coverage of the protests against the IMF and World Bank included

some valuable reporting. For instance, Time magazine's April 24 edition had

a short trenchant piece headlined "The IMF: Dr. Death?" Such content exists

in mainstream media today because -- for years and decades -- activists as

well as small (and yes, independent) media persisted in challenging the

power of corporate globalizers while large media outlets could hardly have

seemed to care less.



	<p>Yes, corporate sensibilities usually get the last word. But not always.

So, we conclude here with words from one of the great American journalists

and media critics of the last century, George Seldes. For several decades,

he struggled to boost journalistic independence as a crucial antidote to

the convergence of big money and media power.



	<p>"Only in democratic countries," he wrote in the 1930s, "is there the

beginning of a suspicion that the old axiom about the press being the

bulwark of liberty is something that affects the daily life of the people

-- that it is a living warning rather than an ancient wisecrack. A people

that wants to be free must arm itself with a free press."



	<p>If cable television had been around then, top news editors at CNN would

probably have considered Seldes to be an odd sort of fellow. He was an

independent journalist who believed in eternal vigilance as a prerequisite

for the free flow of information. "Never grow weary of protesting," he

advised. "In this sensitive business of dealing with the public which

depends on faith and good will, protest is a most effective weapon.

Therefore protest."
