So who will be in charge of the most powerful nation on Earth come
January? Neither George W. Bush nor Al Gore. The new center of power in
Washington will lie with the moderates in both parties--liberal-leaning
Republicans and conservative-leaning Democrats who together will be the
only ones capable of setting Washington's agenda. A president will occupy
the Oval Office, but he will be dependent on the approval of
congressional moderates for almost anything he'd like to accomplish.
<p>Forget George W.'s proposal to use much of the government's projected
budget surplus for a large tax cut. The congressional moderates will
whittle it down. Gore's proposals for an expensive new prescription-drug
scheme for retirees and for a new government-subsidized savings plan on
top of Social Security will be similarly downsized. In fact, you can
safely forget most of what the presidential candidates proposed during
their interminable campaigns. None of it matters any longer.
<p>In the end, the moderates probably will cut the budget surplus into
three approximately equal slices--one intended for a modest tax cut, the
second dedicated to small spending increases for prescription drugs and
health care and the third to pay down the nation's debt. This isn't the
result that Bush or Gore campaigned for, but it's a balance that most
Americans will be content with.
<p>Foreign policy will be guided by the same moderate coalition in
Congress. This means that the U.S. will continue to use its military
muscle with great reluctance but feel no qualms about using its economic
muscle unilaterally when the nation's economic interests are at stake.
The White House and Congress will continue to back free trade while
imposing duties on specific imports that undercut the prices of domestic
producers. The Treasury, carefully overseen by Congress, will continue to
tell the International Monetary Fund what to do. There will be scant
support for foreign aid or debt relief for poor nations.
<p>Meanwhile, economic policy will shift entirely to the Federal Reserve
Board. Years ago, the economy's speed was regulated by two levers--one
fiscal, run largely by the White House, and the other monetary, run by
the Federal Reserve. But fiscal policy all but vanished when the Clinton
administration resolved to reduce the nation's deficit. The government
that takes control next January won't even remember where the fiscal
lever can be found. Thus will Alan Greenspan, the Fed's powerful
chairman, be in complete charge of the nation's economy and, indirectly,
of the global economy.
<p>Power to resolve any particularly controversial public issue will
shift to the federal courts. The weakened political branches will be
neither willing nor able to deal with touchy questions involving privacy,
abortion, affirmative action or the rights of employees or people with
disabilities. Nor will Congress or the White House be capable of
determining the new contours of property rights in patents, copyrights
and trademarks--hot issues in a new economy in which ideas are often more
valuable than physical assets. It's worth noting, by the way, that any
new nominee to the bench will need to be acceptable to the congressional
moderates, who will block potential judges espousing extreme views about
the Constitution.
<p>Most important, no large-scale initiative will emanate from the White
House or Congress. No large vision will be advanced calling upon the
American people to alter the way they conduct their lives or understand
the world. The president will not be able to summon the public's resolve
for such things, and the congressional moderates will lack the authority
to do so.
<p>Hence, the looming financial problems of giant U.S. retirement
programs, Social Security and Medicare will remain unaddressed. Global
warming and related environmental hazards will receive scant attention.
The national disgraces of child poverty, homelessness and hunger will
endure. And inequalities of income and wealth--both inside the U.S. and
around the world--will likely grow wider.
<p>For good or ill, this is the government that most Americans now want.
Despite the petulance of this unusual election, there is no great
ideological divide. Whoever emerges as president will be part of a
government that reflects the values of the great majority of American
voters. In effect, they sought a third Clinton term, minus Bill Clinton,
and that's what they will get. The wonder of American democracy is how
well it works.
<p>But is this the government that the nation most needs? It is of course
possible that the economy will stay the course, that Greenspan will
successfully extend the current expansion for several years and that no
international crisis will intrude directly into the lives of most
Americans.
<p>Yet a steady state cannot be guaranteed. And if this most fortunate
era of relative prosperity and relative peace should come to an abrupt
end, the country may not be prepared to cope. Last week, this nation
chose the status quo. But it may come to discover that it does not really
have that option.
<p><i>Former Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich is a professor at Brandeis University. His next book, "The Future of Success" (Alfred A. Knopf), will be published in January.
