Roy Criner, a Texas logger, is serving a 99-year sentence for the brutal rape of a 16-year-old girl, despite strong evidence that he didn't do it. Two DNA tests - one of them ordered by the prosecutor who won the conviction in 1990 - prove that the semen taken from the victim's body wasn't Criner's.
<P>
 So when does Criner come home to his family? Well, I've just seen a rebroadcast of a gripping PBS "Frontline" program on the case, and my advice to the family is: Don't leave the light on.
<P>
 No one in authority seems interested in seeking Criner's release - or even in re-trying him - not because they have much reason to be certain the right man was convicted but because the trial was technically "fair." This notwithstanding the fact that he was convicted almost entirely on the inconsistent testimony of three men who said Criner told them he'd had sex with - not raped - a hitchhiker he'd picked up. Investigators merely assumed that (1) the account was true and (2) the sexual conquest was the 16-year-old victim. The only physical evidence was blood that might have come from Criner or from millions of other people.
<P>
 Two exchanges from the "Frontline" program, first broadcast in January, suggest the official attitude. The first is between "Frontline" producer Ofra Bikel and District Attorney Michael McDougal.
<P>
 BIKEL: "So now your lab has told you (the semen) is not his."
<P>
 McDOUGAL: "Right."
<P>
 BIKEL: "So what are you going to do about it?"
<P>
 McDOUGAL: "Nothing. It's not his."
<P>
 BIKEL: "But he's still in prison."
<P>
 McDOUGAL: "He's still in prison."
<P>
 BIKEL: "And he will stay there?"
<P>
 McDOUGAL: "And he will stay there.''
<P>
 BIKEL: "(The fact that the semen was not his) doesn't make any difference?"
<P>
McDOUGAL: "No, it doesn't make any difference. I'm not going to argue with you. I've told you, and I've explained to you what it is. It means the sperm found in her was not his. It doesn't mean he didn't rape her, doesn't mean he didn't kill her."
<P>
The second exchange is with Judge Sharon Keller of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, who wrote the majority opinion denying Criner's appeal of his conviction.
<P>
 KELLER: "The evidence didn't show that he did not have sex with this woman. It can't. ..."
<P>
 BIKEL: "Shouldn't the DNA test be considered important?"
<P>
 KELLER: "It could be important. If it had come back positive it would have been important because it would have meant that he - it would have been more evidence that he did what he said he did."
<P>
 BIKEL: "But the other way?"
<P>
 KELLER: "It just doesn't mean that he didn't have sex with her."
<P>
 What comes through with unmistakable clarity is the chilling reluctance of the authorities to admit they may have made a mistake. It would have been perfectly reasonable for the prosecution or the appeals court to say that the DNA evidence - unavailable at the time of Criner's conviction - had raised enough doubt to warrant a new trial. Instead they set about concocting theories that could explain the obvious contradictions.
<P>
 The victim was "promiscuous" and might have had consensual sex with someone else before she was raped and killed. (A local reporter, Bob Burtman, says the police reconstructed the activities of the victim's last two days and found no evidence of sex before the rape.) Criner might have used a condom, or maybe he didn't ejaculate.
<P>
 Civil rights lawyer Peter Neufeld dismissed these self-serving possibilities as "the case of the unindicted co-ejaculator."
<P>
 The point of looking at the details of the Criner case is not to cast Texas prosecutors as especially unethical (or Texas Gov. George W. Bush as especially unfeeling). The point is to express the fear that the behavior of the prosecutors may be too <i>typical. </i> Perhaps it's typical of human beings, including journalists, to defend publicly announced conclusions. It must be infinitely more difficult to acknowledge the possibility that official error may have led to the taking of an innocent life.
<P>
 In that regard, I suppose Criner is lucky. The capital murder case against him was abandoned for lack of evidence, so he wound up being convicted of aggravated sexual assault.
<P>
 He's only got 89 years to go.
