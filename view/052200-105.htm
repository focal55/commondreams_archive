In the midst of one of those periodic, and short-lived, revivals of
interest in history - in this case Roman - occasioned as they generally
are by a blockbuster movie, it's hard not to view the U.S. Senate's vote 
on the deployment of troops in Kosovo in the 
light of imperial Rome. Or, more accurately, in Rome rapidly heading
toward its imperium.
<P>
The full U.S. Senate voted on April 18 on an
amendment that would have obligated President Clinton to set a deadline on
the continued presence of U.S. military forces in Kosovo, contingent upon
the U.S.'s NATO allies assuming a larger share of the financial and troop
commitment there. A day earlier the House had voted 264-153 to add on a
similar, if somewhat diluted, measure to a pending bill appropriating $8.6
billion for military construction and $4.7 billion for imperial adventures
abroad; to wit, assault forces for our Colombian suzerainty and occupation
forces for Kosovo.
<P>
In an unexpected but perhaps long-simmering act of
challenge to our self-appointed Imperator, Senators Robert Byrd, a
Democrat, and John Warner, a Republican, proposed an amendment that would
have compelled the President to adhere to a protocol mandated by the
Constitution and the War Powers Act alike: To appear before Congress and
present his case for further deployment of U.S. soldiers "equipped for
combat" (War Powers Act), and to continue to "consult regularly with
Congress until U.S. Armed Forces are no longer" so deployed.
<P>
This provision had a retroactive component also, as Clinton had never bothered
to consult with Congress about the stationing of U.S. troops in Kosovo in
the first place, last June, treating his address to Congress on March 23,
1999 as all that was required to wage war, construct a massive - and no
doubt permament - stately martial dome to house 5,900 G.I.s with all the
amenities of home, including fast food restaurants and health clubs, and
to provide the opportunity to squire his daughter on a taxpayer-subsidized
tour of the provinces to be ogled at by homesick soldiers. 
<P>
But with
Senators Byrd and Warner suddenly playing the unlikely roles of Brutus and
Cassius in this modern drama, Clinton's grand schemes were, if not
seriously impeded, called into question. It was time for him, like Julius
Caesar twenty centuries earlier, to defy the Senate. Imperial pique is not
to be taken lightly, and the recalcitrant senators were to be laid siege
to in proper fashion.
<P>
The customary way to influence legislators' votes is to either employ the
services of sympathetic colleagues to prevail upon them or, failing that,
to summon key leaders to the White House for a little arm-twisting. That's
how these matters are dealt with traditionally in the American, that is to
say republican, system. But not so in this case. Instead, the Clinton
Administration unleashed its 'diplomatic' commando forces: Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, Secretary of
the Treasury (and former World Bank official) Lawrence Summers, and, as
its trump card, NATO General Secretary George Robertson.
<P>
Their statements, implied diktat and open threats, often read like the classical
crude, and intentionally mistranslated, bluster attributed to foreign
heads of state and their foreign ministers when our government is building
a case for bombing them. Albright accused the Senate (full of incendiary
firebrands as we know) of "playing with fire" in attempting to introduce
some semblance of discussion into matters military and geo-political. They
were leaving poor Kosovo, and by implication the entire Pax Americana, a
prey to "vultures," as our country's chief diplomat so delicately phrased
it. No stranger to matters vulturine, Albright has militarily supported
and personally befriended the likes of the KLA's Hashim Thaci, than whom
no greater vulture exists. But the latter and his cohorts are our
vultures, so the reference was not to them.
<P>
The cosmopolite Secretary, for whom, as Chicago journalist Steve Chapman wrote last year, foreign affairs is a quiz program and the answer is always "bombs," also delivered
herself of these choice pronouncements: "We are the richest nation in the
world. Now is the time to advance and not retreat." And, "We are leaders
and our fundamental objective in Eastern Europe is not to leave - it is to
win." All this in response to two senators simply asking the president to
please talk to them.
<P>
Not to be outdone in bellicose thunderings, Defense
Secretary Cohen, who can work himself into a lather of near-apoplectic
sanctimony with the best of them, advocated the president veto the
proposed bill - proposed on the initiative of Clinton himself - if it
contained the offensive concession to Congressional oversight. It's never
been the established rule to have defense secretaries advise Congress how
to vote and presidents when to veto, but, as mentioned earlier, the
imperial eagles - rather than, say, vultures -are now descending on the
American body politic.
<P>
Next to appear on the podium of remonstrance and admonition was the
sub-imperator himself, Al Gore. According to an Associated
Press/Washington Post release," In a show of how seriously the
administration took the vote, Vice President Al Gore made a rare
appearance in his capacity of president of the Senate to cast a
tie-breaking vote if necessary." It was not necessary - but barely.
<P>
The White House Budget Director, Jacob Lew, who, like Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers, is not generally acknowledged as a specialist in either
foreign affairs or constitutional law, denounced the Senate's alleged
adherence to "rigid, mechanical burden sharing tests." The truth of the
Clinton administration's concern about this revolt of the patrician
obstructionists was more closely revealed, though, by an unnamed White
House source that warned that this timid attempt to assert some modicum of
Congressional input "could damage the strength and durability of the NATO
alliance." That is, a largely procedural quest by Byrd and Warner to have
the president pay a symbolic obeisance to the elected representatives of
the people posed a potential threat to a higher law and a more formidable
power: NATO.
<P>
To make sure the point was not lost on any legislators
over-fond of legal niceties or too protective of their own prerogatives,
the adminstration solicited the intervention of NATO's Secretary General
George Robertson. If the president wouldn't condescend to sway senators'
votes, Robertson had no such scruples. In private letters to Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, Minority Leader Tom Daschle and several key
committee heads, Robertson tried the NATO equivalent of the emotional
approach. "The prospect of any NATO ally deciding not to take part in a
NATO operation causes me deep concern." That message seems clear enough:
When a nation joins, or extends membership in, the newly reconfigured
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it cedes its rights - and its people's
rights - to any independent policy or course of action. And though a
formal precondition for NATO membership is fidelity to democratic
principles, as defined by the NATO leaders themselves, in practice a
member's constitution, parliament and popular opinion are overridden and
effectively rendered nugatory. A particularly disturbing example of this
dynamic was the House's 213-213 vote on April 28th of last year denying
Clinton formal authorization for his attacks against Yugoslavia. In any
well-functioning democracy this unprecedented action would have at least
forced a serious re-thinking of, and probable pause in, the ongoing
bombing campaign. However, only a couple hours after the vote National
Security Council Spokesman David Leavy was on the TV evening news
announcing, with almost spiteful bravado, that the attacks would be
intensified.
<P>
The above demonstrates two important matters. First, the
executive branch of NATO nations will brook no meddling with its imperial
polity, which is decided upon by supra-national planning bodies and
implemented by economic and military treaty alliances. The U.S. Congress,
and parliaments in the other NATO countries, are relegated to the role of
rubberstamp bodies, much as with appointed parliaments under military
juntas and constitutional monarchies. Their role is strictly to provide
popular legitimacy to actions already decided upon by unelected,
unaccountable, and frequently anonymous organizations in Brussels and
elsewhere, and to allocate funds for the same in such a manner as to
placate the major domestic power groupings. (And, of course, to act as a
forum to groom and showcase prospective new executives.)
<P>
The second lesson to be learned from the Senate vote on Kosovo, a more encouraging
one, is that the recognition of the first is dawning on the legislators
themselves. Listen to this, from the main sponsor of the House's
comparable amendment, John Kasich (R-Ohio):"[Passage] sends a strong
message that NATO is not a one-way street. And that's a message that will
have an impact beyond our presence in the Balkans." And this, from Robert
Byrd of the Senate: "The administration would much prefer Congress to
keep quiet, to roll over and play dead, while the administration continues
to do whatever it wants to do in Kosovo." This is not a belated
recognition by Byrd and the forty-six of his colleagues who also voted
against the Clinton administration that the latter's Kosovo policy was
wrong from the start - if it was, it would also be a self-indictment in
most instances - but that their own positions are being undermined by
subservience to an imperial presidency run amok and the subordination of
national interests to that of an aggressive military bloc.
<P>
It's this moment, when the self-interest of senators and congressmen happens to
coincide with that of the citizenry - for peace, for democratic control of
the nation's agenda - that the slide toward imperial war abroad and
disenfranchisement at home can be halted and reversed. Again, with all the
heavy artillery - the metaphor is intentional - arrayed against it, the
Senate vote to support the amendment only lost by six votes. If three
members had been prevailed upon to change their votes the result would
have been a tie, thereby placing presidential candidate Al Gore in a tight
spot and the entire Kosovo debacle in the spotlight.
<P>
If one additional mind had been changed the vote would have failed and
attention been brought to all the buried reservations, unspoken suspicions
and inchoate opposition related to the war against Yugoslavia. Had a more
concerted and focused effort been made by all opponents of the
government's Kosovo policy - and by anyone invested in preserving
democratic control over federal actions abroad - this vote could have been
defeated. What also would have been defeated is Caesar's assault against a
defiant senate and the crossing of a river that friends of peace and
democracy can never permit to be crossed. It's not too late, though. The
emperor and his legionaries are doubtlessly gloating over their perceived
victory. But the victor's  laurel crown can be snatched away as quickly as
it was conferred. The responsibility to stop this usurpation and descent
into global militarism lies, as always, in ourselves.
<P>
The contact with and pressure on senators and congresspersons has just begun. We've got
their phone numbers, e-mail addresses, aides' names and a score card on
all of them. To update the references, we've lost a close inning, but the
game's just begun.
