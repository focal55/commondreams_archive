<p>NO American should work 40 hours a week and still be mired in poverty, especially in a nation where, last year, more than 400 new millionaires were minted each day.<BR>
<BR>
  But thousands of American workers earn so little that they depend on food stamps, Medicaid and other government subsidies to get by. In some cases, the cost of going to work -- transportation, child care and clothing, for example -- outstrips their meager earnings. Unless they can earn a decent wage, some workers will end up on welfare because they simply can't afford to work.<BR>
<BR>
  The St. Louis Board of Aldermen could change that. Before the board today is a bill that would require businesses that receive $100,000 or more a year from the city in contracts or tax breaks to pay their employees a &quot;living wage.&quot; The bill, primarily aimed at service employees, would require businesses that provide their workers with medical insurance to pay a minimum of $8.67 an hour. Companies that don't provide medical coverage would be required to pay $9.92 an hour, a dollar and a quarter more, so their employees can buy their own health insurance.<BR>
<BR>
  The bill, estimated to affect about 1,000 workers, makes good sense. Every year, the city gives millions of dollars in tax breaks to companies that bring jobs to St. Louis. The city has a moral and a fiscal obligation to its citizens to make sure that the jobs created here lift people out of poverty, that they allow workers to adequately clothe and feed their families. Twenty-eight cities and counties across the country, including Denver, Chicago, New York City and Los Angeles, have already passed living wage laws with no adverse impact on city contracts or local businesses.<BR>
<BR>
  Twenty-six labor, community and religious groups, including ACORN, the Reform Organization of Welfare and the Service Employees International Union, have voiced their support for the bill. So have 12 aldermen, Board of Aldermen President Francis Slay, Mayor Clarence Harmon and city Comptroller Darlene Green. The mayor has already instituted a living wage policy for city employees. (Last September, the mayor ordered that all city employees be paid a minimum of $8 an hour, which resulted in 29-cent to 56-cent pay raises for 48 custodians, a messenger and a clerical aide.)<BR>
<BR>
  Mr. Harmon says he'll sign whatever living wage package the aldermen pass. Unfortunately, some aldermen are already trying to water down the bill. Some want to exempt certain companies from the living wage provision by raising the minimum amount a company gets in tax breaks or contracts to as much as $1 million. Others say they'll only commit to a living wage bill if St. Louis County does first.<BR>
<BR>
  The city shouldn't wait for the county to act. St. Louis County, where businesses normally pay higher minimum salaries than those in the city, isn't even considering a living wage ordinance. The mayor should let the aldermen know that he wants a living wage ordinance that includes the largest number of poorly paid workers possible instead one that excludes them. Paying people a decent wage is good for businesses, good for families and good for the community.
