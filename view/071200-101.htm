Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestinian Authority, are meeting at a Camp David summit intended to set the framework for a peace agreement. All sides are pessimistic about the ability of reaching success, with Barak giving it a 50-50 chance, Clinton forecasting ``no guarantee of success,'' and Abu Ala, the senior Palestinian negotiator, doubting the meeting will achieve any of its aims.
<P>

 The impasse over the future of Palestinian refugees is one of the major stumbling blocks. For 52 years, the refugees have been living in exile, clinging to the hope of returning to their villages. But now, the Palestinian refugees fear -- and rightly so -- that on Sept. 13, the date on which Israel and the Arafat-led Palestinian Authority hope to conclude final status agreements, Arafat will cede to Israel's hard line and sign a document that denies them the right of return. The Palestinian Authority is going door-to-door in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and neighboring Arab states polling refugees on whether they insist on returning to their home villages or if they would accept compensation for resettlement. Not surprisingly, reports indicate the vast majority of refugees will demand the right of return.
<P>

    More than 400 Palestinian villages were occupied and depopulated by Israel in 1948, and the Palestinians have not forgotten. Usually a man lives in a certain place in the world, but for the Palestinian, the place lives in the man. The Palestinian refugees of the 1948 and 1967 wars and their descendants, who now number between 3 million and 4 million, are asking the international community to bring their scattered people together and return them to Palestine, just as many Holocaust survivors asked earlier.
<P>

    As a Jew who is concerned for the future of Israelis and Palestinians alike, I know that many American Jews, as well as the Israeli and U.S. governments, have problems with Palestinian refugees recalling their history and demanding repatriation and restitution. It challenges the comforting myths: that prior to Israel's creation, Palestine was a land without people; that Israel, despite the evidence, was not responsible for the 1948 flight of the Palestinians; that most Palestinians are terrorists.
<P>

   By confronting these myths, we Americans might feel obligated to confront our complicity in the creation of the myths and in the rejection of internationally recognized law that calls for return. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and return to his own country. U.N. Resolution 194 declares: The refugees of Palestine wishing to return to their homes and live in peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return.
<P>

   For more than 50 years, Israel has refused to implement Resolution 194 and many similar resolutions. Israel's objection is that accepting the Palestinian right of return would alter the Jewish character of the Israeli state. It is not merely the land or the money. Israel has been able to squeeze in millions of Jewish immigrants from other countries and supply them with temporary housing, education and subsidies while they became absorbed into the country. In May, Barak welcomed the millionth immigrant to arrive from the former Soviet Union since its breakup less than a decade ago.
<P>

   We Americans, especially American Jews, are neglecting the Palestinian refugees because we are not sure. Some of us are not sure we want to risk altering the Jewish character of the state. Others are not sure how to explain to our friends and families that supporting the rights of Palestinians does not mean we are insensitive to Israel's need for security and does not mean we are against the Jews. 
<P>

   It is time to reflect on our complicity and do the right thing. One year ago, 1,100 clergy and lay religious leaders signed a human-rights petition that called for supporting the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland or receive compensation, as called for by U.N. resolutions. The petition calls on President Clinton to publicly urge Israel and the Palestinian Authority to abide by international law and human-rights conventions and to link U.S. financial aid to Israel and the Palestinian Authority to their compliance with human-rights covenants. Shouldn't we ask the same?
