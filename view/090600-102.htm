Reason  sometimes prevails in this crazy world. And so it has -- at least for the moment -- on one of the strangest issues of all, the quest for a national missile defense. President Clinton has declined to authorize deployment, leaving the matter to his successor.
<P>

   This Son of Star Wars, the current version of the long-cherished dream of defending ourselves from missiles, has already cost us a mint. It has failed most of its tests. It has unsettled our allies. It bids fair to set the nuclear arms race spinning off on a whole new round. Yet, against all these odds, it has been virtually unstoppable.
<P>

   Now, at long last, logic seems to have intruded where it has not been welcomed for years.
<P>

   The robust political health enjoyed by NMD, as the insiders call it, may itself seem illogical, in view of its many downsides. But in fact it's easy to explain. Politicians generally enjoy talking about defending the homeland -- leaving aside the bothersome question of no one's knowing how to defend it in this manner. As for the treasure expended with little to show (over $120 billion since the idea was conceived 40 years ago), that's hardly a negative: The failed effort is quite successful for congressional districts where the defense contractors operate.
<P>

   Star Wars enjoyed its original surge in popularity under Ronald Reagan, who may really have believed we could shoot down incoming missiles and make ourselves invulnerable. But, gradually, reality pierced the dream, and President George Bush allowed NMD to float into the background. Bill Clinton had almost extinguished it when politics -- looking weak on defense was something he could ill afford toward the end of his first term -- inspired him to defy dull fact and breathe new life into the illusion.
<P>

   But what Clinton resurrected was an enfeebled, albeit still exorbitant, version -- vulnerable to criticism from every angle. It's too much for opponents of missile defense, way too little for proponents. Yet it's just right to shake the foundations of the international security system, which relies on the Russians and the Americans remaining vulnerable to each other's nuclear weapons.
<P>

   This security arrangement is anchored by the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which codifies the notion that our mutual security depends on neither side pursuing a national missile defense. So of course this means that with every step -- however faltering -- NMD bumbles at the edge of violating the treaty. Thus we have been half-observing the treaty while half-pursuing this lemon of a defense, offending virtually everyone involved, and making a hash of it all -- a very expensive and destabilizing hash.
<P>

   Now Clinton, despite enormous pressure from missile-defense proponents to step up the schedule, has instead acknowledged the technological uncertainties and diplomatic difficulties, and declined to authorize deployment.
<P>

   This is far from the end for NMD. Clinton's announcement stresses its good prospects and assures us that development and testing will go on. Rather, the dream's future rests with one of the two men seeking the presidency. And both George W. Bush and Al Gore say they'll continue the pursuit of NMD, each in his own way.
<P>

   But there's room to hope that some welcome change could come from either man.
<P>

   Bush scolds Clinton for insufficient bullishness on missile defense and vows that he, by contrast, will pursue the dickens out of it. Yet Bush also has made clear he envisions something very different from merely hobbling along in an outdated version of the old security system. Bush pledges dramatic reductions in nuclear arms, and says he'd proceed unilaterally if need be. This liberating step might well move us all toward a more promising new world order.
<P>

   Gore, for his part, pledges a measured pursuit of missile defense. This raises the dreary prospect that he may maintain the same halfway-toward-everything hobble that is now so unsatisfactory. But, politics willing and the technology continuing to fail, it's also possible that Gore, applying his substantial knowledge in national security issues, might lead us away from our damaging delusion and at last put an end to NMD.
<P>

   The fact is, missile defense is not going to be a decision-maker for the voters. The people who are passionate about it -- the ones who love it for making hay and the ones who hate it for raising Cain -- must simply wait to see what happens when one of the candidates takes over.
<P>

   In the meantime, it's enough to savor this rare moment when sweet reason has prevailed.
