If George W. Bush becomes our next president, as
appears likely, it will prove once again that any product can
be marketed. I learned this a couple of years ago when I
found some potato chips in the local convenience store that
were made with olestra. Olestra is a petroleum product-- that
should have killed it right there. I mean, who wants to eat oil,
the kind that comes out of an oil well in Saudi Arabia? It
can't be digested. But the makers of this product were
required to put a warning on the package: "This product
contains olestra, which may cause anal leakage." Right there
on the package! If they could sell this to millions of people,
then-- with a few hundred million dollars for advertising--
George W. Bush was a piece of cake. For all his flaws, Mr.
W. hasn't caused any anal leakage, at least as far as I know.

         <p>Of course this election was Al Gore's to lose, and he
blew it. Sitting on top of the nation's longest running
economic expansion, unemployment at a thirty-year low,
running against someone is not sure whether Social Security
is a federal program-- the pundits surely have reason to shake
their heads and sigh. Who was it that told Al Gore he couldn't
campaign on the strength of the economy, because it was
more important to distance himself from anything having to
do with Bill Clinton? And they pay these people for their
advice.

         <p>Of course, the gains from this remarkable economic
growth have yet to trickle down. Even during the current
expansion, the typical wage has hardly grown at all-- about
0.3 percent a year since 1993.

         <p>Tactical goofs aside, that is the heart of the
Democrats' long-term problem: they have abandoned their
base, and replaced it with a wad of corporate cash with which
to purchase campaign commercials. Al Gore offered very
little to the majority of voters, who have literally not shared
in the gains from economic growth. Paying off the national
debt over the next 12 years-- a policy that until recently was
advocated only by politicians of the extreme right-- isn't
going to do much of anything for anyone.

         <p>So most of these voters stayed home, as they have
been doing since President Clinton pushed NAFTA through
Congress in 1993-- thereby giving us a Republican Congress.
The WTO and its expansion this year to include China gave
labor and its allies more reason not to vote.

         <p>There are some bright spots on the electoral screen. If
George W. Bush wins the electoral vote but Gore takes the
popular vote, we may finally get rid of the electoral college--
an institution whose main reason for existence is its
originators' fear of letting the people choose the President.

         <p>Many people fear that gridlock will result from a
Congress that is closely divided-- as well as a President who
lost the popular vote. But gridlock is not so bad, if we look at
the reality of American politics today. As might be expected
after a $3 billion election extravaganza financed mainly by
corporations and rich people, the leadership of both parties
has no positive agenda.

         <p>And they have a lot of harmful changes they want to
make: on the Republican side, privatizing Social Security and
cutting taxes for the richest people in the country. In the bi-
partisan column, increased military spending, more trade and
commercial agreements that will hurt labor and the
environment, and billions to support war and atrocities in
places like Colombia. Partisan fighting and gridlock would
be welcome in these and other areas, and if the Democrats
want to play a constructive role in Congress, they should be
prepared to filibuster in the Senate.

         <p>The best news is that 2.7 million people voted for
Ralph Nader, proving that democracy still exists in America,
even if only in embryonic form. Most of Nader's support
peeled off to Gore at the last minute, as people saw the
election was going to be close. Still, it is encouraging to see
that millions of people were able to vote for universal health
insurance, responsible trade and foreign policy, an end to the
brutal and destructive incarceration explosion in America,
and all the urgent changes that the overwhelming majority of
Americans want but never get to vote for on election day.

         <p>If the media had given Nader coverage anywhere near
proportionate to his standing in the polls, there's no telling
how many votes he would have gotten. Nonetheless his
showing, which may have made the difference in the
presidential election, may force the Democrats to pay more
attention to their base. And it will give a boost to the Green
Party, which will field increasing numbers of local and
statewide candidates in the next few years.

         <p>If we're lucky, the United States could become a
multi-party democracy.
