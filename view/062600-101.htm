Somebody is getting snookered.

<p> The House has overwhelmingly 
passed a proposal to repeal the federal 
estate tax, and now the Senate will 
most likely follow its lead. This is very 
good news for the very rich.

<p> Ronald Reagan couldn't get rid of 
the estate tax. George Bush couldn't 
kill it. But an unlikely alliance of Congressional Republicans, conservative 
Democrats and a small but significant 
number of very liberal Democrats, 
including members of the Black Caucus in the House, is building a potentially veto-proof majority for this 
breathtaking windfall for the wealthy.

<p> What is going on?

<p> After the bill passed the House by a 
vote of 279 to 136, The Times, in an 
editorial, said, "Seldom have so many 
voted for a gargantuan tax cut for so 
few."

<p> Estate taxes are overwhelmingly 
paid by the wealthiest families in the 
country.  Very, very few Americans 
pay any estate taxes at all. But if those 
few could manage to get the tax lifted, 
they would reap a bonanza. So a disinformation campaign, designed to 
frighten middle- and working-class 
Americans into believing their assets 
will be devoured by the tax man rather than passed on to their survivors, 
has been used to build support for the 
repeal of the estate tax in its entirety.

<p> In 98 percent of American deaths, 
there is no estate tax liability. An 
estate of any size can be bequeathed to 
a spouse free of any estate tax. For 
other bequests, a married couple is 
currently entitled to a $1.35 million 
exemption from the tax ($675,000 
each), and that exemption will 
increase to $2 million by 2006.

<p> As the Center on Budget and Policy 
Priorities reported last week:

<p> "The vast bulk of estate taxes are 
paid on very large estates. In 1997, 
some 2,400 estates -- the largest five 
percent of estates that were of  sufficient size to be taxable -- paid nearly 
half of all estate taxes. These were 
estates with assets exceeding $5 million."

<p> If the estate tax had been repealed, 
the tax-cut windfall for those 2,400 
estates would have averaged more 
than $3.4 million.

<p> The argument for repealing the estate tax carefully avoided the fact 
that it would be an enormous boon for 
people who were inheriting many millions of dollars. Instead the estate tax 
was repeatedly characterized as a 
threat to  small family-owned businesses and farms. According to this 
argument, it is necessary to repeal 
the tax to ensure that these small 
enterprises do not have to be liquidated to satisfy the demands of the tax.

<p> The argument was wildly misleading. Only a tiny percentage of taxable 
estates had any substantial small-business or farm assets.

<p> Nydia Velazquez, a Democratic 
congresswoman from Brooklyn who 
voted to repeal the tax, wrote in an 
 Op-Ed piece in The Times that "the 
reality for  family-owned small businesses is that one-third will be forced 
to sell or partially liquidate themselves to pay estate taxes on the owner's death."

<p> She was wrong. Nothing remotely 
close to one-third of such businesses 
are even subject to estate taxes. So 
the idea of families being forced to 
liquidate them to satisfy the taxes is 
absurd.

<p> Special tax breaks already exist for 
small family-owned businesses and 
farms, and additional tax relief can be 
crafted for those enterprises that remain vulnerable. But the idea that 
you have to get rid of the entire tax to 
protect a very small number of businesses that account for only a tiny 
portion of the tax makes no sense.

<p> The measure approved by the 
House would lead to an estimated 
revue loss of $104 billion from 2001 
through 2010. The Center on Budget 
estimates that revenue losses in the 
10 years after that will be half a 
trillion dollars.

<p> Repeal of the estate tax will face a 
presidential veto. But one of the ironies of this peculiar fight is that the 
votes needed to reach the two-thirds 
majority to override could come from 
some of the president's strongest allies.

<p> Some black and Hispanic leaders 
have bought into the argument that 
the estate tax is a burden on ethnic 
minorities. Harry Alford, president of 
the National Black Chamber of Commerce, said repeal of the tax is essential "to protect our offspring from 
being taxed after our transition to 
heaven."
