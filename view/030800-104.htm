<p>The curious thing about water is that, although it is the most basic of elements upon which all life depends, we seem to understand so little about it. That there is a developing water crisis, most people agree, but even when responsible bodies convene specialised international conferences on the subject, they are inclined to talk of such things as "water for Nature", as if it were just another demand competing for the precious resource like agriculture, hydropower and human settlements.
Can it be that water specialists themselves do not recognise that water is part of Nature - the essential ingredient of life on earth? Do they really believe it is just a commodity that can be managed by engineers and other experts?
<P>The truth is that the world's growing difficulties over the supply of fresh water cannot be tackled without a thorough understanding of the complete water cycle. They have to be seen in the context of the worrying falls in water tables throughout much of the world, and of the catastrophic droughts plaguing some regions while others suffer equally catastrophic flooding.</p>
<P>What prompts these thoughts is the forthcoming Global Water Forum at The Hague from 17-22 March, which will bring together thousands of experts, politicians and representatives of non-governmental organisations with the expressed aim of addressing the global freshwater crisis. My fear is that, without serious analysis of the fundamental causes of the problem, this worthy conference will be reduced to considering the sort of unsustainable technological solutions we have seen in the past.</P>
<P>How long are we to go on ignoring the simple fact that the main cause of the crisis is degradation of the natural environment, and particularly the water cycle?</P>

<P>All over the world, water-storing ponds, lakes and wetlands have been "reclaimed", depleting water sources and vastly increasing the risk of flooding. At the same time, deforestation and the diversion of rivers have severely restricted the natural capacity of the landscape to retain rainfall and refill underground water supplies.</P>
<P>So much seems obvious to me. But there is more. We affect the water cycle by discharging pollutants both directly into aquatic ecosystems and on the land, from where they leach into waterways. And we have released sufficient quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to change the climate of the entire planet, seriously threatening wetlands and altering weather patterns so that more floods and droughts can be expected in the future.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of the world's six billion people have no access to safe drinking water, while almost half lack adequate sanitation. In terms of the human suffering this causes, this is appalling, but the full implications are much wider: it is no exaggeration to say that the degradation of water resources is the main barrier preventing the world from achieving shared goals of good public health, security of food supplies and a better standard of living.</P>
<P>I believe that the only way to solve the water crisis is for us to stop assuming that we are competing with Nature and to welcome natural systems as our ally.</P>
<P>For example, in India - where water tables have been falling rapidly - we can see how the restoration of ecosystems and watersheds goes hand in hand with efficient "harvesting" of rainwater. Underground water sources are refilled and can therefore continue to meet the basic needs of very many people. In Argentina, studies have shown that the energy needs that will accompany expected economic growth can be served without recourse to large dams or nuclear power. Indeed, concentration on energy efficiency and renewable sources does not only make economic sense but also represents perhaps our best hope of tackling the causes of climate change.</P>
<P>Conserving and restoring natural processes does pay off. The US government has embarked on a programme to restore the ecosystems of the Everglades and South Florida in order to ensure water supplies for growing populations in Miami and other cities. It is a pity the degradation has reached such a stage that taxpayers are obliged to meet a bill of US$8 billion.
In ancient times, water resources were recognized and respected in both practical and spiritual terms. It is time that we in the modern world remembered the lessons of our forebears and changed our behaviour to take account of the natural processes upon which we ultimately depend.</P>
<P>So my message to the political leaders and specialists meeting in The Hague in March is to approach their deliberations in a spirit of humility. Instead of trying to invent more triumphs of engineering in vain efforts to protect us from the damage we have wrought, they should begin by developing programmes to protect the actual source of the water we so desperately need - the water cycle and the ecosystems that support it.</P>
<P>As the increasingly violent weather and dreadful floods of recent years have shown, we attempt compete with Nature at our peril.</P>
