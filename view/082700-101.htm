If you are like millions of Americans who vacationed this  summer, you paid top dollar for airline tickets, had little choice of airline,  and were rewarded by long delays.  But then, when you landed, you became a sovereign consumer  again. You had your choice of car rental companies, hotels, and restaurants. You could shop around for the best prices, carefully  measuring price against quality, and exercise real buying power.
<P>
<P>Indeed, at the very same airport where one or two airlines  monopolize routes and disrespect passengers, 10 or 15 auto rental  companies, often side by side, compete vigorously and courteously for  your business. How it is that car rental companies give you plenty of  choice and high quality service, but not airlines?
<P>
<P>The answer is that airlines are not a naturally competitive  industry. They require very expensive capital equipment that needs to fly  mostly full to be cost effective. Big airlines have the market power to crush little ones. And airlines depend on public facilities, namely airports. All of which is why they used to be regulated.
<P>
<P>More than 20 years ago, however, the fathers of airline deregulation thought that airlines could be just like car rental companies  or restaurants. Stop regulating fares and routes, get the government out  of the way, and new, cut-rate carriers would offer better service or lower  fares.
<P>
<P>But it hasn't worked out that way. Without government policing the skies, big airlines either bought out or drove out most upstarts. The few surviving cut-rate airlines with good safety records, such  as Southwest, have toeholds in some big airports (thanks to antitrust regulation); but they are mostly limited to fringe air fields.
<P>
<P>Absent more public regulation and public investment, airlines  are increasingly crowded, surly, incompetent and overpriced. What  choice do we have? We can always walk.
<P>
<P>This summer has also brought a test of deregulation of electric  power. Again, deregulation failed.    In California, the vanguard of electricity deregulation,   consumers are facing bills double and triple those of the regulated era.  As in the case of airlines, the idea was that electricity is just another  commodity. Get government out of the way and the free market will figure  out just the right price and the right generating capacity.    But whoever thought up that idea is a dim bulb.
<P>
<P>There is a very long lead time in the construction of power  plants. The free market can't easily predict weather conditions or peak  demands; it can't suddenly add new capacity. Electricity is, of course, a necessity. If scarcity suddenly  materializes because private entrepreneurs cut construction costs, they  still win  by raising prices. Consumers can only conserve so much; they  simply have to pay whatever the electric company charges. (Price competition is not meaningful in a deregulated system because different  power companies increasingly all buy in the same wholesale power market and charge essentially the same prices.)
<P>
<P>Ironically, the one part of California that still has plenty of  power at reasonable prices is Los Angeles, which has its own system  and never bought into deregulation. L.A.'s system, not coincidentally, is headed by David Freeman, who was once the chief of the granddaddy of  all public power systems, the TVA.
<P>
<P>Under the bad old regulated system, electric prices were set by  public utility commissions. A power grid was maintained, with plenty of  generating capacity to spare.  Regulators made mistakes, but nothing like  the calamity that Californians face this summer. For three quarters of a century, as technology improved, regulated electric rates came steadily  down.
<P>
<P>What one more example? How about banking. Under the old  regulated system, banks almost never failed, they didn't buy and sell each other, and customer service reps actually had time for their  customers. And there was more choice of local competing banks.
<P>
<P>Granted, a lot of the economy works fine with little regulation. Other than making sure that cars pass safety standards, government can stay out of the auto rental business. Other than inspecting kitchens for cleanliness, government doesn't need to second guess what restaurants serve or how much they charge. The same goes for most of retailing and manufacturing.  But big industries where market power is concentrated, and the product is a public necessity, and consumers lack the effective means  to shop around, are just different.
<P>
<P>Deregulating them doesn't help the  consumer. It just helps the consumer to get gouged.  The geniuses who brought us deregulation of these industries  should be sentenced to a purgatory of endless waits at  a one-airline airport. During a power brownout in a heat wave. On hold to their banker.
