IT IS NOT some Pollyanna tendency that compels me to sift through the 
wreckage of the political plane crash that just occurred and try to find a few 
positive, usable shards.
<P>  I do this strictly as an exercise in survival.
</P>
<P>  Like the majority of people who voted in the presidential election, I chose 
Al Gore. But, like the vice president himself and the 50 million-plus other 
folks who pulled, punched and penciled for Gore, I got screwed. And there's 
not a thing any of us can do to reverse that.
</P>
<P>  (Hold it, hold it, you rarin'-to-be-rowdy Republicans. Heed the words of 
Jim Nicholson, your own national party chairman. Earlier this week, he told 
Ted Koppel on "Nightline": "No one should gloat.")
</P>
<P>  When a human being gets screwed and can't change it, just about every 
immediate instinct is to lash out and do some serious damage -- preferably to 
the people who did the dirty deed. Fortunately, it isn't possible to track 
down all the deserving bad guys and gals in this national debacle, let alone 
personally smash every one of them square in the middle of their smug, pasty 
face.
</P>
<P>  I say "fortunately" because who wants to spend the rest of her or his life 
in prison for punching out the likes of Katherine Harris or Jim Baker?
</P>
<P>  Thwarted from immediate gratification, the next set of human instincts is 
to plot some kind of future revenge, something less primitive than nose-
pounding but ultimately hurtful -- or at least annoying. Again, the sheer 
number of perps in this situation makes even delayed relief essentially 
impossible. Besides, is life really long enough to spend years of it standing 
outside Antonin Scalia's house screaming, "Shame! Shame! Shame!"?
</P>
<P>  So then what? You've got 50 million of us, all dressed up in rage with no 
place to go. Not in the market for an ulcer, a stroke or some stress-induced 
immune disorder, I choose to short-circuit the anger, take some deep breaths 
and start searching for those aforementioned shards.
</P>
<P>  So far, I've found a couple:
</P>
<P>  Maybe the most positive, potentially great one directly involves Al Gore. 
In a way that almost no white man of privilege ever experiences in this 
country, Gore now knows what it looks, feels and smells like to get utterly 
and irrevocably screwed.
</P>
<P>  Like Ebeneezer Scrooge in "A Christmas Carol," and Mortimer and Oliver in 
"Trading Places," the vice president has been given a tremendous opportunity 
by the fates to see way beyond the range of his own low-powered telescope.
</P>
<P>  In his I'll-fight-for-you convention speech, and in the last weeks of his 
campaign, he spoke often and passionately (for him, anyway) about the poor, 
the disenfranchised, the marginalized and minorities. Now he knows, firsthand, 
a tad about what these millions of Americans are really up against. Every day 
they run smack into the patently unfair. The unmerciful abuse of power is the 
only kind of power they ever see. The one deck they're allowed to play with is 
unmistakably stacked.
</P>
<P>  If Gore acts constructively on this revelation, as Scrooge did, he cannot 
help but become a true champion for the genuinely dissed of society. If he 
follows the greedy, selfish route of Mortimer and Oliver, he and the people he 
purports to care about will be bigger losers than he could ever imagine.
</P>
<P>  The second useful piece of wreckage has to do with the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Despite its overtly partisan (and clumsy) 5-to-4 ruling, it still represents 
what it was designed to represent: the ultimate authority of law. But any 
pretense of the court being an ultimate moral authority -- or even an oracle 
of wisdom -- is kaput.
</P>
<P>  There is no such human entity and never has been. Not here or in any nation.
</P>
<P>The sooner we all accept that reality, the closer we'll be to behaving like 
adults and working to fashion the only code of morality and wisdom that is of 
use: our very own.
