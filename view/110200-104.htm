The New Democrats may have outsmarted themselves.

<p>A couple of months ago, the current Democratic Party leadership 
seemed to be firmly in control. The succession was orderly. The party's new 
ticket of "moderates" -- Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman -- gained momentum. 
If all went according to plan, President Lieberman would be wrapping up his 
second term in 2016.

<p>The longstanding game plan kept boosting people who fervently 
embraced "the center." Why defend low-income mothers when you can brag 
about dumping them off the welfare rolls? Why make trouble for Wall Street 
when you can curry favor and rake in larger contributions? Why put a brake 
on the drug war when you can keep building prisons and filling them with 
more dark-skinned poor people?

<p>Applauded by countless reporters and pundits, the New Democrats 
grabbed hold of the national party apparatus in 1992 and never let go. 
Journalists concluded that all the major policy issues within the 
Democratic Party had been settled. The mood was similar among most of the 
Democrats on Capitol Hill as they kowtowed to the party's hierarchy.

<p>But in early November, there was outrage in elite circles. Leading 
Democrats and their fans in the media were appalled. In private, top party 
officials cursed the day Ralph Nader was born. In public, they dished out 
lots of honey and vinegar to recalcitrant voters on the left. The point, as 
usual, was to consolidate power.

<p>It wasn't supposed to be this way. The pundits who insisted that 
the Democratic Party must shed vestiges of the New Deal are accustomed to 
being contemptuous of progressive constituencies: Take them for granted! 
They have nowhere else to go! Throw them a bone once in a while, but don't 
hesitate to treat them like dogs! On Election Day, they'll come running.

<p>The conventional media wisdom has been that Americans strongly 
opposed to inordinate corporate power were irrelevant. Now, they're 
incorrigible. And, in the prevailing media view, Nader is the most 
incorrigible of all.

<p>"Nader Intends to Play Spoiler Role to the Hilt," a USA Today 
headline explained on the first day of November. The news article began by 
informing readers that Nader is "relishing his role as the potential 
spoiler in the presidential race."

<p>Well, that's one way to depict Nader. But it would be at least as 
accurate to report that the Republican and Democratic candidates are 
"spoilers." They've never been willing or able to step outside a rotten 
big-money system that precludes basic reforms.

<p>Back when Bill Clinton won the presidency in 1992, no journalist 
had more reason to feel satisfaction than E.J. Dionne Jr., the Washington 
Post reporter whose book "Why Americans Hate Politics" had appeared the 
previous year -- with laudatory endorsements on the cover from media 
heavies Mark Shields, Cokie Roberts, William Schneider and Lesley Stahl.

<p>Early in the decade, Clinton was fond of quoting the Dionne book 
in speeches and interviews. The president-to-be praised him as a "very 
gifted political writer." Most importantly, Clinton saw eye-to-eye with 
Dionne's centrist prescription, which called for politicians to develop "a 
new politics of the middle class, an approach that represents the ideals 
and interests of the great mass of Americans in the political and economic 
center."

<p>Dionne maintained that "voters increasingly look for ways to 
protest the status quo without risking too much change." In effect, it was 
a call to better choreograph an elaborate shell game that would do little 
to rearrange the nation's distribution of economic and political power. 
When Clinton echoed Dionne, much of the national press corps seemed delighted.

<p>Like many of his colleagues at major media outlets, this fall 
Dionne sounded mournful about the failure of Nader supporters to fall in 
line behind Gore. In a recent syndicated column, Dionne lamented "the agony 
for Gore in the closing week of this campaign" -- as a result of "tensions 
in the Democratic coalition that most Democrats thought they'd resolved."

<p>But key issues of economic inequity and social justice -- 
including the further centralization of power in huge conglomerates -- were 
never really settled. They were just suppressed by New Democrats in command 
of the party. Now, their finely woven schemes may be unraveling.

<p>A week before the election, Gore denounced Bush for supporting 
"class warfare on behalf of billionaires." It was an apt description of the 
Texas governor, who is a complete shill for corporate interests. But Gore 
is the loyal vice president in an administration that has presided over 
escalating economic inequality. During the 1990s, Americans with financial 
assets gained wealth. Those who merely worked for a living slipped farther 
behind.

<p>Rhetoric, of course, is much less important than policy. In 
practice, Bush's class warfare from the top down is more extreme than 
Gore's -- but both men have been eager tools of the rich and powerful. 
Perhaps the nation's media establishment can cope with the shock of seeing 
millions of Americans vote for Nader because they want a fundamentally 
different kind of society.
