Tweedy-smug and Tweedy-dumb debated Tuesday night like they were each running 
for high school Student Council president. Tweedy-smug Al Gore was a haughty 
nerd scolding his opponent for not having his numbers straight. George W. Bush 
rolled his eyes and whined that he was just a regular guy and the victim of his 
brainy opponent's "fuzzy math." 
<P>The most telling moment came when moderator Jim (Softball) Lehrer lobbed up a 
question asking the candidates to describe how they had responded to an 
unexpected crisis in their lives. Gore said he took a "big risk" inviting a 
Russian official to mediate in getting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to 
accept surrender terms in the Kosovo war, then said he probably had many other 
moments of great crisis response in his 24 years of public service, but he 
couldn't think of any, so he returned to a scripted debate point. Bush said that 
as governor of Texas he took the incredibly bold and unprecedented step of 
flying into areas of his state hit by natural disasters, talking and comforting 
families, and calling in federal aid. </P>
<P>That's the best they could do. It's obvious neither has ever really dealt 
with a crisis. Gore has been scripted from childhood to respond to every moment 
by using political calculus. Bush has used the safety net of a privileged 
upbringing to cushion his numerous falls from grace, and now finds himself 
thrust unprepared onto the world stage.</P>
<P>While these two unremarkable men spent 90 minutes providing millions of 
American insomniacs with their best sleep in months, a man whose life has been 
selflessly devoted to civic betterment was shut out from the hall in Boston. 
Even though he had a ticket to be part of the audience, Ralph Nader was barred 
from entry by police acting at the behest of the "debate commission," a private 
company run by two former heads of the Democratic and Republican parties. Nine 
thousand protesters massed outside demanding that Nader be given a chance to 
debate - more people than have shown up at almost any rally held by the major 
party candidates.</P>
<P>Nader is personally responsible for saving countless thousands of lives with 
his work on auto and consumer and workplace safety throughout a distinguished 
career as the country's most effective citizen democrat. He is eminently 
qualified to debate and to be president, but has been denied a spot by the 
commission and its corporate sponsors on the excuse that polls show him at only 
5 percent (not the 15 percent threshold the commission has arbitrarily set). Of 
course, the opinion polls include only "likely voters," which excludes the more 
than half the U.S. voting population, who are so disenchanted with the major 
parties and their candidates that they don't even vote. Nader's real level of 
support has not been accurately measured, and it won't be.</P>
<P>The two parties exclude Nader because they know that Americans might vote for 
Nader if they saw him on national TV raising issues the other candidates won't 
touch. Wrestler Jesse Ventura was at 8 percent in the polls until he got on a 
televised debate in Minnesota, and then he won the governorship. And compared to 
Nader, Ventura is mush.</P>
<P>Speaking of mush, Bush and Gore droned on about the minutiae of their tax 
proposals, their prescription drug plans for seniors (only a prominent issue 
because older people vote in high numbers) and other minor issues, struggling to 
define their differences. </P>
<P>Gore tried to make the point that electing him would ensure a woman's right 
to abortion, because he could select three or four pro-abortion judges to the 
Supreme Court. This is the issue Gore has used to scare potential Nader voters 
into voting for him, and it has worked. In fact, though, Bush didn't say he 
would use a pro-life stance as a litmus test for judges, and he hasn't done so 
in Texas, where his judicial appointments have been moderates. Asked whether he 
would overturn the Food and Drug Administration's ruling allowing the abortion 
pill RU-486, Bush said he wouldn't use the presidency to do that. Bush 
emphasized that he wanted to find common ground to reduce the number of 
abortions (a conciliatory, common-sense stance). Given every opportunity to make 
a rabid anti-abortion statement, he refused. But Gore trumpeted his opposition 
to partial birth abortions. </P>
<P>The threat of Roe v. Wade being overturned is a bogeyman being used to keep 
liberals in the Democratic camp. That's because there is little or nothing else 
to make progressives want to choose Gore over Bush. The candidates agree on 
NAFTA, GATT, the WTO and the essentials of globalization. On foreign policy, 
Gore is more hawkish. He wants the best and strongest military in the world, 
while Bush spoke out for less interventionism. Clinton/Gore launched more U.S. 
military adventures than any administration in American history. Gore and Bush 
both support billions for useless and destabilizing missile defense systems. 
They agree on the wonders of welfare reform, but Gore said he wants to take it 
to the "next level," whatever that may be. Under Clinton/Gore, the number of 
children living in poverty has risen, the number of children without health 
insurance has increased by 9 million, and untrained mothers have been taken off 
the welfare rolls and made to work in minimum-wage jobs while their children are 
shoved into child care. The two parties' position on increasing the minimum wage 
is a matter of a tiny difference in amount and timing. Gore talks a better line 
on the environment, but his actual record is very mixed. Neither candidate will 
do much if anything to defend the eroding rights of unionized workers, improve 
job health and safety, or check in any significant way the growing power of 
corporations.</P>
<P>Gore talks about taking on the big corporations and ending the use of soft 
money to finance campaigns - this after years of sucking on the corporate teat. 
Gore is talking about being a defender of working people all his life, which is 
a complete joke. Both parties are completely beholden to corporate financing and 
corporate control. They have lost any accountability to the citizenry.</P>
<P>Nader isn't allowed to debate because he would puncture the carefully 
maintained corporate-media bubble of "unprecedented prosperity" and point out 
how working families spend more time working and make less money than 30 years 
ago; how corporations are running rampant over environmental regulations; how 
issues of human rights and trade have been ceded to bodies like the WTO; and how 
American democracy has become a charade.</P>
<P>Americans want to hear this debate. They are in large measure sick and tired 
of the two major parties, unhappy about the way corporations have taken over the 
political process, and worried about the future of their children and the 
planet.</P>
<P>This is a defining moment in American politics. Nader is pushing the same 
positions he has all his life - which revolve around consumer and worker and 
environmental protection and the maintenance of civic life and democratic 
participation in political decision-making. These weren't really very radical 
positions when Nader began public life in the mid-1960s (when many on the left 
wanted the system overthrown, not reformed through regulatory improvements). But 
the ground has shifted so far to the right that Nader is now outside the pale of 
permitted political discourse.</P>
<P>In cities nationwide, Nader has been drawing crowds of many thousands for 
speeches and rallies, including a good number of college-age students. Contrast 
this to Bush and Gore, whose campaign appearances are all carefully controlled 
and scripted events. (To attend a "town meeting" style videotaping for Gore on 
MTV, students at University of Michigan had to <I>audition!</I>)</P>
<P>Nader is going to file a lawsuit over his exclusion from the debate. Perhaps 
enough pressure will mount so that he could be forced into one of the other 
debates. But that is not likely. What I hope is that enough Americans will see 
that this whole election process has become a sham - a corporate dog-and-pony 
show - to start to work to save our gravely imperiled democracy. </P>
<P>What the rest of the world can do, unfortunately, is only to sit and watch 
and hope that someday soon Americans will come to their senses. Perhaps last 
night's debate will be an impetus for that to happen. After the Two Stooges show 
last night, millions of Americans woke up this morning with the frightening 
thought that either the brainless, bumbling daddy's-boy George W. Bush or the 
haughty, unprincipled opportunist Al Gore will be their next president. </P>
