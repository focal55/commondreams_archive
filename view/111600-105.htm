Conventional wisdom suggests that, by rejecting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's offer at Camp David and turning to violence, Palestinians have set back the peace process by years and ensured that the next Israeli offer will be less generous.
<P>There is little question that violence is abhorrent, harms innocents, and can spin out of control. Still, for many Palestinians, resorting to violence seems as logical as it did for Jewish resistance groups fighting against the British in pre-state Israel.</P>
<P>The key to understanding this view is the ever-expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Again, while conventional wisdom suggests that the Camp David summit collapsed over the issue of Jerusalem, the settlements are a far greater problem for more Palestinians. The continued presence of these fortified enclaves affects the viability of the Palestinian state that most Israelis now accept as an inevitable part of any deal.</P>
<P>Some 400,000 Jews live on territory Israel captured in 1967, including 200,000 in areas around Jerusalem that Israel has annexed. They live on confiscated land and, in the settlements away from Jerusalem, enjoy generous state subsidies for security, construction and infrastructure. Palestinians in these areas watch helplessly as Israel constantly widens settlement boundaries and builds bypass roads through Palestinian areas. Settlers have shot and killed several Palestinians in the past decade, with the perpetrators sometimes receiving little or no punishment.</P>
<P>To protect the settlers and their roads, Israel has sliced the West Bank and Gaza into a patchwork of smaller units that can be sealed at will. This situation, Palestinians say, denies them the territorial contiguity and freedom of movement they need for a viable state. They believe the problem has not been adequately addressed by any of the proposals floated by Israeli negotiators.</P>
<P>The Oslo agreement, signed seven years ago by Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, was to have frozen the expansion of these settlements, leaving their future to later negotiations. Since then, however, Israel has accelerated settlement construction dramatically, bringing an additional 50,000 Jews to the West Bank and Gaza. To Palestinians, now accused of rejecting Oslo by turning to violence, Israel violated its Oslo commitments long ago by unilaterally and significantly altering these facts on the ground.</P>
<P>It's important to view the current Palestinian violence in this context. For the most part, the violence has been focused almost exclusively on the settlements and the Israeli forces protecting and supplying them. To be sure, Palestinians are divided on the question of anti-Israeli violence. Radicals want to carry the fight to Israel proper, while others propose limiting their targets to the occupied territories. These people know that, if Palestinians use indiscriminate violence against Jews wherever they might be, international and Israeli public opinion will be set against them. If, however, they focus on soldiers and armed settlers in occupied lands, the message might be received differently.</P>
<P>Statements this week by Fatah, the leading Palestinian party, as well as the more radical Hamas, appear to support this approach. Fatah said it will try to prevent Israeli forces from entering West Bank towns, while Hamas has called for attacks on settlers and soldiers in both the West Bank and Gaza.</P>
<P>There is little doubt that Israel will respond to any Palestinian violence with force. Its army will shoot to kill, fire rockets to destroy buildings, place towns under siege or curfew, bulldoze olive groves and build new walls.</P>
<P>But such responses are unlikely to defeat the Palestinian resistance, and the campaign will prove costly. Like the Jews resisting British occupation, Palestinian leaders appear to be betting that, by making the occupied lands ungovernable for Israel, the support within Israel for dismantling the settlements will grow.</P>
<P>During the first <I>intifada</I>,which began in 1987 and lasted for several years, Palestinians largely kept the battle within the occupied territories and limited their arsenal to stones and Molotov cocktails. This strategy, coupled with Palestinians' readiness to die or go hungry, increased the political costs of occupation and helped bring about the 1993 Oslo accord.</P>
<P>Choosing violence is a tragic and risky move. It can fuel extremism and alienate the publics whose support is needed for a political deal. Yet many Palestinians, frustrated with a peace process that has allowed their land to be chopped into ever-shrinking ghettos, see a new, guerrilla-enhanced <I>intifada </I>as the only way to gain their freedom. Sooner or later, Israel will have to confront this harsh reality.
