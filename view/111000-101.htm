ROUGEMONT, NC --  Usually, first thing in the morning, she's too sleepy to speak. Not Wednesday. "Who's the new president?" she asked. 
<P> I had to tell her that I didn't know. She got dressed unusually quickly; so did her sister. 
<P> Now it's a peculiar trial to a child, having a news junkie for a parent. We wake up to the radio news, and it stays on through breakfast. Sometimes I'll shush them to hear what's happening in the world. It's an annoying habit of their ma, one they tolerate with varying patience. 
<P> The rule is, I get to listen till we leave the house. Once we're in the car, the radio goes off. We sing; we plan the day. After I drop Grace off at the high school, I can turn it on again. 
<P> For once, this week, neither kid minded the radio. When we got in the car, Grace said: leave it on. We picked up our friend Amanda at Underwood's convenience store. Amanda's 15; she was concerned about the overseas ballots. Mostly military she said, therefore probably Republican. 
<P>When Ruby arrived home on the bus, she again demanded: Who won? When we picked up Grace and Amanda, they wanted an update. Between school and dropping Amanda at home and choir practice, Roo demanded an explanation of the Electoral College. I started, but  Grace was soon butting in. She's taking ELP this year (the name in these parts for what used to be called Civics: Economics, Law and Politics). She knew about "faithless electors"; she knew that a couple of states allow their electors not to vote as a bloc. 
<P>The questions flew. How many times had there been a different outcome in the popular vote and the electoral vote? When was the last election decided that way? What was the reasoning behind the Electoral College? 
<P>They knew their older brother, voting in his first election, had chosen Ralph Nader. Why didn't I agree with this? Could Nader's share of the vote make the difference in Florida? 
<P>OK, you already know this about us, we're Democrats. So are a lot of our friends. So Grace and Amanda and their friends are making plans about which country they will move to if George W. Bush wins. Grace wants to return to the country of her birth, Australia. Or maybe Jamaica, she thinks. Her friend Mae favors Jamaica. Amanda says Italy. 
<P>This talk seems to be genuinely worrying Roo. "What will we do?" she wails, meaning what will we do if Bush wins. It's clear she needs reassurance. 
<P>"We'll be perfectly OK," I say. "I don't like his ideas, and I'm sure he'll do things I won't like, but your day-to-day life won't change a whole lot." 
<P>"But he'll ruin our schools!" Grace says.
<P>"No,"I say, "he doesn't have the power to do that. Your schools aren't controlled by the federal government." So then we get into the delegation of powers between the different levels of government. What can the states do, what can the federal government do? 
<P>In between, we're still glued to the radio. What's happening in Oregon? 
<P>Suddenly Grace knows how many electoral votes it has. She knows how many Gore has now, and how many Bush has, how many they need to win. 
<P>My son calls. Did you see those Florida ballots? he asks. They're a mess! 
<P>Say what you will about this weird time, at least one aspect of it is glorious for a parent like me. My kids are agog with politics. I've found out something about them, and about their friends: They care about this, a lot. 
<P>For once, Grace is not talking about which member of which boy group changed his hair last week. We're discussing the big stuff. 
<P>Maybe it's not so bad, once or twice in a lifetime, to have the system thrown into chaos. I can lecture them all I like about how lucky they are, how different and precious this messy system is, compared to the way a lot of countries live. Life goes on; there's not much reason to pay attention to the mechanics of their political system. 
<P>My kids will never forget this. For the rest of their lives, they'll know this week in the year 2000 as a time when they grew up, when the world got bigger and they started to care about what was on the radio. 
<P>Remembering my own youth, I think: Better this than an assassination.
