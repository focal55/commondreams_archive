August 6 marks two anniversaries of death and destruction. 
One is permanently etched into our collective memory --  the 
flash of light and mushroom cloud over Hiroshima 55 years ago 
that left as many as 140,000 Japanese dead. To forget the tragedy 
of the world's first atomic bombing would be a painful moral 
failure.	 
<P> The other anniversary concerns death today, death 
that continues because of an equally painful moral failure. 
This attack is ongoing, and it has killed far more --  at least 
1 million innocent people, half of them children under the age 
of 5, according to U.N. studies.	 
</P>
<P> For them, death comes 
not in a flash, but with the slow agony of malnutrition and 
wasting diseases. The weapon is the ancient tactic of siege, 
an attack against all living things in a society.	 
</P>
<P> Today 
marks the 10th anniversary of the attack on Iraq through siege, 
the imposition of the most comprehensive economic sanctions 
in modern times. Though administered through the United Nations, 
the sanctions are the result of U.S. policy and power, of this 
nation's rejection of the international consensus to lift the 
siege. The Clinton administration's policy --  or what U.S. 
Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., has called ``infanticide masquerading 
as policy'' --  is that sanctions must remain until there is 
definitive proof that Saddam Hussein's regime is not rebuilding 
weapons of mass destruction.	 
</P>
<P> Or is the policy that sanctions 
must remain until Hussein is overthrown? It's hard to tell, 
because U.S. officials have made both statements, giving Hussein 
little reason to think he can satisfy the United States.	 
</P>
<P> Whatever the policy, the United States has made it clear it 
cares little about the suffering of innocent Iraqis, who live 
</P>
<P>-- and die --  with inadequate diets, unclean water that spreads 
disease and barely functioning medical facilities.	 
</P>
<P> From 
the point of view of creating and maintaining real peace, U.S. 
policy is a failure.	 
</P>
<P> Former U.N. weapons inspector Scott 
Ritter --  hardly an ally of the Iraqis --  has called for lifting 
the sanctions, saying that Iraq is qualitatively disarmed (meaning 
that the capability to produce or use weapons of mass destruction 
has been eliminated). But U.S. insistence on quantitative disarmament 
(accounting for every last weapon or related material) ensures 
there will be no constructive change.	 
</P>
<P> The sanctions also 
have done nothing to advance democracy in Iraq. Living on the 
edge of survival, the Iraqi people have few resources for pressing 
political change. As Denis Halliday, the former U.N. humanitarian 
coordinator in Iraq, notes, ``Sanctions will not change governance 
to democracy. Sanctions encourage isolation, alienation and 
possibly fanaticism.''	 
</P>
<P> But from the point of view of maintaining 
and extending U.S. power, the policy has worked. What U.S. officials 
want in Iraq is a government that accepts the iron law of U.S. 
policy: The resources of the Middle East must remain, as much 
as possible, under the effective control of the United States. 
The old colonial model of direct control is gone; now we rely 
on the cooperation of compliant local governments (authoritarian 
or democratic; we don't much care) that take their cut and ship 
most of the remaining profits to the West.	 
</P>
<P> Recalcitrant 
regimes must be broken so that the flow of oil profits to U.S. 
and British banks and corporations is not threatened. Iraq, 
an ally throughout the 1980s until it challenged the U.S. system, 
is so devastated that it will be decades before it can rebuild.	 
</P>
<P> To oppose the sanctions is not to support the brutal regime 
of Saddam Hussein, but to reject genocide. That is the term 
that Halliday has used, describing the sanctions as an ``intentional 
program to destroy a culture, a people, a country.'' Rather 
than stage-manage a genocide, Halliday resigned in protest in 
1998. In the past year, his successor, Hans von Sponeck, did 
the same, as has the director of the World Food Program in Iraq, 
Jutta Burghardt.	 
</P>
<P> U.S. officials don't feel the same tug 
of conscience. When interviewed on ``60 Minutes'' in 1996, Secretary 
of State Madeline Albright --  then U.S. ambassador to the United 
Nations --  was asked if the deaths of a half-million children 
in Iraq were acceptable. Her answer: ``I think this is a very 
hard choice. But the price, we think the price is worth it.''	 
</P>
<P> I do not know by what moral gymnastics Albright reaches such 
a conclusion.	 
</P>
<P> I do not know how high the death toll in 
Iraq will climb before U.S. policy changes.	 
</P>
<P> And 55 years 
from now, I don't know which anniversary of death will weigh 
most on the consciences of Americans.
