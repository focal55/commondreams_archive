The election season makes it patently clear how Big Business is able to
transform its financial resources into political power via campaign
contributions.

<p>But an even more fundamental source of business power is corporations'
control over investment decisions, and the tax, trade and investment rules
which enhance capital mobility. The ability to shift production to
different locations, or threaten to shift production, gives corporations
enormous leverage over the political process and over workers.

<p>Want to adopt serious environmental standards to stem the corporate
poisoning of the air, water and land? Get ready to face the threat of
plant closures and job shifting. Want to force companies to bear a
reasonable share of the tax burden? Be prepared to face company moves to
lower tax havens. Want to mandate payment of a living wage to all workers?
Plan to hear how business will be forced to move to Mexico or China.

<p>Nowhere is the raw power connected to corporate mobility more apparent
than in labor management relations, as Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of
labor education research at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor
Relations, makes clear in a new paper, "Uneasy Terrain" (see
<a href="http://www.ustdrc.gov/research/bronfenbrenner.pdf">http://www.ustdrc.gov/research/bronfenbrenner.pdf</a>).

<p>When faced with union organizing campaigns, employers routinely threaten
to close their plant and move elsewhere. Understandably, these threats
intimidate workers -- a union won't do you any good if you don't have a
job -- and they are tremendously successful at defeating union organizing
drives.

<p>In the most comprehensive survey ever of U.S. union organizing campaigns,
Bronfenbrenner found that "the majority of employers consistently,
pervasively and extremely effectively tell workers either directly or
indirectly that if they ask for too much, or don't give concessions, or
try to organize, strike or fight for good jobs with good benefits, the
company will close, move out of state or move across the border, just as
so many other plants have done before."

<p>In union organizing drives in the United States in 1998 and 1998, she
found, more than half of all employers threatened to close all or part of
the facility if workers voted to join a union.

<p>But the situation is even worse than that figure suggests, because for
some types employers it is difficult to make credible threats to move --
hotels and hospitals, for example, are to a considerable extent tied to
place.

<p>In mobile industries -- manufacturing and other companies that can
credibly threaten to shift production -- the plant closing threat rate was
68 percent. In all manufacturing, it was 71 percent. In food processing,
it was 71 percent.

<p>These numbers mark a worrisome upturn from a previous Bronfenbrenner
survey, undertaken for the Labor Secretariat of the Commission for Labor
Cooperation and published in 1997. Bronfenbrenner's data from 1993-1995
showed a threat rate of 64 percent among manufacturers, 21 percent among
food processors.

<p>(That earlier study, prepared for a commission created by one of the NAFTA
side agreements, was suppressed by the Clinton administration. Eventually
liberated, it provided some of the key evidence leading to the defeat of
fast track.)

<p>Employers deliver the threats directly (after posting pictures of shut
down facilities, supervisors asked workers at a Mitsubishi plant in
Tennessee, "Is your family ready to move to Mexico?") or more indirectly.
For multinationals, Bronfenbrenner told us, there is a pervasive "silent
threat. ... The map on the wall" showing the locations of a company around
the world is an ongoing reminder that the company can easily do business
elsewhere.

<p>Employers know the threats work, Bronfenbrenner says. Anti-union training
materials emphasize that "fear is the most effective tool," she explains.

<p>And the evidence backs up the commonsense insight that threats to close
effectively intimidate workers.

<p>"Union election win rates were significantly lower in units where plant
closing threats occurred (38 percent) than in units without plant closing
threats (51 percent)," Bronfenbrenner found. "Win rates were especially
low (24 percent) in those campaigns where employers made specific threats
to move to another country. Win rates were also significantly lower in
mobile industries where the threat of closure was more credible."

<p>Unions can overcome plant-closing threats, Bronfenbrenner says, by running
aggressive campaigns that involve rank-and-file union members as
organizers and actively involve and energize the workers who are being
organized. But the challenge is immense, especially given the array of
other anti-union tactics, including firing of union supporters, that
corporations regularly employ.

<p>Dealing with the problem of plant-closing threats, at least in the union
organizing context, will require two major reforms, Bronfenbrenner
concludes. First, labor law must more clearly delineate such threats as
illegal, and impose big enough penalties to deter employers from making
them. Second, trade, investment and tax policy must be changed to limit
corporate mobility, and to block employers from shifting operations to
avoid unionization.

<p>That's not just a pro-union agenda. It is a basic pro-democracy one.
