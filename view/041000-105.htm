WASHINGTON -- As AFL-CIO President John Sweeney declared that

corporate-driven globalization of the economy was "killing the hopes and dreams

of working families from Managua to Milwaukee,'' Wisconsinites joined thousands

of activists in calling for cancellation of debts owed by impoverished

countries.

<p>The crowd rallied on the national Mall on Sunday and then surrounded the

Capitol with a human chain symbolizing the chains of debt that prevent

development of poor countries. As trumpets sounded and ancient Jewish shofars

were blown to herald a time of Jubilee -- when the debts of the poor are

absolved -- the crowd chanted, "Cancel the debt! Free the world!''</p>

<p>While Congress has yet to act on the issue, Bruce Colburn of Wisconsin said

the American people fully understand the need for the United States to provide

full debt relief for poor nations -- a move that economists estimate would cost

the average American less than $4 over the next 20 years.</p>

<p>"People from Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, from all over the U.S. are here to

say that it is time to eliminate the debts and let these countries start to

rebuild,'' said Colburn, a former Milwaukee County Labor Federation chief who is

now a top official with the national AFL-CIO. "This is an issue where people in

places like Madison and Milwaukee are way ahead of the government and the

banks.''</p>

<p>The issue of debt relief has been forced onto the global agenda by Jubilee

2000, a worldwide movement created to push wealthy governments and international

lending agencies to cancel the crushing debts owed by the world's poorest

nations. Development officials, religious leaders and academics argue that the

burden of making interest payments on international debt prevents Third World

nations from providing for the health, education, housing and nourishment of

their citizens.</p>

<p>The activists found an ally in President Clinton.</p>

<p>A statement from the president, which was read at the Jubilee 2000 rally,

said, "In too many countries around the world today, excessive debt and unwise

economic policies divert crucial resources from health, education, environment

and other social investments. Every year, two-thirds of the world's heavily

indebted poor countries spend more on debt service than on health and education.

At the same time, basic human needs go unmet. In these countries, one in 10

children dies before his or her first birthday, one in three children is

malnourished, and the average adult has had only three years of schooling. This

is wrong.''</p>

<p>Last year, Clinton promised cancellation of some debts owed to the United

States by impoverished nations, but Congress has yet to approve funding for that

initiative. Even with congressional action, Jubilee 2000 activists argue, more

work is needed. The debt relief initiative must be extended to cover all

impoverished countries, they say; and they want to see the United States play a

greater role in pushing the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund,

international banks and other wealthy nations to embrace proposals for complete

debt relief.</p>

<p>Nuns and steelworkers, students and retirees at the rally joined in the call

Sunday -- carrying signs that declared "Debt kills 19,000 children each day''

and "Compassion -- not greed.'' The United Auto Workers union printed thousands

of signs declaring "Cancel the Debt!'' and handed them to members who arrived

from as far away as the Upper Midwest to join the human chain.</p>

<p>Sweeney noted the presence of union members and others who had come by bus

from the far corners of the country, saying, "The crushing burden of worldwide

debt is doing more than killing children, it is also killing the hopes and

dreams of working families from Managua to Milwaukee and from Karachi to Kansas

City.''</p>

<p>Samantha West, a 1999 UW-Madison graduate, listened to Sweeney on Sunday and

said, "This really is remarkable. This shows that people in the United States

are starting to make the connections between what's going on in their lives and

in the lives of people living in Africa and Asia, all over the world. That's the

way that change -- real change, change that matters -- begins.''</p>

<p>Noting that activists from around the country will be in Washington for the

next week to challenge everything from corporate sweatshops to U.S. trade

policies to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, West said, "This

is the kickoff event for a week of citizenship like we haven't seen in a long,

long time.''
