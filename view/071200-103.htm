So, we're sitting in our office, and under the door comes a note advising
us that there will be a press conference the next day where
African-American and Hispanic groups will release a report showing how
minority populations will suffer most if the United Nations Global Warming
Treaty (Kyoto agreement) passes the U.S. Senate.
 
<p>The press conference was being pulled together by Advantage Communications
Consultants, a public relations firm in Houston, and coordinated by a
group called the Center for Energy and Economic Development (CEED).
 
<p>A simple check tells us that CEED is a coal industry front group. Of
course, the coal industry has a lot to lose if the United States moves
away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy sources, like solar.
 
<p>But nothing in the press materials tells us that this is a coal industry
event. So we decide to go to the press conference and play along.
 
<p>And it's a slow news day, so when we arrive, there are many reporters
attending the press briefing, including reporters from the Associated
Press and Los Angeles Times. C-SPAN's camera is there to beam the press
conference out live.
 
<p>And the moderator, Linda Brown, from the Houston public relations firm,
makes her opening statement, saying Blacks and Hispanics are left out of
the national policy debate on global warming.
 
<p>We are told that six Black and Hispanic groups, including the AFL-CIO's A.
Phillip Randolph Institute, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, and
the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, are releasing a report.
 
<p>The report finds that "millions of blacks, Hispanics and other minorities
could be pushed into poverty by tough new restrictions on energy use"
called for by the Kyoto treaty.
 
<p>If ratified, the treaty would require reductions in carbon dioxide
emissions from burning fossil fuels.
 
<p>A video is shown. And then the leaders of the Black and Hispanic groups
present lay out the chief findings of the study -- that America's minority
community would be hardest hit by a recession triggered by the Kyoto
treaty, that the treaty would put more than one million Black and Hispanic
worker jobs at risk, that higher unemployment, reduced earning power, and
higher prices for energy and other consumer goods would push millions of
people of color into poverty.
 
<p>So, now we're almost an hour into the press conference, and not one
mention is made of the coal industry's involvement with the study -- a
salient factoid if there ever was one in the context of this press
conference.
 
<p>We're sitting in the press area, and next to us is sitting Stephen Miller,
the president of CEED, the coal front group. So, we point out that CEED is
a corporate front group. And we wanted to know -- did the coal industry
pay for this report?
 
<p>Yes, the coal industry paid $40,000 for the report, Miller admits.
 
<p>And Harry Alford, of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, said that his
organization has received checks from Texaco and General Motors and
others, but "that money has nothing to do with what we are doing here
today."
 
<p>"I take offense at your thinking that our groups are here because someone
gave us a check to say something," Alford said. "So, I'm a little
insulted. And I do think the question is racial."
 
<p>Lionel Hurst appeared insulted, too. By Alford. Hurst is the Ambassador to
the United States from Antigua and Barbuda. Tipped off to the press
conference, Hurst attended and confronted Alford. He pointed out that
people of color communities around the world are already suffering unduly
from the impacts of global warming. "Failure to act internationally on
global warming will pose the greatest costs to the most vulnerable nations
of the world due to sea level rise and the spread of infectious diseases
in a warmer world," Hurst said.
 
<p>Also offended were the African-American activists who for years have been
working on the question of polluting industries dumping on minority
communities.
 
<p>These activists, including Dr. Joseph Lowrey of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, and Connie Tucker of the Southern Organizing
Committee, sent a letter to all members of Congress, pointing out that the
risks to minority communities from global warming "are much greater than
the dangers from the Kyoto Protocol that appear in the biased predictions
of the coal lobby."
 
<p>In the letter, the activists pointed out that asthma death rates are two
times higher for Blacks than for Whites and that a recent national
assessment of the regional impacts of global warming on the United States
found that higher temperatures, coupled with air pollution in minority
neighborhoods, would further aggravate asthma problems. And the coal
industry study ignored the substantial long-term economic benefits of
mitigating global warming.
 
<p>These arguments didn't faze Oscar Sanchez, executive director of the Labor
Council for Latin American Advancement, which represents 1.5 million
Hispanic members of the AFL-CIO.
 
<p>He defended his group's participation in the coal industry-funded event
and laid down a slippery slope philosophy familiar to public interest
groups throughout the city co-opted by big business money.
 
<p>"We had a story to tell and we found a way of doing it," Sanchez told
reporters during the press conference. "We found a sponsor. It's not
uncommon. It's not like it's something that never happened before."
