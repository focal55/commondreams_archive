In another era, we might have expected the federal government to advance our national security interests by establishing America as the superpower of energy independence and sustainability.
<P>

   Given the absence of bold ideas in Washington, the burden of innovation must be shouldered by cities and local governments. That's why Oakland has decided to send a message to the rest of the country that the moment has arrived for breaking America's addiction to fossil fuels.
<P><SNML_LEAD>

   Buying foreign oil is a major contributor to our persistent and ever-increasing trade deficit. Moreover, conventional energy production is the largest industrial source of pollution in the world, contributing to smog, acid rain, global climate change and a host of other environmental problems.
<P>

   Record high temperatures were set again last year, in what has become an annual confirmation of the effects of global warming.
<P>

   The time for complacency is over. The city of Oakland took the lead and has become America's largest green power city. We will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and will purchase 100 percent of our electricity from sources such as geothermal steam, wind power and biomass.
<P>

   Our $4 million annual municipal electricity budget will now be a force for something better -- a sustainable energy future. As a major energy consumer, Oakland is expanding the market for renewable energy, and we're doing it quickly: By 2004, 20 percent of our electricity will come from new renewable energy facilities brought online to serve the growing demand the city is creating for green power. Annually, Oakland consumes approximately 9 megawatts of electricity, enough to power more than 27,000 homes.
<P>

   Our new green-power purchases will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 20,000 tons. If Oaklanders as individuals would join their city government in purchasing sustainable energy, our collective CO2 reduction would exceed 150,000 tons.
<P>

   For at least 25 years, it has been obvious that the world must shift away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
<P>

   When I was governor of California, an energy crisis prompted government at the state and federal levels to offer generous energy and conservation incentives. President Jimmy Carter described the energy challenge as the moral equivalent of war. As a result, industry responded by producing an array of new energy technologies.
<P>

   Now -- finally -- after years of official indifference, there are renewed stirrings of concern, brought on by high gasoline prices and damaging foreign oil dependency.
<P>

   Every year, people in the San Francisco Bay Area use more and more energy, both for electricity and transportation. Yet, what better place in the world than Silicon Valley for taking the lead in developing new and sophisticated forms of energy and energy efficiency?
<P>

   Leaders in government and the private sector should be doing much more. Local government could install various types of distributed energy technologies, such as photovoltaics and fuel cells. Companies could establish modular micro-power plants that would create both greater efficiency and the reliability needed for an information economy that cannot afford a millisecond of power loss.
<P>

   Cities, as well as businesses and residents, must ask two fundamental questions:
<P>

   First, how can we be more efficient?
<P>

   Second, how can we decrease fossil fuels by increasing purchases of renewables to meet our continuing energy requirements?
<P>

   Each of us must take responsibility to do our part to cut pollution and reduce global warming. Purchasing green power is an important first step.
<P><i>Brown, a former Democratic governor of California, is the mayor of Oakland, CA. </i>
