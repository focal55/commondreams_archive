THE PENTAGON'S DECISION to place a Patriot missile battery on a 
heightened state of alert for deployment to Israel underscores the 
effort by the United States and others to create the perception of an 
imminent threat from an Iraqi ballistic missile. It doesn't seem to 
matter to the Pentagon that the Israeli Prime Minister himself 
downplays the Iraqi missile threat as nonexistent.
<P>  In the nearly 20 months since U.N. weapons inspectors were last on 
the job in Iraq, there has been no shortage of speculation on what 
has transpired inside Iraq's weapons factories. Richard Butler, the 
former executive chairman of the now-defunct United Nations Special 
Commission (UNSCOM), has been at the forefront of those charging that 
Iraq is actively rearming.	 
</P>
<P>  One of Ambassador Butler's favorite themes has been that ``Saddam 
Hussein is back in the business of making long-range missiles.'' The 
Pentagon's announcement appears perfectly constructed to play along 
with this theme.	 
</P>
<P>This is not the first time the United States has hyped an 
``imminent'' threat from Iraqi missiles. This past summer, the 
CIA reported that its satellites picked up evidence that Iraq had 
resumed flight testing of the Al-Samoud missile. Even though the 
Al-Samoud has a range of less than 150 kilometers and is permitted 
under U.N. resolutions, the CIA highlighted these tests as proof that 
Iraq had more nefarious plans for long-range missiles.	 
</P>
<P>The United States has not been alone in ``exposing'' the threat from 
Baghdad. In a rare public statement earlier this month, the German 
Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) Intelligence Service confirmed a report 
that its agents had located a ``secret Iraqi missile factory near 
Baghdad,'' the Al Mamoun factory, which produces solid-
fuel missiles known as the Ababil-100.	 
</P>
<P>  Although the Ababil-100, like the Al-Samoud, possesses a range 
less than 150 kilometers, the BND cited this latest discovery as 
clear evidence that Saddam Hussein has continued to build up his 
arsenal.	 
</P>
<P>  Given that inspectors have not been on the job for some time now, 
such information, on the surface, would seem compelling. But the 
reality is much different.	 
</P>
<P>  Contrary to the BND report, the Al-Mamoun factory was well known 
to UNSCOM missile inspectors. Like the rest of the Iraqi weapons 
production infrastruc 
ture, the Al Mamoun factory had been under continuous monitoring by 
</P>
<P>UNSCOM since 1993. The ``secret'' Ababil-100 missile project had in 
fact been declared to UNSCOM by Iraq in the spring of 1998. UNSCOM 
inspectors never felt that the Ababil-100 missile represented 
anything close to a viable project, let alone the potential threat to 
German cities that the BND report made it out to be.	 
</P>
<P>  Why would the Germans publish such a report at this time? The 
answer lies in the current effort by UNSCOM's successor organization, 
the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission 
(UNMOVIC) to send inspectors back into Iraq. Iraq has made it clear 
that it rejects such inspections, and the Security Council is bracing 
itself for yet another confrontation. A report such as the one put 
out by the BND will play a prominent role in any discussion 
concerning Iraq's refusal to accept the UNMOVIC inspectors, and it 
closely parallels the CIA reports of the past summer and complements 
the recent Pentagon announcement on the Patriot missiles.	 
</P>
<P>  Given the lack of substance behind the reports from the CIA, BND 
and the Pentagon, one couldn't help but conclude that these reports 
are part of an overall campaign of disinformation designed to continue demonizing and isolating 
Iraq. Such disinformation campaigns have long been associated with 
the effort to contain Iraq through the continued economic sanctions. 
In this regard, the key issue isn't the truth about Iraq's weapons of 
mass destruction, but rather the perception, however incorrect, of 
the threat such weapons pose in the hands of Iraq.	 
</P>
<P>The continuation of economic sanctions, which have resulted in the 
deaths of some 1.5 million innocent Iraqi civilians, hinges on the 
issue of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. It is high time that 
this issue be debated on the basis of fact, not fiction.	 
</P>
<P>  By spreading such misleading and inaccurate reports, the United 
States and Germany have thrown away the credibility that comes by 
embracing the truth, and instead have surrounded themselves with a 
bodyguard of lies. Given the enormity of the tragedy unfolding in 
Iraq today, the citizens of these two great democracies deserve, and 
should demand, better.	 

<P><I>Scott Ritter, the author of ``Endgame'' (Simon & Schuster, 1999), was a U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq.</I>
