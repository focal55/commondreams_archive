<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->The death toll in America's bitterly  contested election has so far been exactly  zero, an encouraging contrast to recent experience in some less fortunate nations. 
<P>     I worry, though. The Clinton and Gore  haters are dreadfully overwrought about  the impending &quot;theft&quot; of this election.  Peggy Noonan, the Bush and Reagan  speechwriter, has worked herself into a  state of beastly dementia in the pages of  the the Wall Street Journal. I'm terribly  concerned she'll fall over and hurt herself. 
<P>     And no man Rupert Murdoch's age  should be out whipping up his exhausted troops at  the New York Post to produce headlines of greater  and greater paranoia, each suggesting the Gore dictatorship is upon us. You'd think he was William  Randolph Hearst promoting the Spanish-American  War. 
<P>     Let's all get hold of ourselves before things get  bloody. It's true George W. Bush would be the first  president elected in 124 years without winning the  popular vote. I guess the real question is, how do  you &quot;steal&quot; an election that's already been stolen by  that 18th century atrocity known as the Electoral  College? Or, how do you steal a state - Florida, for  instance - where the political machinery is controlled by a Bush and a Republican Legislature? 
<P>     Most tellingly, how do you steal an election that's  already been stolen - very well, legally purchased  - by a gush of corporate soft money in which Republicans enjoyed such vast advantage? 
<P>     Democrats must calm down, too. Look at what  we have just escaped: an unambiguous mandate, a  landslide of electoral or popular votes for the notion  that America be turned into a larger version of Texas - a right-wing democracy based on the  political power of oil and the liberal practice of death penalty. Add to our good fortune a U.S. Senate in which a trouser-length Republican majority has been cut  down to gym shorts. If the next president  must be damaged goods, let him as well be  a Republican. 
<P>     Forget about who &quot;won&quot; this election.  Let's say nobody did. What's really important is the pattern it sets for the next two. 
<P>     With Bush's putative Florida victory so  slim and unconvincing, we now know that  if Gore had saturated the TV markets of South Florida, Tampa Bay and Jacksonville with $10 million  more in last-minute commercials, it would have  changed history. We can be just as sure that if Gore  had known this, he'd have found the money if it  meant selling his dog for cat food. 
<P>     Just as certainly, Bush would have laid his hands  on even more if he'd known his own brother was going to deliver Florida by such an embarrassing  squeaker and that, as hapless Florida went, so would  go the nation. 
<P>     Absent campaign reform, which Bush has no  stomach for and which will take place only over the  stiff and putrefying body of Sen. Mitch McConnell,  R-Ky., corporate America must brace itself. In the  2002 election, pressure from both parties to cough  up enough money to secure more effective majorities in Congress is going to be excruciating. 
<P>     And in 2004, with both parties famished for the  rich spoils of an untarnished presidency, things'll really get expensive.
