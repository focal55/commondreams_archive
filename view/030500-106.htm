<p>ON WEDNESDAY, one week after four police officers were acquitted of killing an unarmed African immigrant, a New York police officer killed my cousin. 
<P>

   He, too, was an unarmed black man.
<P>Hours after my cousin, Malcolm Corey Ferguson, 23, was shot in the head, neighbors in his Bronx community, already angry after the acquittals in the Amadou Diallo case, again took to the streets.
<P>

   ``It's not even a week since Amadou, and you're back here shooting us again!'' the New York Daily News reported one man yelled at a cop. 
<P>

   In the neighborhood near where Malcolm and I grew up, people have had it with bloodthirsty cops.
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1><B>Two victims, one city</B></FONT>
<P>


 Malcolm was no saint.
<P>

   ``It was a totally different situation,'' New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani told reporters Thursday, defending the shooting.
<P>

   I think he's only half-right. 
<P>

   Unlike the Diallo case, the circumstances of Malcolm's death are unclear; police and witnesses disagree about what happened. And, unlike Diallo, Malcolm had an arrest record and was suspected of being a drug dealer.
<P>

   But there is a similarity, a theme, that speaks to the larger disease of distrust of the police that infects New York, Los Angeles and other areas with clusters of minorities.
<P>

   Malcolm and Diallo were black men. Malcolm and Diallo were unarmed. Malcolm and Diallo are dead.
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1><B>Latino officer</B></FONT>
<P>New York police officials were quick to point out that the shooter, officer Luis Rivera, was Latino, effectively squelching any rumblings that the incident was racial. 
<P>

   But what they haven't addressed is the strong feeling among many African-Americans that the police believe that if you're black or brown -- and especially if you're a man -- you're assumed to be a criminal.
<P>

   And that if they can't catch you committing a crime, they assume that, at some point, you have -- or probably will. So if they violate your rights, push you around, beat you, entrap you, fabricate evidence to condemn you or even go too far and kill you, understand it's just a preventive measure.
<P>

   I will never understand how my cousin and Diallo died. I never want to.
<P>

   Giuliani says we shouldn't draw parallels between the two losses. But how could we not? Diallo was shot 41 times by four plainclothes officers looking for a rape suspect. The rape suspect was black. Diallo was black. But when Diallo reached for his wallet, perhaps to prove his identity, the cops opened fire. They kept shooting even as the man lay lifeless.
<P>

   They said it was an accident, a case of mistaken identity.
<P>

   So was Malcolm's shooting.
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1><B>At the scene</B></FONT>
<P>


 A witness told the Daily News he saw two men, presumably cops, walking down Boynton Avenue, one guy in a gray hood, one guy in a black hood. Both hoods were tied up so you couldn't see their faces. The witness ``thought they were robbers.''
<P>

   He watched the hooded men rush into a lobby of 1045 Boynton Ave. Police would later say the hooded men, actually undercover narcotics agents, thought they caught a glimpse of something suspicious in the hallway.
<P>

   Then the men in hoods, according to a witness, ``threw two guys in the lobby on the floor. Malcolm was coming downstairs, and he saw this and thought they was robbing them, so he ran upstairs.''
<P>

   Officer Rivera gave chase. Malcolm had been mugged at gunpoint a few weeks earlier. I can understand why he ran for his life.
<P>

   According to the Daily News, Rivera caught up to Malcolm on a stairway landing and the two grappled over the officer's 9mm pistol. It was during the struggle, Rivera said, that the gun went off.
<P>

   Others say Malcolm tripped and fell.
<P>

   What is known is that a single shot was fired, at close range, hitting Malcolm dead-on in the left temple. He died on that landing.
<P>

   Police say the killing was accidental. I don't know if I believe that. Then again, I don't have all of the facts.
<P>

   I do know that he was unarmed. And while police say they found packets of heroin tucked into his crotch, Malcolm was not a suspect when he was shot.
<P>

   I believe Malcolm was an easy target because of how he looks and where he lived.
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1><B>Bad choices</B></FONT>
<P>


 No, Malcolm was no angel. But he didn't deserve what he got. He was a slow learner and dropped out of school, frustrated because he felt no one there understood him. With no solid education and no prospects for gainful employment, Malcolm turned to petty crimes and dealing drugs.
<P>

   Over the years, he had several run-ins with police that included an arrest in early 1999 for a suspected drug offense. During that arrest, police broke his hand so severely it required surgery. At the time of his death, he had a civil suit pending against the officers.
<P>

   I was disappointed in the way his life had gone. But I was happy to hear that he had received his high school equivalency degree. He was staying out of trouble and made plans to go back to school to become a paralegal.
<P>

   Coincidentally, Malcolm was arrested  Feb. 25 for demonstrating against the Diallo verdict.
<P>

   As children, Malcolm and I had been close. I was born with a brittle bone disease and have used a wheelchair for most of my life. My parents kept me sheltered, and I wasn't permitted to play much with neighbor kids for fear they would break me. But because we were family, and because we liked some of the same things, Malcolm was often my playmate.
<P>

   Those who live on Boynton Avenue said they saw the Malcolm I knew. In a story in the New York Times, they described him as a quiet, easygoing man who never carried weapons, often carted groceries for people and took to selling drugs as a last resort in a difficult life.
<P>

   Like so many of our young men who are seduced by the streets, Malcolm did not come from the streets.
<P>

   He was from quiet Bolton Avenue in the South Bronx, where our grandmother was the first homeowner. He was from a doting mother who, although blind, showed him to look for the good in people and in himself. He was from a group of cousins and extended family who all congregated at our grandmother's house on weekends for barbecues. He was from a rustic little Lutheran church with a steeple where he took turns ringing the bell on Sundays.
<P>

   The Malcolm I knew was misguided but sweet, rough around the edges but caring.
<P>

   Now, he is another dead black man.
