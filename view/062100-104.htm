The NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, which ended a year ago, created a real difficulty for American and European liberals. 
<P>

  Some felt that intervention was needed to stop another genocide, while others argued that any use of force was immoral, and that there were better ways &#150; such as the use of economic sanctions &#150; to bring Yugoslav strongman Slobodan Milosevic around to our way of thinking.
<P>

  Today, I doubt that those positions are real alternatives. While I'm not convinced that economic sanctions can be called "weapons of mass destruction," it's clear that their consequences are just as deadly and far more indiscriminate than cruise missiles and smart bombs. Rather than attacking a tyrant's military capability, economic sanctions &#150; with a logic that targets victims better than any heat-seeking missile ever could &#150; take deadly aim at civilians.
<P>

  More than 80 years ago, President Woodrow Wilson pointed out just how powerful economic sanctions could be. "The one who chooses this economic, peaceful, quiet lethal remedy will not have to resort to force," he said with Jules Verne-like clairvoyance. "Instead, (it) subjects that country to a pressure that, in my view, no modern country can withstand."
<P>

  Wilson may have foreseen the use of boycotts, but he overestimated their effects. The United States has, over the course of recent history, used boycotts and sanctions against countries like North Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Libya, Yugoslavia and most pointedly, Iraq. Yet in each case, these tools of economic warfare &#150; which require so little reflection before being used &#150; have decimated the poor, the elderly and children of these countries while creating the moral high ground on which totalitarian rulers continue to stand. Sanctions simply don't make such people holler "uncle."
<P>

  To make this point, one only need examine the frustrating case in Iraq, where sanctions have been in place since the end of Operation Desert Storm in 1991. After driving the Iraqi army out of Kuwait, a U.S.-led coalition effectively walled off the country, hoping that by squeezing the Iraqi people, they could foment a popular uprising against Saddam Hussein.
<P>

  Nine years later, George Bush is out of the White House, but Hussein still rules. Meanwhile, more than 1.5 million Iraqi citizens have died as a result of the sanction's hardships, which include food and water shortages, lack of basic medicines to fight common diseases such as whooping cough, measles and mumps, and the near-complete destruction of Iraq's civilian infrastructure, from electricity to sanitation facilities.
<P>

  A recent report by former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark cites the deadly toll of the sanctions. Deaths of children under 5 to diseases like diarrhea and malnutrition have increased more than tenfold since sanctions began, from 7,110 deaths annually to 73,572. Low-birth-weight babies now make up one quarter of all live births in Iraq.
<P>

  Surprisingly, the most vocal opponents to Iraqi sanctions are American and British experts who were appointed to oversee arms inspections and the oil-for-food program in Iraq. Denis Halliday, the former U.N. oil-for-food chief, quit his post after 13 months, calling the sanctions a "totally bankrupt" concept.
<P>

  "It doesn't impact on governance effectively and instead it damages the innocent people of the country," Halliday told Reuters news agency, ending a 30-year career with the United Nations. He said that "Four thousand to 5,000 children (are) dying unnecessarily every month . . . because of the breakdown of water and sanitation, inadequate diet and the bad internal health situation."
<P>

  Scott Ritter, the American arms expert who headed the UNSCOM inspection team, is no less critical. He says that economic sanctions have not only failed to dislodge Hussein, but they also obstruct efforts to track Iraq's weapons programs.
<P>

  "If the United States is serious about disarming Iraq," Ritter writes in the current issue of "Arms Control Today," it should "formulate a policy that results in the rapid reintroduction of meaningful, monitoring-based weapons inspection into Iraq. That will require the lifting, not merely the suspension, of sanctions."
<P>

  In the weeks since President Clinton engineered his China trade victory, commentators on both the left and the right have suggested that the boycott against Cuba has outlived its usefulness. Similarly, the United States just this week eased near-total sanctions against North Korea that have been in place for 50 years.
<P>

  Clinton, ever in search of a legacy, could make an important mark in foreign affairs by abolishing the use of economic sanctions as a weapon against already impoverished nations, once and for all. He ought to have learned that ending ineffective sanctions doesn't confer approval upon dictators like Milosevic or Hussein, but it could give the innocent children of Iraq and Yugoslavia a better chance of surviving.
