WILL THE DEMOCRATS insist that George W. Bush, as a minority president, govern from the center? Or will Bush just roll over them?
<P>
<P>The early signs are not encouraging. In the post-election posturing,  Republicans created the presumption that Bush had won and that any  demand for a complete recount was illegitimate. They did this, it is  now  clear, mainly by shouting louder and outmaneuvering the  Democrats.
<P>
<P>Now, the four-year sequel. Bush is acting as if he had won in a landslide. The Republican far right made angry noises when the first  appointments, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, went to relative  moderates. So when former Senator John Ashcroft was named  attorney general, the press dutifully reported that this appointment was  necessary  to appease the Republican right. But what about appeasing the 52  percent of Americans who voted for a progressive candidate and  the 50   Democratic senators?
<P>
<P>The one good thing about this nomination is that it is so bad,  it  may actually rouse Democrats from their torpor. Ashcroft is not  just a  sworn enemy of Roe v. Wade and reproductive choice. He was one  of  three co-sponsors of the Human Life Amendment, which,  astoundingly,  defines life as beginning not just conception, but at fertilization. The   amendment would make illegal not just abortions, but IUDs and birth   control pills.
<P>
<P>Ashcroft is a darling of the religious right. His record on church-state issues is abysmal. He gets a 100 percent rating from the  Christian  Coalition, while National Journal ranks him as the most  conservative  member of the Senate. He ranks at the bottom on environmental  issues, receiving a zero rating from the League of Conservation  Voters.
<P>
<P>Among other key votes, Ashcroft voted against extension   of  employment discrimination laws, against legislation to ban assault  weapons and to require trigger locks, against hate crimes laws. He  accepted an honorary degree from racist Bob Jones University. He singlehandedly blocked the nomination of Ronnie White to  the  federal bench. White, a member of the Missouri Supreme Court, is  African-American. Until Ashcroft weighed in, White had cleared the  Senate Judiciary Committee, 15-3, with a majority of Republican  senators  voting in favor.
<P>
<P>In persuading the Republican Caucus to block the nomination, Ashcroft criticized a handful of White's votes to reverse criminal   convictions or death penalty cases. But in fact, White's record was  comparable to the rest of the Missouri court, including Republican  appointees.
<P>
<P>Supporters of Ashcroft are trying to depict opponents as   painting  Ashcroft as a racist. So if they can refute that charge, Ashcroft  should  be home free.
<P>
<P>But hold on. Ashcroft would be the nation's top law-enforcement  officer, and his record on a broad range of law-enforcement issues  is  far-fringe. Democrats, you would think,  would  be lining up to block Ashcroft. But no. One Democrat, New Jersey  Senator Robert Torricelli (also the first to suggest Gore concede) is  on  record in favor. Exactly none is on record in opposition.
<P>
<P>Why not? First, Democrats want the confirmation process to be fair.  They want to wait for evidence. But of course the man's record is  an  open book.
<P>
<P>Second, John Ashcroft is a fellow senator, a member of the   club.  Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin liberal, serves with him on a key  subcommittee and finds him a congenial colleague. James Jeffords, a  moderate Republican from Vermont, sings with Ashcroft in a  Senate  choral quartet.
<P>
<P>Third, Democrats don't want to oppose unless they are sure they can win, which sets up a chicken and egg problem. It takes just  41 senators to block, but 41 must be willing to block. The Senate  includes 50  Democrats, and five moderate Republicans, two of whom are prochoice women, Senators Snowe and Collins of Maine.
<P>
<P>Finally, there is the general convention that a president has a  right to  name his Cabinet, barring disclosures of personal impropriety. But  this  president and this nomination are different.
<P>
<P>Bush lost the popular vote. He basically stole the White House because his lawyers outfoxed the Democrats' legitimate demand for a recount. The  attorney general is no ordinary cabinet position, since this official  enforces the nation's laws and passes on all proposed appointments to  the federal courts. Nor is this a mainstream nominee.
<P>
<P>Bush should be accorded all the usual perquisites of an incoming  president - as long as he appoints moderates. Ashcroft is an extremist.  If  the Senate Democrats fail to block this appalling nomination, they will spend the next four years getting trampled and they will deserve to. But  the rest of us will pay the price.
