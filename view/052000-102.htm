NEW YORK - Hot on the heels of its acquisition of Viacom, the Columbia
Broadcasting System announced today that it has merged with the
government of Colombia.  
<P>

"This opens the Latin American market to our primetime programming,"
declared Lawrence Tisch, CBS's ecstatic CEO.  "At last, my Colombian
amigos will discover why Everybody Loves Raymundo and the joy of being
Touched By An Angel."  
<P>

Colombian President Andrés Pastrana was equally enthused.  "My
government's propaganda themes will carry great weight when coming from
the mouths of respected journalists such as Dan Rather and Mike
Wallace," he said.  "The days of Colombians begging and pleading for
every last billion in U.S. military aid are over."
<P>

Tisch said CBS would bow to Latin sensitivities and adopt the Spanish
spelling of Colombia.  The new behemoth will call itself Colombia
Government BS. 
<P>

Tisch and Pastrana expect swift FTC approval.  "After all," said
Pastrana, "it was the Clinton administration - in particular, Drug Czar
Barry McCaffrey - that brought us together."  
<P>

With his stern countenance and close-cropped hair, McCaffrey appears an
unlikely Cupid.  In fact, he's played matchmaker for years, fixing up
pretty-but-poor media outlets with the big-spending Office of National
Drug Control Policy.  The result has been beautiful, mutually rewarding
relationships and the delivery of an important message to teens:  Stay
away from dangerous drugs (except for the ones heavily advertised in the
media).  
<P>

"Last summer I was alarmed by the growing strength of Colombia's Marxist
rebels," said McCaffrey.  Working with key Colombian generals, he
developed a public relations campaign to persuade the U.S. Congress and
public to triple military aid to the potentially oil-rich nation.
<P>
  
"The idea," said McCaffrey, "was to play up the drug war and play down
the civil war, portray the guerrillas as 'narcoterrorists' by
exaggerating their role in and take from the drug trade, and keep quiet
about official drug corruption and army ties to paramilitary death
squads."
<P>

A tall order.  "I expected cooperation from the U.S. media - which we've
gotten - but I doubted that would be enough," said the drug czar.  "What
we really needed was a network of our own."
<P>

When McCaffrey saw a news item in July about CBS's low ratings and lower
profits, he immediately phoned Tisch and explained how the network could
reap a Latin windfall.  Tisch was all aglow, and he asked the drug czar
to arrange a meeting with Pastrana.  But Pastrana played hard to get,
saying he first wanted to see how CBS could help Colombia before he'd
agree to talk marriage.
<P>

Tisch dispatched news anchor Dan Rather to Bogotá with orders to make
Pastrana's day.  Using such time-honored techniques as reliance on
official sources and repetition of disinformation as fact, Rather did
just that.  
<P>

"Dan's stories were a godsend," said Pastrana.  "The propaganda was all
the more effective for having come from a seemingly independent
'reporter.'"  
<P>

Next, Tisch sent <i>60 Minutes</i> tough guy Mike Wallace to glorify the
Colombian president.  The resultant December 5 puff profile put the aid
proposal on the fast track and Pastrana in the mood to deal. 
Negotiations ensued, culminating in the accord signed today.
<P>

The industry has taken notice.  Fox and Disney-ABC have intensified
their wooing of China, and CNN top dog Ted Turner reportedly has the
hots for the Virgin Islands.
<P>

Back at the news division of Colombia Government BS, any initial merger
misgivings quickly subsided when Rather and company learned they would
be "double dippers," drawing fat salaries both as journalists and
official spinners.
<P>

"I'm just doing what I've always done:  putting white hats on our guys,
black hats on theirs," said Rather.  "It's the contras and the
Sandinistas all over again - only now I'm getting my just reward.  When
you serve two masters, you should get paid by two masters."
<P>

"The business of news is business," said Wallace.  "And business is
good."
