Like most people, I generally spend my money as I please--it's called "consumer sovereignty." If I opt for Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream because the company is environment-friendly, that is my choice, my right. Likewise, if I loathe the thugs who run Burma and the companies that help prop up its regime, I am free to deny them my consumer dollars.  

  
<P>The Supreme Court is about to decide whether the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has the same right to spend its money as it pleases, and to simply refuse to do business with Burma--or with companies that do business in that country. If an ordinary consumer is generally "sovereign" in the marketplace, why isn't a state consumer likewise sovereign?</P>
<P>The case posing this question, Natsios v. National Foreign Trade Council, is to be argued before the high court on Wednesday. At issue is the 1996 Massachusetts Burma Act, which condemns Burma's abysmal human rights record and all but prohibits state government purchases from companies operating there. Business groups successfully attacked the law in lower courts, and last month the Justice Department weighed in on their side.</P>
<P>We have seen this kind of law before: In the 1980s, public entities all over America boycotted South Africa's apartheid regime. Lawsuits challenged some of the divestment efforts, but none of these cases reached the Supreme Court. Thus, the Massachusetts case will establish the legal framework for every state deciding what to buy and from whom.</P>
<P>In essence, the Justice Department is now arguing (contrary to its position in the mid-1980s) that state government boycotts are illegal because only the federal government has the right to conduct America's foreign affairs. This sounds persuasive at first, but the legal arguments advanced by the feds and the business groups dissolve on closer inspection.</P>
<P>First, they claim that Massachusetts is usurping Congress's express constitutional power to "regulate commerce with foreign nations." But Massachusetts isn't "regulating" anything; it is choosing how to spend its own money, just as any private citizen may do. When I refuse to buy, say, shoes made in Burma, I am not "regulating" anything in any ordinary sense of the word, and the same is true when consumer decisions are made by IBM Corp. or by Mass. Inc. Thus, there is no unconstitutional burden on foreign commerce here--there is only commerce itself, which generally includes both the right to buy and the right not to buy. The case would be different if a state required its residents to boycott Burmese goods--that would be regulation--but Massachusetts has done no such thing.</P>
<P>The feds argue that the issue is somehow different if a consumer decision is motivated by a desire to influence the supplier: If Massachusetts thinks Burmese goods are shoddy, it can shun them, but not if it thinks they are morally tainted. This is screwy economic theory--generally, I can buy whatever ice cream brand I like, whether I like it because of its taste, its logo, or its company's reputation. Economics aside, where does the Constitution say that states are free to be picky and selfish, but not to be altruistic or noble?</P>
<P>The Justice Department also claims that the state statute conflicts with, and thus is nullified by, a 1996 federal law regarding Burma. But nowhere does that law say that consumers cannot boycott Burma; it doesn't speak to the ordinary consumption issue. Rather, the federal law, as put into effect by Clinton in 1997, is itself a sanctions measure: It prohibits any new investment in Burma by U.S. companies. The federal act is anti-Burma. So is the Massachusetts act. Where's the conflict?</P>
<P>Granted, Congress has broad power to restrict the sovereignty of consumers (and states). Thus, federal civil rights laws tell public and private employers that they may not spend their money entirely as they please; for example, they cannot simply refuse to hire black workers. Congress may also have the power to impose special rules on states beyond what it imposes on ordinary consumers. But if Congress wants to do that, it must say so in clear statutory language, so that affected states can consider lobbying against the bill. The Massachusetts boycott was in effect when Congress acted in 1996, yet not one word in the federal statute is directly aimed at state boycotts. Nor has any later federal law addressed the issue.</P>
<P>Things might be different if Burma were some special U.S. ally, like Israel. Where close allies are involved, the federal government does more than pass statutes; it also adopts treaties of friendship and cooperation. A state boycott of such an ally would arguably contradict the friendship premise and thus violate the treaties' spirit. But even if alliance treaties are read broadly to limit states, the Constitution has a mechanism to protect state interests: Instead of a simple majority, a proposed treaty must win the votes of two-thirds of the Senate, the body the Framers designed to safeguard states' rights. In any event, Burma is no Israel.</P>
<P>The federal brief's final argument is that, in foreign affairs, the United States must "speak with one voice" and the Massachusetts law creates cacophony. If a state boycott offends some foreign government, that government might retaliate against America as a whole, dragging the country into an international crisis. But this "one voice" argument wrongly presupposes that the Massachusetts law contradicts the foreign policy of the United States. Here, we have no explicit federal statute, no treaty--not even a clear statement from the president--saying that consumers must be deprived of their freedoms so that America can make nice with the goon squad that runs Burma.</P>
<P>But the "one voice" argument has a much deeper problem. Taken literally, it offends the very basis of our system of government. Americans emphatically do not speak with one voice. Individual Americans are free to criticize foreign governments, even if they thereby offend intolerant regimes that end up blaming all Americans. States, too, must be free to speak out. This vital point was established early in American history, when the Virginia and Kentucky legislatures famously spoke out in 1798 against federal policies penalizing France. There are, of course, regimes in today's world where only one voice is permitted: Burma is one of them, and we must not allow their totalitarianism to invade our democracy.</P>
<P>So Massachusetts must remain free to condemn Burma in its statute books even if this makes life a little harder for the State Department. But if Massachusetts may speak out, why can't it put its money where its mouth is? Here, Massachusetts's money is a form of speech, communicating its condemnation in a dramatically expressive way. Alongside freedom of speech is freedom of association, which includes the right not to associate. Here, the state is simply disassociating itself from business partners it finds offensive.</P>
<P>If all this is so, why did the lower courts rule against Massachusetts? Perhaps because today's judicial liberals dislike broad arguments for states' rights, and today's judicial conservatives distrust sweeping assertions of human rights. Both kind of rights are at issue here--but with a twist.</P>
<P>In several recent cases, judges have invoked states' rights to defend states' wrongs, allowing state governments to violate fundamental freedoms with impunity. For example, the Supreme Court recently held that even when states break federal laws, injured citizens may not sue to recover money damages. Other judges have sharply resisted this trend; indeed most of the court's recent federalism cases have been decided by 5 to 4 votes.</P>
<P>These battles may have discombobulated lower court judges in Natsios, because states' rights and human rights actually work together in this case. Thus, it offers the high court an excellent occasion to cure some of the confusion that now reigns by reminding us that the Framers designed federalism to promote freedom (of speech and of choice), not undermine it.</P>
<P>Perhaps it is no coincidence that this lesson is illuminated by a case from Massachusetts, the cradle of American liberty. In the early 17th century, Gov. John Winthrop imagined his Massachusetts Bay Colony as a light unto the world, a city upon a hill. In the late 18th century, Massachusetts patriots exercised their consumer sovereignty by boycotting certain goods--including tea imported by the morally unattractive East India Company.</P>
<P>In the mid-19th century, many Massachusetts citizens spoke out against slavery, and once again put their money where their mouths were, using their sovereign consumer dollars to ransom slaves while boycotting slave-made goods--all in an effort to influence the "slave power" that controlled the South. Today, the slave power has lost its grip in America, but its heirs are alive and well in Burma. And again, Massachusetts is speaking and spending--and not spending--on behalf of freedom.</P>
<P>Like me, or any other American consumer, a state should have broad freedom to spend its money as it pleases. Congress, by passing laws or ratifying treaties, may restrict that freedom, but federal bureaucrats--acting on their own or in league with business groups--may not. Lower federal courts and the Justice Department have veered off course, and it is time for the Supreme Court to set them straight.</P>
