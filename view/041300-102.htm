<p>It feels oddly like being at a wake in a
        funeral home. Our four delegation members whisper
        together as we wait to tour the Al Mansour Children's
        wing at the Saddam City Medical Centre. The Director is
        away, so someone has been sent to find a senior doctor to
        brief us. As I flip open my diary, it dawns on me that at
        this time four years ago, March 1996, the first Voices in
        the Wilderness delegation visited Iraq. 30 delegations
        later not much has changed within this hospital. What
        must the doctors and nurses think as one delegation after
        another hears the litany of shortages and views the dying
        the children? 
<p>When a doctor finally enters the office,
        my grim mood lifts immediately; it's Dr. Qusay Al Rahim,
        of whom I've spoken so often, to so many groups in the
        U.S. My companions meeting him for the first time will
        probably feel the same warmth towards him as I, and hold
        him in the same esteem. He draws forth a sense that we're
        working, in concert, to solve intractable problems, that
        even little gains, in the face of ridiculous odds, are
        rewarding. I wonder how he maintains his quiet,
        indomitable strength. </p>
        <p>Two years ago, when I first met him, he solicitously
        accompanied us up to his ward, apologising for the
        elevator that didn't work, the hallways that were dark
        because they had no light bulbs. Suddenly he raced away
        in response to a furore down the hall. Hospital visitors
        were shouting for help at the bedside of Feryal, a
        7-month-old baby, whose mother was sobbing frantically.
        Feryal had just suffered a cardiac arrest. Dr. Qusay
        swiftly bent over her and administered mouth-to-mouth
        resuscitation. Feryal's heart gave out in a fight against
        malnourishment plus septicaemia &#151; full body
        infection. The hospital lacked both the nutrients and the
        antibiotics this little one desperately needed. I watched
        Dr. Qusay face the anguished mother to pronounce the
        verdict, &#147;I am sorry, but your child cannot live. We
        have not the oxygen, we have not the tube.&#148; How many
        times, since then, has Dr. Qusay felt shattered, having
        to speak tragic words to disbelieving parents? </p>
        <p>Now he is explaining to us that in a very real way he
        thinks we are all fathers and mothers to these children,
        that it's a challenge to invent new ways to help them.
        And when something works, &#147;well, you see, this keeps
        you hopeful.&#148; He carefully details some of the
        greatest problems they presently face &#151; they've run
        out of high protein biscuits formerly supplied by UNICEF
        and they lack immunisations for MMR (measles, mumps and
        rubella). Actually, sufficient batches of the vaccine
        arrive, but electrical outages interfere with proper
        storage, damaging the vaccines. So far, his tone has been
        that of a kindly teacher, one who wants us to understand.
        </p>
        <p>But then he lowers his head and shakes it back and
        forth several times. &#147;We had a terrible tragedy
        recently. Our incubators are old and broken down, but
        some we try to repair. We placed an infant inside a
        patched incubator, thinking it would work, but the
        sealant was faulty, and the baby grew very cold. In fact,
        we lost that baby.&#148; </p>
        <p>I jot down in my notebook, &#147;Incubators &#151;
        mom!!&#148; Shortly before the Gulf War began, I applied
        to join the Gulf Peace Team, a non-violent, non-aligned
        encampment that would position itself on the border
        between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, between the warring
        parties. The organisers placed me on a waiting list. To
        my surprise, I learned that if I could be in Boston in
        two days, I could join a U.S. contingent leaving on a
        plane that would be the last to land in Baghdad before
        the bombing began. I had just enough time for a hurried
        visit to my parents. Of course, they tried their hardest
        to dissuade me from going. As I flew out their door, the
        last thing I heard was my mother calling out, in her
        thick Irish brogue, &#147;What about the incubators?!
        Kathy, what about the incubators?!&#148; </p>
        <p>She was referring to testimony from Nayireh, a young
        Kuwaiti girl, who told the U.S. Congress that she had
        witnessed invading Iraqi soldiers barge into a Kuwaiti
        hospital and steal the equipment. With luminous eyes and
        a compelling presence, she told of her horror as she
        watched the menacing soldiers dump babies out of
        incubators. Months later, when the war was a distant
        memory, reporters learned that &#147;Nayireh&#148; was
        actually the daughter of a Kuwaiti emir, that doctors in
        Kuwait could not corroborate her testimony, that in fact
        the supposedly stolen incubators had been placed
        carefully in storage during the invasion, and that the
        Hill and Knowlton Public Relations firm had rehearsed
        with the young woman how to give apparently false
        testimony effectively. </p>
        <p>The Desert Storm bombardment destroyed Iraq's
        electrical grid. Refrigeration units, sewage and
        sanitation facilities, and all sorts of valuable
        equipment were ruined. Life-saving devices found in a
        modern hospital were rendered useless. As the Allied
        bombing went on and on, my mother's question became more
        and more relevant, yet went largely unasked. &#147;What
        about the incubators?&#148; </p>
        <p>Now, when our teams visit Iraq, following nine and a
        half years of the most comprehensive state of siege ever
        imposed in modern history, we see incubators, broken and
        irreparable, stacked up against the walls of hospital
        obstetrics wards. Sanctions have prevented Iraqis from
        importing new incubators and from getting needed spare
        parts to repair old ones. And this is only one vitally
        needed item that sanctions prohibit. </p>
        <p>Dr. Qusay's heroism is commendable. Earnest as ever,
        he tells us of other methods he wants to pursue, in the
        wake of the tragedy incurred by an irreparable incubator.
        &#147;I have heard about, maybe you know it, the kangaroo
        method and this they do in Australia. I tell the mothers
        of tiny infants to try it. They can place the baby
        between their breasts and wrap themselves in a garment
        and this may keep the baby warm enough. Or I tell them to
        try to find gauze and cellophane and with this they might
        recreate conditions like an incubator. You see, we must
        invent and try to cope.&#148; </p>
        <p>I wonder what would happen if Dr. Qusay testified
        before Congress as Nayireh did 10 years ago. Would we
        respond with the same moral outrage now that such actions
        are American policy? Would we mobilise to end sanctions
        with the same fervour that drove us to destroy Iraq, and
        its incubators and its babies? Now, as then, any mother,
        Kuwaiti or Iraqi can tell you child sacrifice is wrong. </p>
