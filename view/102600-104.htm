With time running out in the Presidential campaign and a number of
key states slipping away from Gore, the Gore political machine has decided
to go on the offensive against Ralph Nader.  After months of ignoring Nader
and his progressive anti-corporate and pro-social justice agenda, Gore's
allies have begun to engage in the worst sort of fear-mongering in the
hopes of herding wayward liberals back into fold.  Instead of acknowledging
how Gore's actions and words since August and before as part of the Clinton
Administration have undermined Gore's chances, these supporters are trying
to blame Nader for the flaws they fail to see in their own candidate.
<p>In their arrogance, Gore's operatives blithely predicted at the
time of the Democratic convention that Nader would not be a factor by
October.  With the aid of the corporate media and the rigged Presidential
Debates Commission, everything was done to keep Nader's message from being
heard.  Although the message did attract a following through massive
rallies and Green Party grass-roots organizing, the Gore campaign continued
to focus on those issues believed to be critical to winning over the middle
class suburban voter.  In the process, Gore demonstrated once again his
contempt for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.  Now, he has
called upon the spokespeople for that wing from Gloria Steinem to Jesse
Jackson to John Sweeny to come to his aid in denouncing Nader as a stalking
horse for Bush.
<p>A quick review of the Gore campaign and his performance in the
debates should make clear that Gore has been the primary cause of his
wavering support.  The first obvious undermining of his base was the
selection of Senator Joseph Lieberman, another dreary Democratic Leadership
Council conservative who has excited the right more than the left.
Moreover, Lieberman's hardline position on the middle east raised the
obvious concerns of the Arab-American community (a key constituency in
Michigan), leading to the endorsement of Bush by the Arab-American PAC. Had
Gore selected Jesse Jackson as his running-mate, he probably could have
prevented this defection and shored up his support among African-Americans
and progressives.
<p>After a brief rhetorical nod at the convention to labor and the
Democratic Rainbow Coalition, Gore headed off in search of that illusive
"centrist" constituency, a constituency made up of affluent suburbanite
soccer moms and middle class white males.  This latter group has not given
its majority support for a Democratic Presidential candidate since Lyndon
Johnson.  Having proven that he had nothing to offer working class voters
concerned about unfair trade, unfair labor laws, and the lack of universal
health care, Gore went into the debates assuming his debating skills would
demonstrate an intellectual prowess that would wow the viewers.  Instead,
his smarmy style and policy-wonkiness on arcane and narrow issues only
further alienated voters who abandoned both the debate tv viewing audience
and the Gore campaign.
<p>Where Gore might have taken the opportunity to offer a real
alternative to Bush that could have mobilized disaffected and progressive
voters, he again managed to prove that there were more similarities than
differences between himself and Bush on a vast array of issues.  To wit:
<p>Gore quickly agreed with Bush on the crass and discredited argument
that deterrence was the main reason why the death penalty should remain.
In the face of irrefutable evidence of the discriminatory and flawed
character of the death penalty, Gore's political cowardice has made him
anathema to many social justice advocates.
<p>Gore tried to outbid Bush on ways of throwing money at the
Pentagon.  In the face of a 300 billion giveaway that has confounded even
some former military leaders, Gore's Reaganesque pro-military positions and
his support for unilateral intervention in a variety of hot spots have
driven away significant sectors of the peace movement.
<p>Gore and Bush continued to agree on keeping in place the insane and
failed war on drugs, a war that has contributed to victimizing even further
young and poor African-Americans and Latinos.  Is it any surprise that Gore
is having difficulty reaching this disaffected and disadvantaged segment of
the African-American and Latino community?  (It should be noted, however,
that close to 13% of African-American males have been disenfranchised
because of criminal convictions, stemming primarily from the racial
profiling evident in the war on drugs.)
<p>Gore tried to outmuscle Bush on his foreign policy, showing his
utter disregard for Palestinian rights and the lives of Iraqi children and
disappointing once more significant sectors of the Arab-American community.
<p>Of course, Gore has tried to reassure feminists that he is
pro-choice and gays and lesbians that he would support hate-crime
legislation.  Yet, why has it taken the Clinton-Gore Administration so long
to bring RU-486 to market and why was this done right on the eve of the
election?  Why does Gore still advocate a "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy
that has led to even more discrimination and violence against gays and
lesbians in the military?
<p>Gore apparently does not have to answer for this or for his support
of punitive welfare "reform" legislation that has created more difficulties
for poor women and, especially, HIV positive impoverished males.  Moreover,
by claiming he is for campaign finance reform, Gore has tried to cover-up
the massive corporate corruption and control of the Democratic Party and
his campaign.  Since Gore is more than a willing shill for corporate
globalization through his support of the WTO and other undemocratic
transnational associations, it should not be suprising that many find him
to be a rank opportunist and liar.
<p>It is true that Nader has made important policy statements
concerning the rights of labor (endorsing a living wage, urging the repeal
of Taft-Hartley, and attacking the WTO and NAFTA), establishing universal
health care, reducing military spending, protecting the environment, ending
corporate welfare while promoting the general welfare, providing social
justice for racial and sexual minorities, and seeking campaign finance and
electoral reforms.  Obviously, these positions have attracted many people
who have taken the time and effort to educate themselves away from the
restrictive reporting of the corporate media.  	Yet, Gore and his campaign
staff have only themselves to blame for their miserable electioneering and
faltering support.  That they now have to rely on progressive surrogates to
scold Nader for his temerity at providing a real alternative is a sad
commentary on how frightened Gore and his institutional backers are that
they may have frittered away the election.
