Gemma Martinez remembers how she and her husband Abel would put their three children to bed and then talk late into the night about the future. They would leave Mexico City for the United States, work hard and buy a home. But things change. A year and a half later, Martinez is a hard-working widow in East Palo Alto, still full of hope, but far from her dreams.
<P>

As contract negotiations for Bay Area janitors go into their final round today and talk of ``strike'' fills the air, life for some 5,500 workers and their families may get worse before it gets better.
<P>

The hours are rotten, the pay is low. Five days a week, Martinez leaves her three school-aged children in the care of relatives to clean cubicles, empty wastebaskets, mop and vacuum on two floors at the campus of software giant Oracle Corp. in Redwood City. Her ride for the graveyard shift arrives around 7 p.m. and she doesn't return home until 4:30 a.m., in time to catch a few winks before getting the kids ready for school.
<P>

``I never imagined things would be so difficult here, but the children will have opportunities they wouldn't have if we stayed in Mexico,'' said Martinez, 34. ``At least they won't be janitors.''
<P>
   
Demanding that Silicon Valley firms ``share the wealth,'' Martinez and other members of Local 1877 in the Service Employees International Union are closely watching the outcome of today's negotiations. The master contract that covers the estimated 75 percent of Bay Area janitors expired Wednesday. No matter how long talks go today, by Saturday the workers will vote whether to accept the maintenance contractors' final offer or walk out.
<P>

<font size="3"><b>Janitors' contract demand<SNML_DECK></SNML_DECK></b><SNML_DECK><br>
They want raise, medical benefits </SNML_DECK></font><FONT SIZE=+1><SNML_DECK></SNML_DECK></FONT>
<P>

 In a valley where millionaires are fast becoming pass&eacute; and where stock options and a BMW Z3 are virtually assumed to be the birthright of every techie, the janitors say they're not demanding much. They want a three-year contract, with annual pay hikes of $1.30 and medical benefits fully paid by the employers. They now make between $7.64 and $8.04 an hour.
<P>

   Wednesday, the firms improved their first offer proposing a four-year contract and a 50-cent raise the first year, followed by 40 cents the next three years. The offer would cover only current union members and not new hires, creating a two-tier system that's unacceptable, union officials said.<B> </B>The San Francisco Employers Council, which represents the 12 largest contractors that employ the janitors, has declined to comment.
<P>

   Martinez works for the janitorial firm Service by Medallion, but also indirectly for one of the richest men in the world, Oracle founder Larry Ellison. She earns $8.04 an hour, the average janitor's wage in Silicon Valley and East Bay. Her annual salary comes to $16,723, putting her below the poverty line in Santa Clara County, where social services defines poor as an income below $17,052 for a family of four.
<P>

   <B> </B>``People around here.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they drive new cars, they take vacations and spend so much money on fun things,'' said Martinez, a soft-spoken, petite woman who smiles often. ``They would be horrified if they could only imagine our lives.''
<P>

   In many ways, Martinez's life is typical of janitors in the area. Most work two jobs, sacrificing time with their families. The average janitor's household, with both parents working, logs 104 hours per week, according to a survey conducted by the union. To afford rent, many families team up to share apartments and even garages. In nearly one-third of janitors' households, children must sleep in the living room. Like Martinez, many can't afford cars.
<P>

   Martinez's family is one of three sharing a three-bedroom house in East Palo Alto. She pays $450 for a bedroom, just big enough to fit two double beds. She's proudly decorated the walls with certificates of her children's academic achievements. At one end, she's hung a curtain so they can dress with some privacy.<B> </B>The one thing they don't lack is a computer, which was loaned by the children's school. 
<P>

   Her take-home pay is $1,050 a month, half of which goes to rent and utilities. The rest pays for clothing, food and expenses, such as the $50 that goes to a co-worker who drives her to work and back.
<P>

   `We're not asking for much,'' said Martinez. ``It's very little. I just want a bigger room for me and the children, maybe even one with our own bathroom.''
<P>

   Martinez says she doesn't understand why a company as big and powerful as Oracle, which logged profits of $1.3 billion last year, doesn't intervene to help struggling workers. Oracle says janitors like Martinez aren't Oracle employees. ``It's an issue between the janitors and their contractors,'' said Jennifer Glass, Oracle's spokeswoman.
<P>

   That's a technicality to Martinez and other janitors. ``I clean the offices for Oracle, not the offices of Medallion.'' Medallion, the company that's the direct employer of Martinez, didn't return phone calls to its San Jose office.
<P>

   Workers at the lowest stratum of the valley remain largely invisible. Many rotate in and out as temporary workers, or are hired through contractors, as are cafeteria staff and janitors. The sought-after perks for these workers are health insurance, sick days and an hourly salary that's more than a single digit.
<P>

   ``The people who are working in the cafeterias, people who clean the bathrooms inside high-tech companies aren't the highest priorities,'' said Benita Kenn, an independent public relations consultant who specializes in high tech. ``Large companies, whether they're in high tech or or anything else, look at what's the primary impact to their business first. And that's not who cleans their bathrooms.''
<P>

   <SNML_HEADLINES>
<H1><font size="3">Self-sufficiency to a point</font></H1>
<font size="3">Entrepreneurism is no social cure-all</font>
<P>

 Known for its libertarian attitudes and pride in meritocracy, many in the high-tech ranks believe in self-sufficiency, a notion that's fundamental to entrepreneurialism and innovation in Silicon Valley. Such beliefs, social commentators say, falls short when applied toward social problems. ``The attitude in the valley that anyone should be able to start his own company and become a millionaire if they tried hard enough simply doesn't apply to everyone,'' said Kirk O. Hanson, senior lecturer in business ethics at Stanford Business School.
<P>

   Martinez, in some ways, has bootstrapped herself as much as someone in her situation can. She enrolled in an English class shortly after arriving. But after six months, she dropped the classes to work a second job two days a week, cleaning homes after her night shift. On those days, she'll be awake<B> </B>and working<B> </B>for 22 hours.
<P>

   <B> </B>With money so tight, Martinez admits she's scared of the prospect of a strike. In Mexico she was also a janitor, cleaning the subways. Five years ago, when she and her fellow workers went on strike for 15 days, they resorted to begging on the streets to feed their families.
<P>

   Union organizers here have assured workers they won't go hungry. It's preparing to make a $2 million fund available to help striking workers pay rent and feed their families. It's also hooked up with local community and religious groups to set up food banks.
<P>

   Still, Martinez is worried. She says her relatives will help but she knows life is unpredictable.
<P>

   Just two years ago, she was married to a Mexico City police officer. Though they also owned a tiny neighborhood grocery store, they wanted better opportunities for their children. So they sold their store, tapped their savings and made plans. Martinez arrived in Silicon Valley with the children first. Abel had only weeks to go until he was vested in his pension plan and would soon follow.
<P>

   Just 15 days after she arrived in Silicon Valley, Abel was killed while on duty. She didn't have enough money to go back for his funeral.
<P>

   ``It sometimes feels like a dream. A nightmare, actually. But what can you do?''
<P>

   She's too proud to admit that they're poor. But she knows it. They shop at second-hand stores for most things. Her brother and sister-in-law routinely buy their food because Martinez can't afford it.
<P>

   ``When janitors talk about justice and dignity, it's precisely things like being able to buy clothing for your family, spending time with your children, taking your kids out to do something fun,'' said Blanca Gallegos, a union spokeswoman. ``These are things someone else wouldn't consider luxuries but for janitors they are luxuries.''
<P>

   Martinez has little time to spend with 7-year-old Abel, 9-year-old Elvira and 10-year-old Victor each day, getting them ready for school in the mornings and feeding them before she leaves for work in the evening. She sometimes calls them around their bedtime to make sure they're tucked in. Elvira sometimes cradles a photo of her mother in bed with her.
<P>

   ``Sometimes the kids will say, `Mommy, let's go out and play.' If I say no, they say, `You don't love me anymore.' I try to explain it to them. But they're children, they don't understand.''
<P>

   <B> </B>At a recent Saturday meeting, union officials updated workers on the negotiations and prepared them for the realities of a strike. 
<P>

    By the end of the meeting, Martinez had volunteered to be a strike captain to help coordinate logistics.
<P>

   ``No one really wants a strike,'' said Martinez later. ``But it's the only way to pressure these companies so they realize there's value in our work. If we don't fight for it now, we'll never get ahead.''
