Tommy Thompson is busy cobbling together the Republican Party platform on
which his pal George W. Bush will seek the presidency this fall. While this
exciting task has taken Wisconsin's gallivanting governor to hot spots like
Billings and Dayton, it hasn't taken him outside the box.
<p>So far, the &quot;ideas'' that have been pitched at the platform hearings
have been about as predictable as those advanced in the platform-drafting
circles of the Democratic Party. Indeed, the once adventurous process of
platform writing has become such a cautious endeavor that even the candidates
dismiss the documents; remember the 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob
Dole's proud announcement that he didn't even plan to peruse his party's
official agenda, let alone campaign on its tenets?</p>
<p>Perhaps Thompson and his Democratic counterparts should take a cue from the
authors of the new platform of Washington state's Democratic Party. Delegates to
the party's mid-June convention were in a rambunctious mood -- as an example,
they booed Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, a prospective Democratic vice
presidential pick, for his nuclear policies. And they drew up a campaign canon
that made news.</p>
<p>Big news, as it turns out. &quot;Democrats take big step to left in their
platform,'' announced the headline in the Seattle Times.</p>
<p>In addition to affirming that &quot;food, shelter, medical care, education
and jobs are basic human rights,'' the delegates declared that they &quot;oppose
all discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations, military
service, insurance, licensing or education based on race, religion, age, sex,
sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, size, political affiliation,
and/or national origin.''</p>
<p>They came out for &quot;the creation of a single, universal, publicly funded,
accountable Washington state health care system including prenatal and
preventive care, hospital and ambulatory care, prescription drugs, vision and
hearing care, substance-abuse counseling and treatment, and funding for
confidential family planning and reproductive choice.''</p>
<p>The delegates backed complete separation of church and state, condemned
&quot;any law, regulation or government action restricting legal rights and
private matters regarding one's reproductive functions,'' and stated that
&quot;because marriage is a basic human right and individual personal choice,
the state should not interfere with same-gender couples who choose to marry and
share fully and equally in the rights, responsibilities and commitment of civil
marriage.''</p>
<p>In the criminal justice section of the platform, the delegates declared,
&quot;Prevention of crime is as important as reaction to crime. We believe that
government has the responsibility to help alleviate the social conditions which
contribute to crime.'' Of course, they opposed capital punishment -- this is a
civilized state, not Texas.</p>
<p>It was actually in the area of drug policy that the Washington state
Democrats really pushed the limits of contemporary politicking. &quot;We believe
drug use to be a concern for the medical community, not a criminal issue,'' they
declared, going on to state their full support for decriminalization of
marijuana.</p>
<p>A resolution adopted by a close vote of the convention went even further,
proposing that legalized marijuana be sold through cafes, bars and state liquor
stores with the tax money raised from the sales &quot;spent in the fulfillment
of health and human needs.''</p>
<p>Radical? Maybe. But no more radical than the reforms ordinary people talk
about all the time. And, say Washington state Democrats, they're betting that by
standing for positions that are controversial rather than cautious, they'll draw
thousands of disengaged citizens back to the polls. Says Party Chairman Paul
Berendt, the best way to get people to the polls is to give them a platform
designed to &quot;get people fired up.''
