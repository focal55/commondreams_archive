<p>Sometimes, it is important to think big.

<p>In an era where corporations trample across the globe with minimal
restraint, and citizen movements around the world are on their heels, it
is natural -- and necessary -- for those trying to check corporate power
to think defensively and, when they do reflect on affirmative proposals,
incrementally. 

<p>But it is important not to be overly constrained by the existing
balance of forces. If they are to engage, energize and mobilize large
numbers of people, citizen movements need to be animated by positive
visions, as well. And while there is a role for utopian outlines in
suggesting what society could be, even more important are concrete
medium-term proposals that suggest attainable aspirations and purposeful
direction.

<p>One would not ordinarily look to the U.S. Congress for such ideas, but two
members of the U.S. House of Representatives have stepped forward to offer
sweeping proposals to regulate U.S.-based multinational corporations'
global operations and to reorient the global economy to the pursuit of
sustainable development, not corporate greed.

<p>Representative Cynthia McKinney, D-Georgia, has introduced the Corporate
Code of Conduct Act (H.R. 4596) and
Representative Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, has introduced
the Global Sustainable Development Resolution (H.Res 479).

<p>"It is time we reclaim the global economy for the people who make it
work," insists McKinney, "and stop pandering to corporate interests who
build their empires on the backs of the innocent."

<p>"Corporate globalization is forcing men and women around the world to run
a destructive race to the bottom -- a competition in which workers,
communities and entire countries are forced to cut wages, environmental
protections, and social programs to attract footloose capital," says
Sanders.

<p>To address these ills, McKinney's bill would require all U.S.-based
corporations with more than 20 employees abroad to enact a code of
conduct. Significantly, the code also would apply to the companies'
subsidiaries, subcontractors, affiliates, joint ventures, partners, or
licensees -- meaning companies like Nike would not be able to disdain
responsibility for the practices of their subcontractors.

<p>The code would establish a floor for corporate behavior, requiring
companies in their overseas operations to: 

<p>* pay a living wage and ban specific practices, such as mandatory overtime
for workers under 18, pregnancy testing and retaliation against
whistleblowers;

<p>* respect identified international labor standards (including the right to
organize, minimum wage guarantees and protections for occupational safety
and health);

<p>* adhere to both international environmental standards and U.S. federal
environmental laws and regulations;

<p>* provide public documentation of where they are doing business directly
or through subsidiaries or contractors, and extensive information on
employment and environmental practices.

<p>The bill would enforce the code of conduct through two mechanisms. First,
the U.S. government would give preference to complying corporations in
contracts and in export assistance. The bill would include certification
and reporting requirements for companies, and would also establish an
investigative process, open to citizen initiation, to determine
compliance. Second, victims of violations of the bill -- including
non-U.S. citizens -- would be empowered to sue U.S. companies in U.S.
courts.

<p>The Sanders resolution covers more territory than the McKinney bill. It
too includes a corporate code of conduct, to be negotiated
internationally, that contains many of the principles included in the
McKinney bill. But the heart of the Sanders resolution addresses the
institutions regulating international commerce.

<p>One of the key mechanisms for developing its proposals is the creation of
U.S. and United Nations Commissions on the Global Economy. The U.S.
commission would hold town meetings and open hearings around the country
to investigate the effect of globalization on the workers, industry and
environment of the United States. The UN panel would both encourage other
nations to hold their own series of town meetings and would initiate a
global North-South dialogue aiming for negotiation of an international
agreement for global sustainable development.

<p>The provisions that the Sanders resolution seeks to have enacted through
global negotiation or U.S. mandate include:

<p>* a tax on international currency transactions, designed to stem financial
volatility;

<p>* creation of a global investment fund, to heighten demand and meet
pressing needs in developing countries;

<p>* cancellation of the debts of the poorest countries, with no structural
adjustment conditions (the package of Contract with America-style
deregulatiory conditions) attached;

<p>* a remaking of the World Bank, so that it ends support for destructive
megaprojects and instead supports development of poor countries' renewable
energy capacity and food security;

<p>* a shrinking of the International Monetary Fund; and

<p>* trade agreements that "remove labor and environmental rights and
conditions and social protections as factors of competition, such as by
international agreements to avoid competitive cuts in the social safety
nets" and guarantee "the right of nations and localities to plan for local
economic development objectives such as raising employment levels,
enhancing employment opportunities for targeted populations, raising wage
levels in specific industries, dignified work and healthy communities." 

<p>Neither the McKinney bill nor the Sanders resolution will be enacted any
time soon. "This Congress is too beholden to corporate money to challenge
its corporate masters," explains Sanders. 

<p>Only stronger grassroots movements offer the prospect of changing
Congress's primary allegiance. The importance of initiatives like
McKinney's and Sanders' is that, by offering concrete proposals of steps
to a better future, they can help generate and develop those movements.
