<p>"There’s tear gas outside the Treasury...the press conference is at 4.00...the
FCC are right outside..." Throughout the days of protest in  Washington this
April, the phonecalls from the  Independent Media Center  (IMC) came in
breathless, by the hour. Photographs and eyewitness bulletins were there for 
the
taking on the internet, and in parts of DC you could tune into Mobilization
Radio, an unlicensed micro-station, which transmitted stream-of-consciousness
broadcasts from various undisclosed locations until  the FCC shut it down.

<p>Unlike many a DC rally, the anti-capitalist action in the capital was not laid
on primarily to play to CNN’s anchors: there were no sound-bite-ready official
spokespeople, few celebrities, no press kits, not even a predictable march
route. But that doesn’t mean that A16 was media-unfriendly: far from it.
Communications-savvy activists worked every technology at their disposal and
those who were in the loop got all the news, up to the latest burst of
pepper-spray.  

<p>On the web, the IMC is at <a href="http://www.indymedia.org">www.indymedia.org</a>. Its non-virtual home was a 
whitewashed art gallery on 9th and N, a friendly, disheveled part of town.
By April 15, some thousand volunteer media-makers had registered to play their
part. Up a ladder, on a storage shelf-turned studio, camera-people shot
interviews. Barely a week later, a video documentary was available via 
satellite
for public access cable stations (and others) to broadcast. (See 
<a href="http://www.papertiger.org">www.papertiger.org</a>.) In a sound-proof walk-in closet, audio techies bounced  
the sound from the streets, via palm-size recorders, onto laptop computers, 
to the web, for far-off community radio stations to downloaded and play 
on-air.

<p>The old-media folks faced a temporary crisis. Smack in the middle of going to
press with the "Blind Spot" (the IMC’s four-page broadsheet) the in-house
copier crashed, and three nearby Kinko shops-- the 24-hour standby of
pamphlet-printers everywhere -- shut down, citing "riot activity". "The 
employee
was polite as he asked us to leave", reported Troy Skeels for the IMC, "but
explained that our presence was putting his shop in danger of being  closed 
due
to police pressure." With no riot in sight, Skeels and friends hiked to
Georgetown, and produced several thousand copies of BLIND SPOT there instead.

<p>There was a reunion of sorts on the streets of the city. In Chicago, at the 
1996
Democratic Convention, DC’s chief of police Charles Ramsey, was deputy 
commander of the Chicago police department. The "protest pit" strategy his 
forces used there greeted activists again in Washington. Relying on heavy cop 
presence and barricades to block all access to the DNC in Chicago, Ramsey’s 
forces fenced
critics into "free speech" zones -- parking lots miles from the site. He was
trying, no doubt, to prevent another ‘68 debacle when police riots made it 
onto
network television.

<p>Ramsey’s tactics in Chicago inspired media activists to collaborate, and the
prototype of the IMC was born. To get as much information out as widely as 
they could, given minimal access and maximum constraint, reporters from 
different media
shared resources, ability and energy, to cover what was not in the mainstream
and put the info  out onto the world wide web. "Not as many people looked, 
four
years ago," Jay Sands, one of the group’s many coordinators, told me. "But
Indymedia took off in Seattle and the habit  is catching on."  Next stop is 
Los
Angeles, Philadelphia, then Prague. For many, the world wide web will be the
only way to see what happens at the IMF’s annual meeting this fall.

<p>Initiatives like the under-funded, overstretched, IMC collective may not solve
the media-access problem, but they sure can help. When Mobilization Radio, the
low-watt station that covered the protest, announced that the FCC  were at the
door to shut them down, three hundred demonstrators arrived on  the scene in
minutes. "What happened next was probably unprecedented in the history of
microradio," wrote Joe Tuba, for the IMC.  Apparently taken aback by the 
crowd,
the police, FBI, FCC and assorted other intelligence left the  scene without
making arrests or grabbing equipment. "The crowd immediately took the street 
in
celebration...and the station was disassembled and carried out as the
participants left the building and regained anonymity as members  of the 
crowd,"
wrote Tuba.

<p>The fun and excitement at the IMC sure beats the dismal drone of the Pacifica
wars. It’s hard to keep up with shenanigans at what used to be the nation’s
premier public broadcast network. Things there, and in particular, the 
post-purge nightly news broadcasts, seem to go from bad to worse. Time was 
that
Pacifica would have been at the center of the action. Clearly some 
individuals,
like Amy Goodman, still are, but in Washington, Pacifica was on the outs with
the activists. Even the merry IMC gang drew the line at working with the
Pacifica Network News (PNN.) Shortly before the big day, the IMC decided to 
join
the boycott against PNN by refusing to credential PNN reporters, give them
interviews, or allow PNN to use the material the IMC created.

<p>"Many feel that Pacifica Network News has compromised its journalistic
integrity by acts of censorship. There is an ongoing strike by stringers and
freelancers and it was felt that we needed to be in solidarity with them", 
wrote
Liam Kirsher for the IMC.  

<p>Come April 16, a PNN reporter was seen red-faced and furious, screaming at an 
anti-World Bank protester. Why?  She was mad that the activists’ blockade was 
 in her way. 

<p>It was a sad moment, indicative of the path some claiming to represent 
Pacifica
have taken. But they better watch out. While  Pacifica’s management and their
friends are fiddling, the action in public  media is getting hot. April’s
anti-World Bank and IMF protests showed that.
