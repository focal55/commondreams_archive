<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Al Gore's flirtation with populist themes seems to
have breathed new life into a presidential campaign that has
been about as bipartisan boring as any in American history.

<p>We sure needed it. Gore's attacks on corporate
excesses were actually an understatement. America is the last
developed nation where the insurance industry holds a veto
power over national health insurance, leaving one-sixth of the
population without coverage. Or pharmaceutical companies
can dictate the prices of life-saving drugs, without regard to
the social, public health, or even fiscal consequences of their
profiteering.

<p>Mr. Gore didn't put forth any reforms that would
challenge this power of the big drug companies, much less a
proposal for national health insurance. But he did say that
"sometimes you have to be willing to stand up and say no" to
these companies so that "families can have a better life."

<p>He could have added that the richest one percent of
households more than doubled their real, after-tax income
over the last twenty years, while wages for the majority of
the labor force barely held constant. Even over the last year,
at the peak of America's longest-running economic
expansion, the average real wage has not gone up.

<p>But he didn't, and this burst of populism-- despite its
contribution to Mr. Gore's post-convention bounce in the
polls-- may prove as ephemeral as a round of fourth of July
fireworks. Why? For one thing, it's not easy to believe he
would really bite the hands that feed him and his party so
generously.

<p>Mr. Gore's running mate Joe Lieberman leads the
Senate in campaign contributions from insurance companies,
and scores a solid second from pharmaceuticals. Add in
Gore's family fortune in Occidental Petroleum, and you have
just about all of the industries that he has pledged to fight,
just waiting to cozy up and be pals again after the election-
year posturing is over.

<p>On the theory that people in glass houses should not
throw stones, the Bush campaign has refrained from making
this point. They have lobbed puffballs instead, accusing the
Gore campaign of engaging in "class warfare." But after
decades of one-sided class warfare against working and poor
people-- union busting, regressive trade agreements, capital
gains tax cuts, and "welfare reform,"-- it's hard to castigate
someone for suggesting that the victims of this warfare need
some relief. Nor would it help the Bush campaign to point
out that Mr. Reinvented Populist has supported most of the
policies that have hurt the "working families" that he now
champions.

<p>Still, a populist campaign has its risks. He who
stirreth up the masses along these lines might find that they
prefer the genuine article: Ralph Nader.

<p>Nader doesn't just talk about "fighting for you," he's
done it for more than 30 years. His work has created the
modern consumer movement, and helped force the
government to pay attention to auto safety, the environment,
and the effects of trade policy on workers.

<p>Nader is now running for president in order to "wrest
control of our democracy from the corporate government and
restore it to the political government under the control of
citizens."

<p>For many that might seem too ambitious a task. But
given a choice between someone who has become famous
through hard work, intelligence, courage, and standing up for
the interests of the average American-- versus two men who
made the right choice of parents and pandered to rich
contributors-- millions of voters would see it as a no-brainer.
Not to mention the equally large group of non-voters.

<p>Imagine: a president whose integrity is
unimpeachable, beholden to no one but the electorate. It's not
impossible. Stranger things have happened: who would have
thought that Nelson Mandela would one day be president of
South Africa, while he was serving his twenty-seventh year
in prison?

<p>Gore is hoping that most voters will never hear
anything about Nader's candidacy. This could happen if, as
planned, he is excluded from the presidential debates.

<p>The debates are controlled by former Democratic and
Republican party leaders, and financed with money from
corporations like Anheuser-Busch and Phillip Morris. These
people don't want Nader in there for obvious reasons-- look
what happened when Jesse Ventura, then polling at 10
percent, was allowed into the gubernatorial debates in
Minnesota. He won.

<p>On a recent ABC talk show, Cokie Roberts asked
Nader what he thought of the idea of participating in the first
debate, with continued participation depending on how his
poll numbers moved. "That would be a start," said Nader, and
he referred listeners to his web site (www.votenader.org) to
find out how they could get involved in making it happen.

<p>Real populism could be just a mouse-click away.
