I voted this week. I dug through a pile of papers to find my absentee ballot, scribbled a quick "x", and jammed the forms into an envelope before I could change my mind. It was very exciting. It was very painful. I voted for Ralph Nader for president of the United States. 
<P>It wasn't an easy decision. The person I realistically want to win the election is Al Gore. And if he loses to Bush, a Catholic sense of guilt inherited from my father (minus the actual Catholicism) will leave me feeling that I am personally responsible. But even if Bush becomes our next president, I do not believe my vote will have been wasted. Nader's candidacy will have left an indelible mark on the American political script.  
<P>It was thanks to Nader that I started paying attention to the elections. I spent the early months of the race doing my damnedest to avoid it. I refused to vote in the primaries.  
<P>Then I heard this summer that the Green party was running a candidate and that he was doing pretty well. I started looking for election stories. I scanned magazines for profiles of Nader. What I found, to my great relief, was someone echoing some of my own concerns - reasserting the supremacy of democracy over capitalism, universal health care, support for trade unions - and being taken seriously. By September, when I went back to the States for a visit, I was determined to register for an absentee ballot.   
<P>Voting for Nader felt like a tiny step into a broader movement, an act that connected me with protesters in Seattle and Prague. While I was in the States I gave the Greens a small donation, my first to a political party. Just for good measure, I also gave a little to the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Hardly revolutionary acts, but they are a modest start and far more than Gore could have inspired me to.  
<P>The last time I was this excited about voting was in 1992 when Bill Clinton was first running for president, promising to end what seemed, from my 20-year-old perspective, like an endless Republican reign in the White House. I imagined Clinton would throw open the White House doors and let a fresh breeze of liberalism air out a stale den of conservatism.  
<P>Then came the don't ask, don't tell policy. Then the collapse of the health-care project. Then welfare reform. Then Monica Lewinsky. It became obvious that Clinton is not a champion of the left, but a page boy for a nebulous centre.  
<P>Just because you're enthusiastic about the person you're voting for, it doesn't mean you'll get a fairytale ending. Idealistic voting doesn't always work. Gore's supporters won't let us forget that. "A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush," they shout, like it's a campaign slogan. There's some truth to that. If Nader weren't around and the race was still this close I might have been frightened into voting for Gore. But what is the value of a vote cast out of fear?  
<P>The Democrats are treating their liberal supporters as though the only thing they have to do to earn our votes is conjure up the spectre of a Republican presidency. That's not enough. My vote is my power as a citizen of a democracy. If I allow the Democratic party to convince me that I have no choices at the polling booth, then I allow them to strip me of that power. The only way to make the Democratic leadership pay attention is by showing them I can take my vote elsewhere. The wonderful thing about this election is that liberal Americans have finally been offered an elsewhere.  
<P>It's not easy to vote for Nader. The potential consequences are serious. But then, it only matters when it hurts. What are the "a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush" people trying to suggest? That you should support a third party only if it has no impact on the race whatsoever? What would be the point then? For the ideas that Nader and the Green party represent to have an impact, it's got to sting a little.  
<P>That sting is already making a difference. Gore has been forced to acknowledge Nader's presence. With enough votes, maybe Nader and the Greens can keep that momentum going, get the left organised again into a more viable political force.  
<P>Or we could simply vote for the lesser of two evils. But then we shouldn't be surprised if we always end up with evil. I think it's worth giving idealism another try.
