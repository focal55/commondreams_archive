As the Lebanese people have finally liberated themselves from more
than two decades of Israeli occupation, most American commentators are
reacting with only one concern: Will northern Israel be safe from attack?
<p>The focus on this misleading question is the result of a widespread
acceptance of the official Israeli line that its 22-year rampage in
southern Lebanon was in essence a futile quest for peace in a hostile
region. This view is consistent with the pattern of putting Israeli lives
and concerns over those of Arabs, but it is completely inconsistent with
the history of the occupation and the experiences of its Lebanese
victims.
<p>It is blind to the tens of thousands of Lebanese civilians killed by
Israel during the occupation, the hundreds of thousands made homeless and
the scores of destroyed villages and cities. It forgets the ghastly
massacres of unarmed civilians for which the Israelis have been
responsible in Lebanon, including the massacres at the Sabra and Shatila
refugee camps and the U.N. base at Qana. It ignores the Lebanese
civilians held hostage to this day in Israeli prisons and the hundreds of
Lebanese men, women and children held prisoner and tortured at the
notorious Khiam detention center run by the Israeli-controlled militia,
the South Lebanese Army. It does not acknowledge the pain of the Lebanese
nation at being divided for almost a quarter of a century and subject to
continuous attacks on its civilian population and infrastructure.
<p>No wonder, given this history, that the scenes of liberation from
south Lebanon have been truly extraordinary. Hundreds of Lebanese
streamed back into villages and towns from which they had been expelled
by Israel. Tears of joy flowed as relatives were reunited after years of
separation. Hundreds of civilians stormed Khiam, freeing about 140
prisoners and exposing the hideous apparatus of torture and terror
employed there.
<p>These scenes have potentially far-reaching implications. Can others in
the Middle East living under foreign military occupation, such as the
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, have failed to register what real
liberation looks like?
<p>Everywhere Hezbollah fighters, derided by the Israeli and U.S.
governments as "terrorists," conducted themselves in an exemplary manner,
handing prisoners over to government troops and ensuring that the
liberation was not marred by acts of vengeance. These supposed fanatical
terrorists were once again shown to be a disciplined and responsible
liberation force.
<p>How quickly it is forgotten that Hezbollah is itself a product of the
Israeli occupation, founded in 1982 with the aim of driving out the
Israeli army and freeing the south of the hellish experience of
occupation. The fretting about potential Hezbollah rocket attacks on
northern Israeli towns is misplaced, given that since 1996 Hezbollah has
almost always carried out such attacks in response to Israeli killings of
Lebanese civilians, often only after repeated atrocities. By contrast, in
recent months Israel repeatedly attacked Lebanese civilian targets, such
as power stations, in response to attacks on its soldiers in Lebanon.
<p>The Israeli army may have fled Lebanon in chaos and humiliation, but
not without issuing dire threats of massive attacks against Lebanon.
Israel's retreat from Lebanon is incomplete and insufficient. Israel was
driven out of most of southern Lebanon by an extraordinary campaign of
popular resistance, but continues to occupy the Shabaa Farms area. It
holds numerous Lebanese hostage.
<p>There is every indication that Israel still feels it can attack the
Lebanese people with impunity. Israel's foreign minister, David Levy,
recently threatened that Israel would continue to target Lebanese
civilians "blood for blood, child for child."
<p>The international community, while paying lip service to Lebanese
territorial integrity, failed to exert any pressure on Israel to end its
occupation. Instead it was left to resistance groups such as Hezbollah to
enforce U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which in 1978 demanded
Israel's unconditional withdrawal from Lebanon "forthwith."
<p>The United States, Israel's main patron, financier and arms supplier,
has been particularly culpable by repeatedly using its diplomatic muscle,
including its Security Council veto, to protect Israel from international
criticism after its invasions and atrocities. Rather than helping enforce
Resolution 425, which it voted for, the U.S. government line has been
that "all foreign forces should withdraw from Lebanon."
<p>This was an obvious ploy intended to buy time and space for Israel by
drawing a false moral and legal equivalence between Israel's brutal and
illegal occupation of south Lebanon and the Syrian presence in Lebanon.
Syria's role there is controversial, supported by many and opposed by
others as overbearing, while the Israeli occupation was universally
despised, as was amply demonstrated by the instantaneous collapse of its
proxy militia. Had the United States been willing to stand by
international law rather than making disingenuous excuses for outrageous
Israeli conduct, the international community might have been able to act
responsibly toward Lebanon.
<p>The obvious questions now are: Will Israel be forced to complete its
withdrawal from all of Lebanon, or will it be allowed to hang on to the
Shabaa Farms, where it has built a ski resort and a settlement for
Ethiopians? Will Israel be seriously pressured to release the Lebanese
hostages, or will it yet again be granted an exception to the most basic
international human rights norms? Will Israel be made to pay the
reparations it owes to the Lebanese for the invasions, bombings and
occupation, as is supposed to now be the norm for international
aggressors? When will the American government and media acknowledge that
Lebanese and Arab lives and rights are as important and worthy as those
of Israelis?
<p>Finally, and most importantly, will the international community at
long last live up to its responsibility to prevent Israel from ever again
invading or bombing Lebanon and murdering its people?
