Generally, pro-drug messages during pro sports broadcasts outnumber
      anti-drug messages by 8 or 10 to 1.  But Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey and
      his loyal ally, the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, achieved a
      remarkable 2-to-1 ratio Sunday, Feb. 6, in the second game of an NBA
      doubleheader on NBC.  Four beer commercials were almost balanced by two
      warnings about marijuana, long regarded by McCaffrey and the Partnership
      as Public Enemy No. 1.
      
<p>I say “marijuana,” even though that word was not mentioned in either
      public service announcement (PSA).  McCaffrey and the Partnership,
      demonstrating their “street cred,” opted for the slang term “weed.”
      
<p>Why was it so important to deliver two hits of the “anti-weed” message
      during the Sacramento Kings vs. Philadelphia 76ers game?  This is pure
      Colombian conjecture, but it could be related to the leaders of the
      respective teams, all-stars Chris Webber and Allen Iverson.  According
      to a McCaffrey op ed column in the Sept. 30, 1998 <i>Washington Post</i>,
      titled “A Clean and Sober NBA,” early in their careers they were among a
      handful of players who likely succumbed to drug “addiction.”
      
<p>“According to some estimates,” wrote McCaffrey, “as many as 70 percent
      of NBA players may be current drug users. Marijuana, which players can
      use with impunity from league sanctions because it is not prohibited
      under the existing NBA rules, accounts for the bulk of this use (making
      it routine for players to build an addiction bad enough to run afoul of
      the law before their problem receives attention).”&nbsp;
      
<p>McCaffrey didn’t “name names,” but sports fans knew who he was talking
      about, just as yuppies would know who he meant if he had made the
      accusation against “the cast of <i>Friends</i>” without divulging their
      names.  The incidents of NBA players running “afoul of the law” over
      marijuana have been so few — and thoroughly reported in the sports media
      — that fans would know McCaffrey had fingered Webber, Iverson, Robert
      Parish, Mookie Blaylock, Marcus Camby and Isaiah Rider.  McCaffrey’s use
      of the word “routine” thus implied that most or all of them were
      marijuana addicts.&nbsp;
      
<p>I am unaware of any of these players acknowledging a problem with — let
      alone an “addiction” to — marijuana.
      
<p>Who are the “NBA Six”?&nbsp;
      
<p>Chris Webber is a conscientious young man who, unlike Michael Jordan,
      abandoned a lucrative Nike contract because the company wouldn’t make
      its marquee sneakers affordable to poor families.  An avid collector of
      the manuscripts of Frederick Douglass’s speeches and other artifacts of
      the freedom struggle, Webber was recently featured in an NBA Black
      History Month PSA reading a Langston Hughes poem.  Webber was acquitted
      of pot possession, and to my knowledge has never admitted smoking, let
      alone being addicted to, marijuana.
      
<p>Allen Iverson is an artist and a doting father to his kids.  He told
      John Thompson, an NBA analyst who was Iverson’s college coach at
      Georgetown, that he sees himself as a “good guy” and it’s important to
      him that others see him in that light (WTBS interview, Feb. 21).&nbsp;
      Iverson also happens to be an electrifying athlete and the league’s
      second leading scorer.  He comes to play.  Every night.  Always has.
      
<p>Robert Parish, who retired two years ago, played more NBA seasons than
      anyone in history.  He was a consumate professional and an acknowledged
      pot smoker.  The two are not mutually exclusive, and “pot smoker” is not
      synonymous with “pot addict.”&nbsp;
      
<p>Mookie Blaylock, who is among the league leaders in steals every
      season, is another consumate pro.&nbsp;
      
<p>Marcus Camby is a talented center-forward and shot-blocking machine.&nbsp;
      His game was somewhat erratic early in his career, but that’s quite
      common among young players.  It is not proof positive of pot addiction.
      
<p>Isaiah Rider, is a fierce competitor and a consistent scorer who’s had
      his share of run-ins with coaches.  He’s been fined for missing
      practices and flights and for spouting off at teammates.  Was he a
      marijuana addict?  If so, he was the most intense marijuana addict in
      history.&nbsp;
      
<p>Let us set aside the question of whether heavy, long-term use of
      marijuana can result in physical addiction, like alcohol or heroin, as
      some experts claim, or merely psychological dependence.  (Even the
      hawkish Partnership, at <i>www.drugfreeamerica.org</i>, is careful to apply
      the latter term to pot and “addiction” to alcohol.)  Let us ask instead,
      What characterizes the hardcore pothead?  Laziness, lack of ambition,
      respiratory problems like those of cigarette smokers and disinterest in
      one’s physical appearance are common characteristics.  Do those describe
      any of the NBA Six at the time of their run-in with the law over pot?
      
<p>What evidence existed in 1998 that any of the NBA Six had been hooked?&nbsp;
      If the NBA had such evidence, it was (and is) confidential.  How did
      McCaffrey acquire it?  If it didn’t exist, on what legitimate basis did
      he judge them to be drug addicts?  And why didn’t the <i>Post</i>’s editorial
      page editors ask McCaffrey for proof?  Is Bill Clinton’s drug czar so
      powerful that he can tar pro athletes as addicts on no apparent evidence
      and not be challenged by seasoned editors at a major national newspaper?
      
      
<p><b><font color="#008000"><font size="4"><i>SIDEBAR&nbsp;</i></font>
      McCaffrey protects Big Booze — to the delight of the NBA and NBC</font></b>
      
<p>In his op ed column ironically titled “A Clean and Sober NBA”
      (<i>Washington Post</i>, Sept. 30, 1998), Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey never
      once allowed the word “alcohol” to parse his lips.  While he stuck
      mostly to the generic term “drug,” a careful reading indicates McCaffrey
      did not wish the reader to think of alcohol — an “official sponsor” of
      the NBA, an industry with political clout <i>and</i> America’s most abused
      mind-altering drug — when he said the dreaded “D” word.  Just as his
      boss has explained when sex is not sex, our drug czar tells us when a
      drug is not a drug.
      
<p>McCaffrey alluded to (though did not cite) a controversial <i>New York
      Times</i> story of Oct. 26, 1997, “NBA’s Uncontrolled Substance,” when he
      wrote, “According to some estimates, as many as 70 percent of NBA
      players may be current drug users.  Marijuana, which players can use
      with impunity from league sanctions because it is not prohibited under
      the existing NBA rules, accounts for the bulk of this use....”
      
<p>What the <i>Times</i> actually alleged in its tendentious report was that 60
      to 70 percent of players “smoke marijuana and drink excessively.”  The
      <i>Times</i> did not claim that 60 to 70 percent “smoke marijuana excessively
      and drink.”  So despite the misleading title of the article, the <i>Times</i>
      was saying that <i>alcohol</i> accounts for the bulk of NBA drug use.  In the
      story’s fine print, Knicks forward Buck Williams (now retired) stated
      the obvious truth:  “Alcohol is a much larger problem [in the league]
      than marijuana.”
      
<p>NBA Commissioner David Stern disputed the <i>Times</i> report, and rightly
      so.  The estimates of pot smoking and excessive drinking were
      ridiculously high, even for the “young male” demographic to which the
      players belong, which has the highest rates of substance use and abuse.&nbsp;
      But the important point is that McCaffrey ignored allegations of rampant
      <i>abuse</i> of the drug alcohol and chose instead to focus on allegations of
      widespread <i>use</i> of the drug marijuana, allegations which he then
      exaggerated and distorted to reach this apparently baseless conclusion:&nbsp;
      It is “routine for players to build an addiction [to marijuana] bad
      enough to run afoul of the law before their problem receives attention.”
      
<p>McCaffrey is not the “Illegal Drug Czar” (though it has a nice ring).&nbsp;
      He is the “Drug Czar,” and the official “No. 1 Goal” of the government’s
      National Drug Control Strategy is to “Educate and enable America’s youth
      to reject illegal drugs, as well as alcohol and tobacco.”  It’s not his
      job to protect Big Booze.
      
<p>As McCaffrey claims to be concerned about the messages our
      impressionable youth receive about drugs, he might be interested in the
      messages a typical NBA telecast delivers about the mind-altering drug
      most likely to kill or hook both teens and adults.  Several months
      before he penned his <i>Post</i> column, I charted the NBC telecast of the
      Chicago Bulls vs. the Utah Jazz (Jan. 25, 1998) and recorded the
      following in a widely rejected essay, “The NBA-NBC Happy Hour”:
      
      <p>• 10 beer commercials:  3 Budweiser spots featuring those lovable
      lizards, 3 whacky Miller Lite spots produced by “Dave,” 2 Icehouse spots
      featuring gruff Coach Lou, and 2 Milwaukee Best spots urging viewers to
      — I’m not making this up — “Unleash the beast”;
      <p>• 2 NBC announcements that “The NBA on NBC is brought to you by Miller
      Lite, who remind you that anything can happen at Miller Time” (no irony
      intended);
      <p>• 1 NBC announcement that “The NBA on NBC is brought to you by
      Budweiser”;
      <p>• 1 “Let’s take a look at the Miller Lite halftime statistics”
      announcement by Bob Costas;
      <p>• 1 “Miller Genuine Draft presents ‘Even More Basketball’” spot — a
      15-20-second highlight package of key plays in the game, narrated by
      analyst Isiah Thomas, followed by a voice-over reminder that Miller
      “will donate $1,000 to the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund.”
      
	<p>A genuinely “clean and sober” NBA (and NBC) would replace those beer
      commercials with PSAs promoting both abstinence and carefully defined
      “responsible drinking.”  Some PSAs would feature hoop stars who explain
      how they live fun-filled lives without alcohol.  Other PSAs would
      feature hoop stars explaining what “safe-drinking limits” are and how
      they monitor the light-to-moderate drinking they enjoy so they don’t,
      over time, develop a problem.  (Those limits, according to the
      government, are no more than two drinks per day for men under 65, no
      more than one for men over 65 and all adult women except those who are
      pregnant, who must abstain completely.)&nbsp;
      
	<p>Still other PSAs would remind teens that alcohol is a DRUG, and that
      the earlier they start using any drug, the greater the risk of abuse or
      addiction.&nbsp;
      
      <p>Such an effort would cost the filthy-rich network and league some
      revenues, and it would anger the alcohol industry.  With ten percent of
      beer drinkers consuming 50 percent of the beer, it’s critical to the
      robust health of Big Booze that heavy drinkers think of themselves as
      moderate drinkers and thus keep imbibing at their risky rate.  But it
      would be the right thing to do.  By advocating such an effort, McCaffrey
      and his boss could begin to make amends for years of service to Big
      Booze.
