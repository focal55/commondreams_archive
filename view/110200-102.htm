Imagine this: You are a prosecutor. You indict a person for homicide. You
type up a press release and plan to hold a press conference to announce
the indictment.
 
<p>But before you say anything to the media about the indictment, you must
first consult with the lawyer for the defendant. And under the law, the
lawyer for the defendant has a right to veto anything you say in the press
release, or at the press conference. And the lawyer for the defendant has
the right to negotiate the wording of the press release.
 
<p>No prosecutor in his or her right mind would accept such an intrusion by a
person accused of a crime.
 
<p>But a similar situation is being tolerated by the Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), the federal policing agency set up to enforce consumer
protection laws, including those covering children's products made by
companies such as Hasbro (Playskool), Mattel (Fisher-Price), Graco/Century
Products, Evenflo, Cosco, Safety 1st and Kolcraft.
 
<p>Under the law that set up the CPSC, before the agency releases information
to the public, it must notify the company of its intention. If the company
disputes the accuracy or fairness of the information to be released, then
the general counsel of the CPSC gets involved and the dispute over the
press release could end up in federal court. But the CPSC is strapped for
resources, and the result is, in most cases, the company gets its way.
 
<p>What's the consequence of such a policy? More than most, this policing
agency has become subordinate to the industry it polices. And the result
is that hundreds of innocent children are killed and thousands are injured
by consumer products every year -- products that would have been pulled
off the market by an independent agency not hamstrung by corporate
interference.
  
<p>One such infant who died was Danny Keysar. In May 1998, 17-month old Danny
was at a daycare home. His daycare provider put him down for a nap in a
Playskool Travel-Lite portable crib. A short while later, when she went to
check on him, she found that the crib had collapsed with Danny in it. His
neck was caught in the rails. He wasn't breathing. He died.
 
<p>Marla Felcher, then a professor of marketing at Northwestern University,
was a friend of Danny's parents. She attended Danny's funeral.
 
<p>At the funeral, Danny's mother urged Felcher to investigate why Danny
died.
 
<p>Within a week of beginning her investigation, Felcher realized that
Danny's death should never have happened. The crib that killed Danny had
been recalled five years earlier. Danny was the fifth child to be killed
by this particular Playskool portable crib model. Other companies
manufactured cribs using the same design. And over 1.5 million units of
other portable cribs had been recalled, and at least a dozen children have
been killed in total.
 
<p>The whole idea of the portable crib is that it collapses easily. The top
rails on these types of portable cribs have a hinge in the center. A child
could stand up, grab onto the top rail, and collapse it. Danny's weight
was strong enough to collapse the crib. When cribs of this sort collapse,
the top rail bends at the center hinge, forms a "V" and the child is
knocked down. His neck or chest can get caught in the grip of the V, and
he is no longer able to breathe.
  
<p>The problem with the Playskool crib and others that were designed the same
way is that it is possible for a caregiver to set up the crib and assume
that it is locked into place, when it is not.
 
<p>"The coroners' reports on all these portable crib fatalities are
shockingly similar -- the kid was found trapped in the 'V' of the folded
crib rails," Felcher told us last week.
 
<p>The control that the consumer product industry has over the CPSC is truly
mindboggling. For example, some products pose a serious risk of injury to
children, while others present only a slight risk. But because the
industry has a stranglehold over the information flow from CPSC to the
public, reporters and consumer never find out whether the risk is serious
or not.
 
<p>Thus while the CPSC rates how dangerous a product is -- A, B, C, D -- the
rating is not made public.
 
<p>And because the CPSC is not aggressive in getting information out about
product hazards, when it does recall a dangerous product, a very small
percentage -- perhaps 10 to 30 percent -- of the product gets pulled off
the market. One of those recalled products that failed to get pulled from
the market was the crib that killed Danny Keysar.
 
<p>Felcher has written up the findings of her investigation in a book (It's
No Accident: How the Infant Products Industry Compromises Baby Safety
(Common Courage Press, February 2001)). And Danny's parents have set up a
non-profit to help get dangerous children's products off the market
(www.kidsindanger.org).
 
<p>But true progress won't be made until a new political culture sweeps
Washington, one that values human life over the almighty dollar. Only then
will the police be liberated from the death grip of the corporate elite.
