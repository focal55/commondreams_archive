Madison is a two-party town. It is fair to say that the Democrats are in the
dominant position, with such party stalwarts as U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, state
Rep. Mark Pocan, Mayor Sue Bauman and County Executive Kathleen Falk occupying
key partisan and nonpartisan positions. But there is, as well, a scrappy second
party in Madison, with members well represented on the City Council, County
Board and School Board.
<p>The second party is, of course, Progressive Dane -- the union-backed,
left-leaning group that over the past seven years has won dozens of contests for
local posts and established solid ties with Baldwin, Falk and other non-PD
officials.</p>
<p>What of the Republicans? While the Grand Old Party's denizens sheepishly
occupy a handful of local posts, they are hardly major players outside the
confines of the Capitol Square. (It's worth noting that, in isthmus wards, Green
candidate Ralph Nader whipped Republican Bob Dole in 1996 presidential voting.
It's equally worth noting that Nader and his running mate, Winona LaDuke, will
do significantly better in those same wards this year.)</p>
<p>But Madison's just Madison, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>The nontraditional politics of Wisconsin's capital city are mirrored in a
growing number of communities across the United States. In Iowa City, for
instance, Socialist Karen Kubby has just finished a decade-long stint on the
City Council. In Burlington, Vt., Progressive Party members and their allies
hold the mayor's job, a number of local posts and four legislative seats. In
Arcata, Calif., Greens control the local government. The New Party is the No. 2
party on the Missoula, Mont., City Council. In Boston, Rainbow Coalition Party's
Chuck Turner last fall became the first non-Democrat elected to the City Council
in two decades. And San Francisco Supervisor Tom Ammiano almost got elected
mayor of that city last fall as a blunt, no-strings-attached progressive.</p>
<p>Third-party and independent progressive politics are alive and well in
America. In the aftermath of the remarkable coalition-building that fueled last
fall's anti-WTO protests in Seattle, there is reason to believe that this may be
the ripest moment since the 1930s for a progressive political blossoming in the
United States.</p>
<p>That's certainly the hope of the Independent Progressive Politics Network,
which begins its fifth National Independent Politics Summit here today. The
summit, which runs through Sunday on the UW campus (call 556-1232 for details)
brings together activists such as the always inspiring Baldemar Velasquez of the
Farm Labor Organizing Committee; academics such as Lawrence Goodwin, author of
&quot;The Populist Moment''; and successful independent pols such as Iowa City's
Kubby.</p>
<p>South African poet Dennis Brutus, one of the wisest voices on the planet
regarding globalization and democracy in the developing world, is expected to be
present, as are LaDuke and Socialist Party presidential candidate David
McReynolds, whose long history of activism on peace and social justice issues
makes him a bridge between the Old Left, the New Left and the even newer PS
(Post-Seattle) Left. Singer Holly Near will join Madison's excellent Vicki
Guzman for a Barrymore Theatre benefit on behalf of the Independent Progressive
Politics Network Friday night.</p>
<p>Underpinning the forums, seminars and workshops of the weekend will be a new
energy, which is grounded in the realization that independent progressive
politics is no longer a &quot;from-the-sidelines'' activity. In Madison and a
growing number of communities, new parties of the left are not just challenging
the political process, they are displacing traditional players and taking charge
of that process.</p>
<p>The American people are welcoming the change. Indeed, with the latest New
York Times/CBS Poll showing that 75 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with
the process that gave them Al Gore and George W. Bush as their prime
presidential choices, the electorate is signaling that the alternatives the
Independent Progressive Politics Network and its affiliates propose cannot come
fast enough.</p>
