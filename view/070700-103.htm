Every time Washington suspects that
                        Iraq is making gains in the propaganda
                        war over sanctions, reports emanate from
                        the US capital claiming that Baghdad
                        continues to be a global menace and must
                        be &#147;contained&#148; by the blockade.
                        <p>
                        The latest yarn alleges Iraq is testing
                        short-range missiles. <p>
                        Down around the third or fourth paragraph
                        the writer admits that such missiles do
                        not violate the terms of &#147;the Mother
                        of All UN Resolutions,&#148; which lays
                        down what sort of weaponry Iraq can have:
                        short-range missiles with a range of 150
                        kilometers are permitted. <p>
                        Some reports infer that Iraq is also
                        redeveloping medium-range missiles in
                        violation of the resolution. But this has
                        been categorically denied by Scott
                        Ritter, the US citizen who formerly
                        served on the UN Special Commission which
                        monitored Iraq&#146;s arms of mass
                        destruction. <p>
                        Ritter, writing in the current issue of
                        Arms Control Today, an independent
                        journal published in Washington, says
                        that Iraq now has no banned arms of any
                        importance. <p>
                        Nevertheless, US and British warplanes
                        continue to bomb Iraqi targets on an
                        every-other-day basis and insist that the
                        punitive sanctions regime must be
                        maintained until Saddam Hussein is no
                        longer in power. This unending
                        belligerency against Iraq has now caused
                        the most respectable of the opposition
                        groups, the Iraqi National Accord, to
                        pull out of the umbrella grouping, the
                        Iraqi National Congress, which is meeting
                        in London this week to work out a new
                        strategy to topple Hussein. <p>
                        One of the reasons given by the Accord
                        for withdrawing from the Congress is its
                        close connection with the US Central
                        Intelligence Agency, Congressional
                        leaders and the Clinton administration.
                        All are viewed by ordinary Iraqis living
                        under sanctions as their inveterate enemy
                        rather than Saddam. The Accord clearly
                        realized that membership in the Council
                        is not only counterproductive but also
                        pointless because it will never be in a
                        position to oust Saddam&#146;s regime. <p>
                        This being the case, Denis Halliday, the
                        former UN humanitarian coordinator in
                        Baghdad who resigned in 1998 to protest
                        against the sanctions, is now offering
                        Washington and London an alternative to
                        their murderous sanctions policy. He is
                        proposing a 13-point plan which includes
                        the resumption of UN monitoring of
                        Iraq&#146;s weapons program; imposition
                        of &#147;smart&#148; sanctions on
                        arms-producing states to prevent Iraq
                        from obtaining prohibited weaponry; an
                        end to the &#147;demonization&#148; of
                        Iraq and its president; dialogue with
                        Baghdad; lifting of economic sanctions;
                        release of oil equipment to repair the
                        country&#146;s severely damaged oil
                        industry; investment in the devastated
                        economy; postponement of reparations
                        payments which consume 30 percent of
                        gross oil revenues; and an end to the
                        daily Anglo-US bombing sorties which Iraq
                        says have killed 300 of its civilians and
                        wounded more. <p>
                        Halliday, who had made a career in the UN
                        and held the rank of assistant
                        secretary-general before he resigned,
                        admitted to this correspondent in an
                        interview that he was not &#147;very
                        happy&#148; with his plan. But he said it
                        had been designed to &#147;help
                        Washington and London to get out of this
                        dreadful mess they have gotten themselves
                        into&#148; by insisting on sanctions
                        until Saddam disappears from the scene. <p>
                        While he agrees that Saddam&#146;s
                        presence at the helm permits Washington
                        and its loyal acolyte, London, to
                        continue the punitive sanctions regime,
                        Halliday thinks there are &#147;a few
                        people&#148; in Washington who want to
                        bring sanctions to an end. These people,
                        he said, have come to realize that the
                        US, and specifically the Clinton
                        administration, could &#147;be blamed for
                        crimes against humanity, including
                        possibly genocide&#148; because of the
                        sanctions. <p>
                        Halliday is not very optimistic about the
                        US changing its policy under either of
                        Clinton&#146;s potential successors,
                        Vice-President Al Gore or Texas Governor
                        George W. Bush, who have shown themselves
                        more hawkish on Iraq than Clinton. <p>
                        &#147;What I&#146;m working on now is
                        trying to get other governments &#133; to
                        put pressure on Washington to change its
                        policy&#148; before Clinton leaves office
                        in January 2001, he said. &#147;In much
                        of the world there is outrage amongst
                        parliamentarians over the continuation of
                        economic sanctions.&#148; <p>
                        He believes that these anti-sanctions
                        parliamentarians could reinforce the
                        position of the 70 &#147;courageous&#148;
                        US congressmen who have taken a stand
                        against the blockade. These lawmakers
                        understand, he said, that the &#147;human
                        calamity&#148; caused by sanctions
                        &#147;isn&#146;t serving the best
                        interests of the US or Europe.&#148; <p>
                        In his opinion, the UN will never again
                        be able to impose the sort of
                        &#147;illegal&#148; sanctions Iraq has
                        endured for the past 10 years. &#147;What
                        is happening in Iraq is a complete breach
                        of international humanitarian law,&#148;
                        he stated. It amounts to &#147;punishing
                        a people in order to get at their
                        ruler.&#148; <p>
                        Indeed, he believes that the sanctions
                        provisions in the UN Charter will have to
                        be &#147;rewritten&#148; so that no
                        other&nbsp; population is ever targeted
                        in the way the people of Iraq have. He
                        defines the Iraqi sanctions as
                        &#147;genocide&#148; because &#147;if you
                        look at the convention on genocide, it
                        requires intent.&#148; <p>
                        To sum up his thinking: since the
                        Security Council, under US/UK pressure,
                        persists with sanctions knowing what
                        impact the embargo is having on the Iraqi
                        populace, one cannot but conclude that
                        the council is responsible for the murder
                        of 7,000 Iraqis a month, 5,000 of them
                        children under the age of five.
