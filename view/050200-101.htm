The war against marijuana took two interesting, and very divergent,
turns last week.  In Ukiah, California, the Mendocino County Board of
Supervisors placed a measure on the November ballot to decriminalize the
personal cultivation and use of marijuana.  In Sacramento, the Assembly
Public Safety Committee voted to reimpose California’s “Smoke a Joint,
Lose Your License” law.

<p>Mendocino County is where the state’s war on marijuana began 21 years
ago.  In a headline-grabbing event that helped fuel his gubernatorial
ambitions, then-Attorney General George Deukmejian, accompanied by
automatic rifle-toting, flak-jacketed agents, descended by helicopter on
a northern Mendocino County garden.  Since then, billions of dollars
have been spent annually on all aspects of the marijuana war. Two
decades later, the weed is more prevalent than ever.

<p>The message from this state of affairs is so plain and simple that only
a politician could miss it--prohibition doesn’t work.  But the war on
marijuana has never been about stopping marijuana use so much as it has
been about pandering to a public that is legitimately concerned about
health and safety, especially the health and safety of children. 
Pandering is where Governor Gray Davis and the Assembly Public Safety
Committee come in.

<p>The “Smoke a Joint, Lose Your License” mandate was devised by the Bush
administration as an attack on California’s marijuana decriminalization
law under which possession of less than an ounce is deemed an infraction
rather than a misdemeanor.  To this day, the feds withhold
transportation funds from states that refuse to take driver’s licenses
from drug offenders, regardless of whether the drug offense has any
relationship to operating a vehicle.  States that don’t wish to abide by
the mandate can “opt-out” with the signature of the governor. 
Thirty-two states, including every state west of Texas, have taken
advantage of the “opt-out” option.  Despite polls showing that
two-thirds of Californians disagreed with him, former Governor Pete
Wilson chose to support the Bush mandate.  That Wilson law is due to
expire in July 2000.

<p>Now, to the shock of many of those who supported his bid for high
office, Governor Davis has made it clear that he wants the Wilson policy
extended.  This despite the fact that California will be forced to
continue spending millions processing minor pot offenders, whose charges
would otherwise be dismissed with a ticket, to come back to court in
order to defend their licenses.  This despite the fact that the law
Davis supports, AB 2595, would make it a worse offense to have a joint
in your pocket or purse at home than to be caught speeding, driving
recklessly, or with an open liquor container in your car.

<p>In the halls of the State Capitol, our leaders, eager to prove how much
they care about kids and despise crime, sip their martinis and condemn
pot smokers.  Many of them have no doubt “experimented” themselves. Even
more no doubt have children who have.  When those kids get in trouble
they are typically “diverted” from the system, given clemency due to the
extenuating circumstance of having a powerful parent. For the rest of
our kids, and ourselves, it’s “smoke a joint, lose your license,” or
worse. 

<p>The governor and our misinformed state legislators need to pay heed to
the discussion now going on in Mendocino County.  Sheriff Tony Craver
signed the initiative to legalize the personal cultivation and use of
marijuana.  He did this not because he supports marijuana use but
because as a longtime law enforcement official he has seen that
prohibition is a bust.  If the initiative passes, he believes it will
“send a message to policy makers in Sacramento and Washington that
despite decades of efforts to suppress marijuana, the number of users
and amount of plants seized continues to increase.”

<p>Mendocino supervisors were urged by County Counsel Peter Klein to
perform their ministerial duty of putting the initiative on the ballot,
but then to challenge its legality in court.  Klein argued that the
initiative was unenforceable because it preempts state and federal laws
prohibiting the possession and use of marijuana.  However, as Supervisor
Richard Shoemaker pointed out, Proposition 215, the 1996 “medical
marijuana” initiative, purportedly had similar problems and is now being
successfully implemented.  Supervisor David Colfax reminded the Board
that it would be “bizarre” to challenge the marijuana initiative while
continuing to subsidize the county’s robust wine industry.  The Board,
which has a conservative majority, voted unanimously to reject their
counsel’s advice and move forward to a test of the voters’ will in
November.

<p>Perhaps it should come as no surprise that it is in the county where
the pot war got started that it’s now winding down.  Mendocino County
has experienced many of the negative effects of illegal pot.  Millions
of dollars spent by law enforcement, skewing priorities and clogging the
courts.  Thousands of casual users arrested, sometimes imprisoned and
left with indelible marks on their records.  The hypocrisy of preaching
against pot while pushing more dangerous drugs.  A culture of greed and
occasional violence brought about directly by astronomical prices.  The
unseemliness of an economy whose largest cash crop is an illegal weed.

<p>Mendocino County has learned the hard way and is finally on the right
track.  Threats and bullying don’t work.  Lose your home.  Lose your
freedom.  And now lose your license.  Too bad the politicos in
Sacramento seem once again to have lost their minds.
