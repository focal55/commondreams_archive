When Al Gore recently joined conservatives in supporting a special

law to award Elian Gonzalez permanent U.S. residency, his maneuver was

straight out of the playbook that has governed eight years of Clintonism:

"Fake left, go right."

<p>If a play like this works, Clintonites get to position themselves as

thoughtful moderates between congressional Democrats and Republicans.

This "triangulation" strategy was the brainchild of blissful bipartisan

Dick Morris, a Clinton advisor who also worked for Republicans like Trent

Lott and Jesse Helms.

<p>Predictably, Gore's Elian move outraged many Democrats in Congress,

especially those who have long criticized immigration policy for

discriminating against Haitians and Dominicans while giving Cubans

privileges.

<p>No Democrat was more angry than powerful Harlem Rep. Charles Rangel

(D.-N.Y.), who attacked Gore for being "purely political in order to

appease the voters in Miami." Yet Rangel is in a bind when it comes to

Clintonism, for he--like many other liberals--has chosen to wed himself

to it while reserving the right to occasionally grouse. It was Rangel who

helped launch the New York Senate candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton, a

co-inventor of Clintonism, who promptly displayed her talents for

unprincipled flip-flopping on a range of issues, including Israel and

Puerto Rico.

<p>While Clintonism may be good for Bill and Hillary and Al--all of whom

seem willing to say or do anything to win the next election--it's worth

asking whether Clintonism is good for the Democratic Party.

<p>Let's do the numbers. When Clinton entered the White House, his party

dominated the U.S. Senate, 57-43; the U.S. House, 258-176; the country's

governorships, 30-18, and a large majority of state legislatures. Today,

Republicans control the Senate, 55-45; the House, 222-211; governorships,

30-18, and almost half of state legislatures.

<p>The Democrats under Clintonism resemble a house of cards, with the

Clintons and Gore inhabiting the White House atop a party structure

crumbling because of an ever-shifting foundation.

<p>Democrats were once a majority party standing on some firm

principles--helping the little guy, economic security and, to some

degree, standing up to corporations on behalf of workers, consumers and

the environment.

<p>But Clintonism has come to mean coddling big money (except guns and

tobacco), financial scandals, winning at any cost, flip-flopping and

prevaricating.

<p>In 1992, en route to the White House, Hillary Rodham Clinton dismissed

questions about dealings between her Little Rock law firm and Bill

Clinton's Arkansas administration with a widely quoted feminist appeal:

Instead of baking cookies, "what I decided to do was pursue my

profession." That same day, she also made a corporatist appeal: "For

goodness sakes, you can't be a lawyer if you don't represent banks."

That's Clintonism.

<p>In November 1994, Republicans triumphed after White House

policies--the North American Free Trade Agreement, urban neglect, the

health reform fiasco--had dispirited and demobilized the Democratic

Party's grass-roots base. That's Clintonism.

<p>On the eve of the 1996 election, Democratic momentum to regain

majority control of Congress was halted by revelations of Clinton-Gore

fund-raising abuses. That's Clintonism.

<p>The Clintons and Gore came to national power in alliance with the

Democratic Leadership Council, an outfit underwritten by corporations

that prods Democrats to support a wish list of proposals (free trade,

admitting China to the World Trade Organization, Social Security

privatization) that are as popular with big business as they are

unpopular with ordinary Americans, especially rank-and-file Democrats.

<p>Despite long-standing disagreements with the president on issues,

left-liberals in Congress felt compelled to defend him in 1998 against

impeachment and what they saw as "sexual McCarthyism." That forced unity

behind Clinton has helped enforce unity behind Gore.

<p>Now, seven months before the election, many Democratic activists and

some Congress members can add Elian Gonzalez to the list of issues on

which they march to a different drummer than the man heading their

ticket.

<p>Yet, come August, rather than obey party unity behind Gore's

zigzagging party line, some activist Democrats will join protests outside

the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles. Some will explore Ralph Nader's

Green Party campaign.

<p>And a deeper reckoning is inevitable when enough Democrats realize

that Clintonism can survive while the rest of the party and its core

beliefs are slowly triangulated to death.
