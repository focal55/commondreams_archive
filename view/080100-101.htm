I have written columns each year to commemorate the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but lately I have been reading John Keegan's history of World War I, and the violence of August was what struck me as I prepared to write this - the ''Guns of August,'' as Barbara Tuchman put it. I began to take reference and history books almost at random off my shelves. All at once the days of the month began to unfold as a literal chronology of war, from early in the century to late, altering the context even of those most horrible atomic bombs. Here, listed by date and year, is what I found:


<p>Aug. 1, 1914: Germany declares war on Russia.


<p>Aug. 2, 1990: Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait.


<p>Aug. 3, 1914: Germany invades Belgium, declares war on France, the start of World War I.


<p>Aug. 5, 1949: China has fallen to the Communist forces of Mao Tse-Tung.


<p>Aug. 6, 1945: Hiroshima.


<p>Aug. 7, 1964: The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, the start of the Vietnam War.


<p>Aug. 9, 1945: Nagasaki.


<p>Aug. 13, 1961: The Berlin Wall begins to go up, to be completed in four days.


<p>Aug. 14, 1980: Poland cracks down on workers. Solidarity goes on strike in Gdansk.


<p>Aug. 19, 1981: US warplanes shoot down two Libyan jets 60 miles off the Libyan coast.


<p>Aug. 19, 1991: Reactionaries in Russia launch a coup against Mikhail Gorbachev.


<p>Aug. 20, 1968: Soviet forces invade Czechoslovakia, ending the Prague Spring.


<p>Aug.20, 1998: Clinton orders an attack against a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan.


<p>Aug. 31, 1983: The Soviet Union shoots down a civilian airliner, KAL 007.


<p>During the month of August in 1962, several thousand Soviets secretly come to Cuba to construct missile launchers, which are exposed in October.


<p>In late August of 1949, the Soviet Union explodes its first atomic bomb, beginning the nuclear arms race.


<p>By late August in 1939, German divisions are in place for the Sept. 1 invasion of Poland, the start of World War II.


<p>Such a chronology makes one wish to be able to remove this month from the calendar of history, but it also makes one wonder if there is something in the late summer that unleashes the dark energy of the human heart?


<p>Obviously, most of these events were driven by forces that had no regard for dates, yet when seen together it seems odd that so many momentous occurrences took place in these very weeks. And then one remembers that the month is named for Caesar Augustus, who transformed Rome from a republic into a dictatorship. Augustus was an emperor who claimed to be the son of God, and used his army to prove it.


<p>Is it possible to transform the meaning of this month of guns? With that question in mind, let me make a modest proposal to President Clinton and Vice President Gore. For several years now, the Democrats, for clearly political reasons, have gone along with the Republican-driven momentum toward the creation of the Missile Defense Shield, the wildly expensive, unnecessary, unworkable, and dangerous program that is opposed by this nation's friends and rivals both.


<p>It can be argued that Clinton's temporizing on Missile Defense and his piecemeal approval of steps toward it have deprived the Republicans of a potent campaign issue. But with the failure of the most recent missile test early this month, coupled with the crescendo of criticism that the program provoked at the recent summit in Japan, and with Clinton's own long-set schedule for an up-or-down decision, the time for temporizing is over.


<p>What if Bill Clinton chose this month to make a definitive choice against Missile Defense, with a clear explanation to the American people of its risks and costs. He could claim credit for his temporizing as mere prudence, while emphasizing that the preliminary testing of prototypes it made possible has demonstrated that the system will not work.


<p>At last, instead of trying to neutralize missile defense as a political issue, Clinton could undercut hawks in Congress and in the Pentagon by choosing this most political of moments to put the question before the public. It would be his cleverest move yet. Such a reversal would immediately benefit Al Gore, who could make his own considered opposition to Missile Defense the centerpiece of his presidential campaign. Now there would be an absolute difference between the candidates, and the gravity of the question would galvanize the campaign.


W
<p>hat liberal could vote for Ralph Nader in this context? The Republicans would eagerly join such a debate, much as Barry Goldwater did in 1964. Because of a momentous choice set before it in August, the American electorate would cast its most important vote, perhaps ever, on the issue of war and peace. That would change the meaning of this month for sure. I, for one, am confident that the result of such a national plebiscite on the arms race would be the end of it.
