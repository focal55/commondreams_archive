WASHINGTON -- The unprecedented demonstrations that shook Seattle during last
fall's World Trade Organization meeting provided powerful evidence of the
discomfort millions of Americans feel regarding trade policies that harm
workers, the environment, human rights and democracy.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<p>But after presidential primaries that featured competition on the Republican
and Democratic side between militant free traders, the question arose: What
outlet is there going to be for that discomfort? It's like Jim Hightower says in
the title of his fine new book: "If the Gods Had Meant Us to Vote, They Would
Have Given Us Candidates.''</p>
<p>Until the political debate that is needed on these issues develops, the mood
of the masses will be expressed not in the voting booth but in the streets. And
next month, street-level democracy will find expression in Washington, where the
right to assemble will be exercised with some frequency. A series of mid-April
demonstrations sponsored by labor, religious and human rights organizations will
bring the struggle for more humane economic policies to the nation's capital.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the proximity to power will have at least some impact on our
stilted political debate.</p>
<p>The centerpiece event will be protests set to coincide with the April 16-19
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, prime movers
with the WTO in the global push for economic restructuring that removes
democratic control over decisions about trade, agriculture and social welfare
policies.</p>
<p>"On the occasion of the first meetings of the governing bodies of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the 21st century, we call for
the immediate suspension of the policies and practices that have caused
widespread poverty, inequality and suffering among the world's peoples and
damage to the world's environment,'' reads the call for Washington
demonstrations signed by activists with the Jubilee 2000 movement, Global
Exchange, the Campaign for Labor Rights and the 50 Years is Enough Movement --
all of which have sought to relieve the crushing debt on developing nations.</p>
<p>Noting the role that the IMF and the World Bank have played in weakening
protections for workers in developing lands, the manifesto continues: "We assert
the responsibility of these anti-democratic institutions, together with the
World Trade Organization, for an unjust world economic system. We note that
these institutions are controlled by wealthy governments, and that their
policies have benefited international private-sector financiers, transnational
corporations and corrupt officials.''</p>
<p>The protests against IMF and World Bank policies will center on a large
demonstration on April 16. But, in the spirit of the Seattle protests, the full
week leading up to that Sunday demonstration will feature actions designed to
illustrate a host of related economic, trade and debt relief concerns. Key
events during the week include:</p>
<p>** April 9 -- Jubilee 2000/USA's "break the chains of debt'' protest to
encourage elimination of debts owed by the world's poorest nations. This will be
the largest demonstration ever on U.S. soil by the Jubilee 2000 movement, which
has already succeeded in persuading a number of wealthy governments to write off
debts owed them by impoverished nations.</p>
<p>** April 12 -- Rallies and lobbying by labor and human rights groups against
granting permanent most-favored nation trading status to China. The Clinton
administration and congressional Republicans continue to press for permanent MFN
status, which would allow China and corporations doing business there to avoid
scrutiny of human rights abuses, the use of prison labor, suppression of free
trade unions, China's occupation of Tibet and environmental issues.</p>
<p>** April 14 -- Sweatshop teach-in, organized by the Campaign for Labor Rights
and co-sponsored by United Students Against Sweatshops and Global Exchange, to
promote efforts like that of University of Wisconsin students to use consumer
and political pressure to force corporations to stop abusing Third World
workers.</p>
<p>** April 14 -- International Forum on Globalization dialogues on corporate
monopolies and the damage to consumers, workers and democracy that results from
concentration of ownership of key industries in a handful of multinational
corporations. Former UW Professor Robert McChesney, a leading critic of global
media monopolies and the author of the book "Rich Media, Poor Democracy,'' will
be among the featured speakers.</p>
<p>** April 15 -- Latin America solidarity conference designed to highlight the
damage done to nations such as El Salvador by outside pressures to privatize
public services. In Salvador in recent weeks, the streets have been filled with
demonstrations against privatization of hospitals and clinics -- a move favored
by bankers and multinational corporations but dreaded by people who fear they
will be priced out of a for-profit health care system.</p>
<p>The activism in Washington is sure to take many forms as these
fast-developing protests take shape in the weeks to come. To keep track of them
all, check out the mobilization Web site at: <a href="http://www.a16.org"><i>www.a16.org</i></a>.</p>
