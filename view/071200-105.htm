It has been a difficult few days for Lieutenant- General Ronald Kadish, director of America's Ballistic Missile Defence Organisation. At the weekend he invited friends over to show them his new intercontinental missile defence shield, and isn't it always the way; the bloody thing didn't work. A Minuteman II was fired from southern California. Another missile was fired from 4,500 miles away in the middle of the Pacific ocean to intercept the oncoming warhead, but apparently the necessary electronic signal was not received at the correct time or something. That'll teach him not to read the manual beforehand.
<P>It all happened so quickly; suddenly the missile was careering off target, billions of dollars of military hardware was heading in the wrong direction at 16,000mph and Ronald was frantically skimming through the chapter entitled Care of Your Minuteman Missile System. Then his wife had a better idea: "Quick phone the helpline!" And while the president was demanding to know what was going on, the poor general was stuck listening to a recorded message that said "Thank you for calling the ICBM helpline. If you wish to purchase other Minuteman missile systems, press 1. If you are phoning about our direct debit payment plan, press 2. If your intercontinental missile has malfunctioned and is hurtling toward southern California, press 3 and hold for an operator." Then they played a tinny version of Bolero as the general watched $100bn go up in smoke.
<P>It was the most expensive fireworks display of all time, but like our own River of Fire, it was a bit of a disappointment. Everyone went "ooohhh" but there was no "aaahhh". Not even Mrs. Kadish's delicious mulled wine and the packet of sparklers could offer much consolation. Hundreds of people covered their eyes in embarrassed disbelief. It was like the premier of John Travolta's Battlefield Earth all over again.
<P> This is not the first time America's missile systems have missed their target. During the Gulf war, a great deal was made of the Patriot missiles' ability to knock out the oncoming Scuds. The Patriots were declared a huge success because out of 22 Scuds fired, 21 were intercepted. But this is where the US military use a different language to the rest of us.
<P>As everyone remembers, lots of Scuds got through and caused enormous damage. So a Pentagon spokesman was forced to explain that when they said "intercepted", they meant that the path of the Patriot crossed the path of the Scud, though not necessarily at the same time. So "intercepted" means "missed". If modern defence   strategists had planned the D-day landings, the allied forces would have found themselves wading ashore at Torremolinos.
<P>Despite the US spending $122bn on missile defence systems, they have yet to develop anything which actually defends anyone against missiles. Perhaps I'm being over-picky, but you would have thought that this wasn't really good enough. And even though it is no longer clear who is going to declare war on the world's only super-power, the man who may well be the next president, George W Bush, remains a great supporter of the Stars Wars project. America may have token enemies like Iraq or Libya, but they're no more likely to launch intercontinental missile attacks than Darth Vader himself.
<P>Instead of spending unfeasibly large amounts of money on the unworkable national defence shield, the Pentagon would be better off buying a Super Soaker XP 2000 (slogan, Wetter is Better). Admittedly it is unlikely that the Super Soaker would actually intercept any incoming nuclear missiles but it's got about the same chance as anything else they have tried while having the advantage of being cheaper. Even if the Pentagon eventually upgraded to the more expensive Super Soaker Monster XL with multiple nozzles and extra large reservoir, they would still save a fortune.
<P>Of course, when it comes to military spending the cash is always available. They could launch an aircraft carrier that didn't float and still get funding for another one. Why is it that enormous amounts of taxpayers' money are always available for defence spending, and yet if it is education or health we have to help make up the shortfall ourselves? You don't get soldiers' wives organising summer fetes to raise money for much needed nuclear warheads. "Tank rides round the square 50p." "Throw a wet sponge at the general - three goes for a pound." I suppose the sponge would only fly off in the wrong direction and land on the napalm barbecue.
<P>If the smart bombs were that smart they would decommission themselves and redirect the much needed funding towards health, education and overseas aid. It wasn't the missile that missed the target this week. It was all that money that went up in smoke with it.
