Early Sunday morning, a group of 60 armed men entered a poor 

neighborhood in the town of Cienaga, on Colombia's Caribbean coast. The 

gunmen, who police say carried a list of people they were seeking, kidnapped 

10 residents from their homes, dragged them to an isolated part of town, 

interrogated them, then executed them.
<p>Before dispatching their victims, 

the killers accused them of collaborating with left-wing guerrillas who operate 

in the area, witnesses told Colombian newspapers.
<p>The massacre in 

Cienaga was just one of four that occurred this past weekend.
<p>In another 

attack, men dressed in military fatigues and wearing the insignias of the 

right-wing Colombian Self-Defense Group entered a discotheque in the Cauca 

region near Cali and executed three patrons. The gunmen then invaded a 

nearby housing project, where they killed another four people.
<p>All told, 28 

people lost their lives in the latest weekend of this hemisphere's oldest civil 

war. Most of the 35,000 deaths so far, according to human rights groups, 

have come at the hands of the Colombian Army or civilian death squads 

linked to it.
<p>Cienaga is not very far from the city of Cartagena, where 

President Clinton will meet tomorrow with Colombian President Andres 

Pastrana.
<p>Amid big fanfare &#151; and even bigger security &#151; 

Clinton will inaugurate a  $1.3 billion, two-year aid package for Colombia's war 

against drugs. That is more than all the military aid our country will give to the 

rest of Latin America.
<p>Most of the money and the 60 U.S. helicopters that 

are part of the package will go to the Colombian Army, which has the worst 

human rights record in the hemisphere.
<p>When he signed the bill authorizing 

the aid last week, Clinton could not avoid the question of why so much 

largess for a bunch of thugs. He didn't even pretend to try. He simply waived 

the requirement by Congress that Colombia show progress on its human rights 

record.
<p>The army will use the aid against the cocoa-growing and 

drug-processing areas of the south. It will be helped in this by more than 100 

U.S. Special Forces soldiers who are in the country to train special 

battalions.
<p>The south also happens to be the area where the 

Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, the most 

potent insurgent group in the country, has its strongest base.
<p>The army, 

we are told, will not be targeting the northern part of the country, where the 

right-wing death squads, which also have extensive links to the drug trade, 

operate.
<p>Right here in Queens, where most of the city's Colombians live, 

the effects of the escalation of Colombia's civil war can already be 

seen.
<p>&quot;Middle-class professionals are leaving the country in 

droves,&quot; said Arturo Sanchez, a Colombian-born professor at Pratt 

Institute, who has been studying the migration of his countrymen.
<p>Many of 

the new migrants are fleeing the political troubles and the economic crisis that 

has accompanied those troubles, Sanchez said. Nearly 2 million Colombians 

have been internally displaced by the war, and more than 10% of Colombia's 

33 million people now live abroad, mostly in the United States, Venezuela, 

Ecuador, Spain &#151; and even in Japan.
<p>But sending military aid and 

advisers is not the solution.
<p>&quot;This could be the beginning of another 

Vietnam,&quot; Sanchez said.
<p>Last Friday night, nearly 200 Colombian 

immigrants packed the public library in Corona. They came to listen to Ignacio 

Gomez, one of Colombia's most respected investigative journalists, and the 

local leaders of the Movement for Peace in Colombia.
<p>One speaker after 

another condemned the Clinton aid package. 
<p>Down south, every country 

bordering Colombia is sending troops to the border. Each is worried sick about 

the Special Forces and all that military aid &#151; and what it could 
bring.
<p>This is like the rerun of a terrible movie. You'd think somebody in 

Washington would know what the Colombians in Queens already know. The 

end of this will not be good.
