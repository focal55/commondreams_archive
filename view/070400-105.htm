<p>The startling concentration of economic power that has resulted from the
U.S. merger wave of the last several years is going to require new levels
of government intervention in the marketplace. 

<p>Either the federal and state governments will act to break up monopolistic
and oligopolistic corporations, or government agencies will assume
regulatory authority of a kind largely abandoned in the United States, or
consumers will be gouged and innovation stifled.

<p>Case in point: the oil industry and skyrocketing gasoline prices -- now
over $2.00 gallon in parts of the Midwest.

<p>Vigorous antitrust enforcement may be preferable to government regulation.
But government regulation of industry is certainly preferable to industry
regulation of consumers and the marketplace.

<p>A year and a half ago, when Exxon and Mobil merged in an effective effort
to begin restoration of John Rockefeller's Standard Oil, the conventional
wisdom was that the merger would not affect gas prices.

<p>"The change in the structure of the industry is such that the trend toward
lower gasoline prices and more efficient distribution of gasoline is well
underway and this is not going to stop it," one analyst said to National
Public Radio in a typical remark of the day.

<p>The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel went so far as to say that predictions
that the Exxon-Mobil merger would increase prices were "delusional."

<p>Now, conventional wisdom is rapidly changing. 

<p>With oil prices skyrocketing nationwide, prices spiking in the Midwest and
industry profits reaching stratospheric heights, even the Clinton
administration has called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate
whether the oil industry is illegally colluding to raise prices.

<p>The oil industry, as always, has a series of rationalizations for the
sudden jump in gas prices.

<p>OPEC has cut production and world prices have risen, say industry
representatives, even as global demand is increasing. That's true, but it
does not account either for the unique price spike in the Midwest, nor for
the surge in industry profits.

<p>New requirements to sell cleaner-burning gasoline have boosted prices, the
industry complains, and led to special difficulties in the Midwest, where
refiners use ethanol instead of alternative blending components. That's
true, but the Environmental Protection Agency -- noting that the oil
industry has had six years to prepare itself for the implementation of
cleaner fuel standards that the industry helped negotiate -- says the
cleaner-burning gas should only cost 4 to 7 cents more per gallon.

<p>The industry also complains that a Unocal patent on a means to formulate
cleaner-burning gas has impeded the use of the most efficient gasoline
formulation techniques. That may be, but it doesn't begin to account for
the huge price increases, the price spike in the Midwest, or the
industry's outsized profits.

<p>It is hard to escape the conclusion that some significant part of the
story involves industry profiteering -- with the oil giants using the
input cost increases from OPEC and the reformulated gasoline standards as
cover to pile on additional charges. 

<p>Whether these extra charges were the product of collusive agreements or
"conscious parallelism" can only be determined through an investigation
that involves close questioning of key industry executives and careful
review of industry documents.

<p>Either way, the profiteering is a product of industry concentration. Fewer
industry leaders (and there certainly are fewer, following the recent
mergers of Exxon and Mobil, BP and Amoco and BP Amoco and ARCO) make
price-fixing much easier, whether done through overt and illegal agreement
or follow-the-leader pricing without illegal collusion.

<p>There may be legitimate public policy rationales for raising gas prices --
notably, to spur conservation -- but if so, such price increases should be
government mandated, with revenues used for appropriate public purposes.
They should not be the result of industry rip-offs and profiteering.

<p>Absent government initiative to bust up the oil trust, these kinds of
price increases are bound to continue haunting the United States -- unless
the government chooses to regulate Big Oil.

<p>The first and most pressing need is for a windfall profits tax, to put an
end to the industry's gain from consumer's pain due to OPEC and other
input cost increases. 

<p>A second and relatively modest step would involve the issuance of a
compulsory license to require Unocal to let competitors use its
clean-burning gas patent. A patent monopoly cannot be permitted to  
block implementation of effective technologies to clean the environment.
Representatives Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, John Baldacci, D-Maine, Frank
Pallone, D-New Jersey, and Tom Barrett, D-Wisconsin, have introduced
legislation to make this possible.

<p>Finally, it is time to think seriously about price controls. Richard Nixon
did. The oil giants clearly do not have complete control over gas prices,
but they do have the ability to set prices above competitive rates. Why
should industry regulate the market instead of democratic government
authorities?

<p>There are many needed measures on the demand side -- to increase energy
efficiency and facilitate a rapid transition to solar and other clean
energy alternatives -- but these are not a short-term solutions. Only
direct government regulation will stop the oil oligopoly from persisting
in its price gouging.
