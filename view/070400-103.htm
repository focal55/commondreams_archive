These days, Congress high-tails it out of Washington so fast on the eve of
the Independence Day holiday that the only debate that ever takes place on July
4 revolves around the question of which fireworks display to view.
<p>But it wasn't always so.</p>
<p>On July 4, 1864, as the Civil War raged not far from the nation's Capitol,
members of Congress were engaged in one of the most significant -- if now mostly
forgotten -- debates in American history. The good guys won, only to be
vanquished in the end by the man they had made president.</p>
<p>While Washington was at its usual summer boil, historian John C. Waugh
recalls, &quot;Inside the icy-looking dome (of the Capital), it was oven-hot.''
And Waugh was not talking merely about the summer weather. He was referring to
&quot;the daily rise of both the thermometer and congressional tempers.''</p>
<p>At issue was the question of how the armies of the Republic, which were
slowly gaining the upper hand over the armies of the Confederacy, would treat
the former slave states they had occupied. Would the Unionist government permit
a gentle postwar reconstruction in which slavery might even be permitted in some
states -- or, at the least, sharecropping and other forms of structural economic
repression that were really just slavery-lite? Or would there be radical
reconstruction designed to banish slavery, sharecropping and other forms of
racial and economic discrimination in order to form a new and more perfect
union?</p>
<p>While President Abraham Lincoln, desperate to reunite a broken nation, went
ahead with a mild form of reconstruction, the Congress opted for a radical
remake that would banish slavery once and for all and bring a measure of justice
to the South.</p>
<p>Led by Maryland's Henry Winter Davis in the House and Ohio's Benjamin
Franklin Wade in the Senate, the radical reconstructionists pushed through
legislation crafted to push Lincoln toward a more militant position -- with the
purpose of ensuring that the postwar South would not return to its old ways. By
July 2, 1864, both the House and Senate had passed the legislation.</p>
<p>Lincoln had until July 4 to sign the reconstruction bill. But the president
did not intend to do so; rather, he determined to let it die with a &quot;pocket
veto'' -- effectively killing the measure by failing to sign it by the time
Congress adjourned.</p>
<p>As the clock ticked down, the great battlers against slavery trooped to the
president's office and begged him to do the right thing. But Lincoln rejected
their entreaties. When Michigan Sen. Zachariah Chandler told the president of
the bill's key element -- &quot;The important point is that one prohibiting
slavery in the reconstructed states'' -- Lincoln replied, &quot;That is the
point on which I doubt the authority of Congress to act,'' the deed was done.</p>
<p>Surely, there is much for which to honor Abraham Lincoln. But in an honest
democracy, it is worthy to question even our icons. And, on this issue,
Wisconsin's radical Republicans angrily challenged Lincoln -- as did their
allies in other passionately anti-slavery states -- on that bitter July 4 of
1864.</p>
<p>The vision of a radical reconstruction that might have succeeded in
transforming the land in those difficult postwar years was doomed by Lincoln on
this day 136 years ago, and with it the hope that America would soon achieve the
promise of &quot;liberty and justice for all.''</p>
