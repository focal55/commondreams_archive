This past week the Federal Reserve issued a report gravely warning that employers were having to pay a little more to attract employees.  Fast-food joints and warehouses and nursing homes were having to pay above the minimum wage.
<P>
<P>Low-wage workers - imagine - were actually getting some raises. The stock market, of course, tanked.
<P>
<P>Presumably, workers getting raises means that the economy is doing too well and courting inflation, so the ever-vigilant Fed will have to cool it down with higher interest rates. Which will throw some people out of work. Which will remind workers to be grateful for what they get.  Which will then restore profits and reassure investors.
<P>
<P>So let's see: Workers can't get raises when the economy is cold because companies can't afford it (and when unemployment is high, workers have no bargaining power anyway.)  But when the economy is hot, workers musn't get raises either, or Alan Greenspan will end the party. So when can they get raises?
<P>
<P>Is this the only way to run an economy? Doesn't anybody have a better set of rules?
<P>
<P>In 1992, President Clinton got elected on a platform called Putting People First. His centerpiece was the promise that if you worked full time, you wouldn't be poor. But today, despite record economic expansion, millions of full-time workers are still officially poor.
<P>
<P>But it needn't be like this. We already have the tools to lift every single full-time worker out of poverty - and the result needn't be inflationary.
<P>
<P>There is no single magic bullet. It requires several remedies working in tandem. Here are the important ones:
<P>
<P>Higher minimum wages. For most of the postwar boom, the minimum wage was worth more in real purchasing power than it is today. That boom was a time of high growth and very low inflation.
<P>
<P>More generous earned-income tax credits. Thanks to the EITC - a kind of negative income tax for low-wage workers with families - millions of working people have been lifted out of poverty. It could reach millions more.
<P>
<P>A kinder, gentler brand of welfare reform. Welfare reform literally gave the states the means to end poverty by making work pay. A few, led by Washington state, are creatively using the money to make sure people going from welfare to work have the necessary tools to succeed - reliable child care, training that leads to career ladders, wage subsidies, family back-up systems. But most states are mainly purging the welfare rolls and pocketing the savings.
<P>
<P>Better education. Highly skilled workers generally can extract better pay. But skills are not the whole story, since plenty of very highly trained workers have also lost bargaining power in the new economy.
<P>
<P>Stronger unions. In the global, deregulated economy, too, many companies just treat their employees as interchangeable commodities. It's no accident that everyone from doctors to janitors to library assistants is rediscovering the value of unions.
<P>
<P>Social income. One way to raise living standards for all with no risk whatever of wage inflation is to provide basic economic needs as citizen entitlements rather than fringe benefits (which show up as labor costs). For example, if every citizen had health insurance, employers would not see health premiums as a source of inflation. If day care were universal, that would be one less drain on family pocketbooks. If the government resumed subsidizing affordable housing, millions of stressed families would not be spending a third of their earnings on rent. And if we taxed the very affluent to pay the costs, that would help equalize incomes overall.
<P>
<P>During the post-World War II boom, average living standards doubled in a generation. If the present boom holds up, we will repeat that trick by 2025.
<P>
<P>But in that boom, unlike this one, society actually became more equal. Today, it's becoming more unequal.
<P>
<P>The key difference, as MIT labor economist Frank Levy observes, is that the postwar era had stronger equalizing institutions - everything from more reliable unions and laws that increased worker bargaining power to more benign employers, better fringe benefits, and social insurance.
<P>
<P>A set of rules that views rising worker pay as a danger signal is one way to run an economy, but not the only way.
<P>
<P>Better ways are available, and we need a real national debate about how to make work pay. The fault is not Alan Greenspan's. It's ours. In a democratic system, politics is the way we make fundamental choices about the economy. But in this depleted democracy, the most important economic debates are off the political table.
