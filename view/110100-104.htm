What made more than 40,000 Maine Republicans cast primary ballots for Sen. John McCain's insurgent candidacy for the GOP presidential nomination? It wasn't his abortion stance, or his views on international trade.

<P> No, what fired the imagination of Republicans (not to mention the interest of independents and envious Democrats, too) was McCain's personal integrity. It was his opposition to special interests. It was his unshakable commitment to campaign finance reform.</P>
<P> McCain may now be campaigning in Florida and California with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, but his followers aren't fooled. Bush is no McCain.</P>
<P> McCain supporters still have a candidate in the race, however, and his name is Ralph Nader.</P>
<P> Before you write this off as sheer lunacy, listen to the two men on the "McCain" issues that Maine residents care about &#150; not his substantive positions, but his call for procedural reform:</P>
<P>  Eliminating "Big Money" from political campaigns.</P>
<P> McCain: "I have called for the reform of campaign finance practices that have sacrificed our principles to the demands of big money. . . . I have spoken against forces that have turned politics into a battle of bucks instead of a battle of ideas. And for that I have been accused of disloyalty to my party."</P>
<P> Nader: "We must end the dominance and corruption of our political system by the influence of big money."</P>
<P>  Eliminating "Soft Money" from political campaigns.</P>
<P> McCain: "That is the problem I am trying to address with (my) legislation, and no attack, no amount of head-in-the-sand pretense that soft money doesn't affect legislation will cause me to desist in my efforts. And I would close with one observation &#150; if special interests did not believe that their millions of dollars in donations buy them special consideration in the legislative process, then, Mr. President, those special interests - who have a fiduciary responsibility to their stockholders &#150; wouldn't give us that money, would they?" </P>
<P> Nader: "Soft-money contributions have spiraled out of control. Powerful interests give large sums of money in the expectation that their voices will be heard on Capitol Hill and in the White House. In many cases, large contributors give to both the Democratic and Republican National Committees, or even to two competing candidates, expecting to have influence regardless of election outcomes."</P>
<P>  Special interests.</P>
<P> McCain: Let's "break the Washington Iron Triangle of big money, lobbyists, and legislation that for too long has put special interests before the national interest."</P>
<P> Nader: "The basic approach here is that the political system has been hijacked by corporate power and the people are left without a countervailing force against . . . the excesses of moneyed interests. And when you have that kind of unified concentration of power and wealth, what might be called the corporate government, the policies favor the few over the many."</P>
<P> They even sound similar themes when it comes to consumer protection. Referring to the Firestone tire debacle, Nader says, "Criminal sanctions are common in consumer and transportation statutes. Violations by motor carriers, hazardous materials handlers, pipelines, railroads, water vessels, and airlines all are subject to criminal sanctions. . . . It is past the time when these sanctions should be included in the auto safety law for knowingly failing to recall safety defective vehicles that can kill or injure or knowingly violating motor vehicle safety standards."</P>
<P> McCain couldn't agree more. As chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, he introduced the Motor Vehicle and Motor Vehicle Equipment Defect Notification Improvement Act, which calls for criminal penalties for manufacturers that knowingly sell a vehicle with a safety-related defect that causes death or serious injury, increases the current cap on civil penalties from $900,000 to $15 million and allows the secretary of transportation to seek even greater penalties if the conduct is intentional. </P>
<P> I could go on. Take the Clinton impeachment trial. McCain voted to impeach the president, a vote Nader wholeheartedly endorses. McCain was the first to call Bush's record on the environment the worst of any governor's in the country &#150; Nader agrees. </P>
<P> And Nader wasn't the first to suggest Bush isn't ready to be president &#150; it was McCain who initially questioned his fitness for the nation's highest office.</P>
<P> When you get down to what attracted Mainers to McCain, it was all about reforming the political process. Republicans and independents who were disappointed by McCain's loss in the primaries can still vote for a candidate who speaks truth to power, who will oppose the special interests in Washington, and who would make campaign finance reform the hallmark of his presidency. They can still do better than Bush.</P>
<P> They can vote for Nader next week. </P>
