MELBOURNE, Australia<wbr>--<wbr>The suits on the buses mostly sat quietly, working their cell
phones in part because there was little else to do. The buses, which were
to transport them to the large convention hotel housing the World
Economic Forum's annual Asia conference, were not moving. Blocking their
way three blocks from the glistening Crown Towers complex, where the
official sessions were to be held, were row after row of arm-linked
protesters. There were thousands of them, and many who were braving the
brisk breezes of the nippy Australian spring were women and children.
These protesters may not have understood all the nuances, complexities
and yield curves of globalization. But they knew they didn't like this
scary global phenomenon one bit.
<p>This World Economic Forum provided the juiciest target since the riots
last December in Seattle, scene of the now-infamous World Trade
Organization fiasco. True, the WEF, unlike the WTO, is a nongovernmental
organization with no formal power to legislate or administer or
adjudicate. Still, the wide-roving talk-tank, which also holds an annual
January conclave in Switzerland, presented an irresistible target of
opportunity for these protesters. Before long, about 750 or so WEF
invitees--CEOs, government officials, policy intellectuals, media
leaders, academics and WEF officials themselves who had flown in from
their Geneva headquarters--didn't know what hit them.
<p>On Monday morning, when it dawned on police that they could be facing
another Seattle, the WEF invitees were warned of the brewing trouble.
Spurning the buses with their police escorts, some of the invitees
sauntered up to the barricades and tried their best to charm their way
through. It was a no go. So at the outset, this was a conference whose
attendance was severely restricted, as the hotel site was wholly
encircled by protesters well before the police realized how many there
were and what they were up to. In frustration, near the end of the day
some delegates agreed to be airlifted to the hotel rooftop by police
helicopters, or, with a James Bond-like panache, sped to the site by
motor launch across the Yarra River.
<p>The attitude inside was defiant but concerned; and there was less
gloating about the unmitigated benefits of globalization than the
protesters outside might have imagined. Sure, Australia's Prime Minister
John Howard proclaimed globality "the ticket to prosperity for poor
nations." This is the pro-globalization party line. But there were plenty
of suits inside who had their doubts, though not in the way of many of
the protesters, who regard globalization mostly as a cover for the
multinational corporate pillaging of the poor. On the inside, doubts
about the health of the Asia Pacific regional economy, increasingly
globalized as it is, were common. A surprising number said the Asian
recovery probably would not continue. Australian Treasurer Peter Costello
complained bitterly in a riveting off-the-cuff opening address that too
little has been done in the region to repair the infamously flawed world
"financial architecture"--just a few years ago oft-cited as the root
cause of the crisis. Kenneth Courtis, Asia vice chairman of Goldman
Sachs, accused Japan of creating "a massive debt trap" for itself that
might trigger an even more deadly crisis.
<p>No, few if any of the angry protesters had any idea of the intensity
of the debate inside. For many of them, globalization is nothing more
than a global conspiracy designed to leave them behind and line the
pockets of the rich. When you're out of a job, or fear you're going to
lose one, this view seems more plausible than radical. Rapid
technological innovation, not just immense corporate greed, is the
driving force of the new millennium. The truth is that globalization is a
powerful force hurling all of us--wealthy or not--into an uncertain
future.
<p>But observing the many young faces of protest on the barricades, you
had to accept that these were the genuine, defiant ones of the new age,
with a resistance fueled not just by hatred of brutally unfeeling
corporations but also by the harsh facts of contemporary life. Many
people simply want to stop the world and get off. That this is their only
solution causes them no embarrassment. Rather than viewing globalization
as a ticket to prosperity, they see it as a ticket to nowhere. Nodding to
the tumult outside, economist Courtis warned his fellow rich and famous,
"It's too simple [to just preach to people], 'It's the markets, stupid.'
" Capitalism's global gladiators are going to have to come up with
something better than this if they are to convince others--and maybe even
themselves.
