As the election nears, Ralph Nader has drawn
attention from a media that had shown little prior interest in
his candidacy. The reason: there is a slight possibility that
Nader could take enough votes from Vice President Al Gore
to throw the race to George W. Bush.

         <p>For those who are concerned about this outcome, it
helps to know that in most states-- 38 at last count-- the
presidential race is pretty much decided.  So if you live in
any of those states, you can vote for Nader without fear that it
could contribute to a Bush presidency. That is the nature of
our winner-take-all, electoral college system.

         <p>What about the 12 states that could go either way?
Gore campaigners have mounted a sizeable effort to convince
Nader's supporters that "a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush."
Some have gone further-- the New York Times has written
two editorials denouncing Nader for running and telling him
to get out of the race.

         <p>"You gotta love these people," said Nader in an
interview with Harper's magazine. "They think the American
electoral process is a gated community."

         <p>Ralph Nader is there to bust open the gates, as he has
done throughout his career as the nation's most famous
consumer advocate. His decades of dedicated work helped
bring us the Freedom of Information Act, auto safety
improvements, environmental regulation and other reforms
that have saved millions of lives. Now he is trying to help
bring us real democracy.

         <p>And why not? If democracy is good enough for
Yugoslavia or Peru, why not for America? While nobody
steals elections here, our corporate elite does manage to buy
most of the politicians that participate. This leaves the
electorate to choose, all too often, between "two buttocks of
the same fat gentleman," as Christopher Hitchens so
eloquently described our ruling political parties.

         <p>Ironically, Ralph Nader is the candidate of the Center,
if we define that to be what most Americans support. Polls
show that most Americans want universal health insurance,
believe (correctly) that agreements like NAFTA have hurt
American workers, do not want to increase military spending,
and think that corporations have too much power. At least
some of these views would prevail if we had more
democratic elections.

         <p>Of course there are significant differences in rhetoric
and even some substance between the major Presidential
candidates. This will remain true so long as their parties have
some different constituencies: the Democrats after all, still
have unions, African-Americans, and women's organizations
as part of their base of support.

         <p>But politics is rife with unintended consequences.
Where party allegiance is minimal and principles are as
disposable as diapers, choosing the lesser among evils is not
so simple as it appears. For example, a strong case can be
made that President Clinton did more harm in his first term
than George Bush senior would have done. His "welfare
reform" worsened the plight of millions of poor women and
children. Mr. Clinton also lobbied furiously to get the
Democratic Congress of 1993 to pass NAFTA, breaking his
campaign promise to labor and environmental groups that he
would not support an agreement of this kind.

         <p>His botched attempt at health care reform that would
satisfy the big insurance companies set us back many years
on this issue. And Clinton's record on civil liberties was also
worse than that of his Republican predecessor.

<p>All this is not to argue that worse is better. But you do
have to take into account that there are instances in which a
Democratic president can get away with socially destructive
policies that a Republican, facing opposition from traditional
Democratic constituencies, would not.

<p>And there are a lot of issues on which Bush and Gore
have the same awful agenda. For example, both will continue
the "race to the bottom" in wages and environmental
standards through global trade and commercial agreements.
Both will persist in the failed "war on drugs" that has sent
hundreds of thousands of people unnecessarily to prison.
Both support increased military spending, including at least
$60 billion on a Star Wars missile defense system. (Gore is
somewhat more interventionist, and if we include the IMF
and World Bank as part of US foreign policy, Gore could
very well do more damage than Bush to the rest of the
world).

<p>Given these uncertainties, a vote for Nader is more
pragmatic than it may appear. His showing in this election
may prove to be more important than the contest between the
candidates of Big Money.

<p>Jesse Jackson is supporting the Democratic ticket, but
when Ralph Nader appeared on his television show, he
closed the interview with this advice to his audience: "Vote
your interests and your dreams, not your fears."
