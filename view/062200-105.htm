Each June, Americans rightfully honor the bravery and sacrifice of
the men who invaded Normandy in 1944. Recently, however, this celebration
has too often lapsed into a solipsistic and deeply flawed revision of the
U.S. role in World War II, which leads to equally self-congratulatory but
far more dangerous conclusions about America's purpose in the world
today. If Americans are to get a more balanced view of their history and
their global role, we should remember another June anniversary: today,
the 59th anniversary of Germany's invasion of Russia.
<p>A national mythology has emerged that in 1941 the United States,
appalled by the horrific policies of the Nazis, deliberately embarked on
a crusade to rid the world of Hitler and to stop the Holocaust. D-Day
was, according to this version of events, the decisive point in the "Good
War," when American troops, piously aware of the noble cause for which
they fought, began the military operations that defeated Nazi Germany.
Having beat Hitler and made possible a better world, the United States
remains to this day what Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declares
"the indispensable nation."
<p>Some reminders are in order.
<p>First, of course, such a view slights the anti-Japanese dimension of
the U.S. war, which was the real reason the United States had gone to war
in the first place. Nazi Germany declared war on the United States in
accord with its treaty with Japan; only then did the U.S. declare that
Germany was its enemy too. For most Americans, the purpose of the war
remained to exact revenge on the Japanese.
<p>Second, stopping the mass murder of the Jews didn't figure in any way
in either American war aims or conduct. As for American soldiers and
sailors, they fought the war, as historian and critic Paul Fussell
declares, "in an ideological vacuum." The war was "about your military
unit and your loyalty to it." Plainly put, they fought the war to end it
so that they could go home, a point of view entirely reasonable and even
courageous, but hardly high-minded.
<p>As far as the U.S. contribution to defeating the Nazis goes, even
though Time magazine anointed Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower as "The Man Who
Defeated Hitler," if any one man deserves that label, it's Soviet Army
Marshal G.K. Zhukov, or possibly Josef Stalin. The main scene of the
Nazis' defeat wasn't Normandy or anywhere else Americans fought, but
rather the Eastern Front, where the conflict was the most terrible war
fought in history. It claimed 50 million Soviet civilian deaths and 29
million Soviet military casualties. But more to the point, Americans
should recall that about 88% of all German casualties fell in the war
with Russia.
<p>Until the Normandy invasion--from June 1941 to June 1944--almost the
whole of the Nazi war machine was concentrated in the East; and even two
months after D-Day, well over half the German army was still fighting the
Soviets. Military historians date the war's turning point two years
before D-Day when, at Stalingrad, the Soviets eradicated 50 divisions
from the Axis order of battle, or nearly one year before when, at the
Battle of Kursk, the Red Army smashed the Wehrmacht's strategic tank
force, breaking the Nazis' capacity for large-scale attack. And it was
the Red Army that liberated Auschwitz and bore down on Hitler's bunker.
<p>The moral narcissism that characterizes recent American discussion of
our role in World War II breeds within too many of our statesmen a smug
and reckless pride. After all, the thinking goes, if history has shown
the United States to be so virtuous, then any that oppose us must be
evil.
<p>Today, Americans need not honor the Russian dead as we do our own, but
we should give credit where credit is due, and we must not make
exaggerated claims for ourselves. In contemplating how our WWII role
influences our conduct in the contemporary world, Americans should
remember that self-righteousness is bad enough, but when it springs
largely from a self-serving mythology, it is insufferable.
