<p>On Thursday, the state of Texas is scheduled to execute a
62-year-old great-grandmother with a horrifying history of beatings and
sexual abuse.

<p>Betty Lou Beets would become the second woman executed in Texas since
Gov. George W. Bush took office in 1995. To date, Bush has presided over
an astonishing 119 executions that, with a few notable exceptions, have
been greeted with remarkable indifference by Texans and the public at
large. The Beets case may prove to be another exception.
<p>Beets' death sentence raises a number of nettlesome questions for the
governor, not the least of which is whether the condemned woman's own
attorney sold her out for his own personal profit. Another is what the
people of Texas would actually gain by putting this woman to death. A
third is what Bush, the aspiring president, could lose.
<p>Bush is clearly no soft touch when it comes to clemency. In February
1998, he refused to intercede in the execution of Karla Faye Tucker, the
pick-ax murderer and born-again Christian whose cause was championed by
many of Bush's close friends on the religious right. So far, Bush has
commuted only one death sentence, that of Henry Lee Lucas, a convicted
serial murderer who the state sought to execute for a crime he almost
certainly did not commit.
<p>At first blush, Beets would seem an unlikely candidate to move the
governor. She was convicted in 1985 of murdering her fifth husband, Jimmy
Don Beets, a former Dallas fireman, by shooting him in the head. Jimmy
Don Beets was buried under a little wishing well at the front of his
mobile home just outside Gun Barrel, Texas. Mrs. Beets was also charged
in the death of her fourth husband, Doyle Wayne Barker, but that case
never came to trial. Barker was found buried under a shed at the back of
Beets' home with a bullet in his brain.
<p>Gov. Bush has said he applies two "standards" to clemency appeals. One
is evidence of innocence, such as that which came to light in Lucas'
case; another is whether a condemned prisoner has had full access to the
courts.
<p>Although Betty Lou Beets claims she is innocent, her appeal for
clemency goes to Bush's second standard. Beets says she was denied a fair
trial because her attorney deliberately withheld exculpatory and
mitigating evidence. Under Texas law, she could not be sentenced to death
unless the state proved that she murdered her husband so she could
recover a $100,000 pension and insurance policy.
<p>But Mrs. Beets says her attorney, E. Ray Andrews, deliberately failed
to tell the jury that she did not know about the insurance policy until
more than a year after her husband's murder, when Andrews himself told
her about it. Andrews, who has since served a three-year federal prison
sentence for extorting a bribe in another murder case, allegedly withheld
the evidence because he had obtained the literary and movie rights to
Beets' story in exchange for representing her. Had Andrews disclosed what
he knew about the insurance policy, he would have had to testify on
Beets' behalf, which would have meant withdrawing as her counsel and
losing what he viewed as the lucrative movie rights. Because Andrews kept
silent, the state's alleged motive was never seriously contested, and
Beets was sentenced to die.
<p>Andrews also failed to apprise the jury of Beets' long history of
sexual abuse. Beets' current attorneys claim she was raped when she was 5
years old, beaten repeatedly by her alcoholic father, and sexually and
physically assaulted and psychologically abused by a series of five
husbands. They argue that knowledge of this mitigating evidence might
have swayed a jury to conclude that Beets did not deserve to die for her
crime.
<p>In reviewing death sentences, Bush and his aides say he takes account
of a condemned individual's personal history--including such factors as
sexual abuse and family violence--as well as whether there was a fair
trial. In practice, however, the governor has yet to grant a single
clemency appeal for any of those reasons. Indeed, he has turned down
three clemency appeals in non-death cases by women who claimed they were
battered by their husbands, and he has allowed executions to proceed that
involved serious questions of due process. Governors in at least four
other states have commuted sentences of battered women in recent years.
<p>A coalition of domestic violence and women's rights groups has
appealed to Bush to grant a reprieve so that the evidence withheld from
Beets' jury can be examined. Safe Place, a domestic violence center in
Austin--on whose board the governor's wife, Laura, served until last
year--sent Bush a letter that called Beets' legal representation
"inadequate and egregiously compromised." The group claimed that Beets'
"long history of severe sexual and domestic violence . . . left her with
substantive psychological and physical impairments."
<p>Under Texas law, Bush cannot grant clemency without the recommendation
of the state Board of Pardons and Paroles. But Bush has appointed all 18
members of the board, and there is little doubt that if he made it known
he was concerned about Beets' apparent denial of due process, the board
would almost certainly grant a reprieve or commute her sentence to life
in prison.
<p>Bush should examine the evidence that Beets was denied a fair trial
and get his friends on the board to grant a reprieve so that the process
by which this woman was condemned to die can be examined. That could
conceivably take this potential tar baby off of the governor's hands
until after the election. It might also convince some voters concerned
about domestic violence that Bush is actually the "compassionate
conservative" he claims to be, and not just a rubber stamp for an endless
series of executions.
