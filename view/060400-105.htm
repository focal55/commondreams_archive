AN illusive principle of liberal democracy is the uplifting sentiment that fundamental change can be the stepchild of open debate. It sounds oh so good when you say it, but in the shadowy world of politics, the debate can be a sham and inaction the intent.<BR>
<BR>
  Yes, there are real differences between the parties. But the salient detail is that simulated passions obscure the words that can't be said and the solutions that can't be sought. And the fog of that silence reveals a history of change in which the Washington elite began mostly from the outside looking away.<BR>
<BR>
  In one respect, the great movements of the last century lent meaning to the democratic ideal because citizen demands produced seminal legislation. But frequently, it was a painfully slow process that required palpable crisis, violence in the streets and the belated cooperation of leaders whose first allegiance was to economic powers that profited from the status quo.<BR>
<BR>
  Thus, Social Security and unemployment insurance were socialist shibboleths until the breadlines of the 1930s. Without crisis, even Franklin Roosevelt might have failed, or not even tried. And to a shameful initial silence, social activists pursued bizarre hallucinations about the right of women to vote, of blacks to eat at lunch counters, and of workers to organize. In each case, Washington joined the fray after ordinary citizens moved vocally to the streets, and when the ensuing violence could no longer be ignored.<BR>
<BR>
  The reality is that with an eye toward the next election, forbidden topics are everywhere. We have reached the point where the sex life of the president can be more acceptable discourse than an unencumbered evaluation of the great and small issues of the day.<BR>
<BR>
  Consider some examples.<BR>
<BR>
  We take justifiable pride in our multifaceted economic successes. But we trail Europeans in defining indicators such as literacy, infant mortality, poverty, homelessness, life expectancy and economic inequality. We are giddy about the successes and give lip-service to the failures.<BR>
<BR>
  Is there a crisis in our value system?<BR>
<BR>
  Should taxes be raised to European levels so we can balance the economic playing field and pay for urgent needs like housing and health insurance?<BR>
<BR>
  Should we expand single-payer Medicare to single-payer for everyone?<BR>
<BR>
  Should the stopgap gun control debate seek to ban whole categories of weapons as is done in most of the developed world?<BR>
<BR>
  The list is endless, but when questions like these are forbidden fruit in Washington, political debate becomes narrowly orchestrated and mutually evasive.<BR>
<BR>
  Through the plight of one boy, we hear regularly about Cuban tyranny. But, we have supported far worse Latin American regimes and, during 40 years of sanctions, have ignored the facts that Cuba has the highest life expectancy in Latin America and is our only southern neighbor with universal health care, pervasive literacy and where the capital city is not pocketed with teeming shantytowns.<BR>
<BR>
  There is truth in the terrible downside of the Cuban experiment, but there is a second Cuban reality, and we only talk about the first.<BR>
<BR>
  U.S.-sponsored sanctions have killed hundreds of thousands of ordinary Iraqis, and we don't talk about it. Does Saddam's brutality justify the sanctions, despite the deaths? Maybe, and maybe not.<BR>
<BR>
  But where is political openness when the decision-making process does not even notice these deaths?<BR>
<BR>
  OUR 200-year legacy of stability and civil liberties has no parallel in human history. One reason for stability is that economic success breeds commitment and hope. And from that glorious First Amendment come the outlets of debate and protest, with the historical expectation that when civil disobedience seems necessary, the excessive response will have limits and be survivable.<BR>
<BR>
  But change is painfully slow if you are on the outside looking in, if you are sick but without medicine, if you have a job but no rent money. We will one day have the universal health care that is standard in less affluent allies. But for how many decades will we pretend that we can't afford it?<BR>
<BR>
  The refrain of an old civil rights song notes ruefully that &quot;the nice ways always fail.&quot; That caution is as relevant today as it was during Vietnam and the great battles for civil rights.<BR>
<BR>
  And so it will remain until we wrest the political process from our economic nobility, broaden the parameters of mainstream debate and give a well-earned burial to those things we can't discuss.<BR>
<BR>
  So it will remain until ideas get more media coverage than theater, and the message is more newsworthy than its delivery.<BR>
<BR>
  But if history is any guide, it may be a long time indeed before the nice ways are truly sufficient.<BR>
