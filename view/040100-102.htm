With health costs escalating and complaints mounting, politicians
promise us a fresh look at health care reform. One hopes the promise
will be kept. One old tale needing reexamination is the now virtually
axiomatic wisdom that the failure of the Canadian health system
"proves" single payer alternatives won't work. I would argue that, to
the contrary, the Canadian experience clearly demonstrates that
single payer systems remain the most equitable and efficient in the
world. Their crises are due to the attacks of the privatizers rather
than to their inherent limits.
<P>Earlier this year, the <I>New York Times</I> ran a feature article
in which it argued that "few Canadians would recommend their system
as a model for export." The article suggested that the system's
inefficiencies had become so great during the '90s that both the
provincial and federal governments had been forced to rein in health
costs.</P>
<P>Omitted in the <I>Times</I> analysis are two startling facts. Dean
Baker, an economist with the Preamble Center, reports that "According
to OECD data, in 1997 ... Canada spent 9.3 percent of its GDP on
health care. The United States spent 14 percent. Since the United
States is a wealthier country, the discrepancy in dollars spent is
even larger: $2,095 per person in Canada, compared with $4,090 for
the United States. Measured by health care outcomes, such as life
expectancy at birth or life expectancy at age 65, Canada's system
scores better than the US system."</P>
<P>Canadians are clearly staying healthier for fewer healthcare
dollars. Lower levels of poverty in Canada are part of this story,
but here in the US uncovered medical costs are a leading cause of
personal bankruptcy and poverty. In addition, in a single payer
system, where government accepts responsibility for all, there is an
incentive to emphasize primary and preventive care. Not only it is
generally cheaper to prevent disease than to cure it, prevention of
contagious diseases has enormous spillover effects.</P>
<P>By contrast, in the private marketplace, HMOs compete in
destructive or counterproductive ways -- through the clientele they
seek to include or exclude, the amount of service delivered, or
advertising. HMO incentives and the patient's need for adequate care
point in opposite directions.</P>
<P>Not only does such a system generally deliver inadequate medical
care, its purported ability to control costs has thus far proven to
be illusory. When the full advertising, profits, and administrative
review procedures are counted, "overhead" in our system runs at twice
the Canadian level.</P>
<P>Extraordinary medical costs do not explain Canada's economic or
healthcare problems. The world economic stagnation of the late '80s
and early '90s was accompanied by growing budget deficits in both the
United States and Canada. Economists debate the relationship of
deficits to economic development, but in both nations a choice was
made to address deficits by cuts in government spending, even
long-term investment in vital public resources like health care,
rather than raising taxes. In Canada's case the decision seemed even
more imperative given the vulnerability of the much smaller nation's
currency to international speculative pressures. These speculators
demanded of Canada, as of many debt-strapped "Third World" nations,
that they cut budgets and social services.</P>
<P>Health care became an especially inviting target as increasingly
mobile businesses argued that taxes for health care were making
Canada uncompetitive with U. S. businesses already eagerly slashing
their health care benefits. Since utilization rates for such
extraordinarily expensive new technologies as magnetic resonance
imagers are hard to predict, provincial governments tended to make
the most fiscally cautious short-term decisions. They cut back on
hospital beds, trimmed capital budgets for new technologies, and even
reduced admissions to Canadian medical schools. But since deployment
of new technologies and the development of appropriate supportive
personnel takes time, when new treatments demonstrate considerable
efficacy and become widely recommended and used for common diseases,
dramatic shortages not only will develop, they will be both obvious
and hard to address in the short term.</P>
<P>Years of health system starvation have had another unforeseen
effect: Canadians have demanded that provincial governments avail
themselves of the best American medical facilities. Quebec has ended
up paying not only hospital fees but also transportation and housing
costs for some of its citizens undergoing cancer therapies in US
hospitals. In such cases, costs to the Canadian government are much
higher than if adequate facilities had been budgeted for in the first
place.</P>
<P>In addition, many other affluent Canadians have simply paid for
care out of their own pockets in US clinics and hospitals. Since
these citizens are all "full payers," they receive the most prompt
and least bureaucratized care the US system provides. Some have now
become a political force in Canada arguing for such changes as user
fees and/or private hospitals</P>
<P>Nonetheless, despite the cries from affluent and the attacks in
the US media, the concept of equal healthcare for all paid for by
government still has many defenders in Canada. Many middle and
working class Canadians recognize quite rightly that they stand to
lose if the public system is replaced by a US-style alternative. In
Canada, unlike the United States, the majority of the population
still votes in both Federal and provincial elections. Provincial
premiers are now pressuring Ottawa to restore adequate levels of
funding and the Canadian Prime Minister has felt obliged to declare
defense of the system a priority.</P>
<P>If there is a lesson in this tale, it is not the inefficiency of
single payer systems. Rather the story alerts us to the ways health
care politics is connected to other fundamental issues of social
equity.</P>
<P>No health care system works well when it is underfunded, but
public systems that pool risks and resources, emphasize primary and
preventive care, and avoid unnecessary and counterproductive
advertising and administrative costs achieve the best health outcomes
per dollar of the public's money. And when the vast majority of the
population must rely on such a system, they will demand its
adequacy.</P>
<P>But when a rich neighbor to the South can become a default option
for the wealthy or for the short-term needs of political leaders,
confidence in and commitment to the public system will erode.</P>
<P>Finally, public health care, like any other major public
expenditure, all too easily becomes a plaything of private business
interests, with bad practices driving out good ones, as long as
speculators and multinational corporate executives can run roughshod
over the world economy.</P>
<P>Getting this story out, so that healthcare and social justice
advocates on both sides of the border can draw on each other's
experiences, is a vital task today.</P>
