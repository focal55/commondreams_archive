EACH YEAR Women's History Month is a reminder to us to evaluate how 
far we have come toward gender equity and to reflect on how much work 
is yet to be done. We are reminded that so many of the rights that we 
take for granted were the outcome of the struggles of women who came 
before us. Yet the ``sheroes'' who we remember seldom include the 
names of Third World women or women of color.
<P>  As an educator, I am struck by the number of students who believe 
that European American women were the first to desire freedom and 
that their ``poor sisters'' in developing countries will only become 
emancipated as these countries become modernized and follow the 
Western model. There is an irony here.	 
</P>
<P>  Feminist scholars of colonial history have illustrated that part 
of the civilizing mission of the colonizers was, in fact, to rid the 
``natives'' of their acceptance of women's leadership. Indeed, the 
Igbo women's war in Nigeria in 1929 was precisely a battle between 
the traditional Ekwe women's councils and the colonial 
administration's masculinist model of rule. Yet today, sexist abuses 
in the Third World, from female genital mutilation in Africa to sati 
(wife burning) in India, are depicted as rooted in tradition. This 
portrayal of culture as rigid and ahistorical maintains and 
exacerbates cultural practices that oppress women.	 
</P>
<P>  Take the practice of female genital mutilation. African women's 
organizations, such as Forward, have demonstrated that the 
availability of accessible health care, health promotion and girls' 
education are the strongest indicators of whether local campaigns to 
eradicate the practice will be successful. Yet centuries of 
appropriation of Africa's peoples and natural resources have 
prevented the establishment of an adequate health and educational 
infrastructure. Foreign debt, another legacy of colonialism, and cuts 
in public expenditure imposed by the International Monetary Fund have 
also contributed to underdevelopment.	 
</P>
<P>  The existence of female genital mutilation can therefore be seen 
as a cultural practice sustained and strengthened by colonial rule, 
the historical undermining of 
women's power and contemporary economic policies. Once we take off 
the neo-
colonial blinkers, we can see the ways in which the economic 
practices of the West are fully implicated in the cultural practices 
we so deplore elsewhere.	 
</P>
<P>  To bemoan the oppression of Third World women without 
acknowledging the role of racism, colonialism and economic 
exploitation is to engage in what black British feminist filmmaker 
Pratibha Parmar calls ``imperial feminism,'' a standpoint which 
claims solidarity with Third World women and women of color, but in 
actuality contributes to the stereotyping of Third World cultures as 
``barbaric'' and ``uncivilized.''	 
</P>
<P>  Women of color in the United States are often trapped between 
imperial feminism and the need to challenge male violence within 
their communities. For instance, black women are torn between their 
desire not to send any more black men into a penal system already 
bursting with wasted lives and the need to use that very system to 
protect themselves and their children.	 
</P>
<P>  Similarly, American Indian women face a difficult dilemma in 
tackling domestic violence in their communities while denouncing 
police brutality against Indian men. Both of these cases illustrate 
the need for the feminist movement to address the nexus of 
racism-sexism that structures the political choices and practical 
strategies 
available to women of color.	 
</P>
<P>  Rather than responding to these dilemmas by turning a blind eye to 
sexism in their communities, women of color have energetically forged 
an integrated struggle against racism-sexism. Two upcoming events 
herald this important voice. On April 28-30, the Color of Violence 
Conference in Santa Cruz will connect all of the forms of violence, 
including homophobia, prison abuses, environmental racism and 
domestic abuse. At Mills College in Oakland, Beijing +5, hosted by 
the Women's Leadership Institute on April 15, will bring together 
activists and scholars to build a movement beyond imperial feminism.	 
</P>
<P>  It is through these multiracial coalitions that a new vision of 
women's history may emerge.
