There's an elephant in our electoral living room that Democratic leaders
want to hide. In all the talk about cranky voting machines, chads and
butterflies, this is one topic the Gore camp has not touched. It will hurt
them. It has already. In this case, the pachyderm is institutional racism,
and in an election of losers it has come out on top.

<p>Consider the big picture: in election 2000, 90 percent of African Americans
voted for Gore, as did 63 percent of Latinos and 55 percent of Asians
(exit-poll data on Native Americans is unavailable but they've historically
voted Democratic.) The popular vote - that national, pro-Democrat
majority -- is disproportionately people of color. Thanks to the winner-take
all, Electoral College system, it counts for naught.

<p>In the contested state of Florida, the Black vote was up a huge 65 percent.
In a state where thirty-one percent of all Black men may not vote because of
an 1868 ban on felons, Blacks contributed 16 percent (up from 10 percent) of
the turnout, and nine out of ten voted Democratic. Again,
disproportionately, their votes won't count.

<p>On day one after the election, there was a story in the Florida papers about
an unauthorized police roadblock, stopping cars not a mile from a Black
church-turned- polling-booth. NAACP volunteers reported being swamped with
complaints from registered voters who had found it impossible to vote. They
heard stories of intimidation at and around polling places; demands for
superfluous ID; people complained about a pattern of singling out Black men
and youths for criminal background checks, and in call after call, would-be
voters complained they'd been denied language interpretation, and other help
at the polls.

<p>By now it's clear that overwhelmed election workers made a mass of mistakes
but those mistakes were laced through with some clear intent to suppress
some votes. A full three weeks after the election The New York Times finally
took a serious look and reported that -anticipating a large turnout in a
tight race -- Florida election officials had given laptop computers to
precinct workers so they could have direct access to the state's voter
rolls, but the computers only went to some precincts, and only one went to a
precinct whose people were predominantly Black. The technology gap in the
no-laptop precincts forced the workers there to rely on a few phone lines to
head office. Voters whose names did not appear on the rolls were held up
while workers tried to get through on the phone, for hours, or until they
gave up.

<p>For those who voted, there was another technology glitch. 185,000 Floridians
cast ballots that did not count. Theirs were the ballots that had been
punched too few or too many times, or were otherwise flawed. Flaws too, seem
to have followed race lines. In an election that turned on a few hundred
votes, Floridians whose ballots failed to register a mark for President were
much more likely to have voted with computer punch cards than optical
scanning machines. In Miami Dade, the county with the most votes cast,
predominantly Black precincts saw their votes thrown out at four times the
rate of white precincts: according to the Times, 1 out of 11 ballots in
predominantly black precincts were rejected, a total of 9,904.

<p>Urban, multi-racial Palm Beach, home of the infamous butterfly ballot, and
Duval, where candidates' names were spread across two pages despite what the
published ballot had shown, produced thirty one percent of Florida's
discarded ballots (but only twelve percent of the total votes cast.) In
Duval, which has one of the highest illiteracy rates in the nation, more
than 26,000 votes were rejected, 9,000 from precincts that were
predominantly Black.

<p>Many Floridians who found themselves "scrubbed" off the voting rolls weren't
purged accidentally, reports Gregory Palast for Salon.com. Florida Secretary
of State Katherine Harris paid a private firm, ChoicePoint, $4 million to
"cleanse" the voting rolls, and the firm used the state's felon-ban, to
exclude eight thousand voters who had never committed a felony. ChoicePoint
is a Republican outfit. Board members include former New York Police
commissioner Howard Safir and billionaire Ken Langone, chair of the
fundraising committee for Mayor Giuliani's aborted New York Senate bid. The
erroneous data wasn't their doing, ChoicePoint complains, the names came,
raw, from the state of Texas. They were supposed to be reviewed locally, but
they were distributed un-reviewed. African Americans dominate. (The 8,000
wrong names were "a minor glitch" ChoicePoint told Palast; a glitch fifteen
times the size of the Texas Governor's lead.)

<p>As for that election morning police checkpoint, near Tallahassee, Robert
Chamber, a Black resident, told the Guardian UK he knew what it was about:
"putting fear in people's hearts…." The Florida panhandle is home to the
largest concentration of neo-confederate white supremacist groups in the US.
But this problem is no neo-nazi plot - it's racism of the institutional, not
the exceptional kind, and even more devastating than the statistics has been
Democratic leadership's silence. While African Americans in huge numbers
know there was massive voter fraud, harassment and intimidation a la Jim
Crow, the Democratic Party's white top-dogs have resolutely refused to talk
about voting rights, race or racism - Why? For fear it will hurt them in the
court of public opinion? Among white swing voters and southern Democrats?
Already hurting in all of those places, they're trifling with one of the few
solid voting blocks they've got left, (Blacks, Latinos, Jews.)

<p>The NAACP came out strong, the weekend after the election, holding public
hearings and gathering 300 pages of legally sworn testimony from 486 people
who say they were denied their right to vote. With the Congressional Black
Caucus the NAACP wrote to Janet Reno seeking a Justice Department
investigation into possible violations of the Voting Rights Act. That was
back on November 14th. Since then, the Gore campaign has filed dozens of
lawsuits - not one deals with violations of voting rights. The Justice
Department has initiated what officials go out of their way to characterize
as a preliminary inquiry, not an investigation. (Alligator-wrestler Reno is
scared to stir the waters in her home-state, where she's hoping to retire
any day now, some say.)

<p>The Gore team has chosen to try to eek some votes out of three counties with
manual counts, and to make much of butterflies and chards, but nothing of
race. (Recently, Gore told a reporter he was "very troubled" by the "serious
allegations." That's it.) His racist denial of the seriousness of racism
makes nonsense out of US politics.

<p>The Electoral College is a tool of racism. As Yale's Akhil Reed Amar wrote
in the New York Times, "the College was designed at the founding of the
country to help one group - white Southern males - and this year, it has
apparently done just that."

<p>In the years after the forced-end of slavery, former slave states like
Florida imposed those felon-disenfranchisement laws, precisely to disempower
freed-but-impoverished Blacks. The political parties crafted the statewide
primary system into what amounted to a white-man's private club to keep the
newly enfranchised under the old establishment's control. Then came literacy
tests and poll taxes - voters had to keep their tax-receipts on file -
anything to keep electoral power in white hands. For an idea of what those
tackling literacy tests faced, consider: under Jim Crow, Florida required
that textbooks used by the public school children of one race be kept
separate from those used by the other -- even in storage.

<p>After the 1965 Act was passed, states did everything they could to dilute
Black influence. Winner-take all systems, or absolute majority vote
requirements were embraced to keep black candidates from winning over split
fields of white candidates in local races - in just the same way as
winner-take-all works in the presidential contest. More offices were filled
by appointment. Legislative and congressional district lines were redrawn to
keep black voting strength submerged.

<p>None of this requires looking back very far: the same House Speaker, Tom
Feeney, who wants the Florida legislature to select a Bush slate of Electors
no matter what the vote-counters count, suggested reintroducing literacy
tests just two weeks ago: "Voter confusion is not a reason for whining or
crying or having a revote," said Feeney. "It may be a reason to require
literacy tests." (Palm Beach Post, 11/16.)

<p>The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who will may well be the final
arbiter of which votes get counted and which (white) man gets the White
House, is William Rehnquist, a segregationist from way back.

<p>In 1962, Republican activist William (then "Bill") Rehnquist was the leader
of Operation Eagle Eye, a flying squad of GOP lawyers that swept through
polling places in south Phoenix to question the right of minority voters to
cast their ballots. As Dave Wagner reported in the Arizona Republic last
year, Rehnquist defended keeping African Americans out of stores and
restaurants in Phoenix. In 1964, at the Bethune Precinct, (which was 40
percent Hispanic and 90 percent Democratic) Rehnquist and Operation Eagle
Eye activists challenged every Black and Mexican voter's ability to read the
Constitution of the United States in the English language (then a
requirement.)

<p>The result, according to one witness, was "a line a half-block long, four
abreast…They wanted people to become frustrated and leave." In his testimony
to a US Senate hearing on his appointment to the Supreme Court, Rehnquist
denied that he officially challenged anyone's right to vote. Just as today's
defenders of Bush, argue that voter error, not bias, disproportionately
shrank the counted vote, Rehnquist argued that he broke no rules, he was
just following the law.

<p>Trying to wage politics in the US while tiptoing around racism is like
sidestepping an elephant. It's dangerous, it's not smart, and it won't work.
What suppresses the Black and minority vote suppresses the Democratic and
liberal-progressive vote. The majority of white male voters haven't polled
Democratic since 1964 and only women of color create the gender gap for
Gore. Yet the unequal distribution of resources and bias that created a
practically apartheid voting system in Florida was sustained by the
Democratic Party - who approved of the process, try as they might to blame
the Governor's cronies. And Democratic pro-drug war, pro-death penalty,
pro-felon disenfranchisement policies stoked the racist atmosphere in which
this election was held.

<p>The conditions are ripe for a pro-democracy movement. A moment, at least:
this is it. Some things have changed in the nation since 1964, and when the
public has heard (or seen on CSPAN) the witnesses who gave the NAACP
testimony, they have been shocked. Voter protests in Florida have built a
multi-racial coalition that is advocating the kind of electoral reform the
whole nation could get behind. Among their demands: a non-partisan election
commission, standardized voting procedures and federal enforcement of the
Voting Rights Act. Add to that, the longer-term structural changes some
advocate: instant run off voting, or some form of proportional
representation, so that small parties (and minority constituencies) could
build support for their issues without throwing elections to their foes.

<p>The public has seen the Electoral College in its worst light: for the first
time, the tyranny of a minority may contradict the popular will. Perhaps
something will come of the shared experience of disenfranchisement. But not
if we don't talk about what's at the root of it: racism. Not "the system,"
but this particular, racist one. And those who've been marginalized must
occupy the center. People of color are central to why our electoral system
is set up this way; likewise, they must be at the heart of any movement for
real democracy. We can get rid of the racism, but only if we all shove that
elephant out at once.
