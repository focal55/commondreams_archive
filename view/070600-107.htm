It's too bad welfare reform has just about become  a non-issue as Congress  spends the summer writing  the 2001 budget.
<P>Oh sure, every now and  then some people still talk  about reform. But in the  era of the projected surplus  - $1.9 trillion, and climbing - what are the odds  Washington will complete  the job?
<P>After getting rid of Aid to Families  with Dependent Children, what are the  odds it will eliminate that other form  of AFDC: Aid to Finance Dependent  Corporations?
<P>&quot;Corporate welfare&quot; still slides by  well under the political radar screen  while costing taxpayers anywhere from  $75 billion to $200 billion per year, depending on who's counting.
<P>Hard-liners would wipe out everything from corporate subsidies to tax  breaks to pet projects - all the gifts of  public money to those who do some  giving of their own at campaign time.  They'd even eliminate research subsidies, like the kind other nations fund  for ground-level work that could eventually benefit the public but that has no  immediate profit in it.
<P>Aaron Taylor,  spokesman for Citizens Against Government Waste, said the  high-tech sector now  fueling the U.S. economy &quot;came out of nowhere&quot; without such  taxpayer help, which  proves such subsidies  aren't really needed.
<P>That's no doubt an  overstatement; government has some role to  play. But it shouldn't  play nearly as big a  one as it's playing now  in a game determined  more by political connections than any concern for America's future. Big Business  needs a dose of the  same tough love that has helped other  welfare recipients turn their lives  around.
<P>Yet welfare reform has failed to  take hold in the corporate sector. To  wit:
<P>The Market Access Program still  exists. That's the one in which Joe Taxpayer helped corporations like Burger  King, Dole and Sunkist advertise their  products overseas, as if marketing  shouldn't be the company's responsibility.
<P>The Overseas Private Investment  Corp. still exists, subsidizing businesses  and guaranteeing loans to get companies to invest in countries where good  business sense tells them not to. Taxpayers could save an estimated $1.5  billion over five years on that program  alone.
<P>Agricultural subsidies like those  given to sugar growers still exist. Subsidizing sugar costs taxpayers $90 million  per year in higher prices for government-supported food programs, the  CAGW estimates, and costs consumers another $1.2 billion.
<P>Yet there is no outrage  about the recipients of this  kind of public largess driving Cadillacs or using their  taxpayer subsidies to support their children.
<P>In fact, few politicians  seem to be talking about it  at all. And those who do  don't get very far. It  couldn't propel Sen. John  McCain past George W.  Bush, and corporate critic  Ralph Nader can't even get enough  traction on the issue to make it into  the televised presidential debates.
<P>Now Rep. Joe Hoeffel, D-Pa.,  wants to try. He's pushing a bill to create a commission to target corporate  welfare and recommend a package of  cuts in the same way such commissions  targeted unneeded military bases.
<P>There would be one big difference:  While Congress had to accept or reject  the base closures as a package, Hoeffel's bill would allow amendments.
<P>However, they couldn't be made in  some obscure committee hearing. Any  lawmaker who wanted to amend the  list and protect a favorite subsidy  would have to stand up in the House  and do it &quot;in a very public way and  make a case why this isn't corporate  welfare,&quot; said Joshua  Shapiro, Hoeffel's  chief of staff.
<P>Whether you could  shame corporate welfare supporters in this  way is an open question. But it's worth a  try, and the bill finally  got a hearing last  month.
<P>As for its future,  the question remains:  If Congress wouldn't  cut corporate welfare  when there were huge  deficits and pressure  to save every dollar,  why would it bring itself to do so now  when the country is  rolling in surpluses?
<P>&quot;People are more  focused now than ever before on retiring the (national) debt,&quot; Shapiro said  optimistically.
<P>&quot;It seems like a dim prospect,&quot;  countered the CAGW's Taylor, more  realistically. &quot;It's going to be very, very  difficult.&quot;
<P>That's particularly true because corporate welfare has become such an ingrained culture, being passed down  from one generation of stockholders to  the next. In fact, the conservative Cato  Institute notes that, while families now  face time limits and can be kicked off  of welfare after a few years, corporations still can stay on the dole forever.
<P>Welfare reform won't truly be considered a success until Big Business is  told it will have to upgrade its skills, go  into the marketplace and compete on  its own merits.
<P>Sure, that's a scary prospect for  those used to dependency; but it can  be done. In fact, I can't wait to see the  Rose Garden ceremony at which the  president can introduce a business that  has successfully made the transition  from welfare to work.
