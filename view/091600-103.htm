Every four years, in summer, the runner enters the stadium carrying
                         the eternal flame, and with his torch he ignites the pagan dream of
                         immortality. The crowd cheers. 

                         
<p>Am I alone in feeling ambivalent toward the spectacle we call the
                         Olympics? On the one hand, as much as any one, I am thrilled by the
                         athletes, their bodies so poised and their prowess. On the other hand,
                         I withhold myself from this--the most popular pagan celebration in the
                         world. 

                         
<p>Hitler, most notoriously in our times, understood the advertisement of
                         a parade of perfectly formed athletes. Simone Weil, the French Jewish
                         philosopher, admitted that the pageantry of Hitler youth was wonderful
                         to her--their banners and their music. She had to remind herself that
                         the parade meant to trample her. 

                         
<p>Here they come now, from every nation, Olympic runners and wrestlers
                         and jumpers. They parade smiling and waving at us. How should we
                         not cheer? 

                         
<p>We cheer lustily as he flies through the air; cheer to see her run
                         against time. The Hellenic ideal made flesh. The Hellenistic idea was
                         the perfectability of flesh. 

                         
<p>In Europe and America--those countries we call "the West"--two
                         competing influences have always been at play. Civic virtue tends
                         toward Hellenism--the cult of the individual to become and to say and
                         to be....A contrary religious influence, call it Hebraic--characteristic of
                         Jew and Christian and Muslim--describes life bounded by obedience;
                         alone I can do nothing. 

                         
<p>The 19th century philosopher and poet Mathew Arnold in "Culture and
                         Anarchy" distinguishes Hellenism--as spontaneity of
                         consciousness--from Hebraism, a strictness of conscience. These two
                         influences intersect in America. 

                         
<p>In the Hellenistic ideal the forum, the gymnasium and the university
                         are in harmony. In America, there is disharmony. 

                         The architecture of our intellectual life is Greek or Greco-Roman. 

                         
<p>Fraternity row has long chosen to call itself Greek, harkening to Athens.

                         The architecture of official Washington is Greek because the
                         documents of our country are shaped by Hellenism. 

                         
<p>But in America the common religious piety is tribal. Which is why there
                         is a constant hunger in America for public prayer--at the football game,
                         at the high school graduation. And why the Supreme Court justices in
                         their Greek temple keep telling us that such prayer is impossible in
                         America--the Constitution protects the individual from the tyranny of
                         the tribe. 

                         
<p>Hard to imagine the freedom of worship in America for Buddhist and
                         Scientologist and Sufi, were it not for our Hellenistic adherence to the
                         individual. 

                         
<p>But it is impossible to imagine in ancient Greece an event like "the
                         Special Olympics"--cripples and the disabled running enabled. The
                         danger of Hellenism is that it leads to a cult of the hero, who
                         vanquishes all lesser beings. 

                         
<p>Recently, the Olympic altar has begun to crack. Gold medals have had
                         to be taken away from athletes who could not pass drug tests. Then
                         Tanya Harding's ex-husband and a band of goons assaulted a
                         competing athlete. Then, several members of the International
                         Olympic Committee resigned after revelations of five-star extortion of
                         host cities. 

                         
<p>Historians tell us that the ancient Greeks attached no glory to losing.
                         So, also, today: Only gold will get you onto the box of Wheaties. Only
                         gold, not silver, not bronze, not a "good try," will get you
                         immortality--only gold is immortal. 

                         
<p>As someone who feels his soul more Hebraic than Hellenic, I keep
                         thinking that what is eternal about the "eternal flame" is the wish for
                         immortality. The Olympics is a celebration of youth, of ripeness, of
                         summer. It is the most sublime of human romances--and this is its
                         liturgy. 

                         
<p>It is appropriate to the neo-paganism of today's America, where one
                         senses everywhere the obsolesence of a word like "soul." The body is
                         all, health is all, and death is the defeat of all. 

                         The games begin.
