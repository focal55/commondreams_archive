PHOENIX - Lorain Kadish tells me she's going to get herself arrested again and wants to know what I think about it. We have history in such matters.
<p class=txtbody>Back in 1988, I wrote an article about Lorain when she was among 24 protesters arrested for trespassing outside the Federal Building in downtown Phoenix. The group was rounded up while carrying a 30-foot sign that read, "U.S. troops out of Honduras." </p>
<p class=txtbody>Lorain and other protesters were tried, convicted and each ordered to pay a $69 fine. She refused, along with others in the group, and was sentenced to one day in the slammer. </p>
<p class=txtbody>It was a heady and romantic time. But people change. They mature. Or so you'd think. Lorain plans to join another protest that may again result in her arrest and incarceration. She plans to travel this week to Fort Benning, Ga., where she'll join thousands expected to spend the weekend protesting the U.S. Army's School of the Americas, which trains foreign military personnel in combat, counterinsurgency, counter-narcotics and more. </p>
<p class=txtbody>"This is just a terrible thing for our government to be doing," she says. "So many innocent people have been killed by those we've trained there. If I have to risk getting arrested again, well, that's the way it'll have to be." </p>
<p class=txtbody>Still, she wants to know what I think of her decision. </p>
<p class=txtbody>"Twelve years ago," I tell her, "I was willing to write off your reckless behavior as youthful indiscretion. But you're 87 years old now." </p>
<p class=txtbody>She laughs. </p>
<p class=txtbody>"You'd think I'd know better, don't you?" she said. "But, I'm still young." </p>
<p class=txtbody>Lorain was just a whippersnapper - barely in her 60s - when she started getting into trouble, once chaining herself to the doors of the Arizona Public Service building to protest the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station. </p>
<p class=txtbody>Lorain figures she has a vested interest in trying to "inflict peace," since she is a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. </p>
<p class=txtbody>She and her husband, Frank, recently celebrated their 65th wedding anniversary. She has seen a lot. </p>
<p class=txtbody>To her, the Bush-Gore fight for the presidency is silly. A six-of-one, half-dozen-of-the-other argument. </p>
<p class=txtbody>"I'm a Nader supporter," she said. "I hope and believe the Green Party will get stronger and stronger." </p>
<p class=txtbody>Lorain takes no medication and describes herself as healthy as a horse. For the protest at Fort Benning, however, she's bringing along a walker. She plans to festoon it with small American flags. </p>
<p class=txtbody>"I don't need a walker, of course," she said. "I get around fine. But, it makes me look older than I am. Which might help get the message out that this school, which has been supported by Democrats and Republicans alike, should be closed down." </p>
<p class=txtbody>She makes no apologies for such mischievous behavior. But then, she's only 87. Maybe she'll grow out of it.
