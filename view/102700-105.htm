<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->If all of the poor people in Western New York  were rounded up and placed in their own election district, what are the chances that Rick Lazio or Hillary Rodham Clinton - or Al Gore or  George W. Bush, for that matter - would ever  stop there? 
<P>     What are the odds that Lazio, who's practically taken up residence here, would open a campaign office there or that Clinton, famous for her  all-ears tour, would set up a listening post? 
<P>     You're right: not too good. 
<P>     If there's any conspicuous trend this campaign  season, it's the disappearance of the poor. They  seem to have been rendered invisible by the 1996  welfare reform bill. The four-year-old law has become a kind of legislative elixir sprinkled along  the campaign trail to make poor folks evaporate  in a poof. 
<P>     Listen to the campaign back-and-forth. About  the only mention of the poor is when someone  takes a bow for supporting the 1996 law and the  fact that millions have disappeared from the  rolls. 
<P>     But if only they could sprinkle that campaign  potion at the food pantry or the homeless shelter. 
<P>     &quot;We're seeing an increase of at least 10 percent a year,&quot; says Jan Robinson, talking about  the Salvation Army's caseload since the welfare  reform bill passed. &quot;The numbers on the (welfare) rolls may be down, but that really doesn't  reflect what's happening to the individuals.&quot; 
<P>     Robinson, the charity's director of family resources, was among  those on hand last week  for the unveiling of the  first part of a study that  will try to document  what's happening to  those removed from  the welfare rolls -  something governments  have studiously avoided  doing. 
<P>     The first part of the  study, performed with  the University at Buffalo, surveyed local charities. It concluded that as  government help is reduced, more people are  turning to charities, many of which have had to  turn people away because they can't pick up all  of the slack. 
<P>     The next phase of the study, part of a nationwide effort initiated by the Washington-based  Children's Defense Fund, will look at the impact  on individuals. But those who work with the poor  here already know the impact. 
<P>     &quot;We're hearing things like, three days a week  the parents don't eat so the children can,&quot; says  Joan Malone, director of the local Coalition for  Economic Justice. 
<P>     In these supposedly good times, &quot;we have  thousands of people standing in line for food,  and I'm not talking about Krispy Kreme, either,&quot;  adds Bill O'Connell, executive director of the  Erie County Commission on Homelessness. 
<P>     There are no candidate photo-ops with these  people. They don't merit a Kodak moment. In  fact, they get little exposure at all. 
<P>     Instead, there's a celebration of caseload reductions distorted by the fact that &quot;success&quot;  stories often work only a few hours a week or a  few weeks a year. Even with much-hyped minimum wage hikes, they never come close to getting out of poverty - the real measure of success. 
<P>     These are the people taking $6.50-per-hour  jobs while losing Medicaid or forfeiting food  stamps in the maze set up to discourage them  from even thinking about government as an ally. 
<P>     Yet they're in no one's focus group. 
<P>     &quot;Poor people are not powerful&quot; is how the  Children's Defense Fund's Deborah Weinstein  sums up the lack of election-year focus on what  has become of welfare's &quot;graduates.&quot; 
<P>     That's not to bash reform. Self-sustaining  work beats dependency, and Erie County has  mirrored a national trend with rolls here dropping 48 percent in the past six years, officials say.  But the county still has about 2,900 hard-core  cases it needs to resolve before the five-year lifetime deadline kicks in. 
<P>     The county has special welfare-to-work teams  focusing on those cases. A pilot project involving  one team found that 90 percent of those placed  in jobs after the intensive help were still working  12 months later, says Debra Collins, administrative consultant. 
<P>     But welfare reform in general has lacked that  kind of follow-up to determine what happens to  the bulk of recipients who don't get that special  help. And no one running for office seems the  least bit interested in finding out. 
<P>     The 1996 law expires after next year, meaning  its renewal will spark debate during 2001 - a  non-election year. The data being gathered by  the Children's Defense Fund and local groups  will come in handy then. 
<P>     The problem is that nobody's talking about it  now, in a campaign year when priorities are being set. It's as if, when Washington's finest said,  &quot;don't ask, don't tell,&quot; they also had poor people  in mind.
