"They killed my mother, my father, and 20 other family members," Lorena Martinez told me through our translator last Saturday. Her clear dark eyes never left my face. We were sitting under a tree in Cambridge on a golden afternoon, a day whose beauties belied the news that was coming from the Middle East. But this woman was speaking of a different war - El Salvador in the 1980s and early '90s. Her family was among those murdered by "security forces"  - the nightmare of slaughter that took the lives of thousands.
<P>
<P>The Reagan administration, in its misplaced fantasy war against communism, was an underwriter of that killing, salting Central America with weapons and warplanes, loosening waves of US-trained thugs in a paroxysm of violence that came to an end in El Salvador only with the Peace Accords of 1992.
<P>
<P>Lorena Martinez began 20 years ago as an organizer of cane workers, an advocate of land reform, a teacher. Then came the war. She joined the FMLN, the guerrilla movement that opposed the murderous paramilitary that was tied to Roberto D'Aubuisson's ARENA party. Twice she was captured. Her interrogator the second time, she told me, was a North American.   But in 1992 the violence subsided. The gunships and automatic weapons went away, the "disappearing" stopped, and people no longer felt afraid. ARENA and the FMLN continued their struggle within the structure of democratic politics: FMLN has the largest contingent in the national assembly, although ARENA governs El Salvador in a coalition with other parties.
<P>
<P>Lorena Martinez remains a member of the executive committee of FMLN, but she has gone back to her work organizing rural communities around issues of health, education, and the place of women. But now something ominous is happening in El Salvador, she said. America's war on communism has been replaced by the war on drugs.
<P>
<P>Focused on Colombia, to which President Clinton traveled in August to trumpet his plan, the massive new military initiative is spilling quickly into the surrounding countries. "This is not Vietnam," Clinton declared in Cartagena, "nor is it Yankee imperialism." But what Lorena Martinez sees is a sudden influx of American military personnel - a new US air base opened up this summer at the Comalapa Airport not far from San Salvador - and, even more alarming, a dramatic return by Salvadoran police to military methods, including sweeps on US helicopters, which she has seen with her own eyes. (For a fuller report see "US Troops to El Salvador" by Gary MacEoin in the current National Catholic Reporter.)
<P>
<P>The democratic process to which FMLN has been devoted is now at risk as an increasingly well-armed ARENA government shows signs of resuming old patterns. New chaos threatens the region. An ominously named program of "social cleansing" is driving populations out of the border areas of Colombia into Panama, human rights abuses are rampant, assassinations have returned, and antidrug defoliants are already threatening a massive pollution of water and crops.
<P>
<P>As part of the war on drugs, the United States, in addition to the new base in El Salvador, has established "Forward Operating Locations" in Ecuador, and in Curacao. Governments of Guatemala and Honduras  have once again entered into partnerships with the United States for military training and operations. For decades, the curse of Central America was the US-funded militarization that turned the government forces of half a dozen nations into bands of marauders at war with their own people, which was why the agreements that ended those wars uniformly emphasized "demilitarization."
<P>
<P>That process is now being reversed, as weapons and warrior "advisers" once again flood south from North America. "We lived through 60 years of militarization," Lorena Martinez said. "It is not as if we miss it."
<P>
<P>In the United States, the catastrophic effects of the "war" on drugs - addiction criminalized, prisons overwhelmed - are bad enough. But a foreign war promises to be even more disastrous.
<P>
<P>People like Lorena Martinez hear a familiar chord being struck, despite President Clinton's assurance. "El Salvador is so vulnerable," she said quietly. "We are in a crisis of poverty."
<P>
<P>A desperately poor nation needs economic development and investment. Instead the rich nation to the north returns with weapons - doing nothing for El Salvador's own young people, many of whom have themselves fallen into the despair of drugs. "That is when we realized that what is going on here with the new American base is not about fighting drugs, but about other business."
