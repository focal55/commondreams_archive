In the late 1990s, the highly visible work of personalities such as the late Princess Diana and Jody Williams, then coordinator of the International  Campaign to Ban Landmines, placed the horror of antipersonnel land mine casualties on the front pages of newspapers around the world.
<P>
<P>With the signing of the Mine Ban Treaty and the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize, the campaign demonstrated that a mine-free planet was an attainable reality.
<P>
<P>Now, three years after the initial signing of the Mine Ban Treaty in Ottawa, 137 nations have signed and 100 have ratified this agreement. States party to the treaty are destroying their stockpiles of antipersonnel land mines; exports of these indiscriminate weapons have, in a matter of years, gone from a flood to a trickle; and  demining efforts in dozens of countries are giving people back their land.
<P>
<P>Despite this revolutionary success, unfortunately, several states, including Russia and China, have yet to accede to the Mine Ban Treaty. Not surprisingly, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea, notorious culprits when it comes to complying with weapons regulations, have not yet joined either. Many Americans, however, would be shocked to know that the United States is part of this list of usual suspects that produce, deploy, and develop antipersonnel land mines, weapons that maim or kill more than 22,000  civilians a year. 
<P>
<P>Maintaining that antipersonnel land mines are essential for the defense of the Korean Peninsula and the protection of antitank mines, weapons not  prohibited under the treaty, the Clinton administration has abandoned  its once laudable position as the first government in the world to call for  an antipersonnel land mine ban. Since deferring in 1997 to the Pentagon, President Clinton has put the future of US accession to the  treaty in the hands of the Joint Chief of Staff, a body famously  reluctant to surrender use of any weapon, even those, like the land mine, possessing marginal military utility.
<P>
<P>History shows that the United States commanders-in-chief have often  been faced with the challenge of balancing the humanitarian benefits of  weapons moratoria with the protestations of an unyielding Department  of Defense. The 1925 Geneva Convention prohibiting the use of  chemical and biological weapons, though quickly signed by President Coolidge, did not win the consent and support of the Pentagon until the  mid-1970s.
<P>
<P>Regardless of arguments for the positive military application of chemical or biological weapons, the global backlash that  would accompany a nation's admitted employment of these  indiscriminate weapons is now politically untenable. Indicating the  development of an international norm similar to that restricting chemical  and biological weapons, every NATO nation, save the United States and Turkey, has joined the Mine Ban Treaty. This is clear evidence that the world's most powerful armed forces can wage war without endangering the lives of noncombatants through the use of a grossly immoral weapon.
<P>
<P>The refusal of the United States to ban land mines, however, would be more  palatable if the Pentagon could demonstrate that our troops actually need them. Stalling efforts to become compliant to the treaty, the Army claims that ''suitable'' alternatives to antipersonnel land mines must be found before the United States can accede. The search for alternatives,  undertaken in the face of already extant tactics and technology that  could replace the land mine, is unfortunately researchingnew weapon  systems, like RADAM (Remote Area Denial Artillery Munition), that are not compliant to the Mine Ban Treaty.
<P>
<P>Also, the cost to US forces of not adopting this treaty is steep. Our own modern mixed mine systems, combinations of antipersonnel and antitank  land mines, proved in the Persian Gulf War a deadly hazard to American  troops, especially those, like the 82d Airborne, deployed by parachute.   According to Pentagon casualty  estimates, 34 percent of US casualties in that conflict were mine-related.
<P>
<P>Governor George W. Bush, for all his focus on military strength and readiness, has yet to tell the American public where he stands on this  humanitarian and military issue. Vice President Al Gore, sadly, has stated that he will abide by current  policy. Both candidates must conjure up the courage and vision to do what the President Clinton has not done.
<P>
<P>It must be conceded that Clinton has presided over significant increases in funding for global humanitarian demining, doing much to  combat mines already in the ground. The challenge, however, is to ensure not only that mines already emplaced are removed, but that no more will reach another battlefield, farmers field, or playing field.
<P>
<P>And there is only one way to achieve that goal. The United States must join the treaty now.
<P>
