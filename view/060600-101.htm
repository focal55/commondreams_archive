On the morning of May 25, Jineth Bedoya, a reporter for the Colombian 

newspaper El Espectador, arrived at the entrance to Modelo federal prison in 

the capital city of Bogota.
<p>Bedoya had gone to the prison after receiving a 

telephone call from an inmate. The caller said he had information about an 

April riot at Modelo. During the riot, 25 inmates had been hacked and shot to 

death by a group of prisoners who belonged to a right-wing paramilitary 

group.
<p>Bedoya, who covers law enforcement, knew quite a bit about the 

riot. She had previously reported in her newspaper that the smuggled guns 

used by the killers had yet to be confiscated by guards.
<p>This time, as she 

waited outside the jail for a visitor's pass, Bedoya herself was seized &#151; 

kidnapped at gunpoint by two strangers.
<p>Her abductors blindfolded and 

drugged her, tossed her into a van and whisked her to a secret location on 

the outskirts of the city, where for the next 10 hours they tortured and raped 

her.
<p>During the ordeal, the assailants warned Bedoya that if she continued 

her reporting they would kill her and four other Colombian journalists &#151; 

and cut their bodies into pieces.
<p>One journalist her assailants kept 

mentioning as their next target was an editor at El Espectador, Ignacio 

Gomez.
<p>Gomez, or &quot;Nacho,&quot; as his friends call him, has been at 

the newspaper for 16 years. He is one of the most famous investigative 

reporters in a country where journalists who make waves have short 

careers.
<p>During little more than a decade, 89 Colombian journalists have 

been assassinated. Back in 1989, at the beginning of the killings, Gomez 

published a sensational report. He dared to list the hundreds of buildings and 

properties secretly owned by Medellin druglord Pablo Escobar.
<p>Gomez was 

targeted for death and had to flee the country for several months. In the end, 

it was Escobar and most of the Medellin gang who were hunted down and 

killed.
<p>The threats against Gomez resumed again in earnest earlier this 

year. His bosses have tallied 53 separate threats since Feb. 28. That was the 

day that Gomez and the investigative team he heads published another 

explosive article.
<p>The subject this time was one of Colombia's worst 

atrocities &#151; the infamous massacre of Mapiripan. Between July 15 and 

July 20, 1997, a death squad loyal to right-wing paramilitary leader Carlos 

Castano hacked to death more than 60 peasants in the northern village of 

Mapiripan.
<p>The killers were trying to teach a lesson to residents of the 

area, where left-wing guerrillas were operating.
<p>Gomez uncovered some 

disturbing connections between U.S. Special Forces stationed in Colombia 

and the massacre.
<p>According to his report, the Colombian colonel now 

awaiting trial as the mastermind of the massacre was trained by U.S. Special 

Forces troops. And they were secretly conducting training in the northern 

zone just before and just after the massacre.
<p>The Colombian soldiers 

trained by our Special Forces, according to Gomez, facilitated and backed up 

the efforts of the death squad at Mapiripan.
<p>On May 23, just days before 

his colleague Bedoya was abducted, Gomez was assaulted just outside his 

house. As he tried to hail a cab to work, two men tried to grab him and throw 

him into their car. He managed to escape and call police on his cell 

phone.
<p>After police officials told Gomez they could no longer guarantee his 

safety, he fled to the United States last week. His co-worker Bedoya remains 

under police guard in a hospital in Bogota. Another of the journalists on the 

latest death list has fled to London.
<p>The war of terror against journalists in 

Colombia has few precedents in modern times.
<p>Which brings us to the 

huge $1.2 billion in military aid to Colombia the Clinton administration keeps 

demanding from Congress as part of the drug war. Colombia &#151; which 

clearly cannot control its own military &#151; already gets more arms aid than 

all the other countries in the Western Hemisphere put together. This package 

would quadruple the current aid. It would make Colombia the third-largest 

recipient of U.S. military aid in the world, after Israel and Egypt.
<p>Next week, 

Clinton's people begin a new attempt at getting the package passed. Most of 

the money would go for 60 helicopters for the Colombian Army to fight 

left-wing &quot;narcoguerrillas.&quot;
<p>But the problem is both left-wing 

guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries are trafficking in drugs, Gomez told me 

yesterday.
<p>&quot;If you put all these weapons against the guerrillas you will 

create a drug monopoly for the fascist paramilitaries,&quot; he said. 

&quot;This is all stupid. You don't support more war when our country is in the 

middle of negotiating peace [with the guerrillas].&quot;
