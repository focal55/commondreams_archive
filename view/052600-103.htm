The House approval of the China
     trade Bill is a jubilant moment for the winners: Corporate
     America and legacy-seeking President Bill Clinton.
<p>
        They have a less bumpy path now to steer both American exports
     and values to the Asian power.
<p>
        So the US is closer now to fulfilling the trade and democracy
     goals that so significantly drive its dealings with the world.
<p>
        The House passed the China trade Bill by a 237-197 margin, a
     surprisingly comfortable cushion of votes for so contentious a
     battle.
<p>
        This outcome testifies to the persuasive gifts of President Clinton
     and the pro-business instincts of the Republican leadership
     which, out of pragmatism, backed the man it impeached a year
     ago instead of giving him a legislative black eye.
<p>
        It is also another reminder of how powerful and deep-pocketed
     big business is, and what a winner it can be when it lobbies
     incessantly.
<p>
        President Clinton saw winners globally. He said: "The House of
     Representatives has taken a historic step towards continued
     prosperity in America, reform in China and peace in the world."
<p>
        He had been single-minded in pushing the legislation, which will
     burnish his patchy legacy in foreign policy.
<p>
         This parallels his success in winning approval of Nafta in
     1993,sealing his reputation as the free-trade president, as he
     likes to see himself.
<p>
        While the China trade vote is a huge personal victory, he has not
     created a consensus among the Democrats. Only 73 out of 211
     Democrats voted for the Bill, or only 35 per cent.
<p>
        The political disunity of the Democrats, at least on this issue, is
     damaging for their enterprise to retake the House in the
     November election, and he has to take some of the rap.
<p>
        Overall, he has flung open one more door into China, a rising
     power that must be engaged. The hope is that substantial
     economic ties will smoothen the relationship, and create winners
     all round. From the business perspective, a rolling vista of
     Chinese profits awaits.
<p>
        Chinese tariffs will be slashed for a plethora of farm and
     industrial products, while some barriers will be dropped for
     American services, like banks, insurance and
     telecommunications.
<p>
        For instance, China will permit 49 per cent foreign ownership in
     telecommunications, a sector that the US is highly competitive
     in.
<p>
        Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue called the
     vote "a victory of fact over fear and a historic win for the
     American economy and our national security".
<p>
        The alternative is that US firms will not benefit from the
     sweeping market-access measures that the US negotiated last
     November.
<p>
        Amid the jubilation, however, the lobbying blitz by corporate
     America and its campaign cash alienate Americans, who are
     weary of money politics.
<p>
        The Clinton administration is also doling out political favours to
     wavering lawmakers who decided to come on board, and the
     pledges included a weather station, a zip code and gas pipelines.
<p>
        One senior congressional aide whose Republican boss voted
     against the Bill criticised the "pork" in the deal-making.
<p>
        He said of the winners: "President Clinton was willing to make
     many offers. The Republican leadership was willing to work with
     business leaders."
<p>
        The Bill now moves to the Senate, but approval is nearly certain
     next month.
