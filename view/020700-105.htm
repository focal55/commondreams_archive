<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This month the nation will mark two paradoxical milestones. The economic
expansion has becomes the longest in history and the prison population will
reach 2 million.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   Because economic vitality tends to dampen criminal behavior, those
disparate benchmarks seem to confound conventional wisdom. Why are the jails
filling up while the economy is roaring along? The answer is four words: the
war on drugs.</font>
<P>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a recent report by the Justice Policy Institute, the U.S.
prison and jail population will top 2 million for the first time by Feb. 15.
With that astounding total, this country has amassed the largest prison
population, as well as the highest incarceration rate, on Earth. With just 5
percent of the world's population, the U.S. has a quarter of the world's
prisoners.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   The report noted that the decade of the 1990s witnessed the largest spurt
of imprisonment in U.S. history. The rate of prison growth during that decade
was nearly 30 times the average rate of increase for any decade prior to the
1970s, and drug offenses accounted for a significant amount of that increase.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   While we hear plenty of chest-thumping rhetoric about the record economic
expansion, our dubious distinction as the world's leading jailer is seldom a
topic of public discussion. This nation's enormous incarceration rate is a
social catastrophe that should be a major focus of our political discourse.
But it is a stealth issue, even in a national political campaign. All the
presidential candidates--Democrats as well as Republicans--have been fairly
silent on the issue, except to strenuously downplay their own past drug use.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   On the federal level, U.S. leadership has opted for the ostrich approach.
The Republicans are afraid to differ from the military mind-set made famous by
the sainted Ronald Reagan, who officially launched the drug war in 1982. That
war brought increased funding for drug law enforcement and prompted a surge of
inmates and drug offenders that continues to accelerate. When Reagan took
office, the prison population was about 500,000. It has quadrupled since then
and a high percentage of that increase is drug-related.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   Democrats, who purport to favor a less punitive approach, have done little
to bring relief to the incredible incarceration epidemic plaguing the nation.
In fact, it was President Clinton who oversaw the record increases in prison
inmates during the 1990s. What's more, the latest FBI data revealed that the
number of marijuana arrests also hit a record high during the tenure of the
president who didn't inhale. Most drug arrests are for marijuana possession.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   Rather than burst the bubble of pretense that surrounds the idiotic drug
war, national politicians prefer to push their heads even further into the
sand. But discontent about this war's casualties is growing at state and local
levels. Not only have voters in seven states and Washington, D.C., passed
initiatives supporting the medical use of marijuana, efforts also are under
way in many cities and some states to provide drug treatment as alternatives
to prison.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   Surprisingly, the politicians who have most publicly defied drug war
propaganda have been Republicans. U.S. Rep. Thomas Campbell, the California
Republican who is the likely nominee in this year's Senate race, has urged
reform of Draconian drug laws that have fueled record spending for corrections
while inhibiting funding for education in his state. California is not alone.
The Justice Policy Institute study notes that in the last two decades, state
spending on corrections across the country increased by nearly 100 percent,
while spending on higher education decreased by 6 percent.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   Gary Johnson, the GOP governor of New Mexico, also has made some strong
statements condemning the drug war. He argues that the costly campaign against
drugs has left courts and prisons overwhelmed with people arrested for
possessing only small amounts of illegal substances. "We are spending
incredible amounts of our resources on incarceration, law enforcement and
courts," he told The New York Times. "As an extension of everything I've done
in office, I made a cost-benefit analysis, and this one really stinks."
Johnson also suggests that government decriminalize, even legalize, drugs.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   There's little chance that the present group of presidential aspirants will
offer such logical approaches. Rather, we're likely to hear round after round
of simplistic rhetoric as each candidate labors to cast himself as a patriotic
drug warrior.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   Controversy about George W. Bush's reported drug use has come and gone with
his evasive "no comment" and the other dwindling number of candidates either
have declared themselves drug virgins or victims of youthful exuberance.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   The latest blow-up concerns reports that Vice President Al Gore was a
regular rather than occasional pot-puffer. Candidate Gore certainly claims
credit for his part in the record expansion that has made the U.S. an
international beacon of economic success.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
   Shouldn't he also take some credit for a prison population that is the
shame of the world?</font>
