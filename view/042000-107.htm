If, in the thirty Earth Day celebrations we have held since 1970, the human

population and economy have become any more respectful of the Earth, the Earth

hasn't noticed.

<p>The planet is not impressed by fancy speeches.  Leonardo DiCaprio interviewing

Bill Clinton about global warming is not an Earth-shaking event.  The Earth has

no way of registering good intentions or future inventions or high hopes.  It

doesn't even pay attention to dollars, which are, from a planet's point of view,

just a charming human invention.  Planets measure only physical things -- energy

and materials and their flows into and out of the changing populations of living

creatures.</p>

<p>What the Earth sees is that on the first Earth Day in 1970 there were 3.7

billion of those hyperactive critters called humans, and now there are over 6

billion.

Back in 1970 those humans drew from the Earth's crust 46 million barrels of oil

every day -- now they draw 78 million.</p>

<p>Natural gas extraction has nearly tripled in thirty years, from 34 trillion

cubic feet per year to 95 trillion.  We mined 2.2 billion metric tons in 1970;

this year we'll mine about 3.8 billion.</p>

<p>The planet feels this fossil fuel use in many ways, as the fuels are extracted

(and spilled) and shipped (and spilled) and refined (generating toxics) and

burned into numerous pollutants, including carbon dioxide, which traps outgoing

energy and warms things up.  Despite global conferences and brave promises, what

the Earth notices is that human carbon emissions have increased from 3.9 million

metric tons in 1970 to an estimated 6.4 million this year.</p>

<p>You would think that an unimaginably huge thing like a planet would not notice

the one degree (Fahrenheit) warming it has experienced since 1970.  But on the

scale of a whole planet, one degree is a big deal, especially since it is not

spread evenly.  The poles have warmed more than the equator, the winters more

than the summers, the nights more than the days.  That means that temperature

<b>differences</b> from one place to another have been changing much more than the

average temperature has changed.  Temperature differences are what make winds

blow, rains rain, ocean currents flow.</p>

<p>All creatures, including humans, are exquisitely attuned to the weather.  All

creatures, including us, are noticing weather weirdness and trying to adjust, by

moving, by fruiting earlier or migrating later, by building up whatever

protections are possible against flood and drought.  The Earth is reacting to

weather changes too, shrinking glaciers, splitting off nation-sized chunks of

Antarctic ice sheet, enhancing the cycles we call El Nino and La Nina.</p>

<p>&quot;Earth Day, Shmearth Day,&quot; the planet must be thinking as its fever mounts. 

&quot;Are you folks ever going to take me seriously?&quot;</p>

<p>Since the first Earth Day our global vehicle population has swelled from 246 to

730 million.  Air traffic has gone up by a factor of six.  The rate at which we

grind up trees to make paper has doubled (to 200 million metric tons per year). 

We coax from the soil, with the help of strange chemicals, 2.25 times as much

wheat, 2.5 times as much corn, 2.2 times as much rice, almost twice as much

sugar, almost four times as many soybeans as we did thirty years ago.  We pull

from the oceans almost twice as much fish.</p>

<p>With the fish we can see clearly how the planet behaves, when we push it too

far.  It does not feel sorry for us; it just follows its own rules.  Fish become

harder and harder to find.  If they are caught before they're old enough to

reproduce, if their nursery habitat is destroyed, if we scoop up not only the

cod, but the capelin upon which the cod feeds, the fish may never come back. 

The Earth does not care that we didn't mean it, that we promise not to do it

again, that we make nice gestures every Earth Day.</p>

<p>We have among us die-hard optimists who will berate me for not reporting the

good news since the last Earth Day.  There is plenty of it, but it is mostly

measured in human terms, not Earth terms.  Average human life expectancy has

risen since 1970 from 58 to 66 years.  Gross world product has more than

doubled, from 16 to 39 trillion dollars.  Recycling has increased, but so has

trash generation, so the Earth receives more garbage than ever before.  Wind and

solar power generation have soared, but so have coal-fired, gas-fired and

nuclear generation.</p>

<p>In human terms there has been breathtaking progress.  In 1970 there weren't any

cell phones or video players.  There was no Internet; there were no dot-coms. 

Nor was anyone infected with AIDS, of course, nor did we have to worry about

genetic engineering.  Global spending on advertising was only one-third of what

it is now (in inflation-corrected dollars).  Third-World debt was one-eighth of

what it is now.</p>

<p>Whether you call any of that progress, it is all beneath the notice of the

Earth.  What the Earth sees is that its species are vanishing at a rate it

hasn't seen in 65 million years.  That 40 percent of its agricultural soils have

been degraded.  That half its forests have disappeared and half its wetlands

have been filled or drained, and that, despite Earth Day, all these trends are

accelerating.</p>

<p>Earth Day is beginning to remind me of Mother's Day, a commercial occasion upon

which you buy flowers for the person who, every other day of the year, cleans up

after you.  Guilt-assuaging.  Trivializing.  Actually dangerous.  All mothers

have their breaking points.  Mother Earth does not soften hers with patience or

forgiveness or sentimentality.
