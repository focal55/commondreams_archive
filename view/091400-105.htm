It was very nice of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to agree to sell another 800,000 barrels a day, but that does
not begin to solve the petroleum problem.
<p>It is not just that the quantity involved is actually quite
small--these days, after a generation of ever-increasing consumption, an
extra 800,000 barrels per day only amounts to a 3% production increase
for OPEC members, or roughly 1.5% of total world production. Neither
Russia nor Mexico belong to the organization (let alone Norway or
Britain). With U.S. oil stocks very low and the recovery of the East
Asian economies underway, it would take much more production to keep
prices from rising, and OPEC certainly has enough installed capacity kept
idle. But to say that an extra 800,000 barrels a day is not a solution
does not mean that a much bigger production increase would be better.
<p>In fact, the exact opposite is true: The only solution for high
petroleum prices are even higher petroleum prices. If crude oil is cheap,
there is no investment in other energy sources and less effort is made to
conserve, thus eventually guaranteeing acute shortages and even higher
prices than today.
<p>That is the paradoxical truth that has paralyzed Western governments
since the oil-price explosion of 1999. The rise of petroleum prices from
less than $10 a barrel to more than $30 threatens to trigger a wave of
inflation that would inevitably be followed by sharp increases in
interest rates, which would in turn cause a recession. That would end the
miraculously long U.S. boom in the worst possible way.
<p>As for Europe, just now beginning to recover from years of slow growth
and double-digit unemployment, it is certain that the European Central
Bank will react to any more inflation by further increasing interest
rates, strangling the recovery. That the euro also happens to be low
against the dollar for entirely different reasons is not supposed to
influence the bank--its only mission is to keep prices stable. Yet of
course it has some effect, simply because the entire euro-scheme would
blow up if the Germans become sufficiently alarmed by what is happening
to their savings. Inflation and its repercussions are not the only
danger, however. With higher petroleum prices, European consumers have
less money with which to buy other things, cutting internal demand at a
time when Europe's economic recovery is already fragile precisely because
Europeans are not consuming enough.
<p>So there are very good reasons to wish for much lower petroleum
prices. At $15 a barrel or less, there would be no inflationary impulse,
interest rates could go down instead of being driven up, and there would
be no income transfer to weaken internal demand in Europe.
<p>But there are even better reasons to wish for high petroleum
prices--in fact, even higher than the recent peak of $35 a barrel, which
in real terms is less than the level of 20 years ago.
<p>Almost two decades of cheap petroleum have had devastating effects on
both the demand and the supply side of the world's energy balance. The
great conservation efforts, originally launched in the aftermath of the
1973 Arab oil embargo and the resulting explosion in oil prices, have
been abandoned. By 1975 even Americans, with their passion for large
cars, were buying mostly so-called compacts with four-cylinder engines,
and the smallest cars on the market were the ones most in demand.
<p>In recent years, with gasoline prices already low and still falling,
sales of U.S. compact cars have been declining, while the market for the
smallest and most efficient cars virtually came to an end. More than 60%
of American car buyers were not content even with full-sized
eight-cylinder cars, choosing instead so-called sports utility
vehicles--in fact powerful four-by-four trucks, which have been getting
bigger and bigger. The latest monsters offered by GM and Ford have huge
six-liter engines, so the typical user goes to work or to shop, usually
alone, in a vehicle big enough and powerful enough to carry two cows and
10 cowboys, which naturally burns gasoline in proportion.
<p>Even in Europe, where high excise taxes meant that the U.S. low point
of 20 cents per liter could never be reached, gasoline prices have been
low enough to encourage a very definite shift in demand to bigger
vehicles. It was symptomatic of an atmosphere of energy abundance that
Volkswagen was not satisfied with the purchase of Rolls-Royce, maker of
famously heavy and thirsty cars. It also decided to revive the Horch
super-car brand once favored by Adolf Hitler, while Daimler-Benz is
reviving the Maybach. For such cars, today's top-of-the-line 12-cylinder,
five-liter engines would only be the minimum option.
<p>Overall improvements in automotive technology have certainly increased
propulsion efficiencies since 1973, but in both the United States and
Europe, and in Japan as well, buyers have not opted for lower fuel
consumption, preferring higher power levels instead.
<p>The same retreat from energy conservation can be observed across the
board. Within a few years of the 1973 embargo, new materials and new ways
of designing buildings were increasing insulation values in both Europe
and the United States, as well as Japan. That saved much energy in
itself, and also offered the possibility of replacing petroleum or
coal-fueled furnaces with solar heating. It was the same with air
conditioning, whose power needs could be reduced quite drastically by
keeping out direct sunlight. In fact, in the few parts of the world that
are both sunny and rich, as in the Southwest United States, expensive
houses abundantly equipped with solar panels were much in demand. There
was even a small boom in cave houses, often luxurious villas
semi-submerged in the ground for better insulation.
<p>It was the same in most sectors of industry, with older machines and
plants everywhere being replaced by new energy-saving equipment already
in hand, while vigorous research and development efforts were launched to
further increase energy efficiency. In industries of all kinds,
co-generation and recycling became the slogans of the age.
<p>Cheap petroleum changed all that. Efforts to increase energy
efficiency in buildings of all kinds, from villas to office blocks, were
virtually abandoned, even though new polymers could further improve
insulation, while it would be very easy and very cheap to use computer
controls to limit the waste of light, heat and air conditioning.
<p>Instead of energy austerity, we have post-industrial styles
characterized by the addition of nonfunctional structures whose only
purpose is to be visibly useless. In industry, labor-saving once again
became the central goal in developing or buying new equipment, with much
less emphasis on saving energy except in a handful of process industries.
It is a most revealing feature of the "new economy" companies that they
commonly keep their offices brightly lit all night. In part they do that
to advertise their "24/7" culture of nonstop work to achieve the next
Internet breakthrough. But it also reflects an entire mentality: In so
many different ways, from the new demand for extra-powerful offshore
boats to the prevalence of motorcycles with more horsepower than the
family cars of the 1960s, it has become positively fashionable to waste
energy.
<p>The impact of cheap oil on the supply side has been even more
destructive. The worldwide search for alternative sources of energy that
started immediately after the 1973 Arab embargo was propelled by much
scientific enthusiasm as well as an abundance of technical resources.
While many other imaginative schemes were seriously investigated, the
more immediately practical possibilities of solar and wind power were
given their chance in a multitude of pilot projects. The first plants
also were built to extract petroleum from the immense surface deposits of
shale rock in the U.S. and of oil-bearing sands in Canada.
<p>It soon became clear, however, that only coal and nuclear power could
seriously diminish the dependence of industrial countries on petroleum
imports. Each had its problems, of course. But 20 years ago, with oil
prices increasing once again because of the post-shah crisis in Iran and
the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war, nobody would have imagined that the
building of new coal-burning and nuclear plants would simply come to an
end. With cheap oil, there is no incentive to spend money on scrubbers
for coal-fired thermal power stations, and no political leader is willing
to take on the intellectual and electoral fight against post-Chernobyl
obscurantism, even though only nuclear power can offer energy without
burning fossil fuel in the atmosphere.
<p>Thus we have reached today's absurd predicament. With the price of
petroleum determined entirely by the marginal producers of the Arabian
peninsula, the world's most-advanced countries, as well as the Chinese
and other East Asians who are lifting themselves from ancient poverty by
hard work, are all crucially dependent on oil imports from a handful of
countries ruled by absolute monarchs who have the power to wreck those
nations' economies at any time.
<p>Only years of high prices can solve the problem, and if OPEC will not
oblige by keeping the barrel well above $35, extra taxes should be
imposed on petroleum imports to end the addiction to cheap energy that is
a permanent threat to both prosperity and the environment.
