<p>Colombia is Latin America's most complex and 
troubled country. Its two overwhelming problems -- 
a booming trade in cocaine and heroin, and a 
vicious, nearly 40-year-old civil war -- are intertwined and getting worse. Increasingly they threaten  not just Colombia, but neighboring countries as 
well, including Venezuela, one of the  largest suppliers of oil to the United States.

<p> Now the Clinton administration has unveiled a 
$1.3 billion plan to help Colombia, including $955 
million in security assistance. Colombia is already 
the largest recipient of American security aid after 
Israel and Egypt. The plan reflects neither a realistic strategy to fight illegal drugs nor an effective 
long-term approach to establish peace and stability. 
Instead it risks dragging the United States into a 
costly counterinsurgency war. 

<p> Both the drug trade and Colombia's stability 
are legitimate American concerns. The administration and supporters of the plan in Congress have 
concluded that the most effective American response is to increase military assistance and forge a 
close alliance with Colombia's armed forces. Washington should  have learned long ago that  partnership with an abusive and ineffective Latin American 
military rarely produces positive results and often 
undermines democracy in the region.   
<p>  

<p> Colombia produces 80 percent of the world's 
cocaine and about two-thirds of the heroin consumed in the United States. Administration officials 
insist that the security assistance would be aimed 
primarily at fighting drug trafficking and  not at 
counterinsurgency operations against leftist guerrilla groups. But in many areas of Colombia the 
distinction is meaningless. In recent years both the 
guerrillas and murderous right-wing paramilitary 
squads associated with the army have earned millions of dollars from the drug trade.   
<p>

<p> President Andr&eacute;s Pastrana is well intentioned 
and deserves American support. But this plan is 
overwhelmingly skewed toward a military  approach to problems that for years have stubbornly 
resisted military solutions. Washington should be 
devoting a far greater share of its support to the 
Pastrana government's own admirable efforts to 
strengthen civil institutions and address social and 
economic inequities that fuel the war and the drug 
economy. They include reorganizing and strengthening the judiciary, as well as alternative development strategies that would help farmers grow conventional crops, like coffee and cotton, and subsidize 
the construction of roads and schools. Colombia's 
security problems cannot be ignored, and there may 
be ways for the United States to work with the 
Pastrana government to strengthen the Colombian 
military. But this should be done with stricter 
conditions  and an emphasis on reforming the armed 
forces  rather than on equipping them to fight a 
protracted civil war in which civilians are the main 
casualties. 

<p> Peace talks aimed at a negotiated settlement 
represent the best solution to both the drug problem 
and the war. The Clinton administration has provided intermittent support for Mr. Pastrana's early 
efforts to talk peace with guerrilla leaders. He has 
had little success thus far. But in recent days key 
rebel leaders have signaled a new interest in negotiations, agreeing to meet with government representatives in Sweden. Washington should redouble 
its support for these talks. Throwing its weight 
behind Colombia's military at this stage will only 
escalate a war that neither side can win.
