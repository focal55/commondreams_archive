For most of my life, I have not trusted the police. As I watched the videotape of Wednesday&#0039;s police takedown of Thomas Jones in Philadelphia, I could see all my reasons for distrust in living color.
<p>
I&#0039;ve thought of the police as dangerous and brutal toward black people. When I was a boy, even the men in my family were scared of the cops. Each year the men carefully planned their trips down South so that they could sneak through certain states and counties in the dead of the night to escape detection by racist police.
<p>
As I grew up, I swore that my finely tuned African American ear could hear the tires on a police car from a mile away. To me, it seemed that all policemen wore the same cologne and got their haircuts at the same crew-cut specialist. Police callousness toward the African American community was confirmed when one friend was shot and killed by the police and another wounded, both under suspicious circumstances. 
<p>
These feelings were reaffirmed when I witnessed the police beating civil-rights marchers and experienced harassing police car traffic stops long before the term driving while black was coined.
<p>
When the Black Panthers emerged during the struggle for Black Liberation, I joined in the labeling of the police as &quot;pigs.&quot; I viewed them as frontline soldiers in the military offensive against the black community. This offensive has been under way ever since the police were formed to track runaway slaves and protect white skin privilege and the unjust organization of wealth. 
<p>
It is hard to remain sane with such hostile thoughts bouncing about in your head. For many years, through no conscious effort of my own, I was able to intellectually defuse my anger and hostility toward police. I even count two officers among my friends. 
<p>
But last Oct. 17, I learned that individual relations with police officers should not be interpreted as the reality of the law-enforcement institution. On that day, three police officers and a dog confronted me as I left my office in North Philadelphia. They immediately handcuffed me and took my wallet. They escorted me to a security office, where I was questioned by a sergeant and a black officer. The latter, no doubt high on white male police macho culture, was harsher than the white sergeant.
<p>
After they determined that I was legit and let me go, I drove to a gasoline station to fuel up the car, which was my plan all along. But I discovered that the &#36;16 I had in my wallet was gone. A small amount of money, and at first I was going to let it go. But then I realized that the only way an officer would commit such a petty crime is with the unquestionable understanding that a white man&#0039;s word as more value than a black person&#0039;s word. 
<p>
And he was right. 
<p>
When I went to the police precinct at 17th and Montgomery to file a report, I was first told not to do it because no officer would ever steal. I was later threatened by an officer at the precinct. I filed the report anyway, but I never heard one word about the investigation.
<p>
As I watched the television film footage of Philadelphia police beating and kicking Thomas Jones, I thought about young Donta Dawson, Kenneth Griffin, Moises DeJesus, Aaron Forbes - black and Latino men killed by police under suspicious circumstances. The other victims of police brutality, the well-known victims, Amadou Diallo and Abner Louima - who can forget the horrible tales? International human-rights watchers have recognized these abuses. 
<p>
I also thought about billion-dollar stadiums and the meaning of the struggle for black political empowerment. One of the core goals of our struggle has been to pull the police off the throats of black people. Andrew Young was once quoted as saying the first job of a black mayor is to pull the police off the necks of the black community. 
<p>
Though Wednesday&#0039;s events were a terrible display of police hostility, they also are an opportunity for Mayor Street to use his political capital to re-imagine the police department instead of trying to find ways to enrich wealthy white sports team owners. But this political discussion, which grows from the heart of the black struggle, is part of a broader conversation about economic and racial justice. The truth is that there can be no fair policing in an unjust society.
