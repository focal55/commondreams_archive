Sweating and gasping, I chug up the steep hill near my house in what passes
for my old bike's first gear. Halfway up the hill I get off the seat and pump
side-to-side, muttering a mantra about tightening those stomach muscles,
harnessing my power, and really getting near the top. Finally I crest the hill
and coast along for a block or so in perfect, steaming joy.
<p>With my office in my basement, I pay my homage to Bike-to-Work Week with
family bike rides and excursions to the store. But a growing number of people
are bike commuting to work, joining a trend that makes sense from many angles.
Not only does it avoid parking hassles, start and end the day pleasantly, and
avoid nasty radio talk shows, it also relieves stress and promotes
cardiovascular fitness.</p>
<p>But there's another crucial reason to bike. It's pollution-free. With 59
percent of car trips being five miles or less (76 percent are 10 miles or less),
automobiles are creating more and more pollution as people use them for purposes
near to home. Even with the much cleaner cars and trucks developed in the last
35 years, we use and depend on cars more -- much more -- than we did in the '60s
and are losing the air pollution fight.</p>
<p>For my friend Theresa, who bikes downtown to work most days, automobile
pollution has a very personal face -- her older son's asthma. While there are
many possible reasons for his asthma, she and her husband worry that living
close to University Avenue's commuter corridor has resulted in high exposures to
ozone and similar vehicle-caused pollutants. Studies increasingly implicate air
pollution, including car and truck exhausts, as asthma triggers.</p>
<p>Back in the early 1990s, Congress recognized the need to better support
environmentally sound transportation alternatives and passed the Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. That law set aside money to develop mass
transportation, biking and similar environmentally sound alternatives.</p>
<p>But it didn't mandate the allocation of those dollars, and for years
Wisconsin was among the bottom 10 states in spending those federal dollars for
biking and pedestrian projects. Last year, biking and clean air advocates
succeeded in pressuring the state Department of Transportation to spend more of
these earmarked dollars, and it now spends more than $10 million on biking and
pedestrian projects.</p>
<p>Growing up in a coastal community, I used to fantasize as I biked to work
that the bus system would give me passage across the city's many bridges and
tunnels. I dreamed of bike lanes and bike paths. Now I live in Madison, with
bike paths lacing the city and a bus system that's learning how to transport
bikes. As I bike along, I appreciate clean, well-paved streets and dodge the
ruts and glass slivers in others. I'm grateful for wide shoulders on main roads,
but wish I didn't have to breathe the exhaust of long lines of commuters while I
wait to cross streets in my in-town neighborhood.</p>
<p>Federal and other investments in biking have made a difference, but they're
not close to meeting the need. And they don't compare with the state's annual
spending of $730 million on highways, not including the state Department of
Transportation's call for increases of $4 billion over the next 20 years. In
Madison, the tremendous spending on highways and roads and our failure to build
pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods result in problems like Theresa's son
breathing more fumes of more commuters every day, the deterioration of air
quality and increasing congestion in my neighborhood as commuters treat it as
their favorite route home. The state must reduce its bloated highway budget,
which feeds many transportation problems in the first place.</p>
<p>W e should balance our historic excessive highway spending with funding for
high-speed rail, alternatives to congestion like fast rail transit and more
pedestrian and bike facilities. If we don't, we will continue the cycle of city
folks using those perfect and expensive new roads for suburban growth farther
and farther into the countryside, thereby destroying the heart of the country,
the heart of the city, and the health of our children.</p>
