<p>Americans cling to the conceit that 
they have unrivaled opportunity to 
move up and, alas, down the income 
ladder. This notion, that families that 
occupy the bottom rungs of the income ladder readily exchange places 
with those that occupy higher rungs, 
breeds indifference to the most glaring economic fact of the past quarter-century: widening inequality. 
The gap in earnings, for example, 
 between college and high school 
graduates more than doubled.

<p> Yet in a recent Op-Ed piece in The 
New York Times, W. Michael Cox 
and Richard Alm acknowledge that 
the wealth of poor families has been 
falling at the same time that the 
wealth of  rich families has been rising, and ask, "So what?"

<p>  Mr. Cox and Mr. Alm suggest that 
mobility along the income ladder is 
serving as an antidote to inequality. 
But exactly how much mobility is 
there?  According to them, quite a lot. 
"America isn't a caste society," they 
say, citing a study by the Federal 
Reserve that shows that only 5 percent of the poorest 20 percent of 
people stayed in that lowest income 
group over a 17-year period.   
<p>Everyone else moved higher.

<p> But this stunning statistic is stunningly misleading.   
<p>Prof. Peter Gottschalk of Boston College points out 
that the Fed study counts teenagers 
and young adults from upper-income 
families who work part time while in 
school as moving upward when they 
find higher-paying jobs after graduation. This upward mobility of students hardly answers the enduring 
question: How many grown-ups are 
trapped in low-paying jobs? 

<p> The answer is, a lot. America's 
conceit is just that -- a conceit.

<p> Mr. Gottschalk and Prof. Sheldon 
Danziger of the University of Michigan have looked at the plight of children during the 1970's and 80's. They 
separate children into five groups 
according to their family's income. 
About 6 in 10 of the children in the 
lowest group -- the poorest 20 percent -- in the early 1970's were still in 
the bottom income group 10 years 
later.   
<p>Almost 9 in 10 children in the 
bottom group remained in the bottom two income groups 10 years later.   
<p>Neither of these figures budged in 
the 1980's, providing solid evidence 
that mobility did not rise over the 20-year period. About 70 percent of poor 
black children in the early 1970's 
were still poor a decade later. 

<p> The upshot is that few families 
occupying the low rungs of America's income ladder get rich.

<p>    Economists provide no rule for 
figuring out how much mobility a 
society needs to counter the impact 
of any given amount of inequality. 
But there is indirect evidence that 
mobility is not high enough in this 
country to provide an adequate safety valve for those on the bottom 
rungs. Even if mobility was high 
enough 30 years ago to justify a so-what attitude toward inequality, it 
seems improbable that it could be 
high enough today, given that mobility has remained constant but inequality has reached extreme levels. 
Another sobering indicator: mobility 
is no higher in the United States than 
in Western Europe, where living 
standards are comparable and there 
is only a fraction as much inequality. 

<p> Some inequality is essential for 
capitalism. High incomes are the reward for studying long hours, working hard and investing in risky businesses. But high incomes can result 
for reasons that have little to do with 
merit, reflecting rich parents, luck or 
manipulation of the political process. 
 Inequality driven by such factors can 
breed social division, anger and a 
politics of resentment. It also belies 
the notion that America gives everyone a fair chance. 

<p> Economists are in general reluctant to tamper with market-driven 
incomes. The risk of squashing incentives and innovation can be great. 
But there is a compelling case for 
eradicating one virulent form of inequality: poverty. The richest country in the history of the universe 
tolerates a poverty rate of about 20 
percent among its children, and 
about 35 percent among its black 
children. No conceit about mobility, 
real or imagined, can excuse that 
unconscionable fact.
