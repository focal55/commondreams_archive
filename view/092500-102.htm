PRAGUE, September 25 - With thousands of people
converging from throughout Europe to demonstrate against
the IMF and World Bank at their annual meetings, many
people here in Prague are wondering what all the fuss is about.
Security is tight, and residents are being told to stay home and
off the streets. Czech police in their blue and gray polyester
uniforms dot every corner, an unusual sight in a city where the
streets are safe and people generally are not even arrested for
minor drug offenses.  Many Europeans who traveled here to
participate in the events surrounding the meetings have been
turned away at the border, and permits for peaceful marches
have been denied.

<p>The threat of violence has been grossly exaggerated by
the authorities for their own purposes; as in the Washington
DC demonstrations last April, the organizers and protesters
are committed to non-violence. The real danger is that of
embarrassment for the IMF and the Bank. They are fighting to
preserve their legitimacy, which has been badly damaged over
the last three years.

<p>For half a century hardly anyone even knew these
institutions existed, and they operated in the shadows. Those
days are over, although many of their most important
documents and deliberations remain secret.

<p>The Fund and the Bank operate a cartel for credit,
much like OPEC runs an oil cartel. Neither one is leak-proof,
but they both confer considerable power on the men who
control them. While OPEC uses its monopoly power simply to
raise oil prices, these financial giants use theirs to influence
and often dictate the economic policies of dozens of countries.

<p>The IMF is the leader, and a country that falls out of
its favor will not be eligible for most credit from the larger
World Bank, other multilateral lending institutions,
governments, and often private sources of credit as well. This
arrangement gives the Fund (together with the Bank) powers
vastly greater than they could ever derive from their own
resources.

<p>Power is even more concentrated in that the IMF is
basically controlled by the US Treasury Department. This fact
illustrates what dinosaurs these institutions really are. If the
IMF did not exist, nothing like it could be created today. At
the very least the Europeans and Japanese would demand to
have their say, as they do in the WTO (which was created
only five years ago); and the underdeveloped countries, who
are even more excluded from decision-making than Europe
and Japan, would demand a voice in shaping the policies that
now victimize them.

<p>To illustrate IMF policies with an example close to
home: the United States is now running a record current
account deficit. (The current account measures foreign trade
plus other non-investment international transactions). At 4.5
percent of our economy, this deficit is as big as the one that
Brazil was running three years ago when the IMF proposed an
austerity policy as a loan condition. If we were an IMF client,
we would get rid of our trade deficit in the following manner:
the Fed would raise interest rates as high as necessary in order
to throw the economy into a recession. Our economy would
shrink as borrowing for housing and other large purchases
dropped, people were thrown out of work, and businesses cut
back on their investment. As spending plummeted, so would
the purchase of imports, and our trade balance would improve.

<p>Joseph Stiglitz, former chief economist at the World
Bank and a likely candidate for a future Nobel, has called this
a "beggar thyself"-- as opposed to "beggar thy neighbor"--
policy for getting rid of a trade deficit. He resigned under
pressure last year after criticizing these and other policies that
have caused enormous economic damage in countries such as
Indonesia, Russia, and Brazil in recent years.

<p>Because IMF and World Bank policies have failed so
miserably and so often, and because these organizations are so
completely unaccountable and anti-democratic, they have few
defenders outside of a narrow foreign policy elite. And their
opposition is growing by leaps and bounds. In addition to the
protests here in Prague, there will be demonstrations in 60
U.S. cities, backed by the 15 million-member AFL-CIO.
Organized labor has increasingly come to see these
institutions as major adversaries, since they use their creditors'
cartel to enforce the global "race to the bottom" in wages and
working conditions that has hurt American workers as well.
Two weeks ago the Communications Workers of America
took the unprecedented step of pledging to not buy World
Bank bonds, joining a worldwide movement to use the
pension funds of unions, churches, local governments, and
universities to bring pressure on the Bank.

<p>The street heat is working. As the protesters like to
chant, "This is what democracy looks like."
