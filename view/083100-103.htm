COLUMBIA, SC - From Colombia, South America to Columbia, South Carolina, the "Drug War" is
being exposed by human rights organizations as a failed war on drugs, but a
disastrously effective war on poor South Americans and black citizens of the
United States. The phony drug war is being escalated by a President who
"didn't inhale" when they passed the joints around and it's primary victims
are Colombian peasants and racially profiled blacks in the U. S.
      
<p>This week Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Washington Office
On Latin America called on President Clinton to make the protection of human
rights the priority in his meeting with Colombian leaders on August 30.
These leading human rights groups released a 43 page document demonstrating
how Colombia failed to meet a single human rights condition contained in a
$1.3 billion military aid package, that totals more than the military aid we
give all the other countries in Latin America combined. 

<p>On August 23, Clinton signed a so-called national security interest waiver
of human rights conditions placed on the military aid by Congress, and Human
Rights Watch said Clinton's action was a "grave mistake" and  not only made
America complicit in ongoing abuses but risks converting a failed drug war
into a disastrous human rights policy.

<p>This past weekend, 28 people lost their lives in Colombia in the Western
hemisphere's oldest civil war.  According to Human Rights Watch, 35,000
people have been killed and most of them were poor civilians accused by the
Colombian Army or right-wing paramilitaries of collaborating with left-wing
guerrillas.  Last Sunday 60 armed men entered a poor neighborhood in the
town of Cienaga and dragged 10 residents from their homes to an isolated
part of town where they were questioned, then executed.

<p>While poor people are being slaughtered by U. S. armed thugs, The New York
Daily News reports that nearly 2 million Colombians have been displaced by
the war and 10% of Colombia's population now lives abroad.  Arturo Sanchez,
a Colombian born professor in New York, said that middle class professionals
are leaving the country in droves and that "this could be the beginning of
another Vietnam".

<p>Many neutral observers believe "Plan Colombia" is a U.S. State Department
devised plan to enter the counter-insurgency war against the left-wing
guerrillas in the U.S. tradition of armed intervention in Latin America.
But the sudden rise in the strength of the right-wing paramilitaries is
alarming some Washington strategists, and reports state that U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency agents have offered to pay paramilitary leaders to help
them fight the drug trafficking.  Columbia's drug production, which is
estimated to provide 90% of the cocaine consumed in the U.S., has doubled in
5 years as more armed insurgent groups have entered the drug trade to pay
for military campaigns.

<p>As the "War on Drugs" kills and dislocates the poor people of Colombia, in
the U.S. it is incarcerating an alarmingly disproportionate number of black
people.  Human Rights Watch released a comprehensive study on June 8, 2000
describing the stark racial disparities in drug incarceration. Blacks
comprise 13% of the U.S. population, but comprise 62% of drug offenders in
our state prisons!  Nationwide, black men are sent to prison on drug charges
at 13 times the rate of white men, although studies reveal that five times
as many whites use illegal drugs.

<p>In South Carolina, with a black population of 30%, the South Carolina
Department of Corrections reported that blacks comprise 86% of the drug
offenders in our state prisons.
Along with most other states those with felony convictions forever lose
their right to vote and  prospects for good jobs after prison.    

<p>The hypocrisy of "didn't inhale" Clinton, "recreational" smoker Gore, and
"born again" party boy George W. Bush, now a fierce drug warrior like his
dad, is sickening when we are faced with such unjust and tragic consequences
of the "Drug War"!

<p>Human Rights Watch suggests solutions to blatant racial and class inequity.
States should eliminate racial profiling; repeal mandatory sentencing laws
for drug offenders; increase the availability of alternative sanctions;
increase the use of drug courts; and increase the availability of substance
abuse treatment.

<p>White privileged politicians who never spent a day in jail for their illegal
substance abuse activities must end the dirty "War on Drugs" that oppresses
poor and black people. Can they muster the courage and empathy to advocate
such sensible solutions?
