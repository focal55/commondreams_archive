In the wake of protests surrounding the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C., the international
financial institutions have renewed their pledge to alleviate poverty,
protect the environment and fight corruption. But now that the streets of
Washington have returned to normal, is it back to business as usual at
the World Bank? We may have an answer soon. Within a month, the World
Bank will decide whether to finance a controversial oil and pipeline
project in Chad and Cameroon.
<p>Three of the world's largest oil companies--ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch
Shell and the French company ELF--formed the original consortium that
planned to sink 300 oil wells in the land-locked African nation of Chad
and run a pipeline through neighboring Cameroon to the Atlantic coast.
International concern about human rights abuses and environmental
destruction and other problems, caused Shell and ELF to drop out. Now
Chevron and the Malaysian company, Petronas, have joined ExxonMobil in
the project.
<p>The companies have said they won't invest in the project without World
Bank support, which can provide a measure of security against the risks
of investing in such a politically volatile area. According to the U.S.
State Department, state security forces in Chad and Cameroon are
responsible for grave human rights abuses, including extrajudicial
killings, torture and rape. Cameroon last year was rated the most corrupt
country in the world for the second year in a row by the respected
watchdog organization, Transparency International. In Chad, violence in
the project region linked to the prospect of massive oil revenues has
left hundreds of unarmed civilians dead, according to Amnesty
International. The one member of the Chadian parliament who represents
the oil-producing region spent eight months in a disease-ridden jail when
he dared point out project-related corruption.
<p>These signs all indicate that few of the financial windfalls from such
a project will filter through corrupt government officials to reach the
local people who the World Bank says it intends to help. In addition to
exacerbating human rights problems, the pipeline project will also put
the environment of the two countries in deeper jeopardy. The pipeline
will traverse a largely intact area of tropical rainforest, home to
indigenous people popularly known as Pygmies. In Cameroon alone, the
pipeline will make 17 major river crossings, and it will run close along
the Sanaga, one of Africa's most important river systems. Pipeline
leakage, groundwater contamination and fresh water and marine pollution
are ever-present dangers. A leak would endanger communities all along the
pipeline route that rely on surface water systems for most of their water
needs.
<p>In view of the current situation in these countries, the project
likely will only exacerbate problems of corruption, environmental
destruction and human rights abuses. A Republican-led congressional
commission released a report this year criticizing the World Bank for
investing in just these kinds of projects. In the wake of this criticism
and the public scrutiny brought by the recent protests in Washington, the
World Bank should not risk its reputation on such a mammoth, risky
venture. It needs to put in place mechanisms to resolve the human rights
and environmental problems before funding the project. In the meantime,
the World Bank should finance smaller-scale projects that directly target
the priorities of the poor and support sustainable development. Unless
this taxpayer-funded institution proves it can meet its own
sustainability mandates, public support for it only will continue to
erode.
