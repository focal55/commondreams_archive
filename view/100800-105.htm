THE AMERICAN PEOPLE believe that their role in the world is virtuous -- that 
their actions have been for the good of others as well as themselves. And 
they insist that even when their country's actions have led to disaster (as 
in Vietnam) its motives were still honorable.
<P>But evidence is building that in the past decade, the United States has 
seriously misread the nature of the world and its role in it.	 
</P>
<P>  As the lone surviving superpower, it might have led through diplomacy, 
judiciously distributed foreign aid and the formation of coalitions among 
like-minded countries. Instead, it has resorted most of the time to bluster, 
military force and financial manipulation.	 
</P>
<P>  Throughout the world in the wake of the Cold War, official and unofficial 
U.S. representatives have acted, often in covert ways, to prop up repressive 
regimes or their militaries and police forces. Such policies are setting the 
stage for ``blowback'' -- CIA jargon for retaliation against the United 
States for its clandestine operations in other people's countries.	 
</P>
<P>  Every now and then, America's imperial policies come briefly into public 
view. One such moment occurred on July 17, 1998, in Rome, when, by a margin 
of 120 to 7, delegates from virtually all the nations of the world voted to 
establish an international criminal court to bring to justice soldiers and 
political leaders charged with war crimes, crimes against humanity and 
genocide. Differing from the International Court of Justice in The Hague, 
which can only settle disputes only among nations, the new court will have 
jurisdiction over individuals. As a result, efforts like those to bring 
Bosnian and Rwandan war criminals to justice, which today requires specially 
constituted U.N. tribunals, will become far easier. The new court will try 
individuals who commit or order atrocities comparable to those of the Nazis 
during World War II, Pol Pot in Cambodia, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, the Serbs 
in Bosnia and Kosovo, the Hutus in Rwanda, or military governments, most of 
them American-trained and endorsed, like those of El Salvador, Argentina, 
Chile, Honduras, Guatemala, Burma and Indonesia in the 1980s and 1990s.	 
</P>
<P>  Leading democracies of the world, including Britain, Canada, Holland, 
France, Japan and Germany, all supported the treaty. Only Algeria, China, 
Israel, Libya, Qatar, Yemen and the United States voted against it.	 
</P>
<P>  American officials claim that they must protect their 200,000 troops 
permanently deployed in 40 other countries from ``politically motivated 
charges.'' They maintain that, due to America's ``special global 
responsibilities,'' no proceedings can be permitted against its own soldiers 
or clandestine agents unless the United States itself agrees.	 
</P>
<P>Evidently, American leaders believe that they are above the very concept of 
international law -- unless defined and controlled by them. They do not deal 
with the question of whether war-crimes charges against Americans might on 
some occasions be warranted, nor do they consider the possibility that if 
this country intervened less often in the affairs of other states, 
particularly where none of its vital interests were involved, it might avoid 
the possibility of even a capricious indictment.	 
</P>
<P>  Only seven months before the Rome vote, there was another moment when the 
nature of America's stealth imperialism stood revealed. In December 1997, in 
Ottawa, 123 nations pledged to ban the use, production or shipment of 
anti-personnel land mines. Retired American military leaders like Gen. 
Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the allied forces in the Gulf War, have 
endorsed the ban, arguing that these primitive but lethal weapons have no 
role in modern warfare. The Clinton administration, however, bowed to 
military vested interests desperate to retain land mines in the American 
arsenal. Among other things, it insisted that they were needed to protect 
South Korea against the ``North's overwhelming military advantage'' -- 
itself a myth, exposed by the June 2000 meeting of the leaders of North and 
South Korea in which they declared the threat of war on the Korean peninsula 
to be over. The holdouts against the land mine agreement were Afghanistan, 
China, Russia (which later reversed its position), Vietnam -- and the United 
States.	 
</P>
<P>  Jody Williams of Vermont went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize for her 
efforts in organizing the movement that resulted in the treaty. The Clinton 
administration was so embarrassed by its vote that in May 1998 it convened 
its own Conference on Global Humanitarian De-mining at the State Department 
in a public relations attempt to improve its image. Only 21 countries 
attended.	 
</P>
<P>  America's imperial role in East Asia today is as fragile as the former 
Soviet Union's was in 1989 in Eastern Europe, when East Germans unexpectedly 
tore down the Berlin Wall. Despite the fact that the leaders of South and 
North Korea met last June for the first time and pledged to end the division 
of their country, the U.S. military has responded in a surly manner. The 
Pentagon has said that it does not trust these agreements and intends to 
keep U.S. troops in Korea, even if it is reunited.	 
</P>
<P>  As a result of continuous U.S. scare propaganda about the threat of a 
North Korean missile, Japan has committed itself to supporting the United 
States' nonexistent ``theater missile defense'' and to building its own very 
expensive military reconnaissance satellites. But on July 8, the U.S. 
military's test of its so-called National Missile Defense system abjectly 
failed. The United States fired a missile from Vandenberg Air Force Base, 
which released a mock nuclear warhead over the Pacific Ocean. Another 
missile launched from Meck Island in Kwajalein Atoll attempted -- and failed 
</P>
<P>--to shoot the warhead from the sky. A similar test in January 2000 also 
failed. Given the billions of dollars already wasted on it, the whole 
American star wars operation begins to look like one huge con game.	 
</P>
<P>  In July, Japan hosted the annual summit meeting of the leaders of the 
seven major democratic nations plus Russia (G8). The late Japanese Prime 
Minister Keizo Obuchi decided to hold it in Okinawa, an island prefecture of 
Japan that is also the site of 39 American military bases. Anti-American 
revolt has been endemic there ever since Okinawa's reversion to Japanese 
sovereignty in 1972, which produced no change in the American presence.	 
</P>
<P>  The Okinawans blame both the Americans and the Japanese. They are 
continuously exposed to the rape of Okinawan women and teenagers by American 
Marines and sailors, environmental pollution, noise pollution and the 
Pentagon's arrogant presumption that people it has colonized and victimized 
for the past 55 years welcome its presence. They blame the Japanese for 
collaborating with the Americans to keep these troops on their small island.	 
</P>
<P>  On the eve of the summit, the U.S. military in Okinawa once again 
demonstrated that it simply cannot control its own men. Early in the morning 
of July 3, a drunken Marine broke into a private home and groped a 
14-year-old girl as she was sleeping. Only a few days earlier a group of 
drunken Marines got into a fight with a taxi driver as a ploy to help one of 
their mates avoid paying him. And on July 10, a drunken airman ran a red 
light, hit an Okinawan pedestrian and sped from the scene.	 
</P>
<P>  To mark President Clinton's arrival, 25,000 Okinawans joined hands to 
form a human chain around the United States' Kadena Air Force Base. On 
signal, they all held up red cards, the final sanction in soccer. When a 
soccer referee holds up a red card, it means that a player has so violated 
the spirit of the game he must get off the field at once. That's what the 
Okinawans want the Americans to do -- get their bases out now.	 
</P>
<P>What I fear is that when it comes to issues like land mines or troop 
deployments, a civilian president -- even one with better military 
credentials than Clinton's -- can no longer tell his military leaders what 
to do (or not to do). George Washington's Farewell Address, in which he 
counseled Americans to ``avoid the necessity of those overgrown military 
establishments, which under any form of government are inauspicious to 
liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to Republican 
liberty,'' now reads more like a diagnosis than a warning. Both American 
political parties enthusiastically endorse the United States' ``overgrown 
military establishment'' and are deaf to criticism of America's imperial 
role. History suggests that this country is riding for a big fall.

</p>
<b>THE COMPANY WE KEEP</b>
<P>  Most Americans would deem their country's role in the world to be 
honorable, yet the United States' voting record on international human 
rights accords challenges that view. American leaders apparently believe the 
United States is above the concept of international law. Every leading 
democracy has recognized international treaties to protect the rights of 
women and children and to try those suspected of genocide and war crimes, 
except for the United States.

<p>  In July, President Clinton 
signed two protocols to the convention, to protect children from sexual 
exploitation and from being used as soldiers.	
</p>
<p><b>WHY NOT RATIFIED	</b></p>

<b>MOST RECENT ACTION</b>
<P> The United States has promised to sign 
the treaty by 2006, but only if it can find 
acceptable alternatives to the mines it uses now.

<P>The leading alternatives 
under consideration at the Pentagon would still violate the treaty.

<P> The United States, Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Nigeria and Saudi  Arabia are the only countries that still execute juveniles. 
China abolished the practice in 1997. Pakistan, which is ruled by a military 
dictatorship, abolished it in July.	 
</p>
<b>WHY NOT RATIFIED</b>
<P>Twenty-five U.S. states retain the death penalty for juveniles. Critics don't  want an international treaty to supersede state laws.
