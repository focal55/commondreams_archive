Globalization is once again at the top of the agenda, as
the biggest gathering of world leaders in history takes place in
New York for the United Nations' millenium summit. But
most of the discussion and thinking is taking place inside a
very small box, and one that is steeped in popular mythology.

         <p>The phenomenon itself is vastly misunderstood.
Globalization-- defined as an increase in international trade
and investment-- is seen as an inevitable, technologically
driven process. It is billed as a natural phenomenon, like the
weather, to which we all must adapt if we are to survive and
prosper.

         <p>But this has never been true. The globalization we
have seen in recent decades has been driven by a laborious
process of rule-making. It is the establishment and
enforcement of these rules that allows Timberland shoes, for
example, to make their product in China at wages of 22 cents
an hour, and then sell it at the local suburban mall. Advances
in transportation and communications did not determine this
result.

         <p>Our leaders have carefully rewritten the rules of the
game in a way that has driven down wages for the vast
majority of American employees. One may agree or disagree
with this policy, but it should be understood as a conscious
political choice.

         <p>The same thing could have been done to the salaries of
doctors, for example. With much less effort and expense than
it has taken to negotiate investment and trade agreements like
NAFTA and the WTO, we could license and regulate the
training of doctors in foreign medical schools. By allowing
these doctors to practice medicine in the United States, we
could lower the salaries of doctors and greatly reduce health
care costs, without any loss of quality.

         <p>Interestingly, the savings to consumers from reducing
American doctors' salaries to even those of Europe-- where
they are not badly paid-- would be enormous: about $70
billion a year. This is at least a hundred times more than the
efficiency gains from our most comprehensive trade
liberalization agreements, such as the one that established the
WTO five years ago. But it is unlikely to happen, because
doctors-- unlike the majority of the US labor force-- have
enough political clout to protect themselves.

         <p>As much as globalization has hurt American workers,
the results have been far worse for most of the poorer
countries of the world. Over the last 20 years, their economic
growth has been sharply reduced as they have opened their
economies and submitted to Washington's dictates. In Latin
America, for example, income per person grew ten times as
fast from 1960 to 1980, as compared to the past two decades.
In many countries, inequality has also increased.

         <p>A lot of great promises have been made at the summit,
such as halving the number of the world's poor, or halting and
reversing the spread of AIDS, over the next 15 years.

         <p>But there is no reason to take these promises seriously
under present arrangements. The real power over the poorer
countries resides with IMF and World Bank, who head up a
creditor's cartel that is still strong enough to determine what
policies most of them will have to follow. And the IMF/World
Bank nexus, or "the Wall Street-Treasury complex" as one
prominent economist has named it, represents a much more
narrow constituency than the General Assembly of the United
Nations.

         <p>That constituency is considerably more interested in
preserving the status quo, which is why we have seen so little
progress on the crucial issue of debt relief. After four years of
talk, only one of the 41 countries promised debt relief by the
IMF and World Bank has actually seen even partial debt
cancellation. The impoverished and AIDS-stricken countries
of sub-Saharan Africa lose $15 billion a year to debt service,
and no proposed foreign help will come close to making up
for that.

         <p>Even worse, the big pharmaceutical companies, often
with Washington's help, have successfully prevented the
spread of cheap generic substitutes for patented anti-AIDS
drugs that tens of millions of AIDS victims will never be able
to afford.

         <p>Twenty-five years ago the United Nations called for a
New International Economic Order to promote economic
development. The poorer countries began to organize, as labor
unions do within an industry or country, to demand a better
deal. That effort was soon crushed, but recently there have
been signs of revival in organizations such as the Group of
Fifteen (less developed countries). Now that's the kind of
"globalization" that could actually make the world a better
place.
