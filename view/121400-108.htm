<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ongoing electoral insanity 
  has confirmed something that I and a small number of people who have occasionally 
  thought about these things have known for a while: Over the past three-and-a-half 
  decades we in the United States have sold out our election process&#150;which, 
  unless I&#146;m very much mistaken, is the foundation of our democracy (such 
  as it is)&#150;to a small but lucrative cadre of for-profit businesses and their 
  wildly defective products. Which they manufactured, in some cases, many years 
  ago, but which are still used to tally votes today. The real scandal of this 
  election is that most of the problems in the voting and vote-counting systems 
  have been well-known <I>for years</I>, and no one has done a damn thing about 
  them.More than 11 years ago, I wrote a detailed article titled &quot;Vote of 
  No Confidence&quot; for the Silicon Valley weekly,<I> Metro</I>. In the article, 
  I discussed how &quot;The next president of the United States may not be chosen 
  by the voters. Instead, he may be the choice of whoever controls or manipulates 
  the computer systems that tally the votes.&quot; The now famous &quot;hanging 
  chad&quot; was but one small aspect of this story. (Until last month, I was 
  one of the few citizens of the United States who had actually heard, much less 
  uttered, the words &quot;hanging chad.&quot;)</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A deeper problem lay in 
  the security and integrity of the software used to run the vote count. The software 
  for most of the machines, I learned, was incomprehensible&#150;what computer 
  scientists described as &quot;spaghetti code&quot; and &quot;a bucket of worms,&quot; 
  prone to error and vulnerable to deliberate manipulation in a way that would 
  be, for all purposes, undetectable. An ethically challenged software engineer 
  could write a little program to make the count come out however he wanted it 
  to, and no one would ever know. Even if a fraudulent program were detectable, 
  someone would have to look at it first to detect it. And that was impossible, 
  because the private companies that owned the software considered the code a 
  protected trade secret. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, there are today 
  two companies that dominate the industry. Election Systems &amp; Software, whose 
  machines count about 60 percent of the votes nationwide, and Sequoia Pacific 
  Voting Equipment of Jamestown, NY. In 1993, Sequoia Pacific won a $60 million 
  contract from New York City to take the city into the electronic voting age&#150;only 
  to have the contract ditched this year. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No one is saying that those 
  companies, or any of their much smaller would-be competitors, don&#146;t try 
  their best&#150;and certainly not that they&#146;re dishonest. The flaws are 
  inherent to computerized voting systems. I found, 11 years ago, that there was 
  no particular reason to trust the outcome of <I>any</I> election in the United 
  States anymore. At least not those counted by computer, which is most of them.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1989 there has been 
  no reason to update that opinion. Despite having authored that retroactively 
  prescient article, filled with startling facts about the iffy nature of American 
  elections, I have not, over the past decade, spent an undue amount of time waiting 
  by the mailbox for my Pulitzer Prize. Why not? Because I was hardly the first 
  person to make note of these facts. No less a source than <I>The New York Times</I> 
  ran a series about the vulnerability of elections in 1985, by reporter David 
  Burnham, who also wrote the book <I>The Rise of the Computer State</I>. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As early as 1974, the U.S. 
  General Accounting Office commissioned a study that found significant accuracy 
  and security problems in the methods used to count votes by computer. In 1986, 
  the California Attorney General&#146;s office released a report criticizing 
  computerized vote-counting systems for &quot;lacking a reliable audit trail 
  and having a program structure that is very difficult even for computer professionals 
  to understand.&quot; In 1988, the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
  (then called the National Bureau of Standards) released a study by computer 
  scientist Roy. G. Saltman that concluded, in the typically understated language 
  of government documents, that &quot;it has been clearly shown that audit trails 
  that document election results, as well as general practices to assure accuracy, 
  integrity and security, can be considerably improved.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Somewhat more bluntly, Computer 
  Professionals for Social Responsibility followed up on Saltman&#146;s report 
  in their fall 1988 newsletter, declaring: &quot;America&#146;s fundamental democratic 
  institution is ripe for abuse... It is ridiculous for our country to run such 
  a haphazard, easily violated election system. If we are to retain confidence 
  in our election results, we must institute adequate security procedures in computerized 
  vote tallying, and return election control to the citizenry.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also in 1988 (something 
  of a watershed year for computer-voting exposes), the journalist Ronnie Dugger, 
  founder of <I>The Texas Observer</I>, authored a staggeringly long and meticulously 
  researched essay for <I>The New Yorker</I> (when <I>The New Yorker</I> was still 
  publishing staggeringly long and meticulously researched essays) in which he 
  singled out the &quot;Vote-o-Matic&quot; system in particular&#150;still a popular 
  computer voting system, and the very one used in those disputed Florida counties&#150;as 
  possibly &quot;disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of voters.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dugger explained how computer 
  systems that tabulate elections are shot through with error and wide open to 
  what, more recently, James Baker might call &quot;mischief.&quot; I talked to 
  Dugger back in 1989, when I was writing my own article. Freed from the genteel 
  strictures of <I>New Yorker</I> house style, he told me, &quot;The whole damn 
  thing is mind-boggling. They could steal the presidency.&quot; </font></P>
<P ALIGN="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149;</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Computerized 
  vote-counting is a terrible system. This is only news to those who haven&#146;t 
  been paying attention. Every problem that&#146;s arisen in the 2000 election 
  has been on the public record for more than a decade. Yet here we are. Why? 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My first thought was that 
  less-wealthy counties can&#146;t afford the latest technology. They&#146;re 
  stuck with outdated systems like the Vote-o-Matic, for reasons of pure economics. 
  But David Lublin doesn&#146;t think so. He teaches in the American University 
  School of Public Affairs Dept. of Government, and is now on his second grant 
  from the National Science Foundation to collect election data from around the 
  country. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I wouldn&#146;t say 
  the wealthier places always have better or well-conducted elections,&quot; he 
  says. &quot;Often that is the case, but there are surprising exceptions. It 
  depends on the willingness of the local county authority to spend the money, 
  or the state to require them to do it.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nor, for that matter, is 
  increasingly sophisticated computer technology the answer. In fact, it may only 
  make the problems even worse. For example, the next generation of voting computers 
  what are what&#146;s known as DREs (&quot;Direct Recording Electronic&quot;), 
  kind of voting ATMs that allow voters to cast ballot-free votes on a video monitor 
  by pressing buttons, or even on a touch screen. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;DREs are even worse,&quot; 
  says Rebecca Mercuri, a computer scientist at Bryn Mawr who&#146;s studied computerized 
  elections for more than 10 years and recently finished her doctoral dissertation 
  on that exact topic at the University of Pennsylvania. DREs leave no &quot;audit 
  trail&quot; (paper trail) whatsoever, she points out. Votes are recorded directly 
  onto a memory cartridge. There is absolutely nothing to ensure that the vote 
  that registers on the screen is the vote that gets recorded on the cartridge, 
  or that the vote that is recorded on the cartridge is the vote that prints out 
  on paper. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Unless the voter sees 
  that paper trail, how do they know?&quot; she says. &quot;I could teach a 12-year-old 
  to write a program that shows one thing on the screen and another thing on the 
  printout.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While some newer election 
  computing companies say they&#146;ve figured out how to create a foolproof electronic 
  audit trail, Mercuri dismisses such claims as &quot;preposterous.&quot; There&#146;s 
  no way to make sure that software is 100 percent pure. &quot;If we could do 
  that in computer science, we&#146;d have the virus problem solved,&quot; she 
  says. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since computers were first 
  used to count votes in the early 1960s, there have been dozens of instances 
  of computer error in elections. And that&#146;s counting only the known errors. 
  There have been no verified frauds, but that may be only because computer fraud 
  is nearly impossible to verify. Former Florida Gov. Kenneth &quot;Buddy&quot; 
  MacKay suggested last week to Carl Bernstein (in an article on the website Voter.com) 
  that computer fraud may have been behind his highly suspicious 1988 Senate loss 
  to Connie Mack. MacKay lost by 33,000 votes out of four million. In a development 
  that foreshadowed what happened this year, the tv networks had &quot;called&quot; 
  a MacKay victory only to later tell their viewers &quot;never mind.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Funny thing was, in four 
  large counties&#150;Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Hillsborough&#150;200,000 
  fewer voters registered votes in the Senate race than in the presidential race. 
  That&#146;s a 20 percent drop-off. In other counties, and in earlier elections, 
  the drop-off was around <I>1</I> percent. Computer error or tampering remains 
  the most likely explanation for the alarming discrepancy, though none was ever 
  proved. MacKay tried to get a look at the source code for the vote-counting 
  software but was rebuffed by the election equipment companies who declared it 
  proprietary. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What could have happened 
  in 1988,&quot; MacKay told Bernstein last week, &quot;was that the machines 
  could have been programmed so that in my big precincts every tenth vote got 
  counted wrong.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another &quot;Sore Loserman,&quot; 
  perhaps? Maybe&#150;but MacKay was echoing what Peter Neumann, principal scientist 
  at SRI International&#146;s Menlo Park, CA, computer lab (and author of the 
  1995 book <I>Computer-Related Risks</I>), said back then. Writing about the 
  MacKay-Mack election in <I>Risks Digest</I>, Neumann noted, &quot;Remembering 
  that these computer systems reportedly permit operators to turn off the audit 
  trails and to change arbitrary memory locations on the fly, it seems natural 
  to wonder whether anything fishy went on.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here are a few other amusing 
  anecdotes from the annals of wacky election computing: </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Middlesex County, NJ, 
  this year, a DRE vote-counting computer went on the fritz. It recorded votes 
  for both the Republican and Democratic candidates in the county freeholder&#146;s 
  race, but simply wiped out all votes for their respective runningmates. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1985 Dallas, TX, 
  mayor&#146;s race, Starke Taylor defeated Max Goldblatt in an election so controversial 
  that it led the Texas legislature to investigate the flaws in the state&#146;s 
  computerized vote-tabulation process. Allegedly, according to the <I>Dallas 
  Morning News</I>, a computer had been shut off and given &quot;new instructions&quot; 
  after it showed Goldblatt leading by 400 votes. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the Democratic presidential 
  primary of 1980, in Orange County, CA, a &quot;programmer&#146;s error&quot; 
  gave about 15,000 votes cast for Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy to Jerry Brown&#150;and, 
  of all people, Lyndon LaRouche. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are many more such 
  tales. Computers in Oklahoma skipped 10 percent of the ballots in a 1986 election. 
  A power surge in San Francisco switched votes from one candidate to another. 
  A Moline, IL, city alderman actually took office in 1985 only to step down three 
  months later when someone figured out that a machine had misread hundreds of 
  ballots due to a bad &quot;timing belt.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You get the picture. The 
  Dallas case prompted the Texas Secretary of State to direct that, in future 
  elections, a &quot;manual recount&quot; could be ordered to &quot;ensure the 
  accuracy of the count.&quot; The actual ballots, the computer punch cards themselves, 
  are the only existing &quot;audit trail,&quot; to document how people actually 
  voted. </font></P>
<P ALIGN="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149;</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I don&#146;t 
  want to appear &quot;partisan,&quot; but with all of these well-documented facts, 
  it seemed to me that the Republican idea that machine counts are better than 
  human counts is patently absurd. So I called up Bob Swartz, founder of Pennsylvania-based 
  Cardamation, one of the nation&#146;s largest makers and sellers of computer 
  punch cards and card-reading machines. (Not many companies are in that field 
  anymore.) Swartz has been in the punch-card business for 40 years, though he 
  doesn&#146;t do election business anymore. I thought that made him a good person 
  to ask. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Turns out, in his line of 
  work, looking at computer cards with your own eyes is standard procedure. &quot;We 
  didn&#146;t call it a &#145;hand count.&#146; We just called it &#145;looking 
  at the cards,&#146;&quot; he says. &quot;We read the cards through the machine 
  twice, and if there are differences we look at the cards. If our goal is to 
  get 100 percent accuracy, there&#146;s no question that&#146;s the way to achieve 
  it.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Swartz fully expects card-reading 
  machines to make mistakes. It&#146;s when they do <I>not</I> make mistakes that 
  he gets suspicious. &quot;If you recount 400,000 votes and there&#146;s no difference,&quot; 
  he says, &quot;someone fudged the figures.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No election system can ever 
  be fraudproof or error-free. That doesn&#146;t mean we shouldn&#146;t try to 
  improve on the dismal systems we&#146;re using today. It just seems that casting 
  votes on paper ballots, then counting and recounting them by hand, is the surest 
  way to figure out who really won an election. Assuming mostly honest personnel, 
  and barring breathtaking acts of ineptitude, human vote-counters will not, generally 
  speaking, discard ballots by the thousands on a mere whim. Nor will they, unless 
  they are severely reading-deficient or insane, record votes cast for one candidate 
  as votes cast for another candidate. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further, it is much more 
  conspicuous for a dishonest election official to issue new instructions to a 
  group of human beings midway through a counting session than it is for a dishonest 
  computer programmer to type a few new lines of code into a machine. Perhaps 
  most importantly, there is nothing &quot;proprietary&quot; about a person picking 
  up pieces of paper and going &quot;one for this guy, one for that guy.&quot; 
  If Americans, or at least the television networks Americans like to watch, weren&#146;t 
  so damned impatient, conducting elections completely on paper ballots would 
  be the most sensible solution. Noncomputerized elections take a lot longer to 
  produce results, there&#146;s no denying that. But we don&#146;t hold elections 
  all that often in this country. We wait four years to vote for president. We 
  can&#146;t wait another week or two to find out who won? </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the never-ending election 
  of 2000 (and I have to admit, it is taking a long time) teaches us anything, 
  it&#146;s that we can indeed wait it out for a while without untoward consequences. 
  </font></P>
<P>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If America returned to the 
  paper ballot system, fraud and error in elections definitely would not end. 
  They would, however, be much easier to detect and correct. Elections would be 
  run by people, not corporations. There are enough vested interests trying to 
  influence every election. Why do we need the extraneous interest of profit-making 
  companies?
