Earthlings have continued a tradition of bizarre rituals during 
their planet's current season. A columnist from the Galactic Syndicate 
provides this analysis:

         <p>From afar, we may be inclined to smirk at the activities of 
humanoid creatures who inhabit the only life-covered orb in what they call 
"the solar system." But all of us should do our best to understand events 
on Earth, no matter how strange they may be.

         <p>The watery planet, located 93 million miles from its sun, is 
currently dominated by one nation, the United States of America. Because of 
its preeminent power on that globe, the governance of the USA is of 
considerable interest.

         <p>While admirable in some respects, Earthlings -- who number several 
billion -- are not the most self-aware of beings. Their conceits and 
pretensions are apt to calcify into formulaic rites, often embraced with 
credulous fervor.

         <p>And so it goes in the United States, where a new leader is 
selected once every 1,460 cycles of darkness and light. Prior to the 
election, in which some of the USA's citizens vote, events occur which are 
known as "debates."

         <p>With enormous amounts of attention devoted to those spectacles, 
you might imagine that they profoundly explore subjects of great 
importance. Unfortunately for the millions -- indeed billions -- of 
affected and hapless Earthlings, this is not the case.

         <p>Clerical participants in the "journalism" faith are eager to 
assess those debates in terms that are superficial, even idiotic. Not only 
is the focus on appearance, style and practiced composure. Even more 
astonishing, after the latest series of debates ended, most of those 
ecclesiastic professionals voiced satisfaction with the mode of discourse.

         <p>Perhaps a form of shared delusion or even mass hypnosis is 
involved. How else can we explain the constant evaluation of leaders as 
performers -- as if their facile and glib verbal fencing could make up for 
the absence of discernment about the self-destructive essence of deeply 
ingrained institutional habits?

         <p>In the planet's mass media, the most absurd Earthlings are 
commonly employed as "pundits." While claiming special expertise in fields 
such as journalism, history and social science, they function like fleets 
of haywire spaceships -- staying in fairly symmetrical proximity to each 
other, apparently embarked on rational explorations, yet sharing reliance 
on wacky compasses that send them tumbling and spinning through vast 
expanses of time-warped space without relation to fixed points.

         <p>After the most recent series of debates, these pundits were prone 
to go into raptures about the transcendent value of lavish generalities, 
platitudes, homilies and miscellaneous poll-tested buzz phrases spouted 
incessantly by the candidates. Because the standards are so chronically 
debased, craven drivel is likely to be rewarded with profuse accolades.

         <p>To explicate such dynamics, one might visit a few of the Earthling 
libraries. In the USA, those long-term repositories for books exist in 
sharp distinction to the modernized and elaborately maintained holy temples 
for the sacramental material known as "money." In contrast to banks, the 
public libraries tend to be in various stages of disrepair and neglect.

         <p>In the library sections devoted to young beings, there are some 
books which can explain the fatuous musings of pundits. One tale, "The 
Emperor's New Clothes," illustrates a key dynamic of journalism in the USA 
region of Earth. Desires for safety and peer approval -- and deep fears of 
vulnerability to social disapprobation -- lead pundits and countless other 
Earthlings to remain in step with prevailing nonsense.

         <p>As a result, the ritual abuse of reasoning faculties is treated by 
pundits with inordinate respect. In fact, most members of the punditocracy 
are determined to match the patronizing exercises in circumscribed debate. 
Amid all the glaring injustices, looming ecological disasters and economic 
priorities that place the accumulation of wealth over humanoid well-being, 
the media commentators seem as anxious as major candidates to confine 
themselves to discussing options for minimal tweaking.

         <p>Inside the often-dilapidated and sparsely funded structures of 
public libraries, humans can find books by the Earthling writer Mark Twain. 
One, titled "Roughing It," includes an apropos passage at the end of a 
chapter about the vagaries of mining for a fortune. When Twain regretfully 
observes that "all that glitters is not gold," his more experienced 
companion, a fellow named Mr. Ballou, retorts: "Nothing that glitters is gold."

         <p>"So I learned then, once for all, that gold in its native state is 
but dull, unornamental stuff, and that only low-born metals excite the 
admiration of the ignorant with an ostentatious glitter," Twain wrote. 
"However, like the rest of the world, I still go on underrating men of gold 
and glorifying men of mica."

         <p>Unfortunately, the Earthling journalists usually seem unable to 
resist the glittery. They are in the easy habit of mistaking its shimmering 
gloss for substance.

         <p>Perhaps this distant mirror can shed light on some of our own 
foibles and foolishness. Traveling at 186,000 miles per second, 
illumination could get here in a hurry.

Highly Deceptive Media."</i>
