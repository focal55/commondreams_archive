BEFORE I LEARNED that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would be sharing 
the stage with me as UC Berkeley's keynote speaker for convocation exercises 
on May 10, I had submitted to the Committee on Prizes a packet of 
application materials in competition for the school's highest honor, the 
University Medal. The last question that the eight-person panel of 
professors posed to me was: ``If you had a chance to address your graduating 
class, what would you talk about?''	 
<P>  I told them that I wanted my speech to have a global perspective and that 
I intended to impart a serious, but not somber, message to my colleagues 
that while we are living in an age of exploding dot-coms, ``stock options'' 
and outrageously high salaries out of college, the truth was the United 
States' tremendous wealth as the strongest superpower in world history comes 
at the expense of a great deal of human suffering elsewhere. By way of 
examples that I would draw based on my own interests as an Arab and as a 
history major, I would remind my fellow graduates that our world extends 
beyond Berkeley, and certainly beyond the borders of the country to which my 
parents immigrated from Palestine almost three decades ago.	 
</P>
<P>  That Madeleine Albright would also address my class added an interesting, 
though not terribly influential, dimension to my plans. I could not imagine 
speaking at my convocation, in the spring of the new millennium, without 
mentioning what I consider to be the greatest human tragedy of our time: the 
obliteration of the modern state of Iraq and the death of hundreds of 
thousands of Iraqi people from preventable illnesses, starvation and bombing 
since the imposition of U.S.-backed economic sanctions after the 
Persian-Gulf War. Indeed, I would have used Iraq to illustrate a larger 
point about the arrogance of power.	 
</P>
<P>I also could not imagine that I would not take the opportunity to confront 
Madeleine Albright with the damning quote that has haunted her for four 
years ever since she appeared on ``60 Minutes'' and told Lesley Stahl -- who 
had just returned from Iraq -- that the ``price was worth it'' to advance 
U.S. policy in the region, even if it 
meant the death of half a million Iraqi children.	 
</P>
<P>  Albright had suffered a humiliating political setback in February 1998 at 
the hands of Ohio State University students at a CNN International Town 
Meeting. Like me, the students were outraged that a genocide of this 
magnitude could continue unchallenged for nearly 10 years. And less than a 
week after she left Berkeley, she faced a crowd opposing U.S. sanctions at 
the more conservative George Washington University's commencement.	 
</P>
<P>  Albright did not hear my own condemnation, because she fled from Berkeley 
unexpectedly after the university administration switched the order of 
speakers at the last moment when we were all already sitting on stage. It's 
unfortunate, but in many ways telling, that she could not bear to sit 
through my speech and give me an opportunity to say what all the hundreds of 
voices who met her -- black and white, Arab and non-Arab, Muslim and atheist 
</P>
<P>--
were saying, as they ``spoke truth to power.''	 
</P>
<P>  I watched as the protesters were expelled one by one for speaking out 
about injustices in Iraq. By then, the speech that I had prepared -- which 
was not entirely political and had included a substantial portion about what 
I learned from my class on Sproul Plaza -- not only encouraged me to give 
the impromptu speech that I did, which was solely about Iraq, but dictated 
that I do so.	 
</P>
<P>  I talked about how the sanctions were ``infanticide masquerading as 
policy,'' in the words of House Minority Whip David Bonior; that basic food 
supplies and medicines are blocked from entering Iraq in sufficient 
quantities and the U.S. government bombs Iraq still, nearly every day, with 
depleted uranium, which causes tremendously high cancer rates. Even though 
Saddam Hussein is a dictator, I told them he has historically been sustained 
by U.S. dollars and weapons and that innocent 
Iraqi civilians should not have to pay with their lives for that sordid 
relationship.	 
</P>
<P>  Had I said nothing, the protesters would have remained a spectacle -- 
misunderstood, loud, irritating and disruptive -- instead of a brave and 
inspiring voice of justice.	 
</P>
<P>  Some outspoken critics fault me for using the podium to advance my 
political opinions, and for ruining what in their mind is a celebratory 
occasion. Madeleine Albright's presence itself was a political statement, 
and her not mentioning the atrocities in Iraq was a more resounding 
statement still.	 
It is crucial, too, to see a convocation as an event that challenges 
graduating seniors with issues that they will likely face as this country's 
future leaders. Celebrations and congratulations aside, I was talking about 
another holocaust. Though my focus might have been on an Arab country to 
which I am connected by culture, nationality, and, of course, humanitarian 
concern, by no means was the larger point I tried to communicate confined to 
any one region or any one people.	 
</P>
<P>My fellow students have causes of their own about which they are passionate, 
and there is no monopoly on the recognition of human suffering. Neither is 
there an inappropriate time to expose injustices wherever we might find 
them.	 
</P>
<P>  Though Albright may not have heard my message, hundreds of supporters 
throughout the world did. The letters of solidarity that I received mean 
more to me than the University Medal itself, whether they came from 
classmates and professors, academicians at Harvard, Yale, MIT, and Stanford, 
or written in broken English from Germany, South Africa, France, Bangladesh, 
El Salvador, Iraq and Palestine.	 
</P>
<P>  As one letter read, ``Sometimes the smallest victories vindicate the 
larger injustices.''	 

<P><I>Fadia Rafeedie, who will begin pursuing her studies at Yale Law School this fall, served as a board member for the Bay Area chapter of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.
