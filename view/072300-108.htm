If the mere thought of the Republican and Democratic conventions 
creates an urge to yawn, you're hardly alone. 	 
</P><P>    But don't 
tune out. Behind the scenes, tens of thousands of people are 
planning to transform empty, scripted coronations into unforgettable 
protests, zany celebrations and sneaky Shadow Conventions.	 
</P><P> Although the recent World Trade Organization demonstrations 
in Seattle and Washington caught the public by surprise, many 
of these protesters have been working to create an international 
movement for years. Their aim is not to prevent global trade, 
but to address the many problems and casualties resulting from 
unregulated and rapid globalization. One of their key goals, 
in fact, is to ensure that new international standards will 
not wipe out all the consumer laws we have passed during the 
last 30 years.	 
</P><P> For now, many of them are not terribly interested 
in electoral politics. Instead, they want their movement to 
change the terms of debate. In short, they hope to entreat Americans 
to place people before profits as we rush headlong into global 
trade.	 
</P><P> What neither party wants to debate --  economic 
injustice and inequality, at home and abroad --  is precisely 
what these activists seek to broadcast. At both national political 
conventions, they intend to force the media's spotlight on the 
need for campaign finance reform and a ban on the death penalty, 
neglect of the working poor and the homeless, and the suffering 
of workers and civilians affected by policies of international 
organizations like the World Bank, the International Monetary 
Fund and the WTO.	 
</P><P> The Democracy In Motion Caravan Roadshow 
began its coast-to-coast tour on July 10, hoping to spark the 
same earnest and whimsical spirit of activism that inspired 
the protests in Seattle and Washington, D.C. At each stop, veterans 
of these protests hold workshops on nonviolent disobedience, 
political economy, ecological and global policies and, lest 
they take themselves too seriously, creative loafing.	 
</P><P> When the Republican convention convenes in Philadelphia on July 31, 
caravan organizers will join thousands of local activists who 
are expected to participate in daily rallies and marches for 
a week. On August 14, they will rendezvous with their West Coast 
counterparts, who plan to treat delegates at the Democratic 
convention in Los Angeles to similar rallies, disruptions and 
protests.	 
</P><P> A small but critical mass of these young people 
are children of '60s activists. Inspired by their parents -- 
or by a romanticized version of that period --  they are now 
building on the ideals of that era, even as they attack new 
targets. Unlike so many young people during the '80s and early 
'90s, who worried --  with good reason --  about whether they 
would ever find employment, today's youth, like their Boomer 
parents in the 1960s, can afford to look beyond their immediate 
material needs and protest the economic inequality they see 
at home and abroad.	 
</P><P> Unlike activists since the '60s, these 
young activists reject identity politics in favor of coalitions 
that emphasize inclusiveness. Having grown up in the aftermath 
of the women's movement, they instinctively analyze the different 
ways in which women and men experience life at home and at work. 
Children of the civil rights generation, they automatically 
consider the racial implications of global policies. Raised 
in the wake of the sexual revolution, they are comfortably conversant 
with a broad range of sexual orientations.	 
</P><P> Their goals, 
they say, are economic and social justice. Within the last three 
years, for example, college students created Students Against 
Sweatshops on more than 200 campuses. In addition to launching 
successful consumer boycotts against sweatshirts and other university 
apparel produced under subhuman conditions, they also forced 
Nike to disclose the location of its factories and to open its 
books for public inspection.	 
</P><P> Joining these students and 
young people are members of a newly revitalized labor movement 
who are anxious about the impact of globalization on themselves, 
as well as on workers around the world. Some of these unions 
have even forged unprecedented coalitions with ecological groups 
whose goal of sustainability is daily mocked by the irreversible 
environmental damage taking place each day in the deserts, rain 
forests, rivers and oceans of the world.	 
</P><P> Armed with a relatively 
sophisticated analysis of the global political economy, this 
coalition condemns the ecological and economic policies that 
have intensified human misery in much of Africa, Latin America 
and Asia.	 
</P><P> At each convention, protesters plan to highlight 
a variety of urgent problems. In Philadelphia, for example, 
they will start their weeklong activities with a march of the 
poor --  those who have fallen through the tattered fabric of 
an unraveled social safety net. The next day, they will protest 
the ``prison industrial complex'' that funds and builds prisons, 
rather than schools. On the third day, UNITY 2000, a huge coalition 
of some 200 organizations --  including the NAACP, NOW, Students 
Against Sweatshops, local union chapters and the Interfaith 
Coalition --  will march for the movement's two core principles: 
putting people before profit, and ending the corporate greed 
that exploits people here and around the world.	 
</P><P> What is especially appealing about these organizers is how seamlessly 
they weave a complicated critique of global and domestic injustice 
with a playful, sometimes wacky, sense of humor. Their motto, 
emblazoned all over their Internet site, is, ``The Party's Over.'' 
Their ``Call to Action'' invites us to ``Crash the Party.'' 
Perhaps their most hilarious caper --  and one that may grab 
the most media attention --  is the Million Billionaire March, 
at which faux billionaires for Bush or Gore will hoist banners 
that protest, ``99 Percent Is Not Enough!!''	 
</P><P> Puppet processions, 
a signature feature of the Seattle and Washington demonstrations, 
will once again communicate, through images rather than political 
rhetoric, the impact of economic injustice and ecological catastrophe. 
Activists will once again don costumes carefully sewn by hand; 
parading as turtles, they will be making a strong statement 
about what Michael Lerner of Bolinas' Commonweal has called 
``the Age of Extinction'' --  the cumulative loss of thousands 
of species.	 
</P><P> These organizers are passionately committed 
to nonviolent protest, a conviction reinforced by workshops 
in civil disobedience and prohibitions against drugs and liquor. 
They want their message heard, not buried under denunciations 
of violent acts. But they know how impossible it is to control 
the behavior of those who may join them. Police in both cities, 
moreover, are growing increasingly edgy, especially in the wake 
of the excessive police force recently used in Philadelphia.	 
</P><P> In addition to these outdoor marches and rallies, there will 
be indoor Shadow Conventions, hosted by Arianna Huffington, 
a onetime Newt Gingrich cheerleader and now a self-described 
``recovering Republican.'' Funded by George Soros' Open Society 
Institute and other foundations, the Shadow Conventions perhaps 
will offer even more legitimacy to the protests outside. Huffington 
is determined to focus public attention on three issues that 
the two parties will carefully avoid: campaign finance reform, 
the failure and consequences of the war on drugs, and poverty 
and the growing gap between the rich and poor.	 
</P><P> With her 
pitch-perfect media savvy, Huffington has rounded up the usual 
suspects --  Ralph Nader, Jesse Jackson, and Sen. Paul Wellstone 
</P><P>-- along with some unexpected Republican speakers, including 
Rep. Tom Campbell, Sen. John McCain and New Mexico Gov. Gary 
Johnson. To grab the attention of the young, as well as that 
of the media, Huffington has gathered a coterie of celebrities 
(think Warren Beatty), along with big-name bands chosen by Rock 
the Vote. For comic relief, she has lined up some well-known 
stand-up comedians from ``Saturday Night Live.'' Perhaps her 
most creative innovation has been to assemble a group of satirists 
who will provide continuous commentary on the conventions -- 
through subtitles on a real-time video feed that will be broadcast 
over the Internet, and she hopes, on C-SPAN. If done well, it 
could be a scream.	 
</P><P> Naturally, there will be those who condemn 
these sideshows as adolescent distractions from the real event: 
the nomination of the candidates for national office. But to 
protest organizers, it is the conventions themselves --  carefully 
scripted to suppress any debate about the real issues facing 
the American public and the global community --  that reek of 
irresponsible, even adolescent behavior.	 
</P><P> Sure, democracy 
is messy, as endless commentators have noted. But the role of 
social movements is to force us to address problems and consider 
solutions that threaten many economic and social interests. 
So just when it all seems too noisy and contentious, consider 
the alternatives.	 
</P>
<P> In any event, tune in. Despite the intentions 
of the national political parties, there will be serious debate, 
as well as comic relief and great entertainment. You just might 
learn something you never knew you wanted to know.
