The ice cream was no problem. Neither were the little cartons of milk nor the Dr. Pepper from the vending machine that technically is for staff only. But the Chicken McNuggets with barbecue sauce?
<P> "Let's just say I'll have to think about that," Ben Smith, a sheriff's deputy at the Cumberland County Jail, said quietly Tuesday. "I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that one.</P>
<P> A few feet away, Dean Mallis looked up from what well could be his deathbed in the jail's medical unit and repeated his request</P>
<P> "Don't forget the nuggets," he said. "You promise?</P>
<P> "I told you, Dean, I'm not going to promise something if I'm not sure I can deliver," Smith replied patiently. "I'll see what I can do, buddy, OK?</P>
<P> "OK," Mallis said, his withered body motionless except for his blood-blackened lips. "See what you can do . . .</P>
<P> The big picture here is a travesty.  Mallis, near death with complications from AIDS, is for now confined to his 8-foot by 10-foot cell because the county &#150; and, for that matter, the state of Maine &#150; lacks a clear plan for balancing terminally ill inmates' criminality with their mortality. Credit for this revelation goes to Sheriff Mark Dion, who readily admitted this week that his jail cannot provide the end-of-life care that Mallis so clearly needs</P>
<P> But there's also a small picture unfolding each day in the jail's medical unit. Despite the lack of hospice care that would make his life &#150; or what's left of it &#150; more bearable, Mallis has found at least one source of compassion.</P>
<P> Deputy Ben Smith.</P>
<P> "I'm not here to judge the guy &#150; you've got to put that stuff aside," Smith said. "The man's paid his dues as far as I'm concerned."</P>
<P> Mallis, it should be noted, is hardly the most congenial inmate Smith has met in his 21 years as a deputy. Charged with detaining and sexually assaulting a mentally challenged man in a motel room, Mallis has been in jail since July for bail violations after he allegedly harassed other people with AIDS as well as AIDS workers who were trying to help him</P>
<P> Still, at 62 pounds and dropping, whether or not Mallis is a good guy is &#150; at least to Smith &#150; irrelevant.</P>
<P> "He's 26 years old," said Smith, who is 59. "He can't have had much of a life . . . And it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out he shouldn't be here."</P>
<P> So the deputy with the big heart and the quick smile does what he can. Several times a day, Smith makes a special trip to the kitchen to grab Mallis a couple packages of ice cream or a carton of milk. When Mallis vomits on the floor, Smith is there in surgical gloves and a mask to mop it up. If the television outside Mallis' cell is on the wrong channel, Smith is happy to change it.</P>
<P> Then there are the special favors: Monday, when Mallis asked for a Dr. Pepper, Smith thought what the heck and dug into his pocket for change. But on Tuesday, when Mallis asked for the McNuggets, Smith balked.</P>
<P> "He has trouble swallowing, so I'm afraid he'll choke on them," he explained, out of Mallis' earshot. "Otherwise I'd head over to McDonald's and get them in a minute."</P>
<P> They are not, as Smith is quick to point out, close friends. Truth be told, he can't say he really knows Mallis all that well. But a few days ago, another inmate beckoned Smith over and pointed toward Mallis. "You're the only one who seems to care about him," the inmate said.</P>
<P> Smith disagrees. The fact that he's volunteered to care for Mallis, he insists, doesn't make his co-workers any less compassionate.</P>
<P> "I'm not trying to be a hero," he said. "I'm not looking for anything."</P>
<P> Maybe not, but truly good work should not go unrecognized. During Tuesday morning's shift change, while his fellow deputies nodded their approval, Ben Smith was named Corrections Officer of the Month.</P>
