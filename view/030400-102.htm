<p>In a few months scientists will have completed a rough first draft
of the complete human genome, the 60,000 to 80,000 strings of chemical
codes that determine who we are, from brown hair to a predisposition to
cancer.
<p>Gene research offers promise for curing major diseases like AIDS and
cancer, but progress is threatened by the increasingly aggressive quest
of biotechnology entrepreneurs to patent genes as their structures are
unlocked. A patent holder can claim exclusive right to use of the gene.
<p>Patents once went only to those who produced inventions that
significantly advanced the state of an art. The first human gene patents
were awarded nearly two decades ago to companies and research centers
that showed how a gene could be used to produce a specific valuable drug
product such as human growth hormone or insulin. Since then, however, the
patent office has come to issue patents far more broadly. For example, it
has given hundreds of patents to biotech firms that did little more than
use computers to decode the chemical sequences that make up the genome.
<p>In handing out gene patents this way, the federal government risks
impeding valuable research, allowing companies to hide gene sequences as
though they were trade secrets and discouraging scientists from
understanding and experimenting with genes patented by someone else.
<p>On Wednesday, the patent office outlined what it said were reforms
aimed at awarding patents less broadly. The reforms, however, don't
address key problems.
<p>One problem is that when patent owners withhold information about
human genes from perceived competitors, they prevent the sharing of
knowledge that's essential to scientific progress. Another is that while
future drugs are likely to work by simultaneously affecting the behavior
of many genes, current patent laws essentially prohibit drug researchers
from experimenting with genes they don't own. Gene therapies may one day
produce miracle cures. But researchers who are permitted to study only a
limited number of genes will be severely hampered because diseases often
arise from complex interactions between multiple genes and the
environment.
<p>One worthy suggestion for reform comes from the University of
Michigan's Rebecca Eisenberg, a legal scholar. She says that rather than
handing out broad gene ownership patents that allow companies to hide
their gene discoveries from others, the patent office could draw up
"cross-licensing arrangements." These arrangements would legally ensure
that companies got a share of profits whenever the gene they helped
discover was used in a mass-market drug. At the same time,
cross-licensing would guarantee that all scientists could experiment with
a given gene without fearing reprisal from a company claiming ownership.
<p>Last month, President Clinton declared that the human genome should be
readily accessible to everyone. He should direct the patent office to
develop approaches that encourage rather than impede science. This
includes reclaiming the original intent of patents, which should balance
reward to inventors with benefit to science and the public. Biotechnology
companies have every right to a share of profits gained when others
market drugs based on genes they helped discover. But genes are natural
creations and everyone should have equal access to them.
