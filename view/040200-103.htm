YOU WOULD HAVE thought that President Clinton had a gun pointed to his head 
when he signed legislation three years ago ``to end welfare as we know it.''	 
<P>  At an elaborate White House ceremony on Aug. 22, 1996, he said he would 
sign the bill (euphemistically called the Personal Responsibility and Work 
Opportunity Reconciliation Act) even though he was ``deeply disappointed'' 
that it would strip legal immigrants and their children from a range of 
federally funded benefits, including food stamps and Medicaid. 	 
</P>
<P>  ``Legal immigrants and their children should not be penalized if they 
become disabled and require medical assistance through no fault of their 
own,'' he declared. ``Neither should they be deprived of food stamp 
assistance without proper procedures or due regard for individual 
circumstances.''	 
</P>
<P> The law signalled a radical departure from our nation's historic treatment 
of legal immigrants. Until the welfare law went into effect, legal 
immigrants, who pay taxes like any other American, were eligible for 
virtually all benefits.	 
</P>
<P>  Even as he was signing the bill, Clinton vowed to try to reverse some of 
the provisions he found most egregious. ``I am determined to work with 
Congress in a biparisan effort to correct the provisions of this legislation 
that go too far and have nothing to do with welfare reform,'' he declared. 	 
</P>
<P>  But he failed to take into account multiple obstacles, including the U.S. 
Supreme Court. This week, the court refused to hear an appeal by Chicago 
city officials and a group of legal immigrants who said that denying them 
benefits violated their constitutional rights. Chicago had already lost in 
two lower courts, which had ruled that the United States is not required to 
give non-citizens the same welfare benefits as citizens.	 
</P>
<P>  The Supreme Court's decision -- 
or more accurately, its lack of one -- will provide a cover for legislators 
who will be able to cite the court's inaction to justify doing nothing to 
restore benefits to legal immigrants.	 
</P>
<P>Two years ago, immigrant advocates launched a ``Fix '96'' campaign to 
restore some of the excised benefits. So far, the campaign has yielded some 
successes. For example, Congress has restored food stamps and Supplemental 
Security Income to disabled and elderly low-income immigrants who came to 
the United States before August 1996. 	 
</P>
<P>  But the basic architecture of the bill remains untouched. Still left out 
in the cold are all new immigrants (other than refugees) who arrived in the 
United States after the law went into effect.	 
</P>
<P>  Over the past three years, nearly 60,000 new immigrants have settled 
annually in San Jose, Oakland and San Francisco alone. Increasingly, local 
and state authorities have been left with the burden of picking up what was 
once a federal responsibility.	 
</P>
<P>Just because the Supreme Court has refused to weigh in on the subject, 
Congress should not be let off the hook. Congress now has an opportunity to 
correct the problem in two ways.	 
</P>
<P>  It can vote to approve legislation sponsored by Sen. Daniel Moynihan, 
D-N.Y. and Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., which would allow states to provide 
health coverage to legal 
immigrant children and pregnant women, and to restore Social Security 
disability benefits to elderly immigrants even if they came here after 1996 
</P>
<P>--but only if they become disabled after they get here. 	 
</P>
<P>  Or Congress could approve proposals contained in President Clinton's 2001 
budget, which includes $2.5 billion over the next five years to do much of 
what the Moynihan-
Levin bill will accomplish.	 
</P>
<P>  But the larger lesson is one that ought to be obvious to every third-
grader: once a president signs a bill, it becomes the law of the land. As 
Clinton has discovered, it is far easier to sign something into law than to 
remove it from the books later on. The time to protest would have been 
before he signed the bill, not afterward.	 
</P>
<P>  It is now likely that he will leave the White House with the 1996 bill 
largely intact. To each new immigrant, his words of protest on that muggy 
summer's day 3 1/2 years ago will sound increasingly hollow.	 
</P>
<P>
