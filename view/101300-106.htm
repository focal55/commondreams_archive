My son served in the Israeli army in the West Bank, so for me the
barbarous killings Thursday of three soldiers by a lynch mob in Ramallah
made me feel the same anger that must have led Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak to bomb Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's compound in
retaliation and to escalate the war against the Palestinians. Yet I can
also understand that to the Palestinians the three boys killed were just
members of the occupying army, the army that has brutally killed more
than 85 Palestinians and wounded more than 2,000 civilians in the past
two weeks and which might have seemed indistinguishable from the Jewish
mobs that attacked random Arab Israelis in Nazareth a few days ago,
beating and burning.
<p>For every outrage on one side, there is a story of outrage on the
other. And yet, in my synagogue on Yom Kippur we atoned for our side of
the story, for Jewish violence. Our atonement was not an attempt to claim
that Israel holds all the responsibility. I believe that Palestinians
ought to adopt a nonviolent pose and reject any leader who advocates
violence, because I believe that violence is always wrong no matter how
noble the purpose and because in the context of the current struggle, it
had the predicted effect of destroying rather than enhancing the chances
for peace--an outcome sought by extremists on both sides.
<p>Palestinian violence is both immoral and irrational. Yet the
preponderance of responsibility lies with Israel and with an
international media that continue to obscure the basic realities facing
the Palestinian people, and continue to treat the death of Israeli
soldiers enforcing a brutal occupation as somehow more outrageous and
barbarous than the killing of many times as many Palestinian teenagers
who were resisting the occupation.
<p>To me, Israeli deaths are a personal tragedy. But have we not yet
learned that in God's eyes every human being is equally treasured? The
way we talk that discounts the huge number of Palestinians killed and
wounded reinforces the desperation that led to the current tragic moment.
But, you might ask, didn't Arafat irrationally reject a wonderful peace
accord being offered him by Barak? Isn't this current outbreak just more
of the same irrational hatred that always leads Palestinians to reject a
generous peace being offered by Israel?
<p>The reality is quite different. Since taking office, Barak has
expanded existing settlements, built new roads into the West Bank and
made it clear at Camp David that he would insist on keeping the vast
majority of settlers in place. The state the Palestinians would then be
offered would have within it a group of Israeli nationalistic fanatics,
many of whom moved to the West Bank precisely to ensure that there would
never be a Palestinian state.
<p>The resulting scenario is obvious: The settlers would continue their
long history of violent attacks against Palestinians, and when the
Palestinian state tried to impose law and order, the settlers would
demand protection from the Israeli army, which would use the new roads to
send in tanks and heavy artillery just as it has done in the past week.
<p>These Israeli roads and settlements turn the claim of offering the
Palestinians 90% of the land into a cruel hoax. With the Israeli military
patrolling those roads that crisscross the Palestinian state,
Palestinians would face humiliating searches and would not be able to
move freely. Imagine someone offering you a house in which you were going
to have large rooms but they were in charge of the hallways between the
rooms. You would quickly realize that your freedom to be "at home" was
remarkably compromised. For a people who have endured 33 years of
military occupation, with a long history of documented torture, house
demolitions and harassment, this doesn't sound like such a great deal.
<p>Nor are Palestinian demands for control over the Temple Mount and the
adjacent sections of East Jerusalem irrational. Muslims from the occupied
territories have frequently been prevented from coming to the Temple
Mount when Israel proclaims "security closings" of the border. Israelis
who were rightly outraged at being denied access to the Western Wall when
Jerusalem was under Jordanian (not Palestinian) rule from 1948 to 1967
have effectively imposed similar conditions on the 1 million Muslims in
Gaza.
<p>At the same time, many religious authorities ban Jews from walking on
the Temple Mount until the messiah comes. So ceding sovereignty there
would not have been a religious hardship. Barak could have conceded
interim sovereignty to the Palestinians on the condition that those
arrangements would be reopened when the messiah arrived (by Biblical
criteria: nations beating their swords into plowshares and the lion lying
down with the lamb).
<p>Nor has Israel ever acknowledged responsibility for the hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians who were driven out of Israel in 1948, many of
whose descendants today live in refugee camps.
<p>None of this had been resolved at Camp David, and so most Palestinians
realized that the peace process was just another mechanism to prolong the
status quo of an oppressive occupation.
<p>I was honored to attend the signing of the Oslo accords at the White
House in 1993, and in the pages of Tikkun magazine I have severely
criticized those Palestinian intellectuals like Edward Said who did not
believe that Palestinian self-determination would be granted in the five
years that Oslo promised. Now, seven years after Oslo, I can understand
why Palestinians would feel cheated and outraged over the endless
occupation. Add to that the racist attitudes that led Barak to seek
Israeli Arab votes in the last election, his subsequent refusal to allow
Arab parties into his government for fear that their presence would make
the government appear "illegitimate" and the long history of
discrimination against Israeli Arabs in housing and employment, and you
get the volatile ingredients that led to the explosions last week and the
subsequent massive violence against Arabs both inside Israel and in the
occupied territories.
<p>None of this justifies Palestinian violence or the far more massive
counter-violence of the occupying Israeli army. But I see no hope that
the disgusting cycle of violence on both sides will stop until Israel is
willing to end the occupation and end its internal racism against Arab
Israelis. As a religious Jew, I know that God and the Torah are served
best when we insist that every human being, including our enemies, be
seen as equally valuable to God and equally created as embodiments of the
divine. Given my own outrage over the killing of Israeli soldiers, this
is a moment when it seems easier to just forget my faith and stay in my
anger. But I also know that when the Jewish people can only see our own
pain, however real and legitimate, it is time to atone.
