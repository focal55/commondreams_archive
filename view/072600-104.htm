WASHINGTON -- In Bushworld, it's always Day 41 of 
Desert Storm, that glorious day the 
president's approval ratings soared 
toward 91.

<p>    The head-scratching choice of 
Dick Cheney is explained by the fact 
that he was in the bunker during the 
family's finest hour. They would 
have preferred Colin Powell, who 
was also in the bunker during their 
finest hour. But they let Brent Scowcroft, who was also in the bunker 
during their finest hour, help seal the 
deal for Mr. Cheney.

<p> It's impossible to work up even a 
solitary goosebump for a former 
staff member in the Ford White 
House. A prosperous, well-fed, balding, bland, male Republican Washington insider and former House 
leader who voted to the right of the 
N.R.A. <I>and</I> Newt Gingrich.

<p>  In Congress, Mr. Cheney was way, 
way out there, always willing to pony 
up money to guerrillas in Nicaragua 
and Angola but not to poor women 
whose lives were endangered by 
their pregnancies.

<p>  When Trent Lott starts gushing 
about somebody, Katie bar the door.

<p>  The Texas governor who promised 
to be a "different kind of Republican," the candidate who used words 
like "inclusive" and "compassionate" and "heart," is now running 
with a guy who defended cop-killer 
bullets and plastic guns that could 
slip through airport metal detectors. 

<p> Million moms will love that.

<p> The Bush convention in Philadelphia will be gauzy, trying to appeal to 
women, moderates and minorities, 
showcasing Elizabeth Dole, Condoleezza Rice (also in the bunker at the 
finest hour), John McCain, General 
Powell and Laura Bush. The opening 
theme is "Leave no child behind." It 
will be delicious to see how the Republicans deal with those Cheney 
votes against Head Start.

<p>"Inclusive" loses a little punch 
when you are running with someone 
who in 1986 opposed a call to release 
Nelson Mandela after 23 years in 
 prison, and often voted against the 
economic sanctions that helped 
crush apartheid. 

<p>   The Cheney choice is about the 
past. But then, W.'s campaign has 
always been less about vision than 
vindication.   
<p> The dauphin must reclaim the throne because the Bushes 
must restore the halcyon days of the 
ruling-class court that thrived before 
that dissolute commoner Bill Clinton 
usurped it.

<p>   The family yearns to go back to the 
"honorable" days, the golden era of 
Establishment reign -- before the decision not to go into Baghdad began to 
fester, before Bill Clinton stole credit 
for the thrumming economy, before 
first ladies went all weird on us.   
<p>

<p> Mr. Cheney was picked because he 
is the anti-Quayle. George I was determined that George II not repeat 
his mistake, choosing someone 
young and callow. The ticket already 
had that covered. 

<p> Back in 1988 Mr. Cheney, then a 
House luminary, would have been a 
good choice for George I. For George 
II, he comes across as the baby sitter.   
<p>

<p> Mr. Cheney has been minding Junior all year -- first coaching him in 
foreign affairs, then helping him sort 
through his V.P. picks, and now stepping in to provide a steady hand on 
the tiller. 

<p> The past dictated the choice in this 
way as well: W., who had loafed 
through long years when he could 
have been prepping for the presidency, felt he needed some heaviness on 
the ticket. 

<p>   The Bushes hate being "psychoanalyzed," as they call it. They don't 
like personal questions. And yet they 
make many crucial decisions based 
on personality.

<p>  The father chose Dan Quayle and 
the son chose Dick Cheney for the 
same reason: They wanted men who 
liked them, men with whom they had 
"a comfort level."

<p> And while Mr. Cheney might have 
voted like Tom DeLay, he has a calm 
and avuncular air. He vetted the 
other candidates, but he himself was 
vetted by W. and Poppy, who, as 
usual, trusted their instincts.

<p>I doubt either Bush would have felt 
comfortable running with a woman. 
Or with anyone who challenged their 
egos or made waves, like John McCain. They need a history of loyalty, 
and they have a preference for deference.   
<p> Dick Cheney is one of their guys, 
in the Club. And they know best.   
<p>

<p>  Before the Bushes mess up any 
more vice-presidential picks, for Jeb 
or George P., they might want to stop 
checking their gut and start checking 
the voting record.

<p> A ticket with two rich white Texas 
oilmen who went to Yale, avoided 
Vietnam and act more moderate 
than they are? For the Bushes, that's 
a perfect fit.
