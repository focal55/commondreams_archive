<p>President Clinton has taken an enormous political gamble in sending Congress legislation to make China a normal member of  the world trading system. Until now there has been plenty of trade  with China, but its most-favored-nation status has been subject  to annual review and renewal under Cold War era legislation denying normal trade status to totalitarian countries.
<P>
<P>Clinton's action is a gamble in two key respects.  First, the action, which could have been deferred until after the November election, will split his own party like nothing since NAFTA.
<P>
<P>The AFL-CIO, which is doing a lot of the heavy lifting for Al Gore, has made defeat of normal trade status for China its top legislative priority this year. China denies workers the right to  organize, and it pays them wages that undercut US wage standards.
<P>
<P>So far there are fewer than 60 House Democrats willing to vote for Clinton's plan.  This past week Representative John Murtha of  Pennsylvania, a respected senior Democrat who has supported  freer trade, sent around a letter to colleagues warning that normal trade status for China now would deprive the United States of its best  diplomatic leverage at a time when China is menacing Taiwan.
<P>
<P>So the White House will depend heavily on Republican support to get the bill passed, deepening Democratic divisions. But because of Republican unease at China's recent saber-rattling, a majority of House Republicans may not support trade privileges for China either.
<P>
<P>Like the Democrats, the Republicans have divisions in their own ranks. The Republican Party is split between members of Congress  responsive to corporate interests who are lobbying hard for a China deal and hawkish GOP congressmen influenced by the Taiwan lobby who want to keep China ostracized until its behavior  improves.  One Republican proposal would tie trade privileges for China to increased military aid to Taiwan.
<P>
<P>However, the issue does not generate the kind of bitter divisiveness in Republican ranks that it does on the Democratic side of the aisle.  Caught smack in the middle is Al Gore, who has shuttled between business audiences promising to support the  China deal and labor meetings where he pledges to renegotiate it.
<P>
<P>If the China jockeying follows the NAFTA script, it will be disastrous for the Democrats' electoral fortunes and the Gore  campaign. In the end, Clinton may narrowly prevail, but only by   twisting arms of Democratic congressmen, infuriating Vice  President Gore's labor allies, diverting resources and energies from the presidential campaign, and possibly embracing the Republican  Taiwan amendment, which could well intensify the risks of military  hostilities.
<P>
<P>The other major gamble is the China policy itself.  At a major address this past week at the John Hopkins School of Advanced  International Studies, President Clinton made the best possible  case for his China policy. China is a one-party state that does not tolerate opposition, he admitted. But the question is not whether  we approve or disapprove of China's practices.  The question is,  what's the smartest thing to do to improve these practices.
<P>
<P>Membership in the WTO, of course, will not create a free society in China overnight or guarantee that China will play by  global rules, Clinton continued. But over time, he said, it will move China faster and further in the right direction and certainly  will do that more than rejection would.
<P>
<P>That is exactly the question.  In fact, there is rapidly increasing  trade with China and Western investment in China as well as gradual  liberalization of Chinas society, even under China's present  provisional status.  The practical issue is whether China has  liberalized enough to have earned permanent trade privileges now or whether they should be withheld pending further progress.  By  granting such privileges now, the United States gives up the leverage of  annual reviews.
<P>
<P>Republicans, who control Congress, are expected to delay the  China WTO vote until later in the election year. They will likely schedule it at a moment calculated to create maximum divisiveness in Democratic ranks.
<P>
<P>Clinton could certainly have held off until next year. Well-placed sources say that Clinton sent Congress this legislation  now, against staff advice and against the wishes of the Gore campaign, in order to make the China deal part of his legacy.
<P>
<P>His wish may come at an extremely high price. Even with China in the WTO, China's brinkmanship with Taiwan and its human-rights violations will very likely continue. Clinton may well bequeath to his successor a first-class foreign policy mess, and the intraparty acrimony over the vote could help ensure that the successor is George W. Bush.
<P>
<P>Some legacy.
