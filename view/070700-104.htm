What is Connecticut's secret?
<P>
    How is that, there, two powerful entities have mustered the conscience and courage to admit their promotion and support of the hideous practice of slavery while, elsewhere, individuals and institutions alike would, seemingly, surrender their lives before making an apology for ancestral complicity?
<P>
    Fittingly, it was on the Fourth of July that the Hartford Courant -- which has been published continuously longer than any other daily newspaper in the country -- offered front-page repentance on behalf of long-dead owners, apologizing for profiting from the slave trade.
<P>
    "From its founding in 1764 well into the 19th century, The Courant ran many ads for the sale and capture of human beings," reported Jesse Leavenworth and Kevin Canfield, authors of the article. "In effect, Courant publishers, including founder Thomas Green, acted as slave brokers."
<P>
    Although some experts said the newspaper couldn't have gotten too much loot from the ads, the Courant notes that the ads were effective in nabbing runaways. "We are not proud of that part of our history and apologize for any involvement by our predecessors at The Courant in the terrible practice of buying and selling human beings that took place in previous centuries."
<P>
    The newspaper's repentance was preceded in March by a similar apology from Aetna Inc., the nation's largest insurance company, also based in Hartford. Aetna acknowledged the possibility (or probability) that it had sold policies to slave owners to indemnify the loss of their human chattel.
<P>
    Aetna's spokesman conveyed the company's "deep regret over any participation at all in this deplorable practice."
<P>
    Given the amount of time that has lapsed since a historic American newspaper and an eminent American insurance company had anything to do with such hideousness, apologizing might seem like no big deal. None of the current crop of decision-makers has any culpability, after all.
<P>
    But tell that to any number of Americans who recoil at the very thought of incrimination by lineage. You'd think they feared prosecutors or hangmen at the door. Usually, they stake their repudiation of the idea on the bygones-be-bygones principle. Or they protest on the basis of their own innocence in the actual offense -- a position rendered inviolate by the fact that not only they, but in many cases their parents and grandparents, were not even conceived when the wrongdoing took place.
<P>
    The nation had a big fuss about this a few years back, when some members of Congress -- black and white -- suggested that the nation might do well to apologize for slavery, which, for a long time, it supported in both spirit and law.
<P>
    At first blush, it appeared to be a proposition that could do no harm and could possibly do some good in soothing the racial aches that continue to bedevil this country. But, no. Objectors were loud and widespread. So much so that President Clinton, who normally has a quick grasp for such symbolic gestures, backed off without supplying a coherent excuse for the abdication. It was that touchy.
<P>
    To its great credit, The Courant recognized that since it had called on Clinton to issue a national apology and since it had blasted the Aetna case across its front page, the newspaper could not slink into the broadsheet's innards in confessing its own sins. Nor did it waste time doing it.
<P>
    Skeptics and naysayers, take note. The cost to Aetna and The Hartford Courant has been, and I predict will continue to be, negligible. There is no run on cancellations of policies or subscriptions.
<P>
    What the two companies have gained in terms of good will, honor and public faith is incalculable, but a sure thing. Their apologies cannot erase past stains, but they surely do present a clean slate for the future. It is certainly much easier to patronize a company big enough to admit that, somewhere in its continuum, it committed a wrong, that it is now sorry for it and, thus rueful, bound and determined to never again betray decency.
<P>
    It does not make the companies infallible, but it goes a long, long way in making them forgivable.
<P>
    "I dreamt the past was never past redeeming," wrote the poet Richard Purdy Wilbur.
<P>
    I don't think it is. Unless we are.
