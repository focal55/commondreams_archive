JOHN LENNON (1940-1980)<BR>
<BR>
  <i>&quot;Only people know just how to talk to people. Only people know just how to change the world.&quot;</i> From the song &quot;Only People,&quot; by John Lennon<BR>
<BR>
  <BR>

  Do you remember what you were doing on Dec. 8, 1980?<BR>
<BR>
  I was driving home from a friend's party in a furious snowstorm about 1 or 2 a.m. The news broke in on the radio: John Lennon had been murdered, shot dead by a frenzied fan who had been waiting outside of Lennon's Manhattan apartment. Can it already be 20 years?<BR>
<BR>
  For many Americans of my generation, this is one of several moments, like the lunar landing or the assassination of John F. Kennedy, that trigger a specific memory of location and activity. Where were you when you heard the news? What were you doing? Now it's worth considering why we remember.<BR>
<BR>
  There's the tragedy of the timing. The 1970s had generally been a hazy decade of recovery from the frantic 1960s and, similarly, it was a pretty difficult decade for Lennon. After he had nearly killed himself with the drug-and-alcohol lifestyle that took a toll on many musical greats of the era, Lennon disappeared from public life for about five years.<BR>
<BR>
  Just prior to his death, a rejuvenated, sleek and apparently happy and fulfilled John Lennon returned to the studio. As we used to say in the '70s, Lennon had &quot;gotten his head together.&quot; More mythically, he had managed to redefine himself as father, house-husband and middle-aged musical prophet, prepared to tell us the wisdom he had gathered. Tellingly, his new hit song, released just a few weeks before the murder, was entitled &quot;Starting Over.&quot; Perhaps Lennon's journey from drugs and hysteria might be a metaphor and a guide for our own recovery and rebirth. Or so we might have thought.<BR>
<BR>
  John Lennon was a symbol of '60s rebellion and rebirth. Resist authority! Give Peace a Chance! We're more popular than Jesus! Let's have a bed-in news conference! Yet, in 1980, the Lennons were basically an immigrant family. A British man, a Japanese woman, and their bicultural son, living in the multicultural mecca of planet Earth: New York City.<BR>
<BR>
  Think of his keynote song: &quot;Imagine&quot; is a poem that can be read as a declaration of independence from the tyrannies of the mind. In effect, Lennon invited us to imagine that many of the truths we hold so dearly are mere fabrications. Like many great Romantics such as Emerson and Thoreau, Lennon hoped to free our minds from the bonds of slavery.<BR>
<BR>
  The rise and fall of John Lennon contain many of the elements of the American myth, made even more poignant because he was shot down just as he was &quot;starting over.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
  I was appalled by the grisly detail of the mad stalker standing on 72nd street after the shooting, calmly reading &quot;The Catcher in the Rye.&quot; How dare he stand there, reading one of the novels that fired my furnace when I first read it as a high-schooler in 1972? &quot;Catcher&quot; was one of the seminal novels of its generation. And like Lennon, Holden Caulfield stood for the awakening of the human mind, the rebirth that constitutes a major motif of all of American literature. The fact that Lennon's murder was associated with a lunatic reading this marvelous story of teen revolt and freedom seemed a dark irony.<BR>
<BR>
  Now 20 years have passed -- just like that. Cultural critics agree that John Lennon is one of the 20th century's great icons of revolution and rebellion, from the time period (the 1960s) that is generally considered the great moment of cultural revolution and rebellion. I believe his status was sealed by the mythic circumstances of his death. Who can forget the thousands of weeping fans who held vigil for Lennon in Central Park after his death?<BR>
<BR>
  We always tend to remember the good rather than the bad of our fallen mythic figures. In forgetting Lennon's personal foibles, his rather acerbic and offensive self-centeredness, we should also recall what he stood for mythically -- in many ways, the profoundly human desire to try to &quot;imagine&quot; a world reborn as better, more generous, and above all more humane than it currently is.<BR>
