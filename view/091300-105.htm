GINETTA SAGAN, the human rights activist who died last month at age 
75, was better known to the powers-that-
be than to the public. President Clinton honored her work for Amnesty 
International by awarding Sagan a presidential Medal of Freedom in 
1996. Vaclav Havel, president of the Czech Republic, and Kim Dae 
Jung, the South Korean president, were among the prisoners of 
conscience she helped set free. When Augusto Pinochet imprisoned 
thousands of Chileans opposed to his 1973 coup d'etat, Sagan somehow 
reached the general's direct phone line and demanded that he release 
them all.
<P>  A diminutive woman with a warm smile and intense energy, Sagan 
always insisted that anyone could have done the same. Working out of 
her home, she seemed to be nothing more than ``that housewife in 
Atherton,'' as former CIA chief William Casey once called her.	 
</P>
<P>  Far from being a pose, Sagan's refusal to be ``somebody,'' to seek 
public office or to take an official position in a human rights 
organization, drew from the secret sources of her strength.	 
</P>
<P>Sagan was incognito from the day she was born. The love child of a 
French Jewish doctor and a married Italian Catholic doctor, Ginetta 
took on the identity of her wet nurse's baby who had died two years 
earlier. This arrangement shielded her parents from scandal -- her 
father, under Italian law, was unable to obtain a divorce -- and it 
protected Sagan from persecution as a Jew during the war years.	 
</P>
<P>  Growing up with a false identity also prepared Sagan for her role 
in the Italian Resistance. Known as Topolino, or ``little mouse,'' 
the 4-foot-11 teenager seemed innocuous. The prominent Fascist 
officer and his mother for whom she worked as a maid in 1943 never 
guessed that as the girl scrubbed every surface of the house, she was 
listening in on phone conversations and searching for official 
documents in the trash.	 
</P>
<P>  Sagan's branch of the Resistance, based in Milan, succeeded in 
smuggling nearly 10,000 people into Switzerland. Topolino 
escorted 300 anti-Fascists, Jews and draft evaders across a barbed 
wire fence that marked the Swiss border. A removable section of 
barbed wire, which she retrieved after the war and wrapped around a 
candle, was to become the symbol of Amnesty International.	 
</P>
<P>  In February 1945, Topolino was captured, imprisoned and raped. One 
night, she sat alone in a pitch-black cell when, she recalled, ``a 
man threw a loaf of bread in the cell, calling me a whore and all 
sorts of names.'' Hidden inside the hollow panini, she found a 
matchbox containing one match and a tiny scrap of paper. Lighting the 
match, she read: ``Corragio! Lavoriamo per te.'' (Courage! We are 
working for you.) Sagan told this story many times. She wanted people 
to know that they can make a difference by writing prisoners of 
conscience and their jailers in countries around the world, letting 
the former know that they are not alone and the latter that they are 
held responsible for what they do.	 
</P>
<P>  Creating an international constituency to insist that people in 
every country, regardless of their religion, politics and ethnicity, 
have the right not to be persecuted or unjustly imprisoned became 
Sagan's lifework. In 1967, a friend introduced Sagan to a Greek woman 
who described her experiences under the military junta. Sagan learned 
that methods of torture that the Gestapo used in wartime Italy and 
throughout occupied Europe were being 
practiced again. Shortly thereafter, she joined Amnesty 
International, which had been founded by London lawyer Peter Benenson 
in 1961.	 
</P>
<P>  In Paris, Sagan applied the techniques of the Resistance to the 
task at hand. She formed a network that included veterans of the 
Italian underground and Greeks in hiding from the junta. Sagan 
compiled lists of prisoners and located the prisons where they were 
detained. Fact-finding required her to travel to Greece several 
times, always disguised and under an assumed name.	 
</P>
<P>  In 1971, Sagan recruited Joan Baez and Melina Mercouri to perform 
at a fund-raising concert in support of the junta's prisoners. 
Shortly after this event, which drew 10,000 people to Berkeley's 
Greek Theatre, Baez and Mercouri joined a group on the Stanford 
University campus that formed the first West Coast chapter of Amnesty 
International.	 
</P>
<P>  When Gen. Pinochet overthrew President Allende's government, 
Sagan, Baez and their West Coast cohort initiated Amnesty 
International's first direct-mail campaign. Their efforts proved 
instrumental in expanding Amnesty's influence and its U.S. 
membership, which eventually reached 290,000.	 
Alliances with celebrities did not diminish Sagan's need for 
anonymity. She learned to hide within the shadow cast by the light of 
publicity.	 
</P>
<P>  In 1985, Sagan invited Baez to travel 
with her to Poland, which was then under martial law. Sagan had 
raised money to support people imprisoned for their participation in 
Solidarity, the worker's revolution that, ironically, was challenging 
the Soviet empire. How to get funds into Poland was her problem. When 
their flight arrived in Warsaw, Baez and the film crew that 
accompanied her became the focus of attention. Sagan, ostensibly just 
another member of the entourage, was smuggling thick wads of currency 
under her clothes. Suddenly her pantyhose snapped. Baez quickly took 
her friend's luggage and told customs officials that the woman's back 
was hurt. ``I walked as if I had broken my spine,'' recalled Sagan.	 
</P>
<P>  Trying to remain incognito, Sagan accompanied the singer to Father 
Jankowski's parish house where they spent the night. The next day she 
hid in the church as Baez entertained the congregation.	 
</P>
<P>The 60-year-old smuggler managed to accomplish her mission, but her 
presence became known to the authorities.	 
</P>
<P>  As she traveled in a car chauffeured by Lech Walesa's driver, the 
vehicle's brakes failed. Believing the car to have been sabotaged by 
agents of Gen. Jaruzelski, Sagan made a point of posing for a 
photograph beside the wreck, a triumphant smile on her bloody face. 
She did not care that her name be known, but she wanted the general 
and his henchmen to see her spirit.

SAGAN FUND AND AWARD
<P>In 1974, Amnesty International USA established the Ginetta Sagan Fund 
(and Award) for women's and children's human rights to preserve her 
legacy in perpetuity. The annual presentation of the Ginetta Sagan 
Award honors the ``ordinary'' women who have the courage to change 
their world.	 

<P><I>Stephen Most, a Berkeley-based playwright and scriptwriter, interviewed Ginetta Sagan for a documentary film about prisoners of conscience.</I>
