It has been almost two centuries since the poet Lord Byron penned these words:

<P><I>Roll on, thou deep and dark blue</I></P>
<P><I>ocean -- roll!</I></P>
<P><I>Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee</I></P>
<P><I>in vain;</I></P>
<P><I>Man marks the earth with ruin -- his</I></P>
<P><I>control</I></P>
<P><I>Stops with the shore.</I> 

<P>If only the poet had been right. We find ourselves marking the ninth World Oceans Day today amid news of an impending freshwater crisis, and of the shocking decline of both freshwater and saltwater fish stocks. Today, the seven seas that cover more than 70 per cent of our planet have never faced a greater threat.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, far more than 10,000 fishing and whaling fleets have swept the oceans since Byron's time, putting hundreds of species at risk of extinction. The ruin that Byron already saw on land in 1812 has extended into every watery corner of the globe. From mercury poisoning to the dumping of radioactive waste, the oceans have been continually and thoughtlessly used as a dumping ground for the disposal of dangerous materials.</P>
<P>Canada has a critical international role to play in reversing the degradation of the sea and protecting the creatures that live in it. After all, we possess the longest coastline in the world -- nearly 244,000 kilometres. As well, we have the second-largest continental shelf -- 3.7 million square kilometres -- of any country. The marine environment we are responsible for covers an area of approximately five million square kilometres -- equivalent to 53 per cent of Canada's land area. And it's not just the size of our marine area that's so impressive. About 1,100 species of fish are found in our Canadian waters, as well as a wide variety of marine mammals.</P>
<P>And many of them are in trouble. The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) -- the scientific body responsible for determining species at risk -- lists more than 50 marine-associated species as extinct, endangered, threatened or vulnerable. Included on the endangered list are beluga, bowhead and northern right whales. The harbour porpoise, sea otter, humpback whale, and beluga (eastern Hudson Bay population) are regarded as threatened.</P>
<P>At the same time, both the Atlantic cod fishery and the Pacific salmon fishery have been reporting dramatic shortages. Up and down the coastal communities, these shortages have led to closures, people being thrown out of work, and economic uncertainty. We're now living with the cumulative negative effects of decades of both land-based and maritime sources of pollution. Clearly, much needs to be done -- and as soon as possible.</P>
<P>One of the most important and achievable goals is something the World Wildlife Fund is working on with Canada and more than other 100 countries: the creation of an international system of ecologically representative &#34;marine protected areas.&#34; Marine protected areas are a relatively recent concept. It was at the first World Conference on National Parks in 1962 that the need for protection of coastal and marine areas was recognized internationally.</P>
<P>What's the point of these areas? We need them to safeguard endangered species; to protect marine biodiversity and ecosystems; to protect and restore essential fisheries areas, including key breeding and migration sites; to sustain important commercial and local fisheries and to reduce conflicts between different marine-environment users.</P>
<P>In the past three decades, we've seen more than 1,300 protected areas established in more than 80 countries, ranging in size from just a few hundred square metres to the largest and best known, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia, which covers 339,750 square kilometres.</P>
<P>In the eyes of WWF Canada, legitimate marine protected areas are places that do not permit industrial activities or commercial resource extraction to disturb habitat on a large scale -- although they may allow certain fishing practices. But there should not be dredging, mining, oil or gas development, drilling, bottom trawling, dumping, dragging, &#34;finfish&#34; aquaculture or any other activity that severely jeopardizes the protected area's ecological integrity. The use of different regulatory zones within an area means that some areas would be &#34;no-take&#34; (prohibiting all fishing), while other areas could be zoned for multiple use, including tourism, recreation and limited fishing.</P>
<P>There's much work to do. Only three of the marine protected areas established so far in Canada -- Fathom Five National Marine Park in Ontario, Pacific Rim National Park Reserve in B.C. and Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park in Quebec -- meet the WWF Canada guidelines.</P>
<P>Still, the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans has committed itself to creating a network of protected areas. The necessary legal and legislative mechanisms are in place. The 1997 Oceans Act commits the government to co-ordinate an overall protected-area network, and Parks Canada is set to pass new legislation to help establish Marine Conservation Areas in each of 29 marine regions throughout Canada.</P>
<P>We are making some progress: The Department of Fisheries and Oceans has named five &#34;pilot&#34; protected areas, including the Sable Gully off the East Coast, and Race Rocks on the West Coast. Parks Canada has launched consultation processes regarding potential areas in the southern Gulf Islands and Gwaii Haanas in B.C., and western Lake Superior in Ontario.</P>
<P>Now's the time for federal and provincial governments, first nations, the fishing industry, sports fishermen, the tourism industry and other stakeholders to recognize the need for marine protected areas and work co-operatively to ensure Canada protects marine biodiversity.</P>
<P>Speaking of the challenge ahead, the great oceanographer and environmentalist Jacques Cousteau once said, &#34;What we human beings are all living now, whether we are volunteers or not, is an extraordinary, but exceptionally dangerous adventure. And we have a very small number of years left to fail or to succeed in providing a sustainable future to our species.&#34; Otherwise, our capacity to mark the Earth with ruin will not stop at the shore. 
<P><I>John Fraser is a former federal minister of fisheries and is currently</I> <I>chair of the Pacific Fisheries Resource Conservation Council. He is also an honorary director and special adviser to World Wildlife Fund Canada.</I></P>
