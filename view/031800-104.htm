<p>There is an inversive fear that pervades black America. In one
sense, it is deeply rooted and pulverizes the spirit. In another, it's
depressingly homogenized and unrelenting.
<p>When actor Danny Glover was waiting for a cab in New York City, he
feared that the cabdriver would not stop for him because he is black. The
cab driver didn't and later admitted he has an underlying fear of black
people.
<p>When there was a job opening for a top executive management position
in corporate America last month, whites feared that a minority would fill
the position, but at the same time, blacks feared that they would be
passed over for the position because of skin color. And nearly 40 years
after the Civil Rights Act, there are still many white Americans who fear
living next door to a black person; there are still Korean store owners
who follow their black customers around the store because of fear and
suspicion and there are women of every color who clutch their purse or
change directions if a black man is walking toward them.
<p>I was in a popular drugstore looking for a hair product. Surprisingly,
it was not in aisle 4 with the other hair products. It was in the front
of the store, locked up in a glass cabinet with a bolt lock. The hair
colors and perms kits for African American women were the only products
locked and marked "ethnic products" even though Los Angeles is a city
where there is a diversity of ethnicities. The items were locked because
management feared that these items would be stolen if unlocked.
<p>Why is the fear of blacks held so tenaciously in this country? For
many whites, crime wears a black face. According to the Bureau of Justice
Statistics, black males have a 29% chance of serving time in prison at
some point in their lives; white males have a 4% chance. Almost one in
three young black males between the ages of 20 and 29 is under some form
of correctional control compared with one in 15 young white males and one
in eight young Latino males.
<p>But these statistics don't tell our whole story. The numbers don't
represent who we are. The message that black America is deteriorating and
dysfunctional is transmitted every day. But what's not transmitted is the
truth about black America: Every young black male walking down the street
is not armed and extremely dangerous. Every dark-skinned man is not a
thief, a thug, a crack head or an ex-con; all of our communities are not
ghettos; every black woman pushing a stroller is not a single mom on
welfare; there are black men and women who work every day and earn an
honest living and black children who can read cohesively, write
persuasively and analyze deductively.
<p>The myth is that all Americans are welcomed and protected on these
shores and that this country tolerates diversity. Despite the end of
legal segregation, a sense of our positive identity is lacking. The
"black only" and "white only" signs are down, but our skin color still
creates negative attitudes, rigid fears, distorted beliefs and
misconceptions.
<p>When a black man stands innocently in the doorway of his apartment and
is shot 19 times and killed, then it's time to find other ways to bring
about change in America.
<p>White Americans are afraid of us because they don't know us. They
don't know our capabilities, our achievements, our versatility. They
don't know about our integrity, our self-determination, our
entrepreneurships and quest for higher education. They don't know we have
assets, inventions, investments and we do more than hip-hop, dunk, rap
and commit crimes.
<p>We must seek to dispel the negative stereotypes that create this fear
and denigrate our image. Until we do this, racial harmony might not be
achieved. We can push for new laws, but laws change policies, not
attitudes. Affirmative action has generated a diversity of skin colors in
the workplace and on college campuses, but there are still many people
who do not feel comfortable around those who are different from them. If
we push for new laws while there are still misconceptions about who we
are, then this inverted fear will continue to dangle precariously.
<p>Fear of blacks should be un-Amercian. Black Americans know that there
is nothing dangerous about being black, but those who fear us must
discover it too.
