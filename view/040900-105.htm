Corporate giants like Monsanto--which just announced that it has

completed a draft of the genetic code of the rice plant--are quick to

claim that genetically engineered food will contribute to ending world

hunger. Why, then, is there so much industry resistance to labeling their

products as genetically modified? All Californians, whether optimist or

paranoid, have a right to know whether their food has been genetically

engineered.

<p>McDonald's, Burger King and Kentucky Fried Chicken already are

eliminating genetically engineered soy and corn ingredients from their

menus in Britain, while Americans keep ordering these foods without a

clue to their genetic content.

<p>The California Department of Food and Agriculture reviews and comments

on hundreds of corporate applications for genetically modified organisms

(foods), or GMOs, without even having a single full-time expert working

on the issue.

<p>A new report by the National Academy of Sciences claims that

genetically modified food is safe, while in the same breath urging

research on the effects on human allergies and whether GMO corn poisons

monarch butterflies. This is not a reassuring spin, especially since the

leader of the study left midway to go work for the Biotechnology Industry

Organization, and four researchers received funding from Monsanto, which

has a direct economic interest in crops becoming "Roundup ready," i.e.,

tailored for its herbicide.

<p>No one can dispute that genetically engineered food differs from its

conventional counterparts. So why not label them to provide consumers

with information and choice? They are detectable. Virtually every

gene-engineered product carries a signature that gives away its ersatz

nature. A simple $5 test can pick out genetically engineered, soy-based

products from their natural peers.

<p>We don't let manufacturers of other products dupe consumers. An

unlabeled, knockoff copy of a CD is a fraud. Even atomically identical,

man-made and natural diamonds are allowed to be labeled so the consumer

can make the choice between the engineered version and the real McCoy.

People value the "'real thing."

<p>The FDA's bottom-line argument for not labeling is that engineered and

conventional foods are "equivalent." In fact, no one knows if any food

remains identical after it is genetically tampered with. No scientific

group, much less the FDA, has thoroughly examined the actual nutritional

makeup of any genetically engineered foodstuff. What data we do have is

hardly reassuring: The new GMO corn has a toxoid in every kernel. We can

only hope it has no deleterious health effects on human consumers. As a

result of our Freedom of Information Act requests, we know the FDA, our

gatekeeper for food safety, keeps no studies in its files on this corn.

There also is evidence of allergic reactions from novel proteins. When

the sleep-inducing L-tryptophan was genetically boosted a few years ago,

several deaths resulted among unaware consumers.

<p>The fact that no one has noticed that their catsup or spaghetti sauce

has been adulterated with genetically engineered tomatoes some years back

does not give a federal agency the green light to continue this

deception. The FDA already endorses the labeling of irradiated food,

organic produce and processed foods. It allows a kosher symbol on

properly prepared items. None of these foods differs nutritionally in

consistent ways from their conventional counterparts. Nor does the label

say they do.

<p>Would a label lead to the destruction of the biotechnology industry?

We don't see why. The biotech industry need not worry about consumer

preference if its products are actually as good as they say they are.

Consumers are savvy, smart and ultimately fair. They have won the

hard-earned right to choose what they want to eat. Many now choose

organic or low-fat foods. Others don't want genetically engineered food.

A simple label, now universally recognized in the European Union, that

says "contains GMO" should not scare anyone. Mexico's Senate recently has

supported an analogous label. Should not shoppers in California and

Mexico have the right to fill their baskets with products they can trust

are accurately labeled?

<p>Tell the mom or dad looking for baby food that a label is unneeded.

Even Gerber has agreed GMOs have no place in its baby foods. Before other

manufacturers are forced to eliminate all genetically engineered

products, why not give them the option to label?
