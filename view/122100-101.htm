As usual, the competition for P.U.-litzers has been fierce.

<p>For the ninth year in a row, I have worked with Jeff Cohen of the 
media watch group FAIR to sift through the many entries for the annual 
award that pays tribute to this nation's stinkiest media performances.

<p>And now, the P.U.-litzer Prizes for 2000:

<p>*  SWALLOW THE MONEY PRIZE -- Barbara Walters and ABC

<p>The panel on "The View" program broke into a chorus of the "M'm 
M'm good" jingle when Walters asked, "Didn't we grow up eating Campbell's 
soup?" It was all according to plan. In November, blurring the line between 
programming and advertising, parts of eight episodes of ABC's daytime chat 
show became paid infomercials for Campbell's. As the Wall Street Journal 
reported, Walters and her panel agreed to "try to weave a soup message into 
their regular on-air banter." An ABC News executive defended the 
hucksterism of Walters, a news personality, by saying that "The View" is an 
entertainment show and that "people wear many hats."

<p>*  COOL YOUR JETS AWARD -- New York Times, Wall Street Journal and 
Washington Post

<p>It was a quiet media deal: The three most influential newspapers 
in the country would get the first crack at reporting on plans to merge 
United Airlines and US Airways -- on condition that the papers agreed not 
to call any other sources for comment. The deal unraveled only because the 
website of a British newspaper, the Financial Times, broke the story first, 
negating the agreement. Washington Post financial editor Jill Dutt defended 
the agreement to allow the subjects of a news story to dictate who the 
papers could talk to. "It does a better job for readers to have the story 
on the first day than not to have the story," she said.

<p>*  NO NEED TO DEBATE PRIZE -- ABC's "Nightline"

<p>On the eve of the May vote in Congress granting China permanent 
normal trade relations (PNTR), "Nightline" presented a panel composed of a 
former House speaker, a former senator and a former ambassador to China -- 
all strong supporters of PNTR. In response to complaints that the panel was 
one-sided, a senior producer wrote that "we never intended to have a 
debate" because "by the time that we went on the air, the vote was really 
not in doubt." The last time the program had debated China's trade status 
was 1991. In the intervening years, "Nightline" found time for a total of 
40 episodes on O.J. Simpson, Elian Gonzalez, and the conflict involving 
skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan.

<p>*  SEPARATE BUT EQUAL PRIZE -- ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox

<p>Decades ago, Martin Luther King Jr. commented that the most 
segregated hour in America came on Sunday morning, in the nation's 
churches. This year, on the Sunday morning chat shows, a similar tradition 
seemed firmly entrenched. On NBC's "Meet the Press," ABC's "This Week," 
CBS's "Face the Nation" and "Fox News Sunday," the guest list was 
approximately 97 percent white, according to an NAACP survey released in July.

<p>*  BREEZING THROUGH HISTORY AWARD -- Liane Hansen of NPR

<p>On NPR's "Weekend Edition," in mid-December, host Hansen was 
effusive about "Gone With the Wind," the 1939 movie that exudes nostalgic 
warmth for Southern slave owners. She told listeners: "The film remains 
immensely popular to this day, and I think it's safe to say it's become 
part of the basic DNA of this country, if not the world."

<p>*  GOING FOR THE GOLD -- NBC NEWS

<p>News executives indignantly deny that the economic interests of 
corporate owners influence their coverage. But in 2000 (as in previous 
years) journalists at the TV network airing the Olympics found the games to 
be much more newsworthy. NBC -- which had broadcasting rights to the summer 
Olympics -- aired 83 minutes of "news" about the Olympics on its weekday 
nightly newscasts. The contrast was sharp at rival networks: only 16 
minutes on ABC and five minutes on CBS.

<p>*  TRIMMING CHAD AWARD -- The Washington Post

<p>In his popular syndicated column on pro football, Norman Chad (his 
real name) aimed an autumn barb at a favorite target, the owner of 
Washington's NFL team, which plays at the stadium renamed FedEx Field. 
"Redskins high-handed honcho Daniel M. Snyder quietly taking bids for 
naming rights to his children," Chad wrote. But when the column appeared in 
the Washington Post, "children" had been changed to "helicopter," and the 
quip was shortened to simply read: "Daniel M. Snyder quietly taking bids 
for naming rights to his helicopter." The Post's top sports editor defended 
the rewrite, asserting "We edit everybody." Chad says the editor has a 
habit of softening references to the Washington team and its owner: "He 
doesn't do it for any other team."

<p>*  BRING BACK MONICA PRIZE -- Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly

<p>Four days after the presidential election, O'Reilly was quoted in 
the Washington Post about his frustrations in covering the election 
aftermath: "You're trapped in a box full of numbers. With Monica Lewinsky, 
you could say, 'She's a tramp,' 'She's not a tramp.' You could do 
psychoanalysis. This is a one-dimensional story. You have to keep looking 
for new angles."

<p>*  SYNCHRONIZE OUR WATCHES AWARD -- The Associated Press

<p>In reporting on a Republican lawsuit against the TV networks for 
projecting Al Gore the winner in Florida before the polls had closed in the 
state's western panhandle, AP quoted area resident Michael Watson, a Bush 
supporter, as saying the early TV projection "robbed me of my right to 
vote." AP reported: "'I figured it wouldn't do me no good to go vote,' 
Watson said, so he decided not to make the trip of about 20 minutes to his 
polling place." But the story had a rather significant flaw: No TV network 
projected Gore the winner in Florida until 11 minutes before panhandle 
polls closed.

<p>*  COUNT IDEOLOGY NOT VOTES AWARD -- The Wall Street Journal

<p>A few days after five members of the U.S. Supreme Court settled 
the presidential election to their own satisfaction, the Wall Street 
Journal's lead editorial proclaimed: "Someday this may be looked back on as 
the Lucky Election. A complacent electorate took itself to the brink of a 
Constitutional showdown; the High Court barely stepped in to save the day 
before yet another flaky Florida vote evaporated the Presidency.... Mr. 
Bush won with more popular votes than Bill Clinton ever did. That's a 
pretty good position from which to lead." Unmentioned detail: At the time 
the editorial was printed, official totals showed that Al Gore's nationwide 
lead -- sizeable since election night -- had grown to 540,435 votes.

<p>*  MICKEY MOUSE JOURNALISM PRIZE -- ABC News

<p>Reporting that journalists at Disney-owned ABC News had decided to 
avoid stories on a cruise ship line (partly because Disney owned a rival 
line) and on the hit movie "Chicken Run" (produced by a rival movie 
studio), the New Yorker magazine quoted an ABC News producer who said that 
steering clear of Disney "comes up all the time." Explained a producer: "No 
one here wants to piss off the bosses."

<p>*  BUSINESS AS USUAL AWARD -- Idaho Statesman

<p>After the Statesman newspaper allowed a draft of an article about 
Micron Technology to be reviewed by Micron, which is Boise's largest 
employer, the business editor of the Gannett-owned daily resigned. The 
previous business editor recalled being fired over a sentence in the paper 
deemed too critical of Micron, which is covered at the Statesman by a 
reporter married to an employee of a Micron subsidiary. Interviewed in 
January by media critic Howard Kurtz, the Statesman's current editor 
explained: "It's not that it has anything to do with their being the 
biggest employer. What we write can affect a lot of people in this 
community. It can affect the stock price."

<p>*  BUZZED JOURNALISM PRIZE -- The New York Times and Starbucks

<p>In October, the New York Times and Starbucks consummated their 
"strategic relationship." The mega-chain of about 3,000 Starbucks coffee 
shops sells the Times -- while refusing to offer any other national 
newspaper on the premises. In return for its exclusionary privilege, the 
Times provides a national advertising campaign hawking Starbucks stores and 
products.

<p>*  HYSTERIA IN COLUMN-WRITING AWARD -- Thomas Friedman of the New 
York Times

<p>On Nov. 10, in an essay about options for the next president, 
Friedman closed with a couple of sentences that illuminated his nuanced 
approach to important economic and social issues: "My only hope is that no 
matter who wins, he will name Ralph Nader the first U.S. ambassador to 
North Korea. That way Ralph can spend his days with another egomaniacal 
narcissist, Dear Leader Kim Jong Il, and get a real taste of what a country 
that actually follows Mr. Nader's insane economic philosophy -- high 
protectionism, economic autarky, anti-markets, anti-globalization, 
anti-multinationals -- is like for the people who live there."
