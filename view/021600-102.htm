<p>Derailing a multibillion-dollar federal plan to 
restore the Florida Everglades is just the kind of cause that suits Citizens 
for a Sound Economy, a conservative think tank that fights for smaller 
government.	 
</P>
<P>  But soon after the group took on the Everglades project in 1998, the 
Washington-based nonprofit got an incentive that went beyond the purely 
philosophical. It received $700,000 in contributions from Florida's three 
biggest sugar enterprises, which stand to lose thousands of acres of 
cane-growing land to reclamation if the Army Corps of Engineers plan goes 
into effect.	 
</P>
<P>  The sugar contributions were never disclosed publicly but were outlined 
in internal CSE documents that detail how various corporate interests 
donated millions to the group to bankroll its efforts on issues of direct 
interest to them, from global warming to Florida tort reform.	 
</P>
<P>  Along with those earmarked contributions, from companies such as Exxon 
Corp. and Hertz Corp., the organization received more than 
$1 million from Philip Morris Cos. at a time when CSE was opposing cigarette 
taxes. Phone company US West Inc. gave $1 million as CSE pushed deregulation 
that would let US West offer long-distance service.	 
</P>
<P>  The documents, obtained by the Washington Post, provide a rare look at 
think tanks' often hidden role as a weapon in the modern corporate political 
arsenal. The groups provide analyses, TV advertising, polling and academic 
studies that add an air of authority to corporate arguments -- in many cases 
while maintaining the corporate donors' anonymity.	 
</P>
<P>  ``Corporations have discovered that funding of research, publications, 
media campaigns and other forms of advocacy on policy issues can serve as an 
adjunct to traditional corporate lobbying and political contributions,'' 
said James Allen Smith, author of a book about think tanks.	 
</P>
<P>  Others use harsher terms. ``It's part of a rent-a-mouthpiece 
phenomenon,'' said Gary Ruskin of the Congressional Accountability Project. 
``There are mercenary groups that function as surrogates when industry feels 
it's not advantageous for it to speak directly.''	 
</P>
<P>  CSE officials will not discuss specific donations, saying that disclosure 
could expose contributors to harassment by labor unions or other groups. CSE 
President Paul Beckner strongly denies picking issues with an eye to their 
potential for luring corporate funds -- or tailoring the groups' views to 
mesh with those of contributors.	 
</P>
<P>  ``We aren't a group for hire,'' he said. ``There's a bright line that 
defines our independence. There is only one position we can take on most 
issues: the one that means less government and lower taxes. We choose the 
issues we work on, and we decide how that money is expended.''	 
</P>
<P>  While corporations are prohibited from contributing directly to political 
candidates, there are no restrictions on their giving to nonprofit 
organizations such as CSE whose advocacy may help their interests. And 
though lobbyists representing corporations must register publicly, nonprofit 
groups are not required to identify the corporations financing their 
lobbying work.	 
</P>
<P>  In recent weeks, CSE has thrown itself into the political campaigns in 
Iowa and New Hampshire, sending out grassroots activists -- clad in 
signature red jackets emblazoned with the organization's Web address on the 
back -- to obtain candidate endorsements of its position against Internet 
taxation.	 
</P>
<P>  Such outright activism is not for every think tank. Some, such as the 
Heritage Foundation, will not accept money for specific projects for fear of 
appearing beholden to the interest that funded it. Others, such as the Cato 
Institute, take earmarked money but go beyond the legal requirements and 
identify major donors.	 
</P>
<P>  For example, the largest supporter of Cato's study of Social Security 
privatization is the U.S. insurance company AIG, which manages privatized 
retirement systems abroad and stands to benefit if -- as Cato is 
recommending -- such an option is put in place here.	 
</P>
<P>  But other groups, including CSE, use donations for specific projects 
without making public the names of their donors -- raising questions even 
among some of their fellow think tanks. ``A nonprofit which is doing work 
for a very clear interest ought to reveal that,'' said Urban Institute 
President William Gorham.	 
</P>
<P>  On the other end of the political spectrum, some left-leaning think tanks 
take money from similarly interested parties. For example, unions provided 
the seed money to start the Economic Policy Institute, which produces 
research on trade, wage and work-related issues.	 
</P>
<P>  CSE, founded in 1984, has become a particularly vocal and political group 
under the chairmanship of C. Boyden Gray, a Washington lawyer who served as 
President George Bush's White House counsel. Modeling itself on grassroots 
groups such as the Christian Coalition and Ralph Nader's activist 
organizations, CSE has inserted itself into a number of fights with the 
Clinton administration and become an active force in state politics on 
issues from tort reform to labor.	 
</P>
<P>  The group has a foundation that can take tax-deductible contributions -- 
used, for example, to finance its ``education'' effort in support of a 
California initiative requiring unions to get annual permission from members 
to use dues for political purposes. It has a nonprofit arm that can engage 
in even more extensive lobbying. This year, CSE is branching into explicitly 
electoral politics; its board recently voted to set up a political action 
committee with a goal of raising at least $1 million for favored candidates 
in 2000.	 
</P>
<P>  Critics -- and even some business lobbyists -- have previously said that 
CSE's ``grassroots'' activism has sometimes been, as National Journal wrote 
in 1996, ``a fig leaf for corporate lobbying efforts.'' But the newly 
obtained internal CSE spreadsheet -- whose information was verified 
independently with a number of corporations -- offers the most precise 
illustration yet of the close fit between CSE funding and corporate 
interests.	 
</P>
<P>  It shows that Exxon Corp.'s $175,000 for ``global climate'' issues 
arrived after Beckner dismissed the notion of global warming as ``junk 
science.'' Huizenga Holdings' gift of $75,000 went toward the battle for 
Florida tort reform legislation, which limited car rental companies' 
liability. The holding company manages the investments of Florida 
businessman Wayne Huizenga in, among other things, auto rental companies.
