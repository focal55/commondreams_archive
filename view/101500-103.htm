SEGREGATION is still alive and well. No, it's not that certain individuals 
are not allowed to live in certain neighborhoods or that children are not 
bused to better schools in the hills. For the few of us -- professionals of 
color who have managed to break free from low-paid menial labor jobs and 
have graduated to positions in San Francisco's Financial District -- life is 
full of conflict and contradiction.
<P>Every day, on my trek from BART to work, I'm reminded of the painful 
reality that 40 years since the civil rights movement, a legacy of 
discrimination and lack of opportunity still has not been erased. I walk to 
my office in an ocean of people in suits carrying briefcases and cell phones -- but a brown-skinned face is hard to find. Some mornings I count five, six -- maybe 10 -- on good days.	 
</P>
<P>  But by lunchtime, the landscape becomes more colorful, as Latinos spread 
mayo on sandwiches and mix salads in bowls and African Americans serve hot 
soup and ring up sales at cash registers.	 
</P>
<P>  Shortly after 5 p.m., during the exodus back to BART, I'm confronted with 
the occasional person walking against the wave. Usually it's a person of 
color very likely on his or her way to the after-hours job of emptying trash 
cans or cleaning offices. And I'm reminded again that somehow I don't 
belong.	 
</P>
<P>  The old feelings -- my feelings as a 12-year-old girl helping my mother 
in one of the many office buildings she cleaned after her day job -- come to 
mind. The apologetic knock on the door, in an office where someone decided 
to work late, and then the staring at the ground as I walk in and pick up 
the trash to dump it in a bin outside the door.	 
</P>
<P>  Last week, on BART during the afternoon commute, five boys no older than 
8, loaded with a box of candy bars under each arm, jumped in my car. One of 
the boys, the oldest, directed the others as they quickly dispersed 
themselves until there was one boy per car. For a moment, I was transported 
to a bus or train in Central America, where children selling gum, chips or 
the latest remedy for anything from stomachaches to acne is an everyday 
occurrence. I realized then that I didn't have to go to a Third World 
country to find those who are marginalized creating innovative ways to make 
a buck.	 
</P>
<P>  In Latin America, most of these children are orphaned and homeless. Some 
work alongside their parents, doing an array of service jobs: Getting your 
shoes shined on any street corner, paying 25 
cents to watch a child spit fire, or having your windshield washed at a stop 
light are all part of this ``informal economy.''	 
</P>
<P>  The young boys on BART, clean-cut and dressed in fashionable baggy jeans 
and striped shirts, were not selling candy bars to help out a school or a 
club fund-
raising campaign. No, they were selling each 80-cent Snickers bar for $2 to 
supplement their family's income or for their own spending money. Most BART 
riders tried hard not to make eye contact as they uncomfortably turned the 
pages of their newspaper, magazine or novel. The ones who looked up as a boy 
approached them shook their heads and returned to their reading. I, too, 
struggled to avoid their glance.	 
</P>
<P>  I guess looking into the eyes of poverty and disparity is just a little 
too hard for any of us deal with; it's much easier to read about poverty 
when it's thousands of miles away.	 
</P>
<P>These young entrepreneurs knew just how to pick their train -- the Concord 
/Pittsburg line filled with mostly white middle- and upper-middle-class 
professionals. The other lines, which are crowded with people of color, 
probably included many of the lunch-rush service workers.	 
</P>
<P>  Opportunities for people of color continue to be limited to mixing salad 
in a bowl or emptying trash cans. And the United States is more like a 
vegetable tray where the carrots, broccoli, cauliflower and cucumber are 
neatly separated and not the mixed-salad bowl we all imagined and take 
credit for.
