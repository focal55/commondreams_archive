<p>LOS ANGELES -- "This is my tranquillity," said 
Jose Valles. "Sitting here waiting for 
the bus. Because most of the time I 
am stressed. Why? I will tell you. 
Because I don't have enough money."

<p> Mr. Valles earns his living serving 
hamburgers at a McDonald's restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. He's 
a family man. He and his wife, Lily, 
have two children, a boy, 9, and a girl, 
6. He talked about his family's circumstances while waiting in the hot 
sun last Thursday afternoon for the 
No. 60 bus at the corner of Seventh 
and Alameda Streets.

<p> "It's hard. It's rough," he said. 
"You don't have the nice kiss on the 
cheek or the 'Hello, honey, how are 
you?' when you come home from 
work. It's 'What the hell are we 
gonna do?'

<p> "I make $5.75 an hour. That's 
about $240 a week. One hundred ninety dollars after taxes. You can't really live on that. Lily works in a fast-food place, too. She makes the same 
as me. Two weeks of my pay and two 
weeks of her pay every month goes 
for rent. Then you have to pay the 
fare to go back and forth to work. 
You gotta pay for your food. You 
have bills. We're still paying on the 
sofa.

<p> "You see, it's stressing me out just 
thinking about it."

<p> I asked Mr. Valles what he and his 
family did for recreation.

<p> "We take the kids to the park."

<p> I asked if they ever went on vacation. He looked at me as if I'd asked if 
his children could fly. "No," said Mr. 
Valles quietly. "There is no money 
for vacation."

<p> The Valleses are among the millions of working families Vice President Al Gore is trying to connect with 
as he travels the country promising 
to fight for "those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up so 
they are never  left behind."

<p> The Republicans have denounced 
this effort to reach out to working 
families -- to build, as Mr. Gore says, 
a "better, fairer, more prosperous 
America" -- as divisive. It's dangerous, we're told. Un-American.

<p> Mr. Gore is "a candidate who 
wants to wage class warfare to get 
ahead," said George W. Bush.

<p> Welcome to the intersection of 
greed and paranoia. We may be enjoying good times, but the wealthy 
are not yet wealthy enough -- at 
least in the view of the G.O.P. -- to 
accede to a little bit of help for the 
likes of Jose Valles and his family.

<p> With Mr. Bush already gift-wrapping most of the nation's projected 
surplus, which he intends to hand 
over to the very wealthiest among 
us, it's fair to ask who's waging war 
on whom.

<p> In our conversation last week, Mr. 
Valles mentioned politics just once. 
"The politicians keep saying they 
are going to raise the minimum 
wage, but nothing happens," he said. 
"A minimum wage increase would 
help everybody, not just me."

<p> Class warfare? Let's see. The 
Democrats have been trying without 
success to raise the minimum wage 
 -- now $5.15 an hour -- by a mere $1 
over the next two years. That's a 
whopping 50 cents an hour the first 
year, and another 50 cents the year 
after. My goodness, is that an attack 
on the rich? Is that what they mean 
by class warfare?

<p> The Republicans in Congress have 
stood in the way of this most modest 
of pay hikes for the nation's low-wage workers. Mr. Gore favors the 
increase and says he'll fight for it. If 
that's class warfare, we need more 
of it.

<p> Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick 
Cheney, is getting a retirement package worth an estimated $20 million 
from the Halliburton Company, an 
energy services outfit that has a big 
financial stake in the policies of the 
federal government. No problem, 
said Mr. Bush.

<p> But a tiny boost in the minuscule 
minimum wage would seem to be a 
different story.

<p> (The radical Texas Republican 
Party, at its convention in Houston in 
June,  declared that  all minimum 
wage laws should be repealed.)

<p> I asked Jose Valles how his life 
would change if he earned a few 
more dollars a week. He said: "I 
would do something nice for Lily. I 
would buy some clothes for the children and try to take them to a movie 
every now and then. My dream is to 
someday be able to invest in a 
house."

<p> He added: "I'll tell you the truth. I 
would like for my kids to go to college, which I was never able to do. 
I'm like all parents. I would  like the 
best for my children. I would like my 
children to soar."
