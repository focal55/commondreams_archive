PHILADELPHIA -- Sunday night, as the political love fest in this city opened with a parade of illuminated boats and a deluge of fireworks, Republican members of Congress were on one side of the Delaware River and most of the convention delegates were on the other.
<P>
     This separation is an apt metaphor for the way the legacy of Newt Gingrich is being dealt with by convention organizers.
<P>
     As every pundit in the land has pointed out, Republicans are going to great lengths to portray a warm and fuzzy side of conservatism during their national convention. Calmed-down zealots of the religious right are reveling merrily alongside the beleaguered moderates who heretofore had been treated as political lepers.
<P>
     But the group hugs are carefully excluding those who control the legislative branch, at least in television prime time when the embrace might be exposed to voters. The lone inside-the-Beltway lawmaker with a featured speaking role at this convention is Arizona Sen. John McCain, and we all know he's on the stage only because he scared the spurs off the Texas governor in the New Hampshire primary, not because he's a member of the Senate majority. 
<P>
     This decision to keep the likes of Trent Lott and Tom DeLay and Dick Armey behind the curtain does not mean the delegates don't love their representatives and senators. But they have an even more robust desire to sleep in the White House once again. Winning control of Congress in 1994 was a wonderful surprise. But legislating proved to be a messy and thankless business that made the Republican Congress even less popular than the president they so impulsively impeached.
<P>
     The White House, though -- that's where the Republicans think they belong. Through the Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Bush years (with only that sorry little interlude with Jimmy Carter spoiling the run) Republicans developed a sense of entitlement to the presidency. The big reason they've now laid aside their nasty little differences over abortion and gays and all is because they want no ideological squabble to trip up the Bush heir on his way to the restoration.
<P>
     Conservative delegates choose to see Bush as a conservative. Moderate delegates choose to see him as a moderate. And all of them see trouble if George W. gets identified with the reviled congressional Republicans.
<P>
     Thus, when it was time for Sunday's fireworks show, most of the delegates had been bused over to Camden, N.J., while the Republican National Congressional Committee held its own affair back in the city at Penn's Landing.
<P>
     There, the shunned members of Congress could feel desired and wanted. They ate corn dogs, hamburgers and plates of pastry paid for by corporate sponsors. They gathered at the bar for free drinks with corporate lobbyists. They boogied by a stage where the '70s disco group Earth, Wind and Fire performed. The band, of course, was paid from corporate accounts.
<P>
     The legislators will keep a low profile, content in knowing that the public business of the modern political convention has little to do with them, anyway. That business is to launch a successful presidential campaign with an upbeat TV show in which the delegates are not much more than a dutiful studio audience.
<P>
     As for the private business of the convention -- networking with lobbyists and corporate donors -- the senators and members of Congress can feel free to schmooze and be schmoozed without inhibition. There will be no intrusive media cameras in the hotel suites, on the golf courses or aboard the private yachts to record the romance of big-money politics.
