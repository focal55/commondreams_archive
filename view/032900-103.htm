<p>CHUCK SCHUMER was in the Judiciary Committee hearing room of the 
Rayburn House Office Building and his recollection of the place 
brought a smile.	 
</P>
<P>  This was where, as a House member who was a persistent and crafty 
advocate of gun control, Schumer had some memorable jousts with 
persistent and crafty representatives of the National Rifle 
Association.	 
</P>
<P>  ``I think it was in this very room that we actually had the NRA 
admit they wanted people to be allowed to own bazookas,'' Schumer 
said with a chuckle.	 
</P>
<P>  Schumer, now a senator, and Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., were in 
the hearing room to start another fight with the NRA.	 
</P>
<P>  The gun lobby has been saying the president is to blame for kids 
killing other kids and misfits of all description stocking up on 
weaponry and hunting people down. The means used to obtain these 
arsenals have much to do with the cavernous holes in our system for 
regulating who can get a gun, and how easily. These holes were cut 
wide by the NRA, which does everything in its power to keep and 
expand them.	 
</P>
<P>The gun lobby has a durable grip on Congress. But it is not so 
influential with the public at large. People generally do not 
comprehend why background checks should not be performed on 
purchasers of all guns and why, for example, there should be any such 
thing as unregulated gun sales at gun shows or in kitchens or out of 
the backs of pickup trucks.	 
</P>
<P>  The NRA would like to keep all this just the way it is. But it 
would also like to change public opinion. So it has been claiming of 
late that the Clinton administration is soft on guns.	 
</P>
<P>  Enforcement, it says, is way off. Official statistics actually 
show federal and state gun prosecutions are up around the country, 
and gun crime down.	 
</P>
<P>  But, if you repeat the Big Lie enough, people start believing it. 
That is where Schumer and McCarthy come in. They have introduced a 
bill to toughen federal gun enforcement and they want the NRA to join 
hands.	 
</P>
<P>  ``It answers, in my opinion, all the rhetoric we've been hearing 
from the NRA,'' McCarthy said.	 
</P>
<P>  The Schumer-McCarthy plan tries to repair the damage the NRA 
caused with a 1986 law it wrote that gutted the 1968 federal Gun 
Control Act. The plan would try to shrink the enormous network of 
unregulated private dealers, giving the Feds greater authority over 
them. It would help the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
target dirty dealers -- the 1 percent of licensed dealers to whom 
nearly half of all guns used in crimes can be traced.	 
</P>
<P>  The proposal would shut down an NRA-
backed law that lets convicted felons get back their right to own a 
gun, though the very same convicts may never again be allowed to vote 
or even work at the mall. It also would expand a program called 
Project Exile, in which some gun violators who would normally be 
charged with state crimes can be prosecuted and sentenced instead by 
the Feds.	 
</P>
<P>  The NRA gushes about how successful this program has been in 
Richmond, Va. But the group habitually leaves something out. It was 
started and is run by a U.S. attorney appointed by none other than 
Bill Clinton. This is the part of the Schumer-
McCarthy enforcement package the NRA supports. It wants zero 
tolerance for individuals convicted of gun crimes. That is, once they 
commit a crime. The NRA's overall policy is roughly akin to getting 
tough on cocaine users, ignoring the cartels.	 
</P>
<P>  Schumer and McCarthy invite the NRA to get its record on enforcing 
the gun laws as robust as its rhetoric. They know enough, though, not 
to sit idly by the phone awaiting a response.
