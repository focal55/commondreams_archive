A few hours before dawn, the nation's TV networks foisted their 
second outrageous blunder of the night on the American people. After 
"calling" the state of Florida for Al Gore earlier in the evening, the same 
networks announced that George W. Bush had won Florida -- and the White 
House. With a typical flourish, NBC anchor Tom Brokaw declared: "George 
Bush is the president-elect of the United States."

<p>But before the sun rose on the East Coast, the networks were 
correcting themselves again, acknowledging that Florida was too close to 
call. By then, the arrogance of the television networks had compounded a 
distressing specter: The Electoral College might end up giving the 
presidency to someone who came in second in the country's popular vote.

<p>Twenty-four hours after the polls closed across America, the 
reporters and commentators on the airwaves and cable channels seemed to be 
reeling from the succession of extraordinary events. Surely, millions of 
Americans were also stunned, as if the previous long night had been a vivid 
and protracted bad dream.

<p>In effect, the TV networks made a bad situation worse. They added 
to the night's quickly escalating sense of confusion, disorientation and 
uncertainty about the election results.

<p>Despite their vast resources and profuse assurances that they knew 
just what they were doing, the biggest television outlets -- ABC, CBS, NBC, 
CNN, Fox and PBS -- incorrectly proclaimed that the winner of the 
presidential race had been determined. The list of those networks is a 
dishonor roll for American media.

<p>Like most busy people, the executives and journalists who run the 
news operations of the TV networks don't have much time to spare for 
soul-searching. And it's unlikely a lot would change even if some genuine 
introspection took place. It's not a good sign that top execs are treating 
the networks' election-night madness as a public-relations problem.

<p>The rushed and faulty projections for election results were 
dramatic manifestations of the kind of intrinsically flawed coverage of 
politics that goes on all the time in national media. Major outlets cast 
huge shadows across political landscapes, from campaign trails to 
gubernatorial offices, legislative bodies and the White House. But even the 
most influential reporters and pundits are in the habit of acting like 
they're mere observers.

<p>Although journalists at key media institutions pose as flies on 
the walls of national politics, they're apt to function more like movers 
and shakers. Far from just telling us what's happening, the biggest-name 
journalists -- the ones holding forth on the networks throughout election 
night -- are always shaping the media terrain through which politicians walk.

<p>Meanwhile, journalists and the politicians they cover are 
routinely financed -- one way or the other -- by many of the same business 
interests. Numerous firms that own powerhouse media outlets or pay for 
extensive advertising also spend gobs of money on lobbyists and campaign 
contributions. And the phenomenal amount of lucre that went into the 2000 
elections is just a pittance compared to the hundreds of billions of 
dollars in corporate profits riding on future government policies set in 
Washington.

<p>So, where are we now? After a year filled with denunciations of 
the pernicious roles played by money in politics, the big money has as 
tight a grip on the electoral process as ever. Not coincidentally, whether 
Bush or Gore prevails, the man who'll move into 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. next 
January has long been cozy with economic elites of the nation.

<p>After bringing us the fiascos of election night, the TV networks 
assure us that they'll quit being so arrogant. And actually, it's easy to 
stop. They've done it hundreds of times. Periodic self-critiques and public 
shows of repentance are ingrained rituals for news organizations, which 
tout only corporate-friendly presidential candidates as serious contenders.

<p>On the surface, the willingness of the TV networks to "call" 
elections prematurely and inaccurately may seem like an unfortunate quirk. 
But it's a reflection of what constantly happens when news operations -- 
bent on outdoing competitors -- put the drive for profits above public 
service. The people calling the shots at the major networks are acutely 
aware that they must strive to boost the bottom line of the parent company.

<p>It's a metaphor for the profound ways that Campaign 2000 has left 
democracy in the dust.
