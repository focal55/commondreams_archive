<p>How many children must die before the United States will confront its shameful distinction of being No. 1 in child homicides in the industrialized world?
<P>

   The playground shooting in Michigan was shocking, but it easily could happen again in any community. Exposure to violence, lack of parental supervision and access to guns is a deadly combination.
<P>

   Guns are an efficient tool of death. There is little way that a 6-year-old could kill another child without the use of a firearm. No matter what age an individual, it is far easier to kill using a gun than by using a knife, baseball bat or fists.<P>

   A study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that the homicide rate in Seattle during the 1980s was higher than the rate in Vancouver because Seattle had more firearm-related murders -- assaults and stabbings were the same in both cities. In Canada there are stricter gun laws, meaning less access to firearms.<P>

   The rate of firearm-related homicide of children in the United States is 16 times the rate of 25 industrialized nations combined. Maybe the National Rifle Association should put that number on its bumper stickers.<P>

   ``Smart'' gun technology and trigger locks will help solve the problem of accidental gun access by children. But, that is only the start. It is unfathomable that the gun lobby argues against licensing and registration of deadly weapons. For all the discussion about guns providing protection, there is solid epidemiological evidence that the person most likely to die of a gunshot is someone who lives in a home where there is a gun. How many lives is the ``right'' to gun ownership worth? <P>

   Yes, criminals still may find ways to get guns, but if there are fewer on the street, then obtaining one will become increasingly difficult.<P>

   Of course, the fact that the child in Michigan had access to a gun is symptomatic of the underlying dysfunction in this young boy's life. Like many children in this country, the child who shot his classmate was subjected to a daily dose of violence. News reports speak of the child living in a home where there was drug activity and from which neighbors heard gunshots.<P>

   This is not a good environment for a child. The data on the effect of exposure to violence on child's behavior are clear. A study in Cleveland showed that more than 70 percent of children in grades 3-8 in the inner city had witnessed a beating; more than 50 percent of the boys had witnessed a gun pointing. The children exposed to violence tend to be more violent themselves.<P>

   Unfortunately, the child shooter in Michigan had no such luck. With a mother allegedly suffering from drug addiction, and a father in jail, there was no one looking out for this boy.<P>

   Many people knew this child was in trouble; social workers at the school, neighbors and possibly even child-welfare authorities. But little was done to rescue him from his hellish environment. Any child-protection worker will tell you about agencies being understaffed; children being removed from parents and placed in the custody of relatives who provide little supervision; and the complete lack of mental-health services for children.
<P>

   There is always a reason why money can't be invested in drug treatment, family-support services and child-protection programs. There is always a reason why gun laws can't be changed. Tomorrow there will be another story, and as the weeks go by, the shooting in Michigan will be forgotten by all except the grieving families -- until the next shooting. We must break this cycle.<br>
