Cop killer.
 
<p>No, we are not talking about Mumia Abu-Jamal. After a trial that the
National Journal's Stuart Taylor called "grotesquely unfair" and that
included "fabricated evidence," Abu-Jamal was convicted of killing a
Philadelphia police officer. He now sits on death row.
 
<p>We are talking about alleged cop killer Stuart Charles Alexander. If
convicted, will Alexander end up on death row? Not likely.
 
<p>That's because Abu-Jamal is black, while Alexander is white. Abu-Jamal is
a journalist, Alexander is a businessman.
 
<p>Last week, Alexander, who owns a sausage factory in San Leandro,
California, allegedly shot and killed two federal meat inspectors and one
state meat inspector who were visiting his factory.
 
<p>According to news reports, after killing the three inspectors, Alexander
chased a fourth inspector for a couple of blocks down the street, took one
shot and missed. He then returned to his sausage factory, walked inside,
fired some more shots, went outside and surrendered to police without
resistance.
 
<p>A videotape from a security camera inside Alexander's Santos Linguisa
sausage factory "clearly depicts" Alexander killing the three meat
inspectors, San Leandro police told reporters last week.
 
<p>Alexander and one of the inspectors each placed a call for help to local
police minutes before the shootings. State officials charged Alexander
with three counts of murder.
 
<p>Federal officials charged Alexander with two counts of murder -- two of
the federal inspectors worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
 
<p>According to news accounts, meat inspectors closed the facility in January
for not properly heating sausage that was labeled as fully cooked and for
not using expiration dates on meat. The inspectors shut down the facility
in January after Alexander refused to comply with the law.
 
<p>The plant was reopened earlier this month.
 
<p>A sign outside Alexander's sausage factory read: "To all of our great
customers, the USDA is coming into our plant harassing my employees and
me, making it impossible to make our great product. Gee, if all meat
plants could be in business for 79 years without one complaint, the meat
inspectors would not have jobs. Therefore we are taking legal action
against them."
 
<p>Nowhere in any of the more than 60 articles that have appeared about
Alexander's killings have the words "cop killer" appeared. Yet, when
referring to Abu-Jamal, news reporters feel obliged to refer to him as
"cop killer" as if it were his newly adopted name, as when the
Philadelphia Inquirer earlier this year headlined an article: "Antioch
College Invites Cop-Killer as Commencement Speaker."
 
<p>Every day in this country, meat inspectors and other law enforcement
officials are cracking down on corporate crime and violence. And every
day, they meet resistance, harassment and threats from corporate
executives indoctrinated in a radical, reckless, and lawless political
ideology.
 
<p>"There is a great deal of friction and turmoil on the front lines of
federal meat inspectors," said Bobby Harnage, president of the American
Federation of Government Employees. "The deaths of the three meat
inspectors was senseless -- they were killed trying to protect consumers."
 
<p>Recent surveys indicate that corporate crime and violence is on the
uptick. According to a survey released earlier this year by KPMG's
Integrity Management Services unit, employees are observing a high level
of serious illegal and unethical conduct on the job, workers perceive
management as unable or unwilling to deal with unethical conduct, and
employees are discouraged from reporting unethical conduct.
 
<p>And earlier this month, a survey by the National White Collar Crime Center
found that one in three American households are now the victim of white
collar crime and that there is growing public concern with the seriousness
of white collar crime and the criminal justice system's ability to control
it.
 
<p>Neither of these surveys was reported in the mainstream corporate media.
Nor did the mainstream corporate media report on a survey conducted by
former Washington Post reporter Morton Mintz and published this month in
Nieman Reports.
 
<p>Mintz's survey found that corporate newspaper editorial writers rarely
condemn corporate crime and other wrongdoing. He surveyed 124 leading
editorial writers, columnists, and commentators about what they had said
about egregious corporate behavior during the ten years ending December
1998.
 
<p>Mintz concluded from the responses he received, and from the large number
of writers who failed to respond to his inquiry, that "it's fair to say
that it's a rare day in 3,650 days when the national media expose
Americans to opinions on corporate wrongdoing."
 
<p>Political, corporate, and media elites have little time for and little
respect for the victims of corporate crime and violence. They will rant
and rave about Abu-Jamal, but hardly give the time of day to Alexander and
his rampage.
 
<p>It's time that we begin to give a little respect to those who put their
lives on the line to protect us against the ravages of the corporate
criminals. Call your local newspaper editorial offices and urge them to
take a strong stance against corporate crime. Support your local corporate
crime police. Condemn corporate brutality.
