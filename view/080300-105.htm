Over the past few months, no one has aroused progressive political interest 
        more than Ralph Nader, who suddenly has invigorated the most tedious and 
        numbing presidential race imaginable. Suddenly, too, many of the crucial 
        issues progressives care about - issues where Al Gore and George W. Bush 
        either agree or differ only on nuance - have a candidate advancing them. 
        And in Ralph Nader these positions are advocated by one of the most respected Americans of the past 50 years, a person whose integrity, competence, 
        knowledge of the issues and commitment to social justice are unimpeachable. 
      
<P>But many progressives are lukewarm about Nader's candidacy, and some 
        are downright hostile. There are a variety of reasons for this, but the 
        most important one, by far, is the notion that Nader will steal votes 
        from Gore, the lesser of the two mainstream evils. Hence, the more successful 
        Nader is, the more likely it is that Bush will win, with the distinct 
        possibility that the Republicans will control the White House and both 
        branches of Congress for the first time since 1954. Although Bush and 
        Gore eat from the same corporate trough on most issues, a Republican trifecta 
        would be a nightmare for progressives. It could roll back affirmative 
        action, lead to an even more direct assault on labor, unleash corporate 
        greed and appoint judges with an open hostility to women's rights, choice 
        and civil liberties. In short, the argument goes, George W. Bush combined 
        with a Republican Congress would make the past eight years look like the 
        opening weeks of the Paris Commune. 
      
<P>This is a serious argument, even if it tends to be overblown. And Bush 
        is a singularly dreadful politician; he is corrupt, arrogant, cowardly 
        and stupid. His administration will be all about explicitly serving the 
        needs of corporate America to the exclusion of everyone else. But for 
        progressives to vote for Al Gore would be a huge mistake nonetheless. 
      
<P>I am 
        not opposed to the "lesser of two evils" argument per se. Were Nader not 
        in the race, or were he running a faux campaign as in 1996, it would be 
        more compelling. But Nader's Green Party effort is not a fringe or short-term 
        campaign. It is the best chance we have to break out of the cul-de-sac 
        of "lesser of two evil politics" at least since Jesse Jackson and the 
        Rainbow Coalition in 1988, and possibly for generations. 
      
<P>Moreover, if we are going to go the "lesser of two evils" route, it would 
        sure help if the lesser part of the equation wasn't as lame as Gore. Former 
        Labor Secretary Robert Reich speaks the truth when he praises Gore as 
        being superior to George W. Bush as a president for Wall Street and corporate 
        America. As Reich recently gloated in the Financial Times, Gore is the 
        "ideal candidate for American business, with a record to show it." In 
        a nation where the core problems stem from excessive corporate power, 
        a lack of democracy, and massive social inequality, Gore has been the 
        standard-bearer of those who benefit from the status quo. 
      
<P>We need to recognize that the political times are changing. The sort 
        of liberal-conservative mainstream analysis that still dominates journalism, 
        punditry and academic writing is increasingly irrelevant to U.S. politics. 
        The support for the traditional parties is weak; it is largely the electoral 
        laws and donations from the wealthy that keep them in business, which 
        they well understand. Specifically, the support for candidates Gore and Bush is 
        paper thin. It is nearly impossible to engage in a heated argument with 
        one of their supporters, because they do not generate that sort of support. 
      
<P>In short, there may be new openings for progressive candidates and arguments. 
        Support for a candidate like Nader, for example, will come not only from 
        traditional Democrats and independents, but also from people who might 
        not vote otherwise. Some rank-and-file Republicans, believe it or not, 
        also respond well to Nader's call for fair markets, clean elections and 
        government, and against commercial values increasingly ruling all aspects 
        of our lives. 
      
<P>Assume for a moment that Nader withdrew from the race so as not to hand 
        the election to Bush. Say Gore were to win: Then in four or eight years 
        we will be faced with his lame VP as the candidate and another "lesser 
        of two evils" debate. If Gore loses, on the other hand, the conventional 
        wisdom will be that he couldn't appeal to the "center," that he wasn't 
        Republican enough. Then in four years, after all the big money weighs 
        in, we'll end up with another candidate like Gore and another "lesser 
        of two evils" plot line. As the percentage of citizens who vote continues 
        to drop, those who do vote increasingly come from the contented classes. 
        So pitching a campaign to the interests of the bulk of the population 
        is ever more counterproductive, especially to the wealthy who bankroll 
        the electoral campaigns. 
      
<P>The idiocy of this situation should be apparent. Like Clinton, Gore can 
        only win elections with the support of organized labor, minorities, feminists, 
        environmentalists and those poor and working-class people who do vote. 
        So when Democratic presidential candidates fall behind in their races, they 
        invariably pile on slops from the rhetorical larder attacking corporations 
        and the rich. The desperate Gore is already in full throttle. Yet when 
        there is an important conflict between big money and these core constituencies, 
        Gore and Clinton put their support on the corporate side of the ledger. 
        The recent vote on trade with China is a classic example, though there 
        have been scores of similar episodes over the past eight years. Gore and 
        Clinton know their progressive constituencies will never turn to the Republicans, 
        so in the end, they will get their support. 
      
<P>Reich makes this clear in his Financial Times piece: Business can disregard 
        any Democratic populist campaign rhetoric, he notes, because "once in 
        office, Democratic presidents tend to shift to the right without risk 
        of losing their Democratic base because it has no one else to turn to." 
        So pathetic is the left today, that the Gore crowd is blatant in its contempt 
        for their concerns. Yet the "lesser of two evils" crowd says we have no 
        choice but to back Gore. If we are willing to back Gore in this context, 
        it is clear that we will back any Democrat in any context. So there is 
        no reason to think those who bankroll and run the party should have any 
        reason to fear or respect us. And they don't. 
      
<P>Some 
        of those progressives who respect Nader but criticize him for taking votes 
        from Gore argue that Nader should have run as a Democrat. Then he could 
        make his case in the primaries and not worry about helping the Republicans 
        win the general election. It is clearly too late for that route in 2000, 
        so the insinuation is that we should attempt to nominate a progressive 
        Democrat in future years, after we make sure Gore defeats Bush. But it 
        is worth asking if that route really is plausible at all. Let's face it: 
        The last time a progressive outsider took the Democratic nomination was 
        28 years ago, and much has changed in the world since then. There are 
        crucial factors that seem to undermine the ability of progressives to 
        mount a successful internal Democratic grassroots challenge à la McGovern. 
      
<P>These include: the necessity for obscenely massive campaign war chests; 
        the tight noose of the corporate news media with their pathetic range 
        of legitimate debate; and the requirement of progressives to show their 
        party loyalty by agreeing to support the considerable deadweight in the 
        party. Is there any reason to think these factors will lessen in 2004, 
        2008 or beyond? A large percentage of the nominally Democratic voting 
        base may well support progressive positions on many issues - and oppose 
        the pro-corporate agenda of Clinton and Gore - but the system works to 
        see that support does not translate into a progressive Democratic Party. 
      
<P>I am agnostic on the question of whether, ultimately, the Democrats or 
        the Greens or some other party will advance progressive politics in the 
        electoral arena. I do know we need a popular front or coalition to advocate 
        basic democratic and progressive values, and that much of this coalition 
        must come from elements of the Democratic Party. But I would argue that 
        even those who think the Democratic Party is the only possible place for 
        a progressive challenge to corporate rule should support the Nader campaign. 
        If Gore loses due to a strong Nader showing, the Democrats will finally 
        have to realize they cannot take labor, feminists, environmentalists and 
        other progressives for granted. The post-mortems for Gore will not say 
        he was not Republican enough, but that he wasn't progressive enough. And 
        that can only be for the good. A strong Nader campaign this fall also 
        will certainly help the numerous progressive Democrats in tight races 
        across the nation. And in generating a broad base of support, Nader and 
        the Greens will have jump-started the hard work of asserting progressive 
        values in the Democratic Party. It might lay the foundation for a progressive 
        Democrat to succeed in the primary process in the coming years. 
      
<P>My point is simply that the only way to jolt life into this system is 
        from the outside. This is why the Nader campaign is so impressive and 
        so important. Nader and Winona LaDuke, the Green vice presidential candidate, 
        are thinking long-term, toward building a progressive electoral majority 
        in the next 10 to 20 years. The issues they campaign on are the issues 
        we are organizing around all the time - so even if they lose, the campaign 
        can still have a constructive role. Their campaign is not based on a bunch 
        of "fringe" positions that the bulk of Americans detest - despite the 
        efforts of those that oppose progressive politics to so characterize them. 
        On the contrary, Nader and LaDuke speak with authority in plain language 
        about power and fairness and justice and democracy in a manner that has 
        broad appeal. 
      
<P>In view of the imbalance in media coverage and money, the support for 
        Nader is astonishing. At the present rate, polls show him possibly getting 
        3 to 12 percent of the vote in November. If there is justice, and he gets 
        a place in the presidential debates, his support almost certainly would 
        climb dramatically - which is why Gore and his cronies are desperate to 
        keep Nader off the ballot, out of the debates, and discredited by the 
        mainstream media. If voters began to actually think that Nader could win 
        the election, all bets would be off about how well he would do. 
      
<P>I understand 
        why so many progressives I respect are apprehensive about the Nader campaign. 
        There is the distinct possibility that a successful Nader campaign will 
        lead to a Bush victory, with all that entails. There is also the chance 
        that the Nader campaign will be a total dud, but that the energy which 
        goes into it instead of the Gore campaign will contribute to a Bush victory 
        as well. And, in certain areas, a Bush administration will be markedly 
        worse than a Gore administration. 
      
<P>But I think the risk is worth taking. Gore is so bad on so many issues 
        that the difference between him and Bush may well be less than that of 
        any two mainstream candidates in memory, and that is saying a lot. The 
        payoff for supporting Gore, on balance, is low and strictly short-term. 
        It is out of place in a historical moment when millions of Americans are 
        blatantly dissatisfied with the political status quo and grasping for 
        new ideas. 
      
<P>We have to think in broader terms than the immediate election. The Nader 
        campaign is a necessary step in building a progressive political movement 
        in this nation. There is no better time than now, and no better standard-bearer 
        on the horizon than Nader. It will take time; we not only have to attract 
        current voters, but we have to get the millions and millions of disaffected 
        voters to come to the polls because they will finally see politics as 
        addressing issues that mean something to their lives and their communities. 
      
<P> There are grounds for optimism. There may be more political vibrancy 
        today - around issues like corporate-run globalization, the death penalty, 
        sweatshop labor, the environment - than at any time since the '70s. The 
        Nader campaign is part of this progressive resurgence. Indeed, if we try 
        to stoke progressive non-electoral movements on the one hand while adhering 
        to a lesser-of-two-evils support for Gore on the other hand, the resulting 
        confusion can be disastrous for any nascent left. It makes progressives 
        look like a bunch of political nincompoops. 
      
<P>All told, a strong Nader showing in 2000 can be a platform for rejuvenating 
        progressive politics in the United States for the coming generation. It 
        is a risk that must be taken. <img src="end.gif" width="7" height="7">
