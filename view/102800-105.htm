The Supreme Court has been a hot topic in the current presidential race, but
despite all the attention, citizens have seen few facts to back up hyperbole
from either of the major parties.

<p>The Gore campaign has played the fear card to extremes, using the Supreme Court
as the trump.  “We can’t let George Bush nominate Supreme Court justices” is the
refrain sung against images of back-alley abortions.

<p>The idea that Republican nominees threaten women’s reproductive choices has been
repeated uncritically so often that unsuspecting voters have begun to believe
it. But it’s an argument that wilts under scrutiny.

<p>Ask Democrats to name a progressive justice appointed by their party and you’ll
likely be met with blank stares.  It’s not surprising because on a court that
contains two Clinton nominees, most legal scholars agree that the two most
progressive justices have been David Souter and John Paul Stevens, both
nominated by Republicans and the former nominated by George W. Bush’s dad!

<p>The Gore campaign invokes the Roe v Wade decision at every opportunity, but
conveniently fails to mention that a court dominated by six Republican nominees
(including one of the two dissenting justices) decided the case--written by
Nixon appointee Harry Blackmun.  Any honest Democrat also would acknowledge that
the century’s strongest progressive force was William Brennan, another Republican nominee.

<p>So should civil liberties advocates rally for Bush?  Hardly. But while
presenting justices like Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas as legitimate
examples of what progressives fear, Gore’s boosters conveniently ignore the fact
that the voting records of Supreme Court justices often differ tremendously from
the political views of the presidents who nominate them.

<p>Choosing presidents based on their prospective Supreme Court nominees is a shaky
proposition at best, and liberals have been disappointed as well by
Democrat-appointed justices like Byron White, a Kennedy pick.
<p>Remember that the party-controlled Senate has the ultimate power to confirm or
deny nominations.  As a Senator, Al Gore voted to confirm Scalia, one of the
justices he now hypocritically parades as an example of why progressives must
vote (for Gore) against Bush, instead of voting for Ralph Nader or other
challengers.
<p>Gore’s record further belies his avowals. In the Senate, he voted for the Hyde
Amendment's restrictions on access to abortion for poor women.  Previously, in
the House of Representatives, Gore gained an 84% approval rating for his
“pro-life” votes from the National Right to Life League.  Yet Gore now says he
“always” has supported a woman’s right to choose.

<p>Despite the facts, organizations that allegedly serve to protect the interests
of pro-choice women, not the Democratic Party, have joined the scare campaign.
A new commercial by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League
(NARAL) warns that Mr. Bush's goal is "ending legal abortion" (an accusation
utterly lacking evidence) and concludes, "Before voting Nader, consider the
risk."  Clinton and Gore have failed to act in any way while abortion was made
unavailable in 86% of the counties in the United States during their two terms.

<p>Another ignored issue is that the Supreme Court traditionally has been a
follower, not a leader of public opinion, and likely will continue in that
reactionary role with either of the dominant parties controlling nominations.
George W. Bush is a politician.  To think that he would sabotage his career and
party deliberately by selecting a judge who would overturn the overwhelmingly
popular Roe v Wade borders on the ridiculous.

<p>Rather than focusing narrowly on one issue, we encourage citizens to examine the
broader impact of the courts, like the courts’ ongoing erosion of Bill of Rights
protections in the name of suppressing “terrorism,” government-disfavored drugs,
and even political protest.  Justices nominated by both parties have shown
disregard for our Constitution by supporting “corporate personhood” and the
doctrine of money equaling speech.

<p>Appointments to the federal judiciary are important, and there are real
differences between the Democratic and Republican appointments, especially below
the level of the Supreme Court.  Reasonable people may weigh court appointments
heavily in choosing to vote for Bush or Gore, but too many Americans have
opinions on this topic without a base of sound information.

<p>Whatever one’s political persuasion, it’s important to recognize that false
friends often can do more harm than known adversaries.  Before citizens succumb
to voting out of fear rather than belief, consider one thought.  How can you
expect your elected officials to vote their conscience if you don't?
