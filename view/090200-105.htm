Which is worse: a presidential candidate opposed to cleaning up big
money’s role in politics, or one who offers the illusion of wanting to
do something about it without demonstrating that he’s really serious?

<p>On the one hand, George W. Bush is big money incarnate. His presidential
campaign has broken all records for fundraising, topping $100 million.
Bush, the self-proclaimed "Reformer With Results," says he favors
banning soft money from corporations and unions, but wants to allow
individuals to keep giving those large, unregulated contributions—which
means he favors no meaningful reform at all.

<p>By contrast, Gore says that he has learned from the fundraising scandals
perpetuated by the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign. He says he wants to get
"all special interest money" out of politics, and has proposed creating
a Democracy Endowment to provide full public financing for candidates’
general election campaigns. Many observers were impressed by  his
acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, when he
promised to make the McCain-Feingold bill banning soft money the first
priority of his administration.

<p>Gore’s declarations sound sincere. That is, until you recall what the
current version of McCain-Feingold actually says. Yes, it shuts down all
federal soft money donations. But it no longer covers "issue ads," which
means that it does nothing about the millions of unregulated dollars
being spent on slyly worded commercials that imply support for
candidates without actually saying so. The words "McCain-Feingold" have
become such a mantra that few people have stopped to consider how modest
a first step the actual bill has become.

<p>The truth is that Gore is stuck on the horns of a dilemma. To show that
he is serious about really changing how big money dominates politics—and
not just talking about the issue as a way of attracting independent
voters and McCain supporters—he has to do a lot more to build a popular
movement capable of forcing Congress to take real action. For starters,
that would mean aligning himself with the strongest advocates for reform
within his own party. And it would mean advocating full public financing
for candidates in general elections  and primaries to free them from
dependence on big money donors, as already exists in several states. But
such moves would put him in direct conflict with powerful forces within
his own Democratic ranks

<p>The story of what happened to Wisconsin Senator Russell Feingold at the Democratic convention is indicative. Feingold, John McCain’s
crusader-in-arms, spent the week in a state of high moral outrage.
Speaking at the opening evening of the Shadow Convention, he made a
perfunctory declaration of support for his party and then launched into
a passionate condemnation of "what has happened to our conventions, to
our government and to our democracy."

<p>"I’m sorry to say it, but the big story at the Democratic Convention is
really influence buying and peddling….The story is not whether to have a
fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion, but the obscenity of unlimited
special interest soft money contributions. The story is not whether the
President is upstaging the Vice President by holding fundraisers in L.A.
this week; it’s the staggering size of the contributions required to get
into the darn thing. The story is not the elaborate security
arrangements to protect the convention participants at the fund-raisers,
it’s that people feel so shut out of the process that they feel they
must take to the streets."

<p>Feingold’s attack on "our brave new corporate democracy" won him a
standing ovation at the Shadow Convention, which was organized by the
campaign finance reform groups Public Campaign and Common Cause, among
others. But his honesty and forthrightness did not win him any friends
at the Democratic convention a few blocks away.

<p>Indeed, two days later Feingold was scheduled to give a three-minute
speech to the delegates at the Staples Center. But after DNC officials
got wind of what Feingold was planning to say, they pushed up his
speaking time by an hour—to insure a tiny audience—and then chucked his
speech down the memory hole. Several checks at the DNC press table
inside the convention center turned up no copies of the transcript of
Feingold’s address, and while aides there suggested that it could be
found on the official convention website, the Monday after the
convention there was nothing to be found there either. Transcripts, as
well as audio and video recordings, could be obtained for many other
Democratic elected officials, including such notables as the mayor of
Minneapolis and several first-termers in the House. But nothing from the
Senate’s leading Democrat pushing campaign reform.

<p>Feingold’s thought-crime? Before endorsing Gore and praising his
commitment to shut down soft money, he expressed his dismay at all the
soft money fundraising going on at the convention and called on DNC
officials to prohibit it at future conventions. This, apparently, was
too much for Democratic poobahs and powerbrokers, who wanted to enjoy
their days in the sky-boxes and nights limo-ing from one Beverly Hills
party to another without being reminded of their own complicity in
corrupting American democracy.

<p>It was only a few hours after Gore promised to get all special interest
money out of politics that he was off partying at a Barbra Streisand
concert-fundraiser that netted the Democrats more than $5 million. A
Gore spokesperson claimed there was no contradiction, pointing out that
this was "hard money" raised at the maximum of $1000 per contributor.
But when you remember that less than one-tenth of one percent of all
Americans make a $1000 hard money contribution to any federal candidate,
and that this donor class is much whiter, wealthier, older, more male
and more conservative than the average voter, with economic interests
often intertwined with the companies they either own or manager, you
realize that this is a distinction without a difference.

<p>The sad truth is that both parties are now little more than foot-stools
for corporate fatcats. Changing that reality is the real work of reform.
