              an increasingly crude 2000 election campaign clawed its way toward 
              what could well be a dispiriting conclusion, I buoyed my spirits 
              with a visit to the political graveyard. There, I sat for a bit 
              with the last presidential candidate to take so sustained a political 
              battering from the powers that be as the one now being administered 
              to Ralph Nader.            </font>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Robert 
              M. La Follette is buried in Madison's Forest Hill Cemetery, beneath 
              a simple marker that pokes out above the fallen leaves. This has 
              been his resting place since 1925. La Follette died in June of that 
              year, just four days after his 70th birthday. Friends and family 
              identified the cause as exhaustion from his 1924 campaign for the 
              presidency,</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              Wisconsin senator's 1924 campaign as an independent Progressive 
              challenged a conservative Republican and an only marginally less 
              conservative Democrat. La Follette's purpose in making that race 
              was starkly similar to the 66-year-old Nader's rationale for mounting 
              this year's challenge to Republican George W. Bush and Democrat 
              Al Gore.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Senator 
              La Follette did not expect to win,'' recalls historian Roger T. 
              Johnson. "He made the race as a matter of principle, and as a matter 
              of practical politics, hoping that a strong showing would generate 
              the popular support necessary to the formation of a new political 
              party.'' As La Follette said upon launching his campaign, "I stand 
              for an honest realignment in American politics, confident that the 
              people in November will insure the creation of a new party in which 
              all Progressives may unite.''</font></P>
<P ALIGN="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>****</B></font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like 
              Nader, who today seeks to build a progressive force in the form 
              of the Green Party, La Follette had soured on a two-party system 
              that he saw as having fallen entirely under the influence of Wall 
              Street. A maverick throughout his career, he broke ranks with his 
              own Republican Party to mount that 1924 challenge, which was backed 
              by progressive unions, prominent African-American intellectuals, 
              social reformers and other freethinkers in a time of stark repression 
              against those who dared challenge political orthodoxies. (Just four 
              years earlier, the presidential candidate of the Socialist Party, 
              Eugene Victor Debs, had been forced to campaign from the jail cell 
              where he was imprisoned for having spoken out against the profiteering 
              of defense contractors during World War I.)</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">La 
              Follette was able to campaign in 1924 as a free man. But that does 
              not mean that he was given a free or fair shot at winning the presidency. 
              Running on an anti-corporate platform quite similar to the one on 
              which Nader campaigns this year, and pledging himself to restore 
              democracy by banishing powerful special interests from positions 
              of political influence, La Follette offered a radical alternative 
              to the rule of the robber barons. The barons and their minions promptly 
              set out to destroy not just the candidacy, but the man.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
              Philip La Follette recalled in his wonderful book, "Adventure in 
              Politics,'' when efforts to prevent his father from gaining ballot 
              status failed, his opponents attempted to ignore "Fighting Bob.'' 
              But then the elder La Follette began to draw larger crowds than 
              his foes -- just as Nader has with his "super rallies'' -- and the 
              knives came out. "These great meetings gave our supporters tremendous 
              encouragement,'' wrote Phil La Follette. "But they likewise roused 
              the enemy -- especially the Republicans. The checkbooks came out, 
              and the heat was turned on labor and farmers. By the end of October 
              one could feel the vast, spreading tentacles of organized economic 
              power beginning its squeeze to drive people -- especially labor 
              -- by fear into voting for (President Calvin) Coolidge.''</font></P>
<P ALIGN="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>****</B></font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">La 
              Follette was condemned as everything from a radical to a bitter 
              old man on an ego trip. He was dismissed as inept and even insane. 
              And, at every turn, his supporters were warned that a vote for the 
              man they wanted as president would be "wasted'' or, worse yet, would 
              tip the race to the eviler of two lessers.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Seventy-six 
              years later, in another late October, the knives are out again. 
              The tentacles are spreading toward another maverick candidate who 
              has built a coalition of progressive labor unions such as the United 
              Electrical Workers and the California Nurse Association; prominent 
              African-American intellectuals such as Cornel West, Manning Marable 
              and Randall Robinson; social critics such as Barbara Ehrenreich 
              and Noam Chomsky; and freethinkers such as John Anderson, Phil Donahue, 
              Michael Moore and Patti Smith. The enthusiastic support displayed 
              at Ralph Nader's rallies across the nation has roused his enemies; 
              they attack him as radical, bitter and inept, and they dismiss his 
              supporters as vote-wasting dupes and foolish dissenters from lesser-of-two-evilism. 
              They even dare to suggest, as did the foes of La Follette, that 
              the challenger of the powerful interests is himself the dupe of 
              those interests.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
              is enough to turn a voter away from the polls -- and, sadly, that 
              may be the effect of the increasingly venomous attacks on Nader, 
              not to mention the fierce and absurdly incendiary assaults Bush 
              and Gore are mounting upon one another. In 1924, the voter turnout 
              hit record lows -- as millions of La Follette supporters simply 
              abandoned the process in confusion and disgust.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
              is much to be confused about this year, just as there is much with 
              which to be disgusted.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
              what needs most to be said in these final days before the election 
              is that voting -- that most pivotal act of the true democrat -- 
              does matter. La Follette would chastise today's cynics, as he did 
              his compromised contemporaries, telling them that no believer in 
              democracy will ever dismiss the sincerely rendered choice of a citizen 
              on Election Day as anything less than the most noble of all statements.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
              Nov. 7, wise and decent Americans will cast their ballots for Al 
              Gore, George W. Bush and Ralph Nader. No vote will be wasted. Some 
              votes may be cast out of fear; yet even the frightened are forgiven 
              by Robert M. La Follette -- when young Phil complained of fair-weather 
              backers, particularly workers and farmers, who abandoned the candidacy 
              in the face of fear mongering, old Bob replied, "Don't blame the 
              folks. They just got scared.''</font></P>
<P ALIGN="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>****</B></font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
              his forgiveness of this year's fearful voters, however, it is fair 
              to presume that La Follette would offer a reminder that millions 
              of votes are likely to be cast Nov. 7 on behalf of the dream that 
              a great progressive movement can yet be forged in America. And the 
              casters of those votes can take comfort in the fact that, even if 
              their faith is now maligned, it may eventually be rewarded.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Phil 
              La Follette recalled how, on the cold November night of his father's 
              1924 defeat, he went to bed embittered at the treatment of "Old 
              Bob'' and his Progressive supporters. As the years passed, however, 
              the bitterness faded. He came to recognize that "Dad's campaign 
              was a baptism for thousands of Americans. Ten years later, in the 
              days of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, the activists who flocked 
              to Washington had one sure and certain password among themselves 
              to prove they were not 'Johnny-come-latelies': They had fought for 
              'ld Bob' in 1924.''</font></P>
<P align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Three-quarters 
              of a century have gone by. Yet most things remain the same. Powerful 
              interests are still inadequately challenged by Republicans and Democrats. 
              And there are still young progressives willing to earn battle scars 
              as they learn the passwords for a day when the politics of hope 
              replaces the politics of fear.
