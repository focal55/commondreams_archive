During the first several days after the election, many of 
America's leading pundits were very distressed. Some even appeared to be on 
the verge of freaking out as they vented major anxieties: It's upsetting 
that we still don't know who the next president will be! The financial 
markets could plunge! Other countries won't respect us!

<p>Fortunately, cooler heads -- namely, the public -- prevailed. With 
the United States in its second post-election week while complicated legal 
proceedings unfolded in Florida, national opinion polls clearly indicated 
widespread patience rather than panic. Apparently, most Americans didn't 
mind waiting for final ballot tallies and court rulings -- despite all the 
agitation from media commentators frenetically projecting their own 
attitudes onto the body politic.

<p>From the outset, numerous familiar voices on the cable TV networks 
were asserting that a winner should be declared -- in a hurry. On CNN, 
patrician news analyst Bill Schneider fretted aloud that the public would 
not take kindly to delays. The New York Times swiftly singled him out for 
praise in a Nov. 10 editorial that warned against dragging legal issues 
from the election into the courts.

<p>"The CNN political commentator William Schneider picked apt 
language when he spoke of the 'treacherous path' that would-be leaders 
choose when they talk of unraveling the finality of elections," the Times 
editorial proclaimed. Such statements from powerful media outlets, 
transfixed with "finality" rather than accuracy in counting ballots, were 
music to the ears of key Republican operatives like James Baker. A classic 
blue-blooded political player, Baker wailed four days later that "the 
markets" were concerned "because they don't see any finality here."

<p>On MSNBC, print journalists got lots of time in front of cameras 
as they eagerly repeated -- or tried to concoct -- conventional media 
wisdom. Typically, Evan Thomas of Newsweek joined with bombastic host Chris 
Matthews to beat the drums for preemptive closure. Chiming in was frequent 
guest Mike Barnicle of the New York Daily News. (Barnicle used to be a 
columnist on the staff of the Boston Globe, but he lost his job at that 
newspaper after it turned out that he had fabricated a story under his 
byline. So much for high standards of credibility at MSNBC.)

<p>In effect, many commentators kept telling Americans that a quick 
count would be much more valuable than an accurate one. Such claims often 
had a paternalistic ring: It's better to move on. The country can't handle 
this kind of uncertainty.

<p>There were exceptions. Early on, syndicated columnist Mark 
Shields, a regular on the influential "NewsHour With Jim Lehrer," 
eloquently urged patience in support of a more complete tally. At the time, 
he was in a minority on that PBS program. But as days passed and the public 
showed scant signs of imitating the sky-is-falling commentators, the media 
climate improved.

<p>A week after the election, when the "NewsHour" aired a roundtable 
discussion with columnists from the Washington Post, New York Times, 
Chicago Tribune and U.S. News & World Report, the tone was notably more 
judicious. The discourse included much recognition of the wisdom of waiting 
for the courts and manual recounting to sift the results in Florida.

<p>No matter who finally wins the election, we should ponder why -- 
during the crucial days right after Nov. 7 -- so many journalists and news 
analysts were so disconnected from the public.

<p>Many reporters and commentators who cover the national political 
scene reacted to the post-election uncertainties with alarm and dread -- 
and they strained to prod readers and viewers to follow suit. But most 
Americans declined to allow themselves to be stampeded by hyperventilating 
members of the punditocracy.

<p>In this case, with the public's wisdom greatly exceeding their 
own, many of the country's most prestigious political journalists have felt 
compelled to cool their jets. Near the end of an election year with 
precious little to cheer about, that's good news.

Highly Deceptive Media."
