    <font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Talking points</strong></em>:</font><br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">*</font> The Iraqi people are suffering both as a result of the
    sanctions the US insists upon and at the hands of Saddam Hussein. The sanctions against
    Iraq have shattered civil society, the economy and the educational system. The UN
    International Children's Fund estimates that 4,500 children are dying every month -- one
    every ten minutes. This is unconscionable. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">*</font> We must make a distinction between the government of Iraq
    and the Iraqi people. The Iraqi people should be provided with the necessities of life --
    food, medicine and clean water. The presumed US government policy of using the sanctions
    as pressure on the Iraqi people to overthrow Saddam Hussein has not worked and is totally
    immoral. The US should not be using food as a weapon. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">*</font> The Clinton administration has been somewhat ambiguous, but
    has basically said that the sanctions will remain in place no matter what the Iraqi regime
    does. This creates no incentive for the Iraqi regime to abide by UN resolutions. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">* </font>The administration should heed the advice of its allies and
    genuinely try to find a diplomatic solution to the current crisis. This is no time for
    people to be proving how macho they can be. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">*</font><font color="#0000FF"> </font>Are we going to go to war over
    whether there should be 40 or 20 US inspectors? A way must be found to get the inspectors
    back in Iraq, ensure that there are no weapons of mass destruction and alleviate the
    suffering of the Iraqi people.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">*</font> The sanctions are not against Saddam Hussein. He remains in
    power. It is the Iraqi people who are suffering. The sanctions in fact may strengthen his
    hold on power. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">*</font> &quot;Surgical strikes&quot; don't exist in this world. If
    the US bombs, targets will be missed and, as in the past, civilians will die. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">*</font> Iraq had and did not use chemical weapons during the Gulf
    War. While it is the cause of much debate, many experts believe that Gulf War Syndrome was
    caused by the US military bombing Iraqi storage facilities of chemical weapons. What
    untold suffering will be unleashed if the US military begins bombing such Iraqi
    facilities? <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">*</font> Double standards have led to triple and quadruple
    standards. In 1991, the US insisted that a war be waged to implement UN resolutions
    against Iraq. Since that time, the UN and its resolutions have been ignored on Israel's
    oppression of the Palestinians and its occupation of Lebanon. Now, suddenly, the US again
    discovers the UN as an instrument of foreign policy. The UN is a hollow shell that doesn't
    have any teeth except when it comes to Arab countries. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">*</font> Israel is the all time champion of violating UN Security
    Council resolutions, but the US doesn't place sanctions or bomb it. Instead, the US gives
    it billions of dollars each year.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">*</font> On the issue of weapons of mass destruction, Israel has
    never allowed serious inspection of its estimated 200 nuclear weapons. The resolution that
    created UNSCOM also called for a Mideast free of nuclear weapons. Israel's massive arsenal
    must be on the table. So long as Israel has this massive arsenal, the region will be
    unstable and other countries will try to match it. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">*</font> A case can be made that the sanctions are a weapon of mass
    destruction. The rest of the world wants to see some greater alleviation of the suffering
    of the Iraqis. The &quot;food for oil&quot; deal is totally insufficient and does not
    address the infrastructure, like water and electrical facilities. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">*</font> The media are right to complain that Iraq is not letting
    many of them in now. But where have they been for the last six years? As the Iraqi people
    have been suffocating, they have been silent. Now, the only time Iraqi civilians are shown
    on US TV is when they are at Saddam Hussein's palace.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">*</font> Iraqis are humans. If you cut them, they bleed. If you
    suffocate them, they choke. If you starve them, they die. This happens whether or not
    there are cameras there. <br>

    This crisis could be a disaster as the US moves toward attacking Iraq and the brink of
    war, but it could also be a tremendous opportunity. It is a chance to finally put the
    suffering of the Iraqi people on the agenda and to create a situation where the US
    restates its policy to separate the suffering of the Iraqi people from the regime and the
    inspectors can do their work. <br>
