<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Thank you very much. 
It's an honor to be here. I was here once before when Jerry and I won this award 
from President Reagan for the small business people of the year. I got up and 
talked about the same issue I'm about to talk to you about today. Senator Alfonse 
D'Amato got up and told me what an ingrate I was. So it's nice to be here and 
he's not.<br>
<br>
As Ben & Jerry's started to prosper, we felt business has a responsibility to 
give back to the community. So we started the Ben & Jerry's Foundation. And it 
wasn't long before the foundation was totally overwhelmed with requests to fund 
very worthwhile non-profit organizations that were trying to deal with problems 
of poverty. We could only fund about 5 percent of the applications that were coming 
in. We realized every foundation in the country was in this same position, that 
there were so many overwhelming needs the private sector was not able to take 
care of them.<br>
<br>
We were trying to understand, how could this be, in the richest nation in the 
world, that these basic human needs were not being met. We started looking into 
it and we realized that, for example, Head Start, the most successful program 
that we've got for helping to break the poverty cycle, is so underfunded that 
only one out of every three eligible kids can get a spot in that program, that 
there are 11 million kids in the country who don't have any health care, that 
our schools are badly in need of renovation and that we need a whole lot more 
teachers to reduce class size.<br>
<br>
We discovered this is all about priorities. What are the priorities or values 
of the American people? Is the government spending Americans' money in accordance 
with those values?<br>
<br>
There are some politicians who are fond of saying we can take care of those human 
needs through the private sector and through public-private partnerships, maybe 
even through faith-based institutions. Let's get real. No matter who the delivery 
mechanism is, no matter what organization delivers the needed help, there are 
some big dollars involved here.<br>
<br>
Fully funding Head Start would need $7 billion more. Taking care of the health 
care needs of the uninsured kids will cost be at least $6 billion. To repair the 
schools, just to bring them up to minimum federal safety standards, the price 
tag is $112 billion, $10 billion a year for 11 years. Hiring enough teachers to 
significantly reduce class size and improve education, that's going to be $11 
billion. That's a total of $34 billion.<br>
<br>
There's only one place that that kind of money can come from - the federal budget. 
So I'd like to take a look with you for a minute at the federal discretionary 
budget pie. For every dollar that goes into the discretionary budget -- the amount 
of money Congress has available each year to allocate -- six cents goes into education. 
Four cents goes into health care. Approximately 51 cents goes into the Pentagon.<br>
<br>
Throughout most of my life, the major dynamic affecting our budgeting process, 
affecting our budget priorities, was the Cold War. The United States and the Soviet 
Union were locked in an ever-escalating arms race, always generating newer versions 
of higher-tech weapons we both hoped we were never going to use. It was an incredible 
waste of resources on both sides. At its height, both countries were spending 
about $300 billion a year. In order to fund a huge, unprecedented peacetime military 
buildup in the 1980s, federal aid to cities and states was cut by $75 billion 
a year, and it continues at that reduced level to this day.<br>
<br>
The Cold War arms race mentality became the norm. It developed its own bureaucracy, 
inertia and momentum. Then, about 10 years ago, the Cold War ended. We became 
the world's only superpower. We shifted from military warfare to economic warfare.<br>
<br>
The place where this new economic war is won or lost is in our nation's classrooms 
and in the health and education of our nation's children, from prenatal care to 
preschool on up. Yet the budget priorities of the United States have failed to 
respond to this new reality.<br>
<br>
Businesspeople are always trying to fund departmental requests that exceed the 
amount of money available. To respond to a constantly changing external marketplace, 
the budgets of some departments need to be increased, and others decreased. When 
businesses do their budgets, they employ a technique called benchmarking. How 
do our company's capabilities and allocation of resources stack up against the 
competition?<br>
<br>
Let's see how America stacks up versus other industrialized countries. In terms 
of math and science test scores in high school, we rank 18th. In terms of per-student 
spending, we rank tenth. We are the only industrialized country that does not 
provide health care for all of our children. We rank 13th in infant mortality.<br>
<br>
We rank number one in military spending.<br>
<br>
Our country has a severe case of what we in the business world call institutional 
lag, the tendency of large organizations to take a long time to respond to a new 
changing external dynamic.<br>
<br>
We must remain strong militarily, but we must also prepare our children to compete 
in the global economy. This is just as important to our security. Some people 
will say, "But there was a big drop in Pentagon spending, you know, all those 
base closings and such." The reality is that there was a big drop only measured 
against the very peak of military spending in the late 1980s. Our Pentagon spending 
today is at 90 percent of Cold War averages.<br>
<br>
Almost two years ago, the National Defense Panel, commissioned by Congress, found 
the Pentagon's two-war concept was not only obsolete, but was primarily a device 
for justifying Cold-War level expenditures. The panel also argued that the Pentagon 
was spending too much money on yesterday's weapons.<br>
<br>
This institutional lag is exacerbated by the political contributions of defense 
contractors who spent more on campaign contributions than even the tobacco industry 
during the 1998 election cycle.<br>
<br>
The message of the Sensible Priorities Campaign is simple: invest in kids, not 
Pentagon waste. Invest in proven programs in education and health care, without 
raising taxes, by trimming the Cold War-era Pentagon budget by 15 percent, which 
comes out to about $40 billion annually. That 15 percent is the number that was 
arrived at by Dr. Lawrence Korb, former assistant Secretary of Defense under President 
Reagan, who first discussed it in a 1995 "Foreign Affairs" article, and then updated 
his thesis in a 1999 Pentagon budget review done for our campaign.<br>
<br>
Let me give you a few examples of what we're talking about. In terms of nuclear 
weapons, we spend about $30 billion a year on nuclear weapons today, about the 
same as we spent before the end of the Cold War. Dr. Korb has determined that 
for half that amount of money - about $15 billion a year - we could afford to 
have a nuclear arsenal equivalent to 40,000 Hiroshima size bombs, and he says 
that's enough. We think he's right.<br>
<br>
The $15 billion we'd save is enough money to fund health insurance for the 11 
million kids that don't have any and provide Head Start for the 1.2 million kids 
who are eligible but unserved. Our surveys and polling show that 76 percent of 
the public agrees this is the transfer they would like to make with their tax 
money.<br>
<br>
I'll give you another example. The F-22 jet fighter was designed during the Cold 
War to supersede a fighter we thought the Soviet Union was going to build. We 
already had the most powerful jet fighter in the world. But we thought they were 
going to build a better one. The Cold War mode was to build a better one than 
they were going to build, to continue the arms race. Well, the other guy dropped 
out of the race, but we may still build that F-22, even after the House made its 
courageous decision to not fund it next year.<br>
<br>
Our F-15 fighters, the most advanced fighter jet in the world, cost $33 million 
each. F-22s cost $188 million each -- six times more. The total F-22 program is 
scheduled to cost $64 billion. For that $64 billion, we could modernize and repair 
60 percent of all the schools in the United States.<br>
<br>
These questions of values and budgetary priorities go to the heart and soul of 
who we are as a nation, because our values are revealed in how we spend our money.<br>
<br>
Talk to any group of parents, anybody in the checkout line, to any small business 
person or head of the largest corporation. Talk to just about anybody, and you'll 
find that education is their number-one priority. The politicians read their polls; 
they know they've got to talk about education. But their rhetoric is, in the most 
part, empty. They "feel the people's pain" but they are only offering a placebo 
to fix it. They don't back up their words with action.<br>
<br>
Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities is issuing a challenge to all the politicians 
who talk about education and health care, from presidents to county commissioners. 
We challenge them to tell us how are they going to pay for it. If education is 
a priority, if health care is a priority, how and when are you going to pay for 
it?<br>
<br>
Dan Quayle spoke at this forum just two weeks ago. He talked about fixing our 
education system. Well, Dan, show me the money.<br>
<br>
President Clinton goes on and on about how our schools are in disrepair and how 
we need more teachers, and then offers a pittance as a down payment. Well, Bill, 
show me the money.<br>
<br>
Elizabeth Dole called public education the cornerstone of our democracy, the key 
to economic opportunity for all Americans. Regrettably, the system is failing 
too many children. Well, Liz, show me the money.<br>
<br>
Bill Bradley says we're not just going to have education K-12, we're going to 
have lifetime education. Okay, Bill, show me the money.<br>
<br>
Steve Forbes says we need schools that have small classes with more personal attention. 
Well, we'll just use his money.<br>
<br>
Al Gore says we should give all teachers more classes, modern school buildings, 
good working conditions. Show me the money, Al.<br>
<br>
And George Bush says everyone must have a first-rate education because there are 
no second-rate children and no second-rate dreams. Beautiful words, George. Show 
me the money.<br>
<br>
In today's new world, the way our government is spending our money just doesn't 
make sense. It doesn't make military sense. It doesn't make economic sense. It 
doesn't make spiritual sense. It doesn't make common sense. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Ben Cohen 
is a co-founder of Ben & Jerry's. Ben &amp; Jerry's has become known for more 
than its ice cream; namely, its commitment of donating 7 1/2 % of pre-tax profits 
to social causes. In 1988, the company won the corporate giving award from the 
Council on Economic Priorities, and Ben and Jerry were named the U.S. small business 
persons of the year, with all the appropriate hoopla of a White House ceremony 
hosted by President Reagan.<br>
<br>
In 1996, Mr. Cohen and a group of business people took out a full-page ad in the 
New York Times, calling on the presidential candidates to talk about federal spending 
priorities now that the Cold War is over. The response from the public was enthusiastic. 
This convinced Mr. Cohen that they were on to something. Research showed that 
the public regarded business people as credible sources on fiscal responsibility 
and sound budget choices, and military people were trusted to make sound national 
security choices. So Mr. Cohen recruited people from both camps, and now he has 
more than 500 members in his group, which is called <a href="http://www.businessleaders.org/home.htm">Business 
Leaders For Sensible Priorities</a>. BLSP is conducting a national, non-partisan 
public education campaign to inform people about how the federal government is 
spending their money.</i></font></p>
