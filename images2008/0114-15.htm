<p>WASHINGTON - January 14 -As they went before a judge at the US Superior Court
for the District of Columbia late Saturday, a group of activists
arrested the previous day each gave the name of one of the men
imprisoned at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantánamo. Speaking the Guantánamo
prioners' names into the court record was the culmination of a day of
action against torture and indeterminate detention that began on Friday
with a march to the U.S Supreme Court and the arrest of 82 activists
inside and on the steps of the Court.
<P></P>
They were charged with “unlawful free speech on Supreme Court grounds.”
Those arrested inside the building received an additional charge of
“causing a harangue within the Supreme Court.”
<P></P>
As of 8 p.m. Saturday, all 82 persons had been released. Many were
denied food and water for most of the 30 hours they were detained. About
70 withheld their identification and instead gave the name of a detainee
upon arrest. Forty-six pled not guilty and will be going back for trial.
Others accepted an agreement not to be arrested for the next six months
in exchange for the charges being dropped.
<P></P>
The arrestees were participating in Witness Against Torture's Jan. 11
action to Shut Down Guantánamo, which began with a solemn procession
from the National Mall by 400 persons, including a contingent dressed as
the Guantánamo prisoners in orange jumpsuits and black hoods. The march
was preceded by a short rally at the Mall organized by Amnesty
International, the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, and
Witness Against Torture. The event was part of an International Day of
Action endorsed by over 100 groups and that included 83 events around
the world.
<P></P>
The arrestees included people from across the country; teenagers and
octogenarians; first-time arrestees; and members of Witness Against
Torture's original delegation, who walked to Guantanámo to visit the
prisoners in December 2005.
<P></P>
