                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK 
                  - April 4 - In two separate incidents last week, dozens of Iraqis 
                  were killed by what eyewitness survivors claim were U.S. airstrikes. 
                  U.S. officials, however, offered a range of denials and evasions 
                  about what may have caused the explosions. Despite evidence 
                  uncovered by one British newspaper about the second (and more 
                  deadly) of the incidents, however, most U.S. media outlets have 
                  allowed the story to end with the official denials.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 
                  28, in an open-air market in the Shuala section of Baghdad, 
                  over 60 people were reportedly killed in what seemed to be a 
                  missile attack-- the Los Angeles Times (3/29/03), for example, 
                  reported matter-of-factly that &quot;a missile slammed into 
                  a crowded market area.&quot; But as with an earlier explosion 
                  on March 26, the New York Times' John F. Burns reported (3/29/03) 
                  that &quot;it was impossible to determine the cause,&quot; adding 
                  that &quot;a Central Command spokesman in Qatar said Friday 
                  night that the United States could not tell what caused the 
                  bombing on Friday.&quot; Burns suggested that these incidents 
                  &quot;threaten to become yet another major problem for the Bush 
                  administration.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PR angle 
                  was also highlighted on the CBS Evening News after the earlier 
                  explosion (3/26/03), with anchor Dan Rather noting that &quot;scenes 
                  of civilian carnage in Baghdad, however they happened and whoever 
                  caused them, today quickly became part of a propaganda war, 
                  the very thing U.S. military planners have tried to avoid.&quot; 
                  (Of course, the extensive preparations the Pentagon made for 
                  communicating to the press before the war indicate that it was 
                  not hoping to &quot;avoid&quot; a propaganda war-- but to win 
                  one.)</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While one 
                  might hope that reporters would be interested in uncovering 
                  the cause of more than 60 civilian deaths, U.S. media have so 
                  far made little effort to investigate the Shuala incident. One 
                  British reporter on the scene, however, found evidence that 
                  appears to shed light on the origin of the devastation.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 
                  30, Robert Fisk reported in the London Independent that what 
                  appeared to be a missile fragment was found on the scene of 
                  the explosion-- and that it bore a visible serial number, which 
                  Fisk published. In a follow-up report on April 2, the Independent's 
                  Cahal Milmo reported that the serial number could be traced 
                  back to the Raytheon Corporation, and that the weapon was &quot;thought 
                  to be either a HARM anti-radar missile or a Paveway laser-guided 
                  bomb.&quot; The Independent continues: &quot;The American military 
                  has confirmed that a navy EA-6B 'Prowler' jet, based on the 
                  U.S.S. Kitty Hawk, was in action over the Iraqi capital on Friday 
                  and fired at least one HARM missile to protect two American 
                  fighters from a surface-to-air missile battery.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some media 
                  accounts have pointed to the relatively small crater created 
                  by the explosion at Shuala as an indication that a U.S. cruise 
                  missile was not responsible. But cruise missiles are not the 
                  only weapons being launched from U.S. planes in Iraq. The Independent 
                  reported that, according to experts, &quot;the damage caused 
                  at Shuala was consistent with that of Paveway or, more probably, 
                  a HARM weapon,&quot; which are smaller than cruise missiles.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So far, 
                  according to a search of the Nexis database, no major U.S. news 
                  outlet has picked up this new information; instead, reporters 
                  have continued to relay U.S. officials' denials of any knowledge 
                  about the Shuala blast. The New York Times' Burns (4/4/03) questioned 
                  why the Iraqis have not been able to explain the incident: &quot;Often, 
                  as in Shuala, officials have delayed taking reporters to the 
                  site for hours, and have met with evasions the inquiries about 
                  the unusually small crater at the marketplace, and the fact 
                  that most victims appeared to have died from shrapnel wounds 
                  and not from the kind of blast associated with high-energy bombs 
                  and missiles.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On NPR's 
                  Talk of the Nation (4/2/03), the question of civilian casualties 
                  was discussed by host Neal Conan with guests Michael O'Hanlon 
                  of the Brookings Institution and retired Marine Col. Gary Anderson. 
                  In response to a caller's question, Conan explained that U.S. 
                  military officials still could not find any evidence that the 
                  first bombing was caused by a U.S. weapon.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'Hanlon 
                  then explained that an investigation into these cases would 
                  involve answering three questions: verifying where you were 
                  shooting, and tracking &quot;how many of the bombs or cruise 
                  missiles that you fired reached their proper targets&quot;; 
                  looking for bomb fragments; and, finally, judging the size of 
                  the crater left by the explosion, &quot;whether it's consistent 
                  with the size of the explosive charge that was on the warhead 
                  in question, possibly even the shape of the crater and things 
                  like that.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interestingly, 
                  the report in the Independent provides what could be answers 
                  to all of those questions. But Conan summed up the matter this 
                  way: &quot;There were other attacks, though, and as so far, 
                  the investigations by the U.S. military... are not complete, 
                  and again, as Michael O'Hanlon knows, it may be some time, if 
                  ever, before we actually know what happened there.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NPR's listeners 
                  might have been interested to know that more information was 
                  available-- even though it wasn't part of an investigation by 
                  the U.S. military.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACTION: 
                  Encourage NPR's Talk of the Nation and the New York Times to 
                  continue to investigate what caused the March 28 explosion in 
                  Baghdad that killed dozens of Iraqi civilians. You might suggest 
                  that they interview reporters from the Independent who have 
                  pursued the story.</font></p>
