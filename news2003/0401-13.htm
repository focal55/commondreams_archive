                - April 1 - The Bush administration recently added a new tool 
                to its anti-environmental kit that could significantly change 
                the way the government assesses and regulates environmental threats. 
                The tool is a biased form of cost-benefit analysis that makes 
                regulations appear less worthwhile by lowering the hypothetical 
                monetary value of human life. Senior citizens are particularly 
                at risk under this new approach, since many of the techniques 
                can be used specifically to discount the life of the elderly when 
                regulating some of the greatest threats to their health, such 
                as air pollution. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently the 
                administration has used this analysis in new air pollution control 
                rules and proposed legislation that cater to industrial polluters 
                at the expense of public health. Last fall, the Environmental 
                Protection Agency featured this "alternative" analysis in its 
                support documentation for the administration's air pollution legislation 
                for power plants (<a href="http://www.nrdc.org/air/pollution/fclearsk.asp" target="_new">click 
                here</a> for NRDC's view of this legislation), and in its final 
                rule for off-road engines like the ones used in snowmobiles. Both 
                of these proposals would not adequately protect the public from 
                soot, smog and other dangerous pollutants. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This novel 
                approach was so tilted that the level of benefits calculated under 
                this method was more than 90 percent less than under the usual 
                EPA method, falling from the previously accepted standard value 
                of $6.1 million per life saved to less than half a million dollars 
                for many fatalities. What is more unsettling is that most of the 
                reduction in benefits was due to lowering the estimate of the 
                value of saving a human life, not to a change in the estimate 
                of the number of lives that would be saved. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To lower the 
                estimate for the value of lives saved under these proposals, the 
                White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had EPA reduce 
                its established value through a series of steps. One of the most 
                startling steps was to count the value of saving the lives of 
                Americans over 70-years old as worth only 63 percent of the standard 
                value assigned to people under 70 -- a percentage based on a flawed 
                concept and an unsuitable study. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main administration 
                proponent for this kind of slanted analysis is John Graham, head 
                of the OMB office that reviews regulations (see this profile from 
                the Spring 2003 issue of NRDC's OnEarth Magazine). In October 
                2001, Graham recommended that the National Academy of Sciences 
                consider using a related calculus, called Quality Adjusted Life 
                Years (QALY), when evaluating air pollution policies. The theory 
                behind QALY is that the value of saving someone's life should 
                be adjusted downward the older and more infirm he or she gets. 
                But the theory behind QALY conflicts with more valid empirical 
                studies that show that as people get older they do not value their 
                lives any less than they did when they were younger. In any case, 
                it is objectionable on its face if one believes in equal protection 
                for all members of society. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More recently, 
                Graham and OMB have proposed fundamental changes to the guidelines 
                that agencies follow when conducting their reviews of the costs 
                and benefits of regulations. One of the more notable recommended 
                changes would have agencies shift from the standard statistical 
                measure for the value of a life to a different concept, the Value 
                of a Statistical Life-Year (VSLY). Like QALY, the concept of VSLY 
                is biased against the elderly because it lowers the value of saving 
                a life based largely on the numbers of years a person has left 
                to live. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seniors are 
                not the only people whose lives would be cheapened by the Bush 
                administration's new approach. Other administration techniques 
                could apply to everyone. They include selectively excluding studies 
                that heighten the estimate of people's willingness to pay for 
                protection (in this case wage-risk studies) and discounting the 
                value of saving people from cancer and other kinds of illnesses 
                that are not immediately fatal. The administration also is only 
                considering alternative techniques that would lower the value 
                of life instead of approaches that might raise the standard estimate, 
                such as shifting from assessments based on a current "willingness 
                to pay" for safeguards to approaches based on a "willingness-to-accept" 
                harms or risks. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The blatant 
                one-sidedness of the administration's approach reveals its intention 
                to only use methods that ratchet down the value of life to reduce 
                the perceived benefits of regulation, and thereby minimize the 
                steps industry must take to clean up pollution. Although the EPA 
                claims that it ultimately did not use this biased approach in 
                setting its standard for off-road engines, nothing prevents it 
                from doing so in the future. Indeed the presence of this alternative 
                analysis, however distorted, becomes a convenient hook for legal 
                and legislative action hostile to environment protection. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The implications 
                of discounting lives are quite significant. If, for example, the 
                government decided the value of life is now worth less than a 
                tenth of what is used to be, policymakers could decide to allow 
                10 times as many deaths from environmental pollution -- claiming 
                the "benefits" were unchanged -- to keep costs down for industry. 
                Such a review procedure could block federal agencies from adopting 
                meaningful standards for a range of pollutants, and even set the 
                stage for agencies to weaken effective environmental protections 
                that are already in place. </font>
