- July 9 - Please use the toll-free number and talking points below to call your House member this week and urge him/her to oppose a harmful bill, H.R. 2210. This Head Start reauthorization act transfers control of Head Start programs nationwide to the states. Proposed by Rep. Michael Castle (R-Del.) late in May, the bill would launch a downward spiral in funding and quality for one of the nation's most successful programs for low-income pre-schoolers. Please call 1-888-583-2809 and urge your representative to vote against H.R. 2210. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">H.R. 2210 (deceptively named &quot;The School Readiness Act of 2003&quot;) would limit Head Start's ability to provide high quality child development programs to low-income children by allowing states to determine standards. Because states are in such financial difficulty, it is likely that many will cut services, lay off teachers and raise eligibility standards. The federal requirement that comprehensive services be provided to all Head Start children is an important underpinning in the program's celebrated success. Without this stimulating and nurturing experience, many Head Start children would simply not be ready to learn when they begin grade school. Numerous studies have shown that if a child is not succeeding by the third grade, she/he will continue to fall behind. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Funding under H.R. 2210 is miserably inadequate. The bill does not expand funding to cover the increasing cost of living, to implement advancement of teacher credentialing plans and wages, or to provide services to the many more children and families in need of assistance through Head Start, Early Head Start, and the Indian, Migrant, and Seasonal Head Start programs. Importantly, the bill would do away with Head Start's current provision against employment discrimination on the basis of religion. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Background: </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress is poised and ready to pass H.R. 2210, Head Start Reauthorization. Head Start is currently a federally-run grant program that, at the local level, provides low-income preschool children and their families with early childhood education and comprehensive services, including health, nutrition, parental involvement, social and other services, and it prohibits discrimination in hiring and providing services. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 22, Rep. Michael Castle (R-Del.), chair of the Subcommittee on Education Reform of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, proposed H.R. 2210&#151;another effort on the part of right-wing Republicans to continue shredding the social safety net for low income families. On June 12, the subcommittee passed an alternate version of the bill with additional amendments. On June 19, the committee passed the final bill (27-20) in a mostly party-line vote. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Head Start is a unique and effective program that supports low-income children and families and has been in operation since 1965. Since its inception, Head Start has helped over 20 million children succeed in school and, consequently, beyond. Under Bush&#146;s proposal, H.R. 2210 would dismantle the comprehensive and effective approach employed by Head Start and change the program's scope to only focus, narrowly, on education. Responsibility for the program would transfer from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to the U.S. Department of Education. This shift in accountability expresses a profound contradiction to the very basis of Head Start&#151;to provide health, nutrition, and social services that ensure a child is ready and able to learn. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The original Head Start allows federal grants to bypass the state and go directly to the local level to be implemented. Similarly, Head Start has federal performance standards. H.R. 2210 will allow control of funding to go through the state level, thus permitting the state to determine its own standards, in addition to allowing states to eliminate comprehensive services like health, nutrition, and social services. Unfortunately, Head Start funding will offer states fiscal relief from their already tightly stretched budgets. There is no guarantee that states will allocate Head Start funding to appropriate programs. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, H.R. 2210 will exchange standardized testing for federal quality standards. In essence, this reflects Bush's sheer unwillingness to support effective and long-term strategies that help families raise themselves out of poverty. Many educators believe that this type of testing is based on a false assumption that children from low-income families can and should perform as well as those from higher incomes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">House Republican leaders will likely attempt to push through H.R. 2210 as soon as possible. Please call your representative now. To reach your member and urge opposition to H.R. 2210, call (888) 583-2809 this week between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. This toll-free number is operational during the entire week of July 7 or until the vote has taken place. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Talking Points for Your Phone Message: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please do not support any legislation that dismantles the Head Start structure. Head Start is a unique and effective program that provides necessary support to low-income children and their families. Please vote against H.R. 2210. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Head Start is a program has proven itself successful time and time again. H.R. 2210 would allow states to undermine the quality and reach of a valuable program that has bettered the lives of over 20 million children since its creation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please ensure that Head Start will continue to provide comprehensive services such as health, nutrition, and social services and that federal funds are used to maintain high standards. I strongly urge you to vote against H.R. 2210 and look forward to hearing from you on this issue.</font></p>
