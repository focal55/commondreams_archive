                - April 8 - Today, Ralph Nader and the sports industry watchdog 
                League of Fans sent a letter to high school basketball star LeBron 
                James asking him to advocate for sweatshop eradication measures 
                in his anticipated endorsement contract with either Nike or Adidas. 
                The letter follows: </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mr. James: 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congratulations 
                on your outstanding accomplishments as both a student and an athlete 
                at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is widely 
                assumed that you will be declaring for the NBA draft in the coming 
                months and are projected by most commentators to be the number 
                one pick. With all of your potential both on and off the court, 
                some have even labeled you as the "next Michael Jordan." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While any basketball 
                player would revel in having their playing ability compared to 
                Michael Jordan's, we would like to take this opportunity to request 
                that you separate yourself from Michael Jordan in an area where 
                he has fallen markedly short. Mr. Jordan has always had the chance 
                to use his influence to do something wonderful for the well-being 
                of human beings in Nike's sweatshops (overseas factories where 
                workers are subject to extreme exploitation) whose work has helped 
                make him a multi-millionaire. He chooses not to support justice 
                for those people. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With your anticipated 
                endorsement contract with either Nike or Adidas, you have the 
                chance to do what Michael Jordan should have done and use your 
                cultural status to help make the world a better place by helping 
                to stop the use of sweatshop labor in the sports shoe and sports 
                apparel industry. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nike and Adidas 
                (along with Reebok) are synonymous with sweatshops in Third-World 
                countries. Their products, typically manufactured by subcontracted 
                companies, have become symbols of labor rights violations, paltry 
                wages, forced overtime and abuse for hundreds of thousands of 
                workers. And despite pressure from around the world, Nike and 
                Adidas still choose to maximize profits by undermining human rights 
                standards. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It does not 
                matter which of these companies you ultimately choose to endorse, 
                but we ask that you stand up for the people who will be manufacturing 
                the products that will make you a wealthy man. If you demand in 
                your contract, whether it is with Nike or Adidas, that they improve 
                the conditions of the contracted factories that manufacture their 
                products and that you have power to influence and review the working 
                conditions for those who make the products you endorse, it will 
                pressure the entire sports shoe and apparel industry to change. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some refer 
                to Michael Jordan as the "king of sweatshops" for being the world's 
                most successful salesman of sweatshop-made shoes. As New York 
                Times columnist Harvey Araton wrote in September 2001, "No one 
                has ever confused you, Michael, with Muhammed Ali or Martina Navratilova 
                or Arthur Ashe. With your icon leverage you might have helped 
                convert Nike, the notorious third-world workplace abuser, but 
                you didn't do causes that were not commercials." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the coming 
                weeks and months, you will find yourself in a strong position 
                with the ability to help diminish or even eliminate some sweatshops. 
                As Nike and Adidas compete for your services, we urge you to push 
                for inclusion of as many of the following contract conditions 
                as possible. In their global operations, including those of contractors 
                and subcontractors, Nike/Adidas must: </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) Ensure the 
                enforcement of workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively 
                (unionize) without intimidation. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) Signal to 
                factory owners and governments in supplier countries that enforcement 
                of labor standards, including increased wages, will not lead to 
                relocation in search of even cheaper labor. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3) Ensure that 
                workers are paid living wages which are at least adequate to meet 
                the basic needs of family and allow a small amount of discretionary 
                income. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4) Ensure that 
                workplaces are safe and healthy, eliminating exposure to toxic 
                chemicals, providing adequate personal protective equipment and 
                protecting workers from dangerous machinery. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5) Ensure that 
                workers are not forced or coerced into working unreasonably long 
                hours and that workers can obtain sick leave. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6) Ensure that 
                workers are free from physical and verbal abuse, intimidation 
                and sexual harassment. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7) Secure the 
                protection of workers who speak out or blow-the-whistle on poor 
                factory conditions. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8) Make public 
                the names and locations of all overseas contractors. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9) Work with 
                international unions and human rights organizations to establish 
                a transparent factory monitoring program that is verified by credible 
                organizations which are completely independent of the companies 
                themselves and involve unannounced factory visits. (Such a program 
                was created by United Students Against Sweatshops, an organization 
                of college students and community members at over 200 college 
                campuses across the country. They developed the Worker Rights 
                Consortium (WRC) in 2000 to verify and inspect conditions in factories 
                producing apparel for colleges and universities and to ensure 
                that the apparel of WRC member schools (112 and growing) are not 
                made in sweatshops.) </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10) Guarantee, 
                with confirmation from an independent organization through a transparent 
                factory monitoring program, that any product that uses the "LeBron 
                James" name or likeness meets the conditions negotiated initially. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If Nike or 
                Adidas were to meet these demands, the lives of hundreds of thousands 
                of people would be improved immediately. You will have your greatest 
                leverage to push the companies to meet as many of these conditions 
                as possible during your contract negotiations with them. It is 
                then that you can best seek legally binding, written commitments. 
                If you proceed to advocate for as much of this sweatshop eradication 
                agenda as possible, you would be respected throughout the world 
                for not just your ability to play basketball, but for your generosity 
                as a human being in doing your part to make the world a better 
                place. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is of 
                course a lot to ask of a young man. But you are on the verge of 
                choosing to immerse yourself in the world of international commerce, 
                which inevitably brings with it a wide array of complicated and 
                difficult challenges and decisions. Moreover, in choosing to leverage 
                your power to diminish the evils of sweatshops, you can call not 
                just on the talents of your agent and legal representatives, but 
                a vast array of experts and activists who have visited sweatshops 
                around the world, carefully documented conditions in these facilities, 
                lobbied tirelessly for the major athletic shoe, clothing and equipment 
                makers to respect basic working conditions, and who have established 
                bona fide and independent mechanisms to monitor workplace conditions. 
                These experts and activists, many little older than yourself, 
                would be thrilled to assist you in the effort to ensure respect 
                for the basic rights of workers in athletic shoe, clothing and 
                equipment factories around the world. </font>
