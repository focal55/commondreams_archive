                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Encon Environmental 
                Services of El Paso, Texas; Encon's owners, Roberto Loya of El 
                Paso and Jesus Audelio Uribe Franco of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico; 
                Victor Manuel Arroyo Balderas, warehouse coordinator of Encon, 
                Raul Chavez Beltran; and Ramon Martinez Altamirano of El Paso, 
                Texas; were named in an indictment, unsealed on Feb. 13 in U.S. 
                District Court for the Western District of Texas in El Paso. Loya, 
                Altamirano, Franco and Balderas were subsequently arrested. The 
                indictment charges violations of the Resource Conservation and 
                Recovery Act when the five men and Encon participated in a scheme 
                resulting in the illegal importation of hazardous waste into the 
                United States. The indictment alleges Encon, Beltran and Franco 
                developed a business relationship, in about 1995, with Loya to 
                illegally import hazardous wastes, including soil contaminated 
                with mercury, into the United States without a permit. Altamirano 
                and Balderas allegedly supported the illegal operation. The defendants 
                allegedly informed companies that had hired Encon to dispose of 
                hazardous wastes that the wastes were being disposed of in a legal 
                manner. Instead, the charges state that the wastes were illegally 
                stored in a warehouse in El Paso. Failing to properly dispose 
                of mercury- containing wastes can lead to human contact with mercury 
                which, in sufficient amounts, can cause brain damage and other 
                illnesses. The case was investigated by the EPA Criminal Investigation 
                Division Dallas Area Office, the Texas Commission on Environmental 
                Quality, and the Texas Environmental Task Force. It is being prosecuted 
                by the U.S. Attorney's Office in El Paso. An indictment is merely 
                an accusation, and all defendants are presumed innocent unless 
                or until proven guilty in a court of law. </font>

                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gary Wasserson 
                was indicted on Feb. 13 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern 
                District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia for allegedly violating 
                the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Wasserson was owner 
                of the now closed Chief Executive Officer of Sterling Supply Co. 
                in Philadelphia, Pa., which provided dry cleaning supplies to 
                Philadelphia-area dry cleaning stores. While in operation Sterling 
                Supply accumulated hundreds of drums and containers of chemicals 
                such as acetone, sodium perborate tetrahydrate, sodium hydrosulfite, 
                isopropanol, tetrachloroethylene (also known as perchloroethylene 
                or perc), methylene chloride, xylene, and naphalene. These chemicals 
                are toxic and/or flammable and present hazards to those who unknowingly 
                came into contact with them. The government charges Wasserson 
                illegally transported and disposed of the chemicals stored at 
                the Sterling Supply facility in 1999, by sending them to the Girard 
                Point Transfer Station in Philadelphia from where they were taken 
                to the Modern Landfill in York, Pa. Improperly landfilling of 
                toxic chemicals can contaminate ground water and make it unfit 
                for human consumption. If convicted, Wasserson could receive a 
                maximum sentence of up to 12 years in prison and/or a fine of 
                up to $150,000. The case was investigated by the Philadelphia 
                Area Office of the EPA Criminal Investigation Division and by 
                the FBI. It is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's office 
                in Philadelphia. An indictment is merely an accusation and all 
                defendants are presumed innocent unless or until proven guilty 
                in a court of law. </font>

                MEN INDICTED AND ARRESTED FOR FAILURE TO DISCLOSE LEAD PAINT </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thomas F. Sailor 
                of O'Fallon, Mo., and Marco Webster of St. Louis, Mo., were each 
                indicted on Feb. 12 and were arrested Feb. 19. The charges are 
                they both violated the Toxic Substances Control Act by failing 
                to disclose lead-based paint to home buyers and charges they falsified 
                lead paint disclosure forms. Exposure to chips and dust from lead-based 
                paint can produce neurological damage and other diseases so disclosing 
                the presence of lead-based paint to home buyers is required by 
                federal law. The risk of exposure to lead is especially high among 
                small children who can experience significant delays in mental 
                development and may even die when they are exposed to lead as 
                they crawl and play on the floor. If convicted on all counts, 
                each defendant faces a maximum sentence of up to six years in 
                prison and/or a potential fine of more than $250,000. Charges 
                were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District 
                of Missouri in St. Louis. The case was investigated by the St. 
                Louis Area Office of EPA's Criminal Investigation Division, the 
                EPA Region 7 Office of Inspector General and the City of St. Louis 
                Division of Health. It is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's 
                Office in St. Louis. An indictment is merely an accusation and 
                all defendants are presumed innocent unless or until proven guilty 
                in a court of law. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Administrator 
                Christie Whitman recognized 37 new members of the Performance 
                Track program. The program is a voluntary partnership program 
                with public and private entities that go beyond compliance with 
                environmental regulations and commit to continual environmental 
                improvement over the next three years. Facilities recognized in 
                this program consistently meet their legal requirements, implement 
                environmental management systems, voluntarily achieve environmental 
                improvements beyond compliance, and report on progress. Launched 
                in June 2000, Performance Track now has quickly grown and now 
                has a total of 304 members. This round of Performance Track members 
                includes the first port facility, the Port of Houston; the first 
                jet manufacturer, Dassault Falcon Jet Corp; and the first concrete 
                manufacturing facility, Lafarge Alpharetta Ready Mix. EPA also 
                welcomes seven small businesses, one federal facility and additional 
                facilities from already-represented organizations, such as International 
                Paper, Baxter International Inc., Dupont, Arizona Chemical, Dana 
                Spicer, Lockheed Martin, Sony, Bridgestone-Firestone, Motorola, 
                Pfizer, 3M and NASA. Individual facilities commit to specific 
                environmental improvements, examples of this include: a 64 percent 
                reduction in Volatile Organic Compound emissions by 2005; a 50 
                percent reduction in water use that will save 20 million gallons 
                per year; and recycling and reduced energy consumption commitments.
