- May 1 - Nearly half the American 
population-more than 137 million Americans-continues to breathe 
unhealthy amounts of the toxic air pollutant ozone (smog), 
according to the American Lung Association State of the Air: 2003 
report released today. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The annual report cites that moderate improvements in smog 
levels are due to a break from summer heat, not air pollution 
cleanup activities, further illustrating the urgency for Americans 
to fight for cleaner air in the face of potentially devastating 
changes in the nation's environmental policies. The Lung 
Association anticipates increasing numbers in its 2004 report, 
which will include data from the hot 2002 summer. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report was released in the shadow of the Administration's 
rollback of key Clean Air Act provisions and additional proposals 
that would weaken public health protections of that law, thereby 
denying tens of millions of Americans healthy air for the 
foreseeable future. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Lung Association urges Americans to contact members 
of Congress to oppose any bills that would weaken the Clean Air Act 
and to contact EPA by May 3, 2003 to oppose the proposed changes 
that would weaken the New Source Review provisions. Americans can 
log on to <a href="http://www.lungusa.org" target="_new">http://www.lungusa.org</a> to make their voice heard to 
Congress and EPA on these critical issues. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Four years into the American Lung Association State of the Air 
reports, where we've analyzed data since the mid-1990s, we can 
point to no significant ozone improvements other than a few lucky 
changes in the weather," said John Kirkwood, president and chief 
executive officer of the American Lung Association. "We can't 
depend on Mother Nature to protect Americans from disease and death 
caused by breathing human-made smog. It's time to fight for our 
right to breathe clean air and for America to solve the air 
pollution problems that Americans create." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The release of the American Lung Association State of the Air: 
2003 also marks the beginning of the annual ozone season, when the 
summer heat traditionally causes smog levels to rise across the 
nation. The report examines ozone air quality data for 1999-2001, 
which are the most recent quality-assured data from the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The report grades and ranks 
counties on how often their air quality reaches "unhealthful" 
categories of the EPA's Air Quality Index for ozone air pollution. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the fourth consecutive year, four California metropolitan 
areas-Los Angeles, Fresno, Bakersfield, and 
Visalia-Tulare-Porterville-top the list of America's smoggiest 
cities, followed by Houston-Galveston-Brazoria, Texas. Rounding out 
the top 10 most ozone-polluted cities list are Sacramento-Yolo and 
Merced, Calif. and three Southeastern locales-Atlanta, Ga., 
Knoxville, Tenn., and the Charlotte, N.C. metropolitan areas. The 
report found that over half-55.5 percent-of counties with ozone 
monitors received an "F" rating. While this year's report includes 
data from 14 additional counties, only five million fewer Americans 
live in counties that received an "F," compared with the 2002 
report. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We see a tiny dip in the number of Americans directly affected 
by ozone, but at these huge numbers, it's insignificant," said 
Kirkwood. "Smog control has been held up for years, and now we risk 
losing some important tools we have in the Clean Air Act that are 
based on protecting our health. In the meantime, kids with asthma 
and people with any lung disease run a very real risk of suffering 
respiratory problems from breathing ozone. Even healthy, active 
adults can find it hard to breathe." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Threats to the Clean Air Act -- 
The American Lung Association's report cites two administration 
initiatives that would repeal, weaken, and delay Clean Air Act 
safeguards: regulatory changes that roll back the "New Source 
Review" safeguards, and the administration's proposed legislative 
air pollution plan, unconvincingly called the Clear Skies 
Initiative. Compounding years of legal issues that have stalled 
full implementation of the Clean Air Act, these actions would 
cripple the Act, prohibiting or delaying measures intended to 
protect public health. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In February 2003, the American Lung Association, as part of an 
environmental coalition, filed a lawsuit against EPA for adopting 
illegal changes to New Source Review, a provision of the Clean Air 
Act that requires approximately 17,000 of the nation's oldest and 
dirtiest power plants, oil refineries and other industrial 
facilities to meet emissions standards applicable to new facilities 
by installing up-to-date-pollution control devices whenever the 
plants make changes that increase pollution. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Trying to drastically weaken New Source Review is the tip of 
the iceberg of policy changes that would weaken the core of the 
Clean Air Act, which has helped protect public health for 40 
years," said Kirkwood. "We are at risk of losing major advances in 
our nation's air quality to politics. Clean air is a health issue 
and is being tossed aside to benefit industry-our biggest source of 
outdoor air pollution." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration's legislative air pollution plan would hurt 
public health and help big polluters by delaying and diluting cuts 
in power plants' sulfur, nitrogen and mercury pollution compared to 
timely enforcement of current law. The administration plan would 
roll back the current law's public health safeguards to protect 
local air quality, curb pollution from upwind states and protect 
our national parks. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The American Lung Association has fought for clean air for 30 
years, and we will continue to defend the strongest tool we 
have--the Clean Air Act--until we achieve cleaner, healthy air for 
all Americans," said Kirkwood. "The relationship between air 
pollution and lung disease is undeniable. That's why clean air 
remains a priority goal for the American Lung Association." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- American Lung Association State of the Air: 2003 Report 
Highlights -- 
Ninety-three counties' ratings improved by at least one grade 
since last year's report, while 26 counties received lower grades 
this year. Only two cities-Redding, Calif., and Chattanooga, 
Tenn.-stepped off last year's list of most ozone-polluted cities; 
both, however, maintained their F grades despite the change in 
ranking. Six counties-Blount, Tenn., Douglas, Ga., Knox, Tenn., 
Fayette, Ga., Maricopa, Ariz., and Wake, N.C.-were deleted from 
this year's list of the 25 most ozone-polluted counties, replaced 
by Nevada, Calif., Placer, Calif., Tarrant, Texas, Henry, Ga., 
Camden, N.J., and Hartford, Md. Of the newcomers, only Camden 
County, N.J. has ever been on this list before. Louisville, Ky. and 
Allentown-Bethlehem-Eaton, Pa. are newcomers to the nation's top 25 
smoggiest metropolitan areas since last year. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 7.4 million adults with asthma and nearly two million 
children suffering from asthma attacks live in counties that 
received an "F" grade in ozone air pollution. Those totals 
represent 70 percent of the 10.6 million American adults with 
asthma and 69 percent of the 2.8 million children who have had an 
asthma attack and live in counties with an ozone monitor. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Lung Association State of the Air: 2003 report also 
presents new analyses of regional ozone sources and trends, as well 
as examining ozone transport-the pollutants being carried by 
winds-that leads to unhealthy smog levels even in regions where 
smog is not actually created. Ozone not only moves into a state 
from the outside but also moves within the state. Some air 
pollution episodes have been followed hour-by-hour as they move 
city-by-city within a state. In many cases, the highest levels of 
ozone will show up in suburban areas downwind of larger 
communities. Some regions, including the Southeast and Midwest, are 
notable as sources of transported ozone affecting cities and states 
within the region and outside it; they lead the nation in emissions 
of both volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides-the two 
essential groups of gases required to make ozone. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- About Ozone -- 
Ozone is a highly reactive form of oxygen that results primarily 
from the action of sunlight on hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, 
which are emitted in a variety of activities, especially fuel 
combustion. Ozone levels typically rise between May and October 
when higher temperatures and increased amounts of sunlight combine 
with stagnant atmospheric conditions that are associated with smog 
episodes. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even relatively low ozone levels can affect healthy people's 
ability to breathe, leading to shortness of breath, chest pain when 
inhaling deeply, wheezing and coughing. Long-term exposure can 
result in reduced breathing ability and increases the risk of 
respiratory disease later in life. Children, the elderly and 
individuals with chronic lung disease, such as asthma, are at 
greatest risk of breathing problems from ozone exposure. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We had made great progress through the 1980s in reducing smog, 
but unhealthy ozone levels actually increased in some regions 
during the '90s," said Kirkwood. "We need to make major policy 
changes that will have a long-term, positive impact on our smog 
problem." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- What Americans Can Do -- 
"Americans' right to breathe clean air is being threatened," 
said Kirkwood. "We need individuals to fight for the Clean Air Act, 
support New Source Review, and oppose efforts that benefit big 
polluters and harm public health." 
</font>
