- July 16 - The East Timor Action Network (ETAN) and the Indonesia 
Human Rights Network (IHRN)today praised the U.S. House of Representatives 
for reinstating a ban on military training for Indonesia.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The amendment to the State Department FY2004-2005 Authorizations bill (H.R. 
1950), which passed today, would restrict International Military Education 
and Training (IMET) for Indonesia until President Bush certifies that 
Indonesia is &quot;taking effective measures&quot; to fully investigate and 
criminally prosecute those responsible for the August 31, 2002 attack on ten U.S. citizens murdering two school teachers, in  Timika, Papua (see 
below). Indonesian police and NGO investigations have strongly implicated 
the Indonesian military (TNI) in the attack.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While praising the action, the two groups urged Congress to expand the 
conditions on resumption of IMET.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Indonesia must understand that Congress takes an attack on U.S. citizens very seriously.  Restrictions on U.S. military assistance should also 
acknowledge escalating assaults on the rights of others in the Indonesian 
archipelago,&quot; said Kurt Biddle, Coordinator of IHRN. &quot;Instead of freeingpolitical prisoners, another past Congressional condition, Indonesia hasslapped stiff prison sentences on political activists such as Muhammad Nazar, who was given five years earlier this month.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Many past Congressional conditions, including accountability for past 
rights violations in East Timor and Indonesia, and transparency in the 
military budget, have never been met,&quot; said Karen Orenstein, Washington 
Coordinator of ETAN. &quot;Now, a massive military assault is now being 
perpetrated against the people of Aceh - replete with extra-judicial 
executions, torture, rape, and massive displacement - utilizing 
U.S.-supplied weapons.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a nearly identical provision 
last May.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House amendment originated from Rep. Joel Hefley (R-CO) and was offered 
as part of an en bloc amendment by Chairman Henry Hyde (R-IL).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Language in the bill also condemns Indonesia's failure to hold accountable members of its security forces for crimes against humanity committed in 
East Timor and &quot;expresses concern that members of the Indonesian security 
forces continue to commit many serious human rights violations, 
particularly in areas of conflict,&quot; including Aceh and Papua (see below).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush administration has pushed for resumption of military ties withIndonesia in the name of fighting the 'War on Terror,'&quot; said Kurt Biddle of 
IHRN. &quot;Currently, it is the Indonesian military terrorizing the people of 
Aceh and elsewhere.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senior Bush administration officials reportedly have decided to release 
funds for IMET for Indonesia for this fiscal year, but the administration 
must first &quot;consult&quot; with Congress before obligating the money; these 
meetings have not yet taken place. See <a href="http://etan.org/action/issues/miltie.htm" target="_new">here</a>  for additional background.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ETAN advocates for democracy, sustainable development, justice and humanrights, including women's rights, for the people of East Timor. ETAN calls 
for an international tribunal to prosecute crimes against humanity that 
took place in East Timor since 1975.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IHRN is a U.S.-based grassroots organization working to educate and 
activate the American public and influence U.S. foreign policy and 
international economic interests to support democracy, demilitarization,</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and justice through accountability and rule of law in Indonesia. IHRN works 
with and advocates on behalf of people throughout the Indonesian 
archipelago to strengthen civil society.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1950
BY MR. HEFLEY</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CONDITION ON THE PROVISION OF CERTAIN FUNDS TO INDONESIA.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(a) CONDITION ON ASSISTANCE.Subject to sub-section (c), no funds made 
available under section 23 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C.
2763) 
or chapter 5 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C.2347 et seq.) in fiscal year 2004, other than funds made available for 
expanded military education and training under such chapter, may be 
available for a program that involves the Government of Indonesia or the Indonesian Armed Forces until the President makes the certification 
described in subsection (b).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(b) CERTIFICATION.The certification referred to in subsection (a) is a certification submitted by the President to the appropriate congressional
committees that the Government of Indonesia and the Indonesian Armed Forces 
are taking effective measures, including cooperating with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(1) to conduct a full investigation of the attack on United States citizens 
in West Papua, Indonesia on August 31, 2002; and</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(2) to criminally prosecute the individuals responsible for such attack.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(c) LIMITATION.Nothing in this section shall prohibit the United States 
Government from continuing to conduct programs or training with the 
Indonesian Armed Forces, including counterterrorism training, officer 
visits, port visits, or educational exchanges that are being con ducted on 
the date of the enactment of this Act.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">---------</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SUBTITLE B--OTHER MATTERS</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SEC. 721. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO EAST TIMOR, JUSTICE, AND 
REHABILITATION.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This provision expresses a the sense of Congress regarding the ongoing need 
for justice related to crimes committed by the Indonesian military and 
Indonesian supported militias in East Timor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Committee supports efforts by East Timor's Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation to consolidate peace and reconciliation and 
encourages the President to expeditiously assist in the provision of 
information requested in the January 24, 2003 letter from the Commission.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Committee supports the extension of the mandate of the joint UN-East Timor Serious Crimes Investigation Unit and the Special Panel for Serious 
Crimes beyond May 2004 to pursue justice and avoid a backlog of cases 
lacking investigation and trials.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Committee encourages the UN and Indonesian authorities to continue to 
resolve the situation of the approximately 28,000 East Timorese remaining 
in Indonesia. In light of the recent resumption of killings and other 
crimes in East Timor by militia members based in Indonesia it is particularly urgent that the remnants of militia organizations be quickly 
removed from the border area. It is also important to provide decent 
humanitarian conditions and to ensure freedom of choice in repatriation and 
resettlement, particularly for those who may still be subject to 
intimidation by militia organizations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SEC. 722. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING HUMAN RIGHTS AND JUSTICE IN INDONESIA.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This section expresses concern that members of the Indonesian security 
forces continue to commit many serious human rights violations, 
particularly in areas of conflict such as Aceh, Papua, the Moluccas, and Central Sulawesi. It also expresses other concerns in the region.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Committee urges every effort be made to salvage the Framework Agreement 
on Cessation of Hostilities in Aceh (COHA). The Administration should 
strongly urge the Indonesian Government and military to halt the presentbuild-up of troops and military equipment in Aceh and to abandon plans for 
intensified military operations in Aceh, and press the Indonesian 
Government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) to resume talks within the 
framework of COHA, so as to bring about a reduction in the level of armed 
conflict in Aceh.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Committee is deeply concerned by reports of an Indonesian military campaign targeting civilians in the Central Highlands of Papua, which 
reportedly includes the burning of villages and torture and killing of 
detainees. The Committee notes the lack of justice in the trial for the 
murder of Papuan civic leader Theys Eluay, which was treated as an ordinary 
crime rather than a political killing, and which has resulted only in very 
lenient sentences for low-ranking Special Forces (Kopassus) officers. The 
Committee also has concerns regarding the Presidential Decree of January 2003, which, over objections from people within Papua, would divide Papua 
into three provinces, in violation of the government's own Special Autonomy 
Law for Papua.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Committee expresses concern over assistance for the Indonesian 
military, including the provision of International Military Education and 
Training, because of human rights abuses linked to the military and especially because the case involving the killing of two U.S. citizens and 
one Indonesian citizen and the wounding of others in the Timika area of 
Papua on August 31, 2002 remains unresolved. The Committee contests that military assistance, if given, should be contingent on a the release of a 
transparent budget audit of the Indonesian military, an end of resistance 
to the principle of civilian control, an improved record with respect to human rights abuses carried out by the military as noted in the State 
Department's Human Rights Report, and the ability of the government to hold 
security forces accountable for crimes against humanity in East Timor and 
serious crimes elsewhere in Indonesia.</font></p>
