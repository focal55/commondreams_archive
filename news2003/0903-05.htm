- September 2 - New documents shed light on how special interests have driven the decision to award Boeing a leasing deal that will cost $5.7 billion more than purchasing tanker planes outright, according to<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=4494&sequence=0" target="_new"> figures issued by the Congressional Budget Office</a> last week. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The documents released by Senator John McCain and <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/030908/biztech/8boeing.htm" target="_new">reported on by U.S. News and World Report </a> show a well-orchestrated effort between the Air Force and Boeing effort to promote the deal. The Air Force is &quot;desperately looking for the rationale for why the USAF should pursue the 767 Tanker now,&quot; wrote a Boeing executive in a September, 2002 email included in the packet of documents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An October 4, 2001 <a href="http://www.pogo.org/m/cp/cp-dicks-10042001.pdf" target="_new">letter to President Bush</a> from Washington State Representative Norman Dicks makes the case for including the leasing deal in the Administration&#146;s post-September 11th economic stimulus package. The timing of the letter came several months before the leasing deal provision was attached to the Defense Department budget by Washington Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter underscores how Boeing&#146;s supposed failing business operation was the original driving force behind the leasing deal proposal &#150; rather than national security needs as the Air Force, Boeing, and other deal promoters now claim. Representative Dicks writes &#147;I believe that the Administration&#146;s economic stimulus package should include at least $2.5 billion for the purchase or lease of these aircraft in the Defense Department&#146;s portion of the legislation.&#148; In 2002, Boeing was ranked 24th in profits out of the top 500 companies, according to Forbes Magazine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.pogo.org/p/contracts/ca-030103-c17.html" target="_new">Other documents show the key role</a> that former Air Force executive Darlene Druyun played in organizing the deal. Darlene Druyun took a lucrative position at Boeing shortly after her efforts on the leasing deal as well as on a failed attempt to give Boeing $200 million annually in subsidies for the military C-17 airlifter program.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is anticipated that the Senate Armed Services Committee, the last of four committees with jurisdiction, will approve the leasing deal this Thursday, September 4. The <a href="http://commerce.senate.gov/hearings/witnesslist.cfm?id=908" target="_new">Senate Commerce will hold hearings</a> tomorrow on the deal at which POGO&#146;s Eric Miller will testify.  A copy of Eric Miller&#146;s testimony is pasted below.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Testimony of Eric Miller, Senior Defense Investigator, Project On Government Oversight, on Proposed KC-767A Tanker Lease, before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, September 3, 2003:</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I want to thank you for asking me to testify today on an Air Force proposal to lease 100 wide-body Boeing tanker aircraft &#150; a proposal we believe is ill-advised for both the Pentagon and the taxpayers. The Project On Government Oversight (POGO) investigates, exposes, and seeks to remedy systemic abuses of power, mismanagement, and subservience by the federal government to powerful special interests. Founded in 1981, POGO is a politically-independent, nonprofit watchdog that strives to promote a government that is accountable to the citizenry.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more than a year, POGO has conducted an ongoing in-depth study into the tanker lease proposal. In May 2002, we issued a critical report on the tanker lease idea, &#147;Fill &#146;Er Up: Back-Door Deal for Boeing Will Leave the Taxpayer on Empty.&#148; Only last week, we sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee urging the committee to reject the proposal. Also, we have formally joined with such other public watchdog groups including Americans for Tax Reform, Taxpayers for Common Sense, and Common Cause in calling for an end to the deal. We hope the members of this committee will join in our fight to put an end to the unneeded and overpriced tanker lease. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Since we issued our report last year, the Air Force and some Members of Congress have continued a full-court press to secure funding for the tanker lease. It has become increasing clear that the costly lease proposal has little to do with helping the nation's fighting men and women, and everything to do with padding the bottom line of an already prosperous defense contractor. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lease idea that clearly began as a gift to Boeing has suspiciously morphed into a manufactured tanker shortage crisis. The deal was originally pitched by a few Members of Congress as a financial aid package of sorts for Boeing, a contractor that was ranked  15th in sales and 38th in profits on the 2003 Forbes magazine list. The company&#146;s rankings in sales and profits actually rose after 9/11. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of those Members of Congress doing the pitching for Boeing was Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington, who wrote a letter to President Bush on October 4, 2001, using the tragic events of 9/11 as an excuse for promoting this bad deal.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;While we have promptly approved legislation that provides direct assistance to U.S. airlines, providing critical financial stability at this time, we have thus far not addressed the downstream impacts of this crisis, including the loss of work at Boeing,&#148; Dicks wrote. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The tragic events of 9/11 should not be used as an excuse to discard common sense.      </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then after it became clear that the lease was more expensive than an outright buy, Pentagon spin doctors began telling Congress a different story &#150; the converted B-767 aircraft were urgently needed to replace an aging fleet of KC-135 tankers, a claim that has not been well supported.   </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, evidence against the lease idea has been mounting. In a report issued last week the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) became the latest government financial agency to join the chorus of critical voices. In fact, the CBO concluded in a damaging assessment that the proposed lease &#147;would essentially be a purchase of the tankers by the federal government, but at a cost greater than would be incurred under the normal appropriation and procurement process.&#148; The CBO also said the proposed lease does not meet the conditions for an operating lease as required by Office of Management and Budget rules. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Others, including the General Accounting Office, Office of Management and Budget, Congressional Research Service, and DoD contractor the Institute for Defense Analysis, all have suggested that leasing the tanker aircraft would be far more costly than purchasing them. </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is another problem. The federal government should not reward contractors with such extraordinary handouts who do not have a record of &quot;integrity and business ethics.&quot; Three Boeing space subsidiaries recently were suspended after an Air Force investigation revealed that Boeing was in possession of thousands of pages of Lockheed Martin's proprietary documents. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A POGO study documented 50 instances of misconduct or alleged misconduct by Boeing since 1990. Indeed, POGO&#146;s investigation shows that as recently as March 2003 Boeing agreed to an $18 million settlement with the government for alleged violation of the arms control act and international traffic in arms regulations.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rather than sweetheart deals, we should be looking at suspending repeat corporate offenders from future contracts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
In response to criticism of the deal, Air Force officials, attempting to capitalize on Congressional support for new procurement funding, have only muddied the waters with distorted facts and contradictory financial projections. Yet, they too have also admitted that the lease would cost more than a purchase of the tankers. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, copies of email communications between Boeing and Air Force officials made public by the Senate Commerce Committee last week point to an improper &#150; if not outright illegal &#150; cozy relationship between the defense contractor and the Pentagon. The emails suggest that the Air Force went to Boeing for ideas on how to sell the tanker lease rather than letting the facts speak for themselves. In a September 18, 2002 email between two Boeing executives one told the other that the Air Force was &#147;desperately looking for the rationale for why the USAF should pursue the 767 Tanker NOW.&#148;    </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another email even suggested that the Air Force&#146;s former acquisition chief, Darleen Druyun, shared Airbus prices with Boeing officials before she left to go work for Boeing. This unnatural closeness between contractor and the Air Force should be further investigated before the government enters into any formal lease or purchase agreement for new tankers.  </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clearly, tanker aircraft play a vital role in the mission of the U.S. military, but the Air Force has failed to provide evidence that the KC-135 fleet is in urgent need of replacement. To the contrary, a May 2002 General Accounting Office preliminary study suggested the opposite, that the current fleet can be re-engined and updated to serve the military's mission until 2040. Air Force officials seemed to support the idea of keeping and renovating the current KC-135 fleet until the lease proposal was dangled in their faces by some Members of Congress eager to curry political contributions from a powerful defense contractor.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the arguments the Air Force makes is that the tankers can somehow be manufactured in a shorter period of time if they are leased. In reality, a leased aircraft is not built any faster. If the need is as critical as the Air Force suggests, then the new tankers should be budgeted for purchase like any other procurement item. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Air Force&#146;s expressed concern over tanker shortages is not credible in light of its decision to decline the purchase of 36 new 767 tankers two years ago at a considerably cheaper price.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Simply put, Air Force leaders never said they even needed the tankers until they woke up one morning and saw a pile of money on the table. All of a sudden, they say the KC-135 tanker fleet is plagued with corrosion problems, and have even suggested that the current fleet of tankers is unsafe &#150; even though the KC-135 mishap rate is lower than many other Air Force aircraft. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For several reasons, POGO strongly opposes the lease idea. The CBO analysis claims that over the period of the lease the taxpayers will spend $5.7 billion more to lease the aircraft over the cost of an outright purchase. In all, the CBO estimates the tankers will cost $161 million each if the Air Force exercises an option to purchase the aircraft at the end of the six-year lease period. An independent analysis by DoD contractor the Institute for Defense Analysis concluded that the aircraft should cost considerably less and still provide Boeing with a handsome profit. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the Air Force has just recently complained that its fleet of airborne gas stations is aging, its top brass never requested funding from Congress until recently. The purchase of the 100 tanker aircraft was not even on the Air Forces&#146;s list of top 60 budget priorities last year. The Air Force budget wish list included requests for such areas as bomber and fighter upgrades, aerial drone targets, family housing investment, a new C-130J, and readiness spare parts. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Air Force most recently has claimed that the current tanker fleet is unsafe because of corrosion but offers no specific assessment of the extent of the problem. No wonder: A July 2003 GAO study concluded that there is no way to assess the extent of the corrosion problem because neither the DoD or military services have reliable data. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until recently, the Department of Defense has projected that the tanker fleet could be flown for decades. In fact, General Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that the KC-135 tanker fleet is &quot;relatively healthy&quot; with &quot;lots of flying hours left on them.&quot; The Air Force has not publicly disclosed any studies that contradict Myers statements, and the recent GAO study supported his observations with data supplied by the Air Force. </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;As you know they&#146;ve been re-engined,&#148; Myers said. &#147;We&#146;re putting new avionics in the cockpit. There&#146;s been a lot of work done on those particular aircraft to keep them modern.&#148; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Myers&#146; comments are consistent with the DoD&#146;s official position prior to learning of the lease proposal. In response to GAO criticisms, the DoD told the GAO that its tanker fleet would not need replacing for decades. &#147;While the KC-135 is an average of 35 years old, its airframe hours and cycles are relatively low,&#146;&#146; DoD responded to the 1996 GAO tanker requirements study. &#147;With proper maintenance and upgrades, we believe the aircraft may be sustainable for another 35 years.&#148; </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By latest count, there are 545 KC-135 tankers in the Air Force fleet. Of that total, 134 are older E models and 411 are upgraded R models. The Air Force says it wants to use the 100 leased Boeing tankers to replace 127 of the 134 older E models beginning in 2006. The E models are the oldest and least capable tankers. For that reason, all of the E models currently are assigned to reserve and National Guard air units, while the newer R models are all part of the active Air Force fleet.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the average age of the KC-135s is high, the actual hours of aircraft use are relatively low, according to the GAO. The Air Force itself projects that the E models have a lifetime of 36,000 flying hours and the R models can fly for 39,000 hours. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As of 1995, the GAO says the majority of the KC-135 fleet had logged a total of between 12,000 and 14,000 flight hours. From 1995 to late 2001, the average tanker has averaged about 300 hours a year, bringing the total average hours flown by most of the tankers to roughly 14,000-16,000, or less than half the total expected life of the aircraft. (The average could now be slightly higher because tanker hours have increased slightly since the war in Afghanistan.) By these calculations, not one of the E models, the oldest in the fleet, would reach its limit until 2040, according to the GAO. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even if the Air Force&#146;s recently-crafted claims that there is an urgent need to replace KC-135 E models were true, the GAO says the quickest &#150; and cheapest &#150; solution may be to replace the engines of the older tankers and upgrade to R models at a cost of $29 million each. That means the bill to upgrade all 127 E models otherwise being replaced would only total about $3.6 billion, a mere fraction of the CBO&#146;s $21.5 billion estimate to lease 100 new Boeing 767 aircraft.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even before the release last week of the communications between Boeing and Air Force officials, the tanker lease deal has been a textbook case of bad procurement policy and favoritism to a single defense contractor. The legislative add-on permitting the lease does not even attempt to cover up the acrid smell of back room dealing. It brashly subverts the competitive bidding process by authorizing the Air Force to procure 100 new tankers only if it leases them specifically from Boeing. Boeing could not have structured a better deal had it drawn the lease proposal itself. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This appearance of favoritism was the subject of inquiry at a February 12, 2002, Senate Armed Service Committee hearing on the proposed fiscal year 2003 defense budget. When questioned about the deal, Air Force Secretary James Roche admitted that Air Force officials did not even discuss it with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Armed Services Democratic Committee Chairman Senator Carl Levin, or ranking Committee Republican Senator John Warner. Such communication is customary in the case of large defense appropriations. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the hearing, Roche was asked by Republican Senator John McCain if there had been discussions with Airbus, a division of European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), a Boeing competitor also interested in selling wide-body tankers to the Air Force. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Yes, sir. Back as far as October I made the point that if Airbus could come in and do something, we would be delighted to have that happen,&#148; Roche responded. &#147;...I have met with [EADS Chief Executive Officer] Philippe Camus and have opened up the door for him if he wished to do something.&#148; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;But doesn't the legislation say the loan can only be Boeing 767's?&#148; McCain fired back. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Yes, sir. But if Airbus did something that was particularly good, I would come back to the Congress, sir,&#148; Roche said. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Roche never did get back with Congress on the issue, but apparently was stung by hints of favoritism during the hearing. Only a week later, on February 20, 2002, the Air Force issued a formal Request For Information that gave interested tanker defense contractors only two weeks to submit a complex proposal for the lease of 100 refueling aircraft. Predictably, a cheaper-priced formal proposal by Airbus was rejected, and the Air Force is currently finalizing lease negotiations with Boeing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the leasing of major weapons systems, aircraft, and ships are rare, the Boeing 767 lease proposal is not totally without precedent. It bears a striking resemblance to a handful of long-term lease deals by the Navy to quickly put several dozen tanker ships into commission during the 1970s and 1980s. Although at the time the leases were purported to be cheaper than buying the refueling ships outright, the GAO has since concluded the leases actually resulted in a higher cost to the taxpayers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Since the Navy leases, Congress has increased transparency of long-term leases and tightened the process to evaluate long-term leases of military equipment and weapons. Through a detailed process called &#147;budget scoring,&#148; the military services are now required to assess the cumulative impact of a long-term lease and compare it to the cost of purchasing equipment before Congress agrees to appropriate the funding. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, there is a great danger that the Boeing tanker lease may be a sign of things to come and future leases could become more commonplace. In fact, the idea of leasing major weapons systems in the future has been a goal of the Pentagon since late 2001. In the name of flexibility the DoD has, in effect, declared war on close financial oversight of multi-year leasing of weapons systems, aircraft, and ships. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a 2001 memo, Pentagon Acquisitions Chief E.C. Aldridge, Jr., and DoD Comptroller Dov S. Zakheim announced a new multi-year leasing initiative, instructing key Pentagon officials to help &#147;identify candidate programs for acquisition by means of multi-year leases.&#148; Their memo said that long-term leasing of weapons systems has historically been rare because of statutory and regulatory &#147;impediments.&#148;</font></p>
<p> </p>
