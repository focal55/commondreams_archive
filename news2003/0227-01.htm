                YORK - February 27 - On February 24, Newsweek broke what may be 
                the biggest story of the Iraq crisis. In a revelation that "raises 
                questions about whether the WMD [weapons of mass destruction] 
                stockpiles attributed to Iraq still exist," the magazine's issue 
                dated March 3 reported that the Iraqi weapons chief who defected 
                from the regime in 1995 told U.N. inspectors that Iraq had destroyed 
                its entire stockpile of chemical and biological weapons and banned 
                missiles, as Iraq claims. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until now, 
                Gen. Hussein Kamel, who was killed shortly after returning to 
                Iraq in 1996, was best known for his role in exposing Iraq's deceptions 
                about how far its pre-Gulf War biological weapons programs had 
                advanced. But Newsweek's John Barry-- who has covered Iraqi weapons 
                inspections for more than a decade-- obtained the transcript of 
                Kamel's 1995 debriefing by officials from the International Atomic 
                Energy Agency (IAEA) and the U.N. inspections team known as UNSCOM. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Inspectors 
                were told "that after the Gulf War, Iraq destroyed all its chemical 
                and biological weapons stocks and the missiles to deliver them," 
                Barry wrote. All that remained were "hidden blueprints, computer 
                disks, microfiches" and production molds. The weapons were destroyed 
                secretly, in order to hide their existence from inspectors, in 
                the hopes of someday resuming production after inspections had 
                finished. The CIA and MI6 were told the same story, Barry reported, 
                and "a military aide who defected with Kamel... backed Kamel's 
                assertions about the destruction of WMD stocks." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But these statements 
                were "hushed up by the U.N. inspectors" in order to "bluff Saddam 
                into disclosing still more." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CIA spokesman 
                Bill Harlow angrily denied the Newsweek report. "It is incorrect, 
                bogus, wrong, untrue," Harlow told Reuters the day the report 
                appeared (2/24/03). </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But on Wednesday 
                (2/26/03), a complete copy of the Kamel transcript-- an internal 
                UNSCOM/IAEA document stamped "sensitive"-- was obtained by Glen 
                Rangwala, the Cambridge University analyst who in early February 
                revealed that Tony Blair's "intelligence dossier" was plagiarized 
                from a student thesis. Rangwala has posted the Kamel transcript 
                on the Web: <a href="http://casi.org.uk/info/unscom950822.pdf" target="_new">http://casi.org.uk/info/unscom950822.pdf</a>. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the transcript 
                (p. 13), Kamel says bluntly: "All weapons-- biological, chemical, 
                missile, nuclear, were destroyed." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Who is Hussein 
                Kamel? </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kamel is no 
                obscure defector. A son-in-law of Saddam Hussein, his departure 
                from Iraq carrying crates of secret documents on Iraq's past weapons 
                programs was a major turning point in the inspections saga. In 
                1999, in a letter to the U.N. Security Council (1/25/99), UNSCOM 
                reported that its entire eight years of disarmament work "must 
                be divided into two parts, separated by the events following the 
                departure from Iraq, in August 1995, of Lt. General Hussein Kamel." 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kamel's defection 
                has been cited repeatedly by George W. Bush and leading administration 
                officials as evidence that 1) Iraq has not disarmed; 2) inspections 
                cannot disarm it; and 3) defectors such as Kamel are the most 
                reliable source of information on Iraq's weapons. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Bush declared 
                in an October 7, 2002 speech: "In 1995, after several years of 
                deceit by the Iraqi regime, the head of Iraq's military industries 
                defected. It was then that the regime was forced to admit that 
                it had produced more than 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly 
                biological agents. The inspectors, however, concluded that Iraq 
                had likely produced two to four times that amount. This is a massive 
                stockpile of biological weapons that has never been accounted 
                for, and capable of killing millions." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Secretary 
                of State Colin Powell's February 5 presentation to the U.N. Security 
                Council claimed: "It took years for Iraq to finally admit that 
                it had produced four tons of the deadly nerve agent, VX. A single 
                drop of VX on the skin will kill in minutes. Four tons. The admission 
                only came out after inspectors collected documentation as a result 
                of the defection of Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's late son-in-law." 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* In a speech 
                last August (8/27/02), Vice President Dick Cheney said Kamel's 
                story "should serve as a reminder to all that we often learned 
                more as the result of defections than we learned from the inspection 
                regime itself." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Deputy National 
                Security Advisor Stephen Hadley recently wrote in the Chicago 
                Tribune (2/16/03) that "because of information provided by Iraqi 
                defector and former head of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction 
                programs, Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel, the regime had to admit in detail 
                how it cheated on its nuclear non-proliferation commitments." 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The quotes 
                from Bush and Powell cited above refer to anthrax and VX produced 
                by Iraq before the 1991 Gulf War. The administration has cited 
                various quantities of chemical and biological weapons on many 
                other occasions-- weapons that Iraq produced but which remain 
                unaccounted for. All of these claims refer to weapons produced 
                before 1991. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But according 
                to Kamel's transcript, Iraq destroyed all of these weapons in 
                1991. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 
                Newsweek, Kamel told the same story to CIA analysts in August 
                1995. If that is true, all of these U.S. officials have had access 
                to Kamel's statements that the weapons were destroyed. Their repeated 
                citations of his testimony-- without revealing that he also said 
                the weapons no longer exist-- suggests that the administration 
                might be withholding critical evidence. In particular, it casts 
                doubt on the credibility of Powell's February 5 presentation to 
                the U.N., which was widely hailed at the time for its persuasiveness. 
                To clear up the issue, journalists might ask that the CIA release 
                the transcripts of its own conversations with Kamel. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kamel's disclosures 
                have also been crucial to the arguments made by hawkish commentators 
                on Iraq. The defector has been cited four times on the New York 
                Times op-ed page in the last four months in support of claims 
                about Iraq's weapons programs--never noting his assertions about 
                the elimination of these weapons. In a major Times op-ed calling 
                for war with Iraq (2/21/03), Kenneth Pollack of the Brookings 
                Institution wrote that Kamel and other defectors "reported that 
                outside pressure had not only failed to eradicate the nuclear 
                program, it was bigger and more cleverly spread out and concealed 
                than anyone had imagined it to be." The release of Kamel's transcript 
                makes this claim appear grossly at odds with the defector's actual 
                testimony. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Kamel story 
                is a bombshell that necessitates a thorough reevaluation of U.S. 
                media reporting on Iraq, much of which has taken for granted that 
                the nation retains supplies of prohibited weapons. (See FAIR Media 
                Advisory, "Iraq's Hidden Weapons: From Allegation to Fact," http://www.fair.org/press-releases/iraq-weapons.html 
                .) Kamel's testimony is not, of course, proof that Iraq does not 
                have hidden stocks of chemical or biological weapons, but it does 
                suggest a need for much more media skepticism about U.S. allegations 
                than has previously been shown. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, 
                Newsweek chose a curious way to handle its scoop: The magazine 
                placed the story in the miscellaneous "Periscope" section with 
                a generic headline, "The Defector's Secrets." Worse, Newsweek's 
                online version added a subhead that seemed almost designed to 
                undercut the importance of the story: "Before his death, a high-ranking 
                defector said Iraq had not abandoned its WMD ambitions." So far, 
                according to a February 27 search of the Nexis database, no major 
                U.S. newspapers or national television news shows have picked 
                up the Newsweek story. *** </font>
