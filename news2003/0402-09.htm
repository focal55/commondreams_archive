                - April 2 - Contrary to the alarmist rhetoric spread by the state's 
                medical and business lobbies, the temporary malpractice insurance 
                spikes experienced by doctors in many states are not on the horizon 
                in Rhode Island, according to a report issued today by Public 
                Citizen, a national consumer advocacy organization. The report 
                concludes that instead, the most significant, long-term medical 
                malpractice "crisis" in Rhode Island is the unreliable quality 
                of care being delivered to state residents by a relatively small 
                proportion of the state's doctors. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The annual 
                amount of medical malpractice insurance premiums that Rhode Island 
                doctors pay has decreased since 1992 when inflation is taken into 
                account, the study found. Also, the amount of malpractice payouts 
                Rhode Island insurers make annually to patients who have suffered 
                from doctor errors has decreased since 1992 when inflation is 
                considered. Moreover, there has been a significant decrease in 
                the number of malpractice payouts made in the state to patients, 
                while the number of physicians in Rhode Island increased by 11 
                percent from 2,623 in 1999 to 2,915 in 2002. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen 
                released the report as the issue gains attention nationally and 
                in Rhode Island, where lawmakers are considering legislation that 
                would make it harder for injured patients to seek compensation 
                for their injuries. Nationally, the U.S. Senate may soon consider 
                a measure that would cap awards for pain and suffering damages 
                in medical malpractice cases at $250,000. U.S. Sens. Jack Reed 
                (D) and Lincoln Chafee (R), both representing Rhode Island, will 
                play a key role in determining the fate of that legislation in 
                Congress. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Capping damages 
                will only hurt those who have been most severely injured by health 
                provider negligence," said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook. 
                "Congress and state legislatures should enact measures to stop 
                insurance company price spikes, not penalize patients who have 
                already suffered from negligence." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Repeat offender 
                doctors are responsible for more than half of malpractice costs 
                in Rhode Island, the study found. Between September 1990 and September 
                2002, 4.8 percent of Rhode Island's doctors were responsible for 
                52.7 percent of all malpractice payments to patients, according 
                to information obtained from the federal government's National 
                Practitioner Data Bank. This small number of doctors made two 
                or more malpractice payments worth a total of $104.7 million. 
                Further, just 1.6 percent of the doctors made three or more payments 
                to patients, representing 26 percent of all payments. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Less than one-third 
                of doctors who made four or more malpractice payments to patients 
                have been disciplined by the state medical board. Rhode Island 
                is one of the nation's less stringent states in disciplining doctors, 
                ranking 35th among all states and the District of Columbia in 
                2002, according to Public Citizen's annual ranking of state medical 
                boards. The state has yet to fully implement a 1997 law mandating 
                public disclosure of profiles of individual physicians. Although 
                some profiles are available online, they omit two crucial categories: 
                malpractice information and criminal convictions. The system is 
                scheduled for an update this summer, but the profiles still will 
                not contain data on doctors' malpractice payouts. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 
                Public Citizen's report, The Facts About Medical Malpractice in 
                Rhode Island (available at <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/civjus/medmal/articles.cfm?ID=9271" target="_new">http://www.citizen.org/congress/civjus/medmal/articles.cfm?ID=9271</a>): 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- Medical errors 
                cause 164 to 365 preventable deaths in Rhode Island each year. 
                These errors cost residents, families and communities $63 million 
                to $108 million annually in lost wages, lost productivity and 
                increased health care costs. In contrast, medical malpractice 
                insurance costs Rhode Island's doctors less than $22 million annually. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- Rhode Island's 
                doctors paid $21.6 million in premiums for malpractice insurance 
                in 2001, compared to $19.5 million in 1996, an increase of 11 
                percent. Adjusting for medical inflation, which was 19.8 percent 
                during the same period, and the growing number of physicians in 
                the state, this represents a significant decline in actual dollars. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- According 
                to the National Practitioner Data Bank, the number of medical 
                malpractice payments to patients by Rhode Island doctors declined 
                21 percent, from 73 in 1997 to 58 in 2001. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- Annual malpractice 
                payments to patients by Rhode Island insurers have decreased when 
                inflation is considered. The amount of malpractice payments made 
                to Rhode Island patients was $22.8 million in 2001, a $1.7 million 
                or 8 percent increase over $21.1 million in 1992, equaling 0.9 
                percent a year. However, during this same period, costs for medical 
                care increased 47 percent nationwide, an average of 5.2 percent 
                a year. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Long-term 
                solutions to reducing malpractice insurance costs lie in reducing 
                medical errors," said Frank Clemente, director of Public Citizen's 
                Congress Watch. "Data show that the legal system is not the problem. 
                There are too many medical errors and too much medical negligence, 
                a lot of which could be prevented with stronger disciplining of 
                the relatively few repeat offender doctors." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 
                to effective doctor discipline, the study suggests that states 
                require hospitals and other health care providers to institute 
                meaningful risk prevention programs. Hospitals should implement 
                measures to curb errors, such as using computers to order and 
                track prescriptions (these can cut errors by 55 percent), requiring 
                proper hand-washing to reduce infections, addressing the nursing 
                shortage and reducing the long hours of medical residents. Also, 
                insurance risk should be spread, reducing the number of classifications 
                of doctor specialties. Risk pools for some are too small and thus 
                overly influenced by a few losses and the concentration in a few 
                specialties of doctors handling the highest risk patients.
