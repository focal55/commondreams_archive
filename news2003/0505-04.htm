- May 5 - Closed discussions between the Bush administration and the
livestock and poultry industry, which resemble the controversial energy
task force meetings held by Vice President Cheney, may soon lead to
far-reaching deals that would shield polluting animal factories from
government lawsuits and effectively exempt animal factories from clean air
safeguards.  According to state and local air pollution administrators that
have pulled out of the negotiations, Bush administration officials at the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are contemplating an alarming
agreement proposed by the meat industry.  A copy of the industry's
confidential proposal memo was recently released by an anonymous source
concerned with the consequences of exempting animal factories from basic
environmental protections, and is available at:
<a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom/2003/may/cafo_papers.asp" target="_new">http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom/2003/may/cafo_papers.asp</a>
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Third and fourth generation family farmers can't enjoy their backyards,
sometimes can't even leave their houses, due to the toxic gases coming from
the manure in these industrial feedlots.  Knowing that these animal
factories are a major source of toxic pollution, why is the Bush
administration cutting secret deals cut behind closed doors and letting
polluting animal factories off the hook from their responsibility to obey
clean air and clean water laws?" asked Pat Gallagher, Sierra Club's
Director of Environmental Law.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Exempting animal factories from basic environmental laws like the Clean
Air Act would quite simply put thousands of communities at risk," said
Brent Newell, Attorney with the Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment.
"These facilities pollute like factories and should be treated as such."
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The confidential proposal, submitted by the meat industry last summer,
would provide animal factories the opportunity to enter a "safe harbor
agreement" with the Bush administration.  Under the agreement, larger
animal factories would opt-in by consenting to possible monitoring of air
emissions.  In return, the larger animal factories would receive amnesty
from enforcement for Clean Air Act or Superfund violations.  The agreement
would also protect smaller animal factories, with no risk of monitoring.
But the proposal is riddled with problems, for example:
   Members of the environmental community and the public have not been
   asked to participate in the secret meetings, potentially violating laws
   designed to prevent special interest influence;
   The agreement strips citizens of their ability to enforce the Clean Air
   Act, blatantly disregarding the public health threat posed by unabated
   pollution;
   EPA would provide inadequate opportunity for public comment;
   Fewer than one percent of the farms that enter the safe harbor agreement
   will actually be monitored, which severely limits the amount of data
   collected;
   EPA already has the authority to demand emission monitoring from animal
   factories without the need to exempt the entire industry from
   environmental laws in the process.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This backroom deal smells every bit as bad as the stench from these animal
factories," said John Walke, director of the Natural Resources Defense
Council's Clean Air Program. "It's yet another example of the Bush
administration trying to dismantle our bedrock environmental laws at the
expense of public health."
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The agreement is so flawed that state and local air pollution
administrators who pulled out of the discussions have now written a letter
to EPA Administrator Whitman expressing "serious concerns" over the safe
harbor agreement.  The letter from the State and Territorial Air Pollution
Program Administrators (STAPPA) and the Association of Local Air Pollution
Control Officers (ALAPCO) also discloses that the EPA is considering
effectively exempting animal factories from the Clean Air Act and
Superfund.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This related and extremely controversial move would mean considering a
wholesale change in the way the Bush administration's EPA applies the Clean
Air Act to animal factories.  By defining emissions from confinement
buildings and manure lagoons at feedlots as "fugitive emissions," the EPA
would effectively exempt the U.S. livestock and poultry industry from the
Clean Air Act.  Fugitive emissions do not count for purposes of determining
whether a source must obtain clean air permits, so the classification of
emissions as fugitive or nonfugitive is the singular decision that largely
determines whether animal factories are regulated under the Clean Air Act
as major sources of pollution.  The EPA is expected to issue a decision by
late May. The STAPPA letter can be found online at:
<a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom/2003/may/cafo_papers.asp%20" target="_new">http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom/2003/may/cafo_papers.asp
</a></font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Instead of using our environmental safeguards to protect communities at
risk, the EPA is trying to define pollution out of existence; it's a
blatant reward to appease a politically powerful, polluting industry," said
Tatjana Vujic, Environmental Integrity Project's Attorney.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scientific studies are beginning to prove what neighbors to factory farms
know well-manure lagoons emit toxic airborne chemicals that can result in
human health problems.  Peer-reviewed studies have shown increased
headaches, sore throats, excessive coughing, diarrhea, burning eyes, and
reduced quality of life in residents near a 6,000-head hog operation in
North Carolina resulting from air emissions, and increased eye and upper
respiratory symptoms in residents within two miles of a large hog operation
in Iowa.  Animal factories are known to emit smog precursors, particulate
matter, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide, which can cause both immediate and
long-term respiratory problems.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A joint letter was sent to EPA Administrator Whitman today by the
Association of Irritated Residents, Center on Race, Poverty & the
Environment, Environmental Defense, Environmental Integrity Project,
Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Sierra Club.  The letter urges
the Bush administration to neither remove animal factories from the Clean
Air Act's permitting and pollution control programs nor grant immunity to
animal factories violating federal law.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are suffering from the effects of toxic emissions from local feedlots,"
said Tom Frantz, a resident of California's San Joaquin Valley and
President of the Association of Irritated Residents.  "We object to federal
policy devised in a secret, back-room deal, a practice that has become all
too common with the Bush administration and its friends in polluting
industries."
