                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Health GAP 
                  writes this letter: (1) to report continued deficits in the 
                  planning and rollout of the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation and 
                  Bottlers in Africa HIV/AIDS Healthcare Program; (2) to demand

                  high ranking corporate executives to discuss our concerns in

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you know, 
                  in June of 2001, during the UN General Assembly Special Session 
                  on HIV/AIDS, Coca-Cola announced efforts in to combat AIDS in 
                  Africa in partnership with UNAIDS. Among the marketing and prevention 
                  initiatives announced was a plan to provide or pay for treatment 
                  of employees living with HIV/AIDS. Pressed by members of the 
                  media to differentiate between the 1,200 direct employees versus 
                  100,000 workers of the Coca-Cola system, Coca-Cola representatives 
                  agreed to negotiate with its business and bottling partners 
                  to provide access to AIDS treatment to the entire Coca-Cola 
                  Africa workforce.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beginning 
                  in April of 2002, Health GAP and other treatment activists launched 
                  a worldwide campaign against Coca-Cola for its failure to provide 
                  a comprehensive workplace HIV/AIDS care and treatment program 
                  for its workers in Africa and elsewhere employed directly or 
                  indirectly by Coca-Cola's affiliated bottlers and distributors. 
                  After demonstrations in New York, Washington, Atlanta, Boston, 
                  and Barcelona in the summer of 2002, numerous universities taking 
                  part in a &quot;Kick Coke of Our Campus&quot; campaign, an October 
                  17 Global Day of Action on four continents brought additional 
                  pressure against Coca-Cola to commit to a comprehensive and 
                  sustainable workplace program.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fifteen 
                  months after its initial promise to negotiate with bottlers 
                  on the provision of treatment to all of its workers in the Coca-Cola 
                  system in Africa and shortly before the Global Day of Action, 
                  the company for the first time committed in writing to enroll 
                  all of its African system workforce in an HIV/AIDS healthcare 
                  program that includes antiretroviral therapy, thereby launching 
                  The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation and Bottlers in Africa HIV/AIDS 
                  Healthcare Program. In subsequent correspondence and personal 
                  communications, Coca-Cola representatives promised that all 
                  bottlers and distributors would be enrolled by the end of March 
                  2003.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Health 
                  GAP continued to engage corporations to adopt workplace policies 
                  of non-discrimination and provision of prevention, care, and 
                  treatment programs for workers and their dependents living with 
                  HIV and as we have continued to follow the development of the 
                  Coca-Cola HIV/AIDS Healthcare Program, we regret that Coca-Cola 
                  has failed to show proof of commitment to the success of the 
                  Program and in particular has failed to address multiple problem 
                  areas that have previously been brought to its attention.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Prompt 
                  and efficient rollout of treatment programs: Coca-Cola needs 
                  to revise its processes and address problem discussed further 
                  below to ensure a rapid, efficient rollout of treatment in Africa:</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- While 
                  Coca-Cola is in danger of missing its March 2003 deadline of 
                  formally enrolling all bottlers in the cost-sharing scheme, 
                  the real problem is the lack of progress on rolling out actual 
                  treatment programs. Coca-Cola must announce a firm timetable 
                  not only for enrollment of distributors but for implementation 
                  of treatment.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- Coca-Cola 
                  must report on the number of programs, if any, implemented thus 
                  far and the number of people living with HIV/AIDS who are eligible 
                  for and receiving treatment, which are true indicators of Coca-Cola's 
                  commitment--more so than memos of understanding between it and 
                  its bottlers. Coca-Cola must continuously monitor and evaluate 
                  the overall Program based on standard metrics and should thereafter 
                  regularly and transparently make such reports available to Health 
                  GAP and other stakeholders.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- Rollout 
                  of the Program will continue to be hampered unless Coca-Cola 
                  streamlines the implementation process and requires distributors 
                  to promptly contract, on standardized terms, with the designated 
                  care coordinator, PharmAccess. Currently PharmAccess, a non-profit 
                  foundation based in the Netherlands, which is contracted with 
                  Coca-Cola to roll out its treatment programs, must negotiate 
                  separate agreements with each of Coca-Cola's bottlers and distributors 
                  individually in each country on all issues from planning to 
                  procurement.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Quality 
                  of Care: Coca-Cola's insistence on a decentralized process and 
                  the resulting lack off accountability has put the success of 
                  the Program in jeopardy:</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- Coca-Cola 
                  must cease giving mixed messages to bottlers about working with 
                  Pharmaccess or launching a treatment program on their own. Without 
                  universal standards and treatment protocols the quality of care 
                  is threatened and the integrity of Coca-Cola's Program is compromised.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- Coca-Cola 
                  must centralize the program and put standard operating procedures 
                  in place not only to ensure quality, but also to allow the efficient 
                  procurement of drugs and diagnostics, consistent program-wide 
                  monitoring and evaluation, and reliable system-wide reporting 
                  methods.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Treatment 
                  Uptake: Throughout Africa, efforts to enroll people living with 
                  HIV/AIDS in treatment programs is compromised by stigma and 
                  discrimination and by a lack of treatment literacy:</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- Coca-Cola 
                  must ensure that bottlers and distributors are upholding the 
                  promise of confidentiality of all medical records without which 
                  uptake of services is likely to suffer. Voluntary and confidential 
                  HIV testing must be provided with clear statements on a universal 
                  policy of non-discrimination.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- Coca-Cola 
                  must ensure that bottlers and distributors are implementing 
                  a policy of non-discrimination and non-stigmatization and foster 
                  a workplace and community ethos of care and concern for people 
                  living with HIV/AIDS.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- Coca-Cola 
                  must support workplace treatment literacy campaigns which will 
                  help educate system workers about the feasibility and pragmatics 
                  of treatment and that encourages voluntary counseling and testing.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Universal 
                  rollout: Coca-Cola needs to extend the coverage of AIDS treatment 
                  to Coca-Cola system workers in other developing countries.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- The 
                  current slowdown in Africa further delays the availability of 
                  AIDS treatment to Coca-Cola workforce in developing countries 
                  outside of Africa. Coca-Cola has hundreds of thousands of system 
                  workers in other developing countries, including countries with 
                  growing AIDS crises, and these workers too, and their dependents, 
                  are entitled to meaningful access to life-saving treatment.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* 10% co-pay 
                  for worker: Activists predict that the announced 10% co-pay 
                  provisions will deter uptake of treatment, especially in light 
                  of the relative low wages of workers, the relative high cost 
                  of ARV treatment, and the possibility of multiple cases of HIV 
                  infection in a particular family. Although Coca-Cola has promised 
                  in writing that it &quot;will not let inability to pay be a 
                  barrier to treatment,&quot; it has failed to address activist 
                  concerns that co-pays will negatively impact uptake. Accordingly, 
                  we demand that Coca-Cola:</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- publicize 
                  the costs of annual treatment against average bottler salaries 
                  in each country;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- monitor 
                  uptake to be certain that 10% co-pay requirements are not negatively 
                  affecting uptake;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- review 
                  and revise its 10% co-pay provision if reporting shows that 
                  treatment uptake has suffered; and</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Cost-sharing 
                  with bottlers: Coca-Cola has announced that its bottling &quot;partners&quot; 
                  will need to cover 40% of program costs, but that &quot;cost 
                  sharing will not serve as a barrier to participation by all 
                  bottlers in Africa.&quot; Coca-Cola must confirm its willingness 
                  to negotiate with smaller and mid-sized bottlers about their 
                  cost-sharing percentage and further than Coca-Cola is willing 
                  to reconsider such percentages in the future as more workers 
                  take advantage of costly ARV treatment programs.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Cheapest 
                  medicines: Coca-Cola has committed to expand its potential sources 
                  of pharmaceutical products beyond those provided by GlaxoSmithKline, 
                  depending on national intellectual property and drug registration 
                  status. Coca-Cola should commit further to the principle of 
                  utilizing low-cost generic producers wherever possible in order 
                  to decrease costs to bottlers and workers.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Sustained 
                  corporate commitment: At present, Coca-Cola's commitment to 
                  the Africa HIV/AIDS Healthcare Program is through its charitable 
                  arm, the Africa Foundation. To solidify and ensure the Program's 
                  success:</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- Coca-Cola 
                  must publicly issue a formal corporate-level commitment to sustaining 
                  the Program indefinitely. Activists rightfully question Coca-Cola's 
                  long-term commitment to the Program in light of the statement 
                  by Robert Lindsay, VP of Public Affairs &amp; Communication 
                  for the Africa Group, that the &quot;Foundation will likely 
                  withdraw because the financial burden [on the bottlers] will 
                  become less.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> -- As stated 
                  previously, Coca-Cola must integrate HIV/AIDS workplace policies 
                  and protocols into its system-wide operations as a minimum standard 
                  for its bottling partners in Africa and must formally state 
                  its commitment and generate timeline for extending coverage 
                  for AIDS treatment, as part of a comprehensive HIV/AIDS workplace 
                  policy, for its operations in developing countries outside of 
                  Africa.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Meetings 
                  with Health GAP and public reports to stakeholders: After a 
                  long delay, Coca-Cola reluctantly agreed to sponsor a meeting 
                  between Health GAP and other activists with Robert Lindsay from 
                  the Africa Foundation. At this point, given the need for a higher 
                  level corporate commitment from Coca-Cola, we request a meeting 
                  with the President and with Deval Patrick, Executive Vice President 
                  and General Counsel, in order to discuss these programmatic 
                  concerns and demands for expanded commitment. In addition to 
                  requesting a meeting, and in light of ongoing operational concerns, 
                  we also request a system of regular and transparent reports 
                  every three months of operational milestones. The treatment 
                  of workers living with HIV/AIDS, and their dependents, is too 
                  important to fall to the back burner or to suffer unnecessary 
                  delays and problems because of poor information flows and limited 
                  external accountability.</font></p>
