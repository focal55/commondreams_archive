<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - April 23 - An innovative 
framework to provide automatic, affordable health insurance to 
nearly all Americans is outlined today in a Web-published Health 
Affairs article by health policy experts Karen Davis and Cathy 
Schoen of The Commonwealth Fund. The article, "Creating Consensus 
on Coverage Choices," would build on existing sources of public and 
private health coverage by combining tax credits for private 
insurance, public program expansions, and a new mechanism to make 
enrollment more automatic. The article also provides a roadmap for 
a phased-in series of steps to achieve affordable and automatic 
coverage for all Americans over time. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The framework presented by Davis and Schoen seeks to bridge 
differences between those policy strategies that rely on tax 
credits to increase private insurance coverage and those strategies 
that would increase health coverage through public program 
expansions. An estimated 39 million of the 42 million Americans who 
are uninsured would gain coverage, increasing total national health 
expenditures by a modest 3 percent. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We know what works in the current system, so we should build on 
success instead of trying to reinvent the wheel," said Davis, 
president of The Commonwealth Fund. "The consensus approach gives 
people the choice to keep the coverage they have if it's working 
well for them. It provides a long-term vision, but also lends 
itself to phasing in and adjustment over time with experience. The 
federal government could begin to enact some pieces of this plan 
immediately." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Key aspects of the consensus framework include: 
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Access to affordable coverage for small-business employees, 
the self-employed, and other uninsured individuals through a new 
Congressional Health Plan. The Congressional Health Plan would 
provide a choice of any insurance plan participating in the Federal 
Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). It would be open to 
anyone working for a business that has fewer than 50 employees, as 
well as to self-employed workers and other uninsured individuals. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Automatic enrollment and premium assistance. Any uninsured 
person would receive tax credits to help pay premiums that exceed 
5 percent of their incomes (10 percent for those in upper tax 
brackets). The uninsured would be enrolled automatically in the 
Congressional Health Plan and would have a choice of other group 
options. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Public coverage expansions for low-income individuals and 
people at risk for being uninsured because of their health or age. 
Medicare would be open to those 60 and older who lack access to 
group coverage, to the disabled on the Medicare waiting list, and 
to Medicare dependents. State-run programs, with enhanced federal 
financing to reduce state costs, would be open to any individual or 
family with an income below 150 percent of poverty. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Building on employer-sponsored coverage where it is working 
well. To minimize disruptions in coverage, employers would continue 
to be the mainstay of the health insurance system for working 
families. Companies that do not offer coverage to employees would 
contribute 5 percent of payroll-up to $1 per hour worked-to a fund 
that would help pay for coverage. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The framework illustrates ways in which various approaches 
could be combined, and it also shows what could be accomplished 
incrementally if you have a vision of how different parts fit 
together," noted Schoen, vice president at The Commonwealth Fund. 
"Another possible step toward covering everyone would be to conduct 
state demonstrations like those suggested by the recent Institute 
of Medicine report. Given the fiscal conditions that states are in, 
such demonstrations would require a new commitment of federal 
resources." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the Health Affairs article, Davis and Schoen discuss how the 
tax system could be used to provide income-related credits and to 
ensure automatic enrollment of the uninsured into private and 
public group health plans. The framework would couple this 
automatic enrollment and premium assistance with a mix of private 
and public insurance expansions designed to provide affordable, 
continuous, and high-quality coverage options for the entire 
under-65 population. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new Congressional Health Plan -- the proposal's 
centerpiece -- would allow small-business employees, the 
self-employed, and other uninsured individuals to enroll in the 
same insurance plans offered to federal employees. Members of 
Congress could also participate to show their commitment to 
high-quality coverage. The program would be open to everyone, 
regardless of their health status or age. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To make coverage affordable to those with very low incomes who 
cannot afford coverage even with tax credits, as well as to those 
at risk for being uninsured because of their health or age, public 
insurance programs would be expanded. In addition, the framework 
includes provisions that would improve the stability and continuity 
of employer-based coverage and encourage more firms to participate 
in group coverage. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In total, these components would reach an estimated 39 million 
of the 42 million Americans who were uninsured in 2002, if 
participation were mandatory. Even if participation were voluntary, 
an estimated 33 million of the uninsured would still be covered. 
For the entire under-65 population, the new insurance framework 
would provide the security of more continuous, affordable coverage. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The authors' cost estimates suggest that the combined approach 
would result in a marginal increase in total national spending, 
while providing out-of-pocket cost savings for the uninsured and 
more affordable premiums for individuals and small businesses. 
Various features would also likely reduce insurance administrative 
costs throughout the health system, including the costs associated 
with instability of coverage. People with health problems would 
have the added security that continuous insurance coverage would be 
available to them at an affordable price. The net federal costs of 
the expansion are estimated to be $70 billion when fully 
implemented-an amount that could be partially offset by repeal of 
the one-percentage-point reduction in the income tax scheduled to 
take effect in January 2004.
