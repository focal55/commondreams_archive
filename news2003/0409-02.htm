                YORK - April 9 - Following yesterday's indictment of Indonesian 
                military and police officials, the East Timor Action Network/U.S. 
                (ETAN) today urged the United States and United Nations to fully 
                support the prosecution of Indonesian officials accused of committing 
                crimes against humanity in East Timor by the joint UN/East Timor 
                Serious Crimes Unit. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We urge the 
                U.S. and the UN to actively pursue the extradition and prosecution 
                of all those indicted by the Serious Crimes Unit (SCU) currently 
                residing in Indonesia. The Bush administration must use all diplomatic 
                resources at its disposal to ensure Indonesian authorities honor 
                the indictments issued and comply with extradition requests," 
                said John M. Miller, spokesperson for ETAN. "There must be concrete 
                repercussions for Indonesia's complete failure to cooperate with 
                the SCU." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The serious 
                nature of the crimes committed, the inability of the new nation 
                of East Timor to seek justice on its own, and the extreme violence 
                aimed at a UN Security Council-mandated mission all necessitate 
                international involvement," added Miller. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesia has 
                publicly refused to extradite anyone to East Timor for trial. 
                Of the 227 suspects previously indicted by the SCU, nearly two-thirds 
                reside in Indonesia. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an effort 
                to avoid an international court process, Indonesia established 
                its own ad hoc court on East Timor, considered a sham by nearly 
                all observers. The Indonesian court is expected to announce its 
                last verdicts this month. So far, the court has acquitted 11 of 
                14 Indonesian defendants before it. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The SCU indictment 
                accuses 16 persons, including nine Indonesian military (TNI) officers 
                and the former Indonesian District Chief of Police, of crimes 
                against humanity committed against the civilian population of 
                Covalima district in 1999. Among incidents involved is the notorious 
                September 1999 massacre at the Suai church, where scores of women, 
                men, and children were killed, including three priests. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"East Timorese 
                officials have expressed concern about the impact of the SCU indictments 
                on relations with Indonesia, but East Timor's civil society has 
                repeatedly called the pursuit of justice fundamental for stability 
                and stated that the East Timorese people are crying out for justice," 
                said Miller. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">East Timor's 
                National Alliance for an International Tribunal, praising February's 
                indictment of the former head of the Indonesian military General 
                Wiranto and other high-ranking officials, wrote to UN High Commissioner 
                for Human Rights Sergio de Mello, "East Timorese victims have 
                complained that [earlier SCU] indictments only charged lower-ranking 
                Indonesian military and police personnel as well as militia members, 
                but failed to address the primary perpetrators. The people of 
                East Timor, who since 1975 have lived under Indonesian military 
                occupation. are well aware that the violence in 1999 was part 
                of an ongoing systematic and planned use of violence against our 
                people." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The U.S. and 
                UN must ensure that the SCU and its courts have sufficient resources 
                to finish investigations and conduct effective trials," added 
                Miller. "The current May 2004 deadline for the SCU must be extended 
                by the Security Council. Otherwise, justice will become just one 
                more broken international promise to the people of East Timor."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"UN Secretary-General 
                Kofi Annan and the Security Council must further establish an 
                international tribunal to investigate and try war crimes, crimes 
                against humanity and genocide committed throughout the illegal 
                Indonesian occupation of East Timor, from 1975 to 1999." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The April 8 
                indictment charges eight TNI District and Sub-District Commanders, 
                the former Indonesian District Civilian Administrator (also a 
                TNI Officer), the former Indonesian District Chief of Police and 
                six East Timorese TNI soldiers with 31 counts of crimes against 
                humanity, including murder, extermination, enforced disappearance, 
                torture, deportation and persecution committed against the civilian 
                population of Covalima district between 27 January 1999 and 25 
                October 1999. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The indictment 
                includes the September 6 massacre of refugees who sought refuge 
                inside the Suai Church compound. Last August, the ad hoc court 
                in Jakarta found five of those named in the SCU indictment not 
                guilty of the church massacre. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The SCU has 
                now issued a total of 59 indictments against 243 persons. Most 
                of those indicted remain at large, likely in Indonesia. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United

                the SCU under authority granted by UN Security Council Resolution 
                1272 (25 October 1999) to set up a system to administer justice 
                in East Timor. The SCU has focused on investigating serious crimes 
                that took place during 1999 and prosecuting those responsible. 
                The UN also created a hybrid international-East Timorese Special 
                Panel of the Dili District Court to hear serious crimes cases.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">East Timor 
                gained independence in May 2002, but the UN retained authority 
                to investigate and prosecute serious crimes committed through 
                1999 in the post-independence UN support mission UNMISET through 
                Security Council Resolution 1410. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesia's 
                ad hoc Human Rights Court on East Timor has acquitted 11 of 14 
                Indonesian defendants tried thus far, in addition to two convictions 
                for the only East Timorese on trial. The five sentences handed 
                down were not commensurate with the crimes committed; four defendants 
                received less than the legal minimum under Indonesian law. All 
                remain free pending appeal. Few of the top architects of the terror 
                in East Timor were even named as suspects, much less brought to 
                trial. Other serious shortcomings of the Indonesian court include 
                an extremely unprofessional courtroom environment packed with 
                high-ranking military and militia; inadequate witness protection; 
                and a prosecution that has presented weak and inaccurate indictments 
                and arguments, painted a false picture of the conflict in 1999, 
                and failed to present the overwhelming amount of evidence available.
