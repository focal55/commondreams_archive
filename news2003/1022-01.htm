- October 21 - Today, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force joined the <a href="http://www.sldn.org" target="_new">Servicemembers Legal Defense Network</a> (SLDN) in once again opposing the Bush Administration's re-nomination of Major General Robert T. Clark to Lieutenant General, the Army's second highest rank. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is yet another example of the Bush Administration cramming unqualified individuals down the throats of the American people in order to appease his rabidly anti-gay, anti-choice and anti-immigration base,&quot; said National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Executive Director Matt Foreman. &quot;While the &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; policy is in and of itself flawed, MG Clark's documented failure to order required training on how to address anti-gay harassment is cause for great concern. The military should not be about perpetuating discrimination within its ranks, which under the leadership of Robert T. Clark we might expect given the history of his tenure.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information, please read the following press release and action alert from SLDN: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senate Likely to Vote on Promotion of Major General Whose Command Included Murder, Domestic Abuse, Harassment &amp; Record Discharges </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senators Question MG Clark's Leadership, Says He &quot;Still Doesn't Get It;&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Retired Military Leaders Oppose Nomination </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Washington, DC - Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN) has learned that a vote on the controversial nomination of Major General Robert T. Clark is expected on Thursday following a closed-door session of the Senate Armed Services Committee at 9:30am. If MG Clark's nomination is approved by the Committee, he will face a vote by the full Senate concerning his promotion to Lieutenant General, the Army's second highest rank. A Senate confirmation would place Clark in command of the Fifth United States Army, based at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2002, the Armed Services Committee elected not to act on the nomination due to serious concerns about MG Clark's leadership before and after the murder of PFC Barry Winchell at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Winchell was beaten to death by fellow soldiers who believed he was gay. In the weeks and months following Winchell's murder, SLDN revealed evidence that MG Clark failed to curb a virulent anti-gay atmosphere on his base, including pervasive harassment of perceived gay and lesbian soldiers and anti-gay graffiti on base. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Department of Army Inspector General report found that MG Clark failed to order required training on &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; or on how to address anti-gay harassment. The report shows other troubling facts about MG Clark's tenure at the post, including command-wide low morale; inadequate delivery of health care to soldiers and their families; and wide-spread, leader-condoned underage drinking in the barracks. Under Clark's leadership, and due to a gay discharge policy he implemented, Fort Campbell recorded the highest number of lesbian, gay and bisexual discharges at any military installation worldwide. According to 60 Minutes, the base also saw an alarming spike in domestic abuse cases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MG Clark issued no statements against anti-gay harassment, refused to speak with or meet the parents of PFC Winchell for four years after their son's death. He also failed to reassure base soldiers that anti-gay harassment would not be tolerated, leading Senators to question President Bush's nomination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is compelling evidence that there were problems at this base,&quot; Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), a member of the Armed Services Committee, recently told NBC Nightly News. Other Senators told NBC that, in private meetings, &quot;MG Clark portrayed himself as the victim, claiming his character was being maligned,&quot; leading one Republican Senator to confide that, &quot;The General still doesn't get it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The question before the Armed Services Committee is whether Major General Clark lived up to his responsibilities to my son, and the sons and daughters under his watch,&quot; said Patricia Kutteles, PFC Winchell's mother. &quot;The answer is no. He failed to stop harassment under his watch. Beyond the courts-martial, he failed to hold a single soldier accountable for the dangerous atmosphere on his base. He failed to take even the most basic steps - such as ensuring 911 emergency services - to protect his soldiers. His nomination should be rejected.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A dozen retired senior military leaders also called on the Armed Services Committee to reject the nomination. In a letter released today, the officers note that Clark &quot;is not suited for promotion to a position of increased responsibility.&quot; The officers go on to say that, &quot;One lesson every commander learns . . . is that he or she is responsible for every action under his or her command . . . . MG Clark should not be rewarded with a promotion.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A coalition of military, veterans and civil liberties organizations led by SLDN have also called on Senators to oppose the nomination. The Democratic National Committee, People for the American Way, the National Organization for Women, the Human Rights Campaign, the National Gay &amp; Lesbian Task Force, American Veterans for Equal Rights, the Transgender American Veterans Association and Michigan's Triangle Institute have joined Mrs. Kutteles and SLDN in their opposition. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Promotion should be based on an exemplary record of service to our men and women in uniform,&quot; said SLDN Executive Director C. Dixon Osburn. &quot;Major General Clark, through his actions surrounding PFC Winchell's murder, failed that test. There are many leaders more qualified to assume command of the Fifth U.S. Army. The Senate Armed Services Committee should insist President Bush find a better candidate for this prestigious post.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.sldn.org" target="_new">Servicemembers Legal Defense Network</a> is a national, non-profit legal services, watchdog and policy organization dedicated to ending discrimination against and harassment of military personnel affected by &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; and related forms of intolerance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACTION ALERT!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oppose the Nomination of MG Robert T. Clark </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please call the United States Senate today and ask your Senator to vote against MG Robert T. Clark's promotion, which is currently before the Senate Armed Services Committee. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate Armed Services Committee is expected to act soon on President Bush's nomination of MG Robert T. Clark for promotion to Lieutenant General. A decision regarding the nomination could come as early as Thursday.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MG Clark was commanding general at Fort Campbell, Ky., in 1999 when PFC Barry Winchell was harassed and subsequently beaten to death with a baseball bat by two fellow soldiers who thought Winchell was gay. Servicemembers Legal Defense Network has again called on the Senate Armed Services Committee to oppose Clark's nomination. (Other national and state groups opposing MG Clark's nomination include the DNC, HRC, PFAW, NOW, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, American Veterans for Equal Rights, the Transgender American Veterans Association and Michigan's Triangle Institute.) Serious evidence indicates that MG Clark did not do enough, either before or after PFC Winchell's murder, to protect his troops and curb the anti-gay environment so prevalent on his base. (Full details regarding SLDN's opposition to MG Clark's nomination are available online at www.sldn.org). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anti-gay harassment is widespread in our armed forces, according to the Pentagon's own survey of troops. Promoting a general who tolerated such harassment sends the wrong message to every command. Please contact Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner (R-VA) and Ranking Member Carl Levin (D-MI) and ask that they vote NO on Clark's nomination. </font></p>
