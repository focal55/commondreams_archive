                - March 13 - HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson today announced two 
                proposed rules from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that 
                will improve patient safety by reducing medication errors and 
                by more quickly identifying potential errors that may occur. The 
                new rules, part of FDA's strategic initiative to reduce adverse 
                events involving the products it regulates, will require bar coding 
                on medications and will improve reporting requirements for safety 
                problems involving medicines. "These proposals are key steps in 
                reducing medication problems through using state-of-the-art technology," 
                Secretary Thompson said. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today's actions 
                are the start of a comprehensive strategy to build a medical patient 
                protection system for the 21st Century," said FDA Commissioner, 
                Mark B. McClellan, M.D., Ph.D. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the 
                major initiatives announced today -- the proposed requirement 
                for bar codes -- adopts a technology that is widely used in other 
                industries to reduce the number of medication errors in hospitals 
                and other health care settings. The required bar code would contain 
                the National Drug Code (NDC) number, unique identifying information 
                about the drug that is to be dispensed to the patient, in a linear 
                bar code as part of the drug label. The proposed design would 
                allow manufacturers to include additional information, and more 
                information could also be added to the bar code standards as information 
                technology progresses. When used with bar code scanners and computerized 
                patient information systems, bar code technology can prevent many 
                medication errors including administering the wrong drug, administering 
                a drug to a patient who is known to be allergic, administering 
                the wrong dose, administering the drug at the wrong time, or using 
                the wrong route of administration (for example, by injection rather 
                than by mouth). </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 
                to the human suffering they cause, medication errors represent 
                a significant economic cost to the United States. According to 
                the Institute of Medicine and other experts, thousands of deaths 
                and millions of hospitalizations result from medication errors. 
                The expected annual benefit from preventing adverse events due 
                to medication errors is equivalent to $3.9 billion. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed 
                rule would apply to all prescription drug products, including 
                biological products and vaccines (except for physician samples), 
                and OTC drugs that are commonly used in hospitals and dispensed 
                in a hospital pursuant to an order. Standardized bar codes would 
                also be required on prescription drug products used in other settings 
                such as retail pharmacies. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second 
                action the agency is announcing -- the proposed revamping of safety 
                reporting requirements -- aims to enhance the agency's ability 
                to effectively monitor and improve the safe use of medications 
                including drugs and biologics. The proposed rule would: </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Improve 
                the quality and usefulness of safety reports submitted to the 
                agency as well as facilitating the consistency of safety reporting 
                around the world. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Require 
                the submission of all suspected serious reactions for blood and 
                blood products on the market. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Require 
                reports on important potential medication errors. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These steps 
                would provide FDA with more useful, timely, and extensive information 
                to support quicker, more effective actions by the agency to prevent 
                adverse events. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To expedite 
                the agency's review of and response to medication errors, the 
                proposed amendments would require companies to submit to FDA, 
                within 15 calendar days, all reports they receive of actual and 
                potential (i.e., "near miss") medication errors occurring in the 
                United States. An example of a potential medication error - from 
                the standpoint of the rule - is a situation in which a pharmacist 
                selects the wrong medication because of a similar sounding name 
                but catches the error prior to dispensing the medication. In this 
                case, no patient was the recipient of an actual medication error. 
                However, if the pharmacist reported what happened in an effort 
                to alert the company to this potential problem, then the company 
                would be required to report the "potential" (or "near miss") medication 
                error to FDA. In this manner, FDA could work with the company 
                to make changes to help ensure that actual medication errors because 
                of this problem do not happen. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposal 
                would also raise the quality and consistency of safety reports 
                by requiring the use of internationally agreed definitions reporting 
                formats, and other safety reporting standards. If the proposed 
                safety reporting standards are implemented, companies will be 
                able to devote their resources to preparing a single, high-quality 
                report for submission to all major regulatory agencies around 
                the world. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under this 
                proposal, blood establishments would be required to submit to 
                FDA reports of all suspected serious reactions, not just fatalities, 
                which currently is the case. The proposal refines and clarifies 
                the expectations for the amounts of data needed in various safety 
                reports. The net effect will be to lessen some of industry's reporting 
                burdens - especially for certain non-serious suspected adverse 
                reactions - thus allowing companies to focus their resources on 
                producing quality reports of serious suspected adverse reactions 
                which potentially have a much greater public health impact. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both proposed 
                rules, as well as other material related to today's announcement,

                FDA invites written comments from the public on these proposed 
                rules to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug 
                Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061, Rockville, Md. 20852.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In coordination 
                with today's actions, FDA is using emerging technologies such 
                as automatic reporting systems to promote greater patient safety. 
                By capturing important risk information automatically using modern 
                clinical information systems, FDA can augment the information 
                it will obtain through its mandatory adverse event reporting programs. 
                These automatic programs are designed to expand with the use of 
                sophisticated electronic information systems in health care, and 
                in many cases will be able to provide results and safety guidance 
                in electronic form to participating providers and organizations 
                based on the electronic data provided. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, 
                FDA is involved in a public-private collaboration called "Connecting 
                for Health," aimed at improving quality and patient safety through 
                the adoption of clinical data standards and compatible health 
                information systems. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under this 
                program, the FDA will also participate in a national pilot project 
                that will involve several hospitals, such as New York Presbyterian, 
                along with information technology suppliers, such as IBM, that 
                will explore real-time identification of adverse events associated 
                with medical products. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The agency 
                also plans to expand its Internet-based pilot program (MedSun) 
                to work collaboratively with more than 100 health care facilities 
                across the country to help ensure the safe use of medical products, 
                and will expand its collaborative electronic program on medical 
                device safety. In addition, FDA recently developed a partnership 
                with a managed care organization and with the Centers for Medicare 
                & Medicaid Services which will allow FDA to access high-quality 
                data that can be used to analyze safety concerns in large patient 
                populations.
