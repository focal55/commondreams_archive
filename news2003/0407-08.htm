                YORK - April 7 - Domini Social Investments LLC today announced 
                that it has filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court 
                that supports San Francisco activist Marc Kasky in his effort 
                to hold Nike accountable for its statements concerning the company's 
                use of sweatshop labor. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kasky argues 
                that Nike's statements should be considered "commercial speech" 
                akin to advertising, and therefore subject to California's consumer 
                protection statutes, while Nike maintains that they are "noncommercial" 
                or "political speech" because they touch on matters of public 
                concern, and therefore benefit from stricter protection under 
                the First Amendment. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In its own 
                brief, however, Nike concedes that "virtually everything a company 
                does is ultimately intended to improve its financial bottom line" 
                (emphasis in original, Nike's brief p. 22). Nike has also conceded 
                that allegations about sweatshop practices contributed to its 
                disappointing financial performance in 1997 and 1998. "Both of 
                these concessions are important, and in our view, demonstrate 
                that these types of statements should rightly be considered commercial 
                speech," said Adam Kanzer, General Counsel and Director of Shareholder 
                Advocacy for Domini Social Investments. "These statements were 
                not made during a debate about political philosophy - they were 
                made by a company defending its reputation and its bottom line." 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domini believes 
                that Nike v. Kasky is a critical case for all investment firms 
                that practice socially responsible investing (SRI). Domini Social 
                Investments is the manager of the Domini Social Equity Fund (NASDQ: 
                DSEFX), the nation's oldest and largest socially and environmentally 
                screened index fund. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The SRI community 
                depends upon the accurate flow of corporate social and environmental 
                performance data," said Mr. Kanzer. "All investors depend on government 
                regulators to ensure that information from corporations is provided 
                on a timely and accurate basis. If any of this information is 
                deemed to be 'political speech,' it will severely undercut these 
                regulatory efforts. Nike's definition of political speech -- any 
                commercial speech that also touches upon matters of public concern 
                -- is alarmingly broad, potentially affecting nearly every aspect 
                of a corporation's business, from treatment of stock options to 
                compliance with environmental regulations. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It is important 
                to note that this case has no bearing on Nike's actual practices 
                regarding its overseas contractors, or whether its statements 
                were in fact false or misleading," Mr. Kanzer continued. "It addresses 
                only the constitutional question of whether companies like Nike 
                can claim full First Amendment protection for public statements 
                regarding their own business practices that also touch upon matters 
                of public concern." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The principal 
                author of Domini's amicus curiae or "friend of the court" brief 
                is Cynthia A. Williams, Associate Professor of Law at the University 
                of Illinois College of Law. The brief is co-authored by Michael 
                R. Siebecker, Adjunct Assistant Professor at Hunter College. KLD 
                Research & Analytics, Domini's social research provider, and Harrington 
                Investments, a Northern California-based social investment firm, 
                also signed onto the brief. James Pfander, Prentice R. Marshall 
                Professor of Law at the University of Illinois College of Law, 
                was counsel of record. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domini's involvement 
                in Nike v. Kasky follows its successful campaign for new rules 
                by the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring mutual funds 
                and investment advisers to disclose their proxy voting policies 
                and voting records. This is the first brief Domini has filed with 
                the Supreme Court. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Professor Williams 
                said, "Our brief asks the Court to recognize as a legal principle 
                that we ought to treat companies' statements about social and 
                environmental facts precisely as we treat their statements of 
                financial facts. These factors are critical to investors and consumers, 
                but they are only valuable if they are true. A broad ruling in 
                Nike's favor would seriously undermine the SEC and other regulators' 
                abilities to ensure that these statements are accurate and not 
                misleading." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to 
                John Harrington, president and CEO of Harrington Investments, 
                "Corporations, certainly including Nike, spend hundreds of millions 
                of dollars on advertising and public relations to sell their products 
                and establish their trade name, logo or brand. A corporation's 
                statements about its own business practices are clearly commercial 
                speech and should never be confused with the freedom of speech 
                guaranteed to individuals by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 
                Corporations have a duty to speak in a way that is accurate and 
                not misleading, and they should not be given free rein to use 
                the First Amendment to evade that duty." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domini's Argument 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domini argues 
                that granting full First Amendment protection to corporate speech 
                would undercut disclosure and reporting requirements imposed by 
                the Securities and Exchange Commission, and would make it easier 
                for companies to sidestep antifraud regulations. Domini's brief 
                maintains that a ruling in favor of Nike could have serious implications 
                "at a time when restoring investor confidence in the markets is 
                crucial." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domini also 
                argues that Nike's position would threaten investors' ability 
                to obtain information from corporations on issues of public concern, 
                such as information about use of child labor, toxic releases, 
                or expensing stock options. Because the U.S. Supreme Court has 
                struck down laws compelling political speech, corporations could 
                claim that compelled disclosure of noncommercial information is 
                unconstitutional. This may also threaten shareholders' ability 
                to file shareholder resolutions on social, environmental or corporate 
                governance matters (because the SEC might not have the authority 
                to compel corporations to include such "political" speech in their 
                proxy statements). Domini, Harrington, and many other socially 
                responsible investors regularly file such resolutions each year. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Supporters 
                of Nike's position have argued that to regard corporations' statements 
                on their environmental and social performance as commercial speech 
                would have a chilling effect on their willingness to disclose 
                such information. Nike itself has refused to release its most 
                recent report on corporate social responsibility. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domini, however, 
                maintains that companies like Nike will continue to discuss their 
                practices because it is in their interests to do so. This information 
                is demanded by consumers, federal regulators, nonprofit organizations, 
                some national governments, and by socially responsible investors 
                and research organizations. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nike has argued 
                that it has a right to defend itself when its labor practices 
                are attacked. In its brief, Domini argued "of course Nike or any 
                other company must be able to respond to criticisms of their labor 
                policies by providing facts about those policies ....Yet that 
                reassurance needs to be based on truthful, accurate and non-misleading 
                information. Nike or any other company should not be able to 'plead 
                the First' so that the truth of the facts they assert about their 
                social and environmental records cannot be tested in litigation 
                -- just as they would not be able to plead the First to preclude 
                an examination of their statements of fact about their financial 
                results of operation or about product quality, price or safety." 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domini pointed 
                out that Nike's position could have implications for financial 
                statements as well: "Indeed, given recent events, that financial 
                statements are accurate is itself a matter of public concern, 
                suggesting that on Nike's theory even statements of fact about 
                a company's financial results would not be commercial speech." 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background 
                of the Case </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nike, along 
                with other corporations, was criticized in the late 1990s for 
                using sweatshop factories in Asia to manufacture its running shoes 
                and other products. In 1998, California consumer Marc Kasky sued 
                Nike under California statutes prohibiting false and misleading 
                advertising. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kasky challenged 
                statements Nike had made to newspaper editors, university professors, 
                and investors, such as that the company paid "on average, double 
                the minimum wage as defined in countries where its products are 
                produced" and that its workers "are protected from physical and 
                sexual abuse." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">California 
                state law allows anyone to sue a company for "false advertising" 
                in statements that are deemed to be "commercial speech." Commercial 
                speech receives a far lower level of protection under the First 
                Amendment than political speech. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">California 
                state and appellate courts agreed with Nike that its statements 
                were protected as noncommercial speech. The California Supreme 
                Court, however, ruled in Kasky's favor, holding that Nike's statements 
                are "commercial speech for the purposes of applying state laws 
                barring false and misleading commercial messages." Nike then appealed 
                the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court is scheduled to 
                hear oral arguments on April 23. </font>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1997 Nike 
                became the first of two companies to be removed from the Domini 
                400 Social Index(SM) because of concerns over its international 
                labor standards. (Wal-Mart was dropped for the same reason in 
                2001.) The Index is maintained by KLD. The Domini Social Equity 
                Fund is a fully replicating index fund based on the Index.
