                - April 4 - Proponents of sweeping trade agreements such as the 
                North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade 
                Organization (WTO) always have maintained that U.S. trade commitments 
                do not affect or undermine domestic law. But the Bush administration's 
                attack on a domestic environmental law is the latest proof - the 
                &quot;smoking dolphin,&quot; if you will - that trade commitments 
                do lead to the erosion of domestic public interest policies.</font> 
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Monday, 
                  April 7, U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson of San Francisco 
                  will hold a hearing in a lawsuit filed by environmental groups 
                  to halt the Bush administration's proposed change to the popular 
                  &quot;dolphin-safe&quot; labeling law for tuna. This case provides 
                  an excellent opportunity to examine the way that today's trade 
                  agreements intrude on domestic policymaking in the United States.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush 
                  administration announced on Dec. 31, 2002, that it planned to 
                  weaken the rules protecting dolphins from encirclement nets 
                  used to catch tuna. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1992, 
                  the United States has been under orders to weaken the dolphin 
                  law in question after it was ruled to be an illegal trade barrier 
                  by an international tribunal operating under the General Agreement 
                  on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. Recently, Mexico has stepped 
                  up threats of WTO action if the law is not changed. The Bush 
                  administration action underscores the concerns raised by public 
                  interest activists about domestic policies being attacked by 
                  foreign nations as illegal trade barriers in secret WTO tribunals. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following 
                  provides a timeline of the challenge to the dolphin law and 
                  an explanation of the actions by the Clinton and Bush administration 
                  to comply with the resulting trade rulings and threats. </font></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> History 
                  of Dolphin Trade Case</font></b></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For reasons 
                  that are poorly understood, yellowfin tuna in the Eastern Tropical 
                  Pacific often travel with dolphins. In the 1950s, tuna fishermen 
                  developed a deadly new method for catching the tuna. They would 
                  locate pods of dolphins swimming near the ocean surface and 
                  then herd the dolphins, along with the tuna swimming beneath, 
                  to the surface. Fishing vessels would then encircle the disoriented 
                  animals with giant purse seines, which could be drawn together 
                  at the bottom to trap the fish. The dolphins often drowned before 
                  they could be brought aboard the boat and released.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Outrage 
                  over the practice, which is estimated to have killed seven million 
                  dolphins in the region, helped spur Congress in 1972 to pass 
                  the Marine Mammal Protection Act. While this act drastically 
                  reduced the number of dolphin deaths, fishermen still were permitted 
                  under the act's provisions to kill tens of thousands of dolphins 
                  per year. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public concern 
                  rose again in 1988, when an environmental activist secretly 
                  videotaped large numbers of dolphins being slaughtered on a 
                  Panamanian vessel. Congress that year banned tuna imports from 
                  countries that failed to meet U.S. dolphin conservation standards. 
                  Then in 1990, Congress reacted to a growing grassroots movement 
                  by creating the highly popular &quot;dolphin safe&quot; labeling 
                  program, which outlawed the use of the label for tuna caught 
                  using encirclement nets. In 1992, Congress banned the U.S. sale 
                  of all tuna that was not &quot;dolphin safe.&quot; </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mexico and 
                  several other countries challenged the ban as a violation of 
                  the GATT. In 1991, a GATT tribunal ruled that U.S. law violated 
                  GATT rules because it treated physically identical &quot;goods&quot; 
                  - tuna - differently according to the manner in which they were 
                  caught, harvested or processed. Even though such &quot;process 
                  and production&quot; distinctions are vital to many environmental 
                  and other laws, the GATT tribunal ruled that the United States 
                  was allowed to protect dolphins only through &quot;less trade 
                  restrictive measures.&quot; The panel also ruled that under 
                  trade rules, a country may not set regulations on its own markets 
                  that have implications reaching beyond its borders.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Initially, 
                  the United States did not change its dolphin law to conform 
                  with the GATT ruling. The fight over congressional approval 
                  of the NAFTA becoming heated and the Clinton administration 
                  thought that gutting a popular dolphin protection because of 
                  a trade ruling in a case brought by Mexico would threaten congressional 
                  approval of NAFTA. The 1991 GATT case had achieved a high profile 
                  because it was the first obvious attack on an environmental 
                  policy brought under the authority of a trade pact. But GATT 
                  rules required a consensus, which the United States could block, 
                  before sanctions could be levied.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But in 
                  1995, the dispute resolution rules changed drastically with 
                  the formation of the WTO, which had been created by the Uruguay 
                  Round of the GATT and approved by Congress the previous year. 
                  The WTO featured an automatically binding dispute resolution 
                  system, meaning the United States lost its ability to keep the 
                  dolphin policy without suffering sanctions.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1995, 
                  with NAFTA already implemented and the WTO in effect, Mexico 
                  threatened to bring a challenge to the WTO over the United States' 
                  continuing failure to implement the 1991 GATT dolphin ruling. 
                  To avoid the embarrassing spectacle of being ordered by the 
                  WTO to &quot;kill Flipper,&quot; the Clinton administration 
                  sought to weaken the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Shortly after 
                  the 1996 election, President Clinton wrote a personal letter 
                  to then-Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo declaring that within 
                  30 days of his new term, he would bring the U.S. marine mammal 
                  law into compliance with the 1991 GATT ruling.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through 
                  1996, a coalition of consumer, environmental and wildlife groups 
                  fought to uphold the law in Congress. In 1997, after an even 
                  bigger push by the Clinton administration, this time directly 
                  led by Vice President Al Gore and then-Undersecretary of State 
                  Timothy Wirth, Congress amended the Marine Mammal Protection 
                  Act. After skirmishes in court, the embargo against tuna caught 
                  with purse seines was lifted. However, tuna caught in ways that 
                  killed dolphins could not use the coveted &quot;dolphin safe&quot; 
                  label - making it considerably less marketable. The law stipulated 
                  that tuna caught with encirclement nets could be labeled &quot;dolphin 
                  safe&quot; only if a special dolphin safety observer (on boats 
                  as long as a football field) witnessed no dolphins deaths. The 
                  change to the definition &quot;dolphin safe&quot; was to go 
                  into effect only if a National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) 
                  study mandated by the new legislation concluded that there were 
                  no detrimental impacts on dolphin populations by encirclement 
                  tuna fishing if certain techniques, such as divers, were used 
                  to free trapped animals.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In April 
                  1999, then-Commerce Secretary William Daley announced that based 
                  on the results of NMFS' preliminary report, it would implement 
                  the 1997 amendment effective February 2, 2000. This would mean 
                  that the labeling standard for &quot;dolphin safe&quot; tuna 
                  would be weakened from a standard of &quot;no encirclement fishing&quot; 
                  to &quot;no observed dolphin deaths.&quot; The Mexican government 
                  welcomed the tardy implementation of the GATT order.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, 
                  in August 1999, environmentalists led by Earth Island Institute 
                  filed suit against the Commerce Department, arguing that Daley 
                  had acted arbitrarily and ignored scientific evidence when he 
                  promulgated the new regulation. The change in dolphin labeling 
                  was temporarily stayed. In April 2000, a U.S. district court 
                  ruled against the Commerce Department. In July 2001, the 9th 
                  U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling. The Mexican 
                  government revived its threats of a new WTO case.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mexican 
                  tuna could still be imported under the law the Clinton administration 
                  had persuaded Congress to pass. It just could not be labeled 
                  &quot;dolphin safe.&quot; Mexico argued that this situation 
                  did not satisfy the GATT ruling of 1991 and continued to hold 
                  the threat of a WTO case over the United States' head.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Watching 
                  two different administrations scramble to kill a popular domestic 
                  law at the mere threat of WTO action puts into perspective why 
                  so many countries no longer wait for a formal WTO challenge 
                  before weakening laws under attack.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2002, 
                  Commerce Secretary Donald Evans attempted to introduce identical 
                  regulations as the Daley rules to change the definition of &quot;dolphin 
                  safe&quot; to comply with Mexico's GATT-WTO demands. Last September, 
                  NMFS released the final report on dolphin populations required 
                  by the 1997 statute. The report found that dolphin stocks are 
                  depleted, that purse seine nets exert stress on dolphins and 
                  that dolphins are not recovering. However, another study required 
                  by the 1997 statute found that &quot;purse-seine fishery is 
                  not having a significant adverse impact on any depleted dolphin

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the basis 
                  of this latter report, on Dec. 31, 2002, Secretary Evans announced 
                  the Commerce Department would allow &quot;dolphin safe&quot; 
                  labels on tuna caught using the dolphin encirclement technique. 
                  Environmental groups filed suit and a temporary stay was granted 
                  in early January 2003. A hearing in the case is now scheduled 
                  on April 7 in San Francisco.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is easy 
                  to lose track of why three presidents, four U.S. trade representatives, 
                  five U.S. Congresses, and three Mexican presidents have been 
                  working diligently to undermine a remarkably successful U.S. 
                  environmental law. But in the end, these most recent and perhaps 
                  dolphin-deadly developments illustrate how indeed so-called 
                  trade agreements do undermine vital domestic environmental and 
                  other public interest policies.</font></p>
