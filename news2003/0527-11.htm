- May 27 - Following is Volume II
of WildFire Watch:
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 20th, President Bush touted his so-called Healthy
Forest Initiative and expressed his support for the Healthy
Forest Restoration Act of 2003 (HR 1904), claiming the two
proposals would reduce the risk of wildfires in our National
Forests. Unfortunately, both fail to focus on protecting
families, homes, and communities that are threatened by
wildfires, and instead benefit the timber industry. In his
remarks at the White House, President Bush made a number of
misleading claims both about his Healthy Forest Initiative and
the Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HR 1904). Here are the facts:
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Statement:
"The Healthy Forest Initiative that I announced last summer is
making American woodlands more safe, acre by acre."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Facts:
Although President Bush stressed his commitment to a
responsible approach to protecting our forests, his approach is
failing to protect both our communities and our forests.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Between FY 2001 and FY 2002, funding for Wildland Fire
Management has decreased in both the Department of the Interior
(DOI) and USDA/Forest Service. Under President Bush's
leadership, the DOI's fire management budgets have been cut by
nearly $300 million, while the Forest Services budgets were
slashed by over $320 million. (FY2000-FY 2002 Wildland Fire
Management Appropriations, Department of the Interior and Forest
Service, <a href="http://www.fireplan.gov" target="_new">http://www.fireplan.gov</a>)
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In addition, budget requests to fund the Department of
Interior's Hazardous Fuel Reduction programs have seen absolutely
no increases since FY 2002, when $186 million was requested. Not
only have budget requests remained stagnant, but the Department
of the Interior's budget for Hazardous Fuel Reduction was
actually cut between FY 2001 and FY 2002 (USDA/Forest Service and
Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management Budget
Justifications, FY 2001 to FY 2004; FY2000-FY 2002 Wildland Fire
Management Appropriations, Department of the Interior and Forest
Service, <a href="http://www.fireplan.gov" target="_new">http://www.fireplan.gov</a>)
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Jerry Taylor, The CATO Institute's Director of Natural
Resource Studies, responded to President Bush's false claim that
his approach would protect forests, saying "The federal
government reports that 70 million acres of federal lands need
immediate thinning and another 140 million acres must be thinned
soon. The president's plan to thin 25 million acres in the next
10 years will cost as much as $4 billion yet leave nearly 90
percent of those acres untreated. That will leave forest homes
almost as defenseless as they are today." (Administration's
Forest Plan Doomed to Fail, "Forests Initiative" Will Leave 90
Percent of Acres Vulnerable to Fires, 5/20/03;
<a href="http://www.cato.org" target="_new">http://www.cato.org</a>)
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Taylor went on to say, "A recent Forest Service report
estimates there are just 1.9 million high-risk acres with homes
and other structures near federal lands. To defend homes and
communities, we should treat those acres and fireproof the homes.
That could be done in just one or two years at a tiny fraction of
the cost of the president's plan." (Administration's Forest Plan
Doomed to Fail, "Forests Initiative" Will Leave 90 Percent of
Acres Vulnerable to Fires, 5/20/03; <a href="http://www.cato.org" target="_new">http://www.cato.org</a>)
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Statement:
"This bill sets priorities for forest management by
authorizing work in the areas that are closest to rural
communities, and work where there's the greatest risk for
environmental damage."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Facts:
The Administration's forest policy fails to set clear
priorities. In fact, the Healthy Forest Restoration Act provides
little assistance to those families and communities most at-risk
from wildfire and instead directly benefits the timber industry.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- A January 2002 General Accounting Office (GAO) report notes
that federal agencies have failed to identify and prioritize
high-risk communities. "Therefore, it is not possible to
determine if the $796 million appropriated for hazardous fuel
reduction in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 was targeted to the
communities and other areas at highest risk of severe wildfires.
(General Accounting Office, "Severe Wildland Fires" GAO-02-259,
page 4.January 2002.)
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- During the fiscal year 2002, just over a third of the acres
where the Forest Service planned to reduce hazardous fuels were
in areas in and around communities. In 2003, the agency's plan is
for only 55 percent of acres mitigated to be in "wildland-urban"
areas. (USDA Forest Service, FY 2003 President's Budget
Overview," page B-13. February 4, 2002)
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth testified in June 2002
that the most effective means of reducing the risk of fires to
western communities is through careful thinning of small diameter
trees near homes and towns. (Dale Bosworth, Testimony before
House Subcommittee on Forests and Forest Health, June 12, 2002)
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Furthermore, the Forest Service's Fire Science Laboratory
found that the most critical steps to protecting homes and lives
are 1) to clear away fuels from within 100-200 feet of homes, and
2) to fireproof buildings. (USDA Forest Service, "Reducing the
Wildfire Threat to Homes: Where and How Much?" Cohen, Jack D.
1999)
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- On May 14, 2003, the GAO released findings on the analysis
of fuel reduction projects conducted under the National Fire Plan
in fiscal years 2001 and 2002. Only 1.5 million of the 4.7
million acres treated were located within the wildland-urban
interface (GAO-03-689R, page 3-4)
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Statement:
"The Healthy Forest Restoration Act helps the people closest
to the problem by allowing local citizens to help plan projects
for nonprofit, for profit, and for stewardship groups."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Facts:
The Administration's forest policy actually undermines the
right of public participation and gives agencies broad discretion
to prioritize projects in remote areas of public land. The
legislation calls for expedited procedures for fuel reduction at
an unspecified distance from communities, allowing the Forest
Service to log far from the homes and communities most threatened
by fire, and does not specifically direct the Forest Service to
do Fuels Reduction projects close to threatened homes.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Far from allowing increased local participation, the Healthy
Forest Restoration Act of 2003 would seriously undermine
citizens' ability to participate in the decision-making process
and directly contradicts the Western Governors' Association's
(WGA) strategy for consensus and community-based planning.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In fact, former Governor John Kitzhaber, of Oregon, wrote a
letter to Reps McInnis and Walden, disputing their claim that the
Healthy Forest Restoration Act is based on the strategy laid out
in the Western Governor's Association 10-Year Comprehensive
Study. Ktizhaber wrote, "I am very concerned that this
legislation will be perceived by the public as a way to reduce or
avoid legitimate public participation in and review of . . .
important projects." (Letter from John A Kitzhaber, May 15, 2003,
available at <a href="http://www.wildfirecentral.org">http://www.wildfirecentral.org</a>)
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the last two years, the GAO has conducted two independent
studies that demonstrate there is no evidence that wildfire
prevention efforts are hampered by public involvement or the
appeals process. The current GAO report is the third independent
study that undermines the claims that public involvement hinders
wildfire prevention.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The May 14, 2003 study from the GAO found that more than 95
percent of the 762 hazardous fuels reduction projects reviewed by
the GAO -- covering some 4.7 million acres of federal forest
lands -- were ready for implementation within the standard 90 day
review period (724 out of 762). Less than three percent of
protects were litigated. (GAO-03-689R, pages 1-5)
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- An August 31, 2001 GAO report demonstrated that over 99
percent of fuel reduction projects proposed by the Forest Service
for fiscal years 2000-2001 went through without appeal, and none
were litigated. The Forest Service proposed implementing 1,671
hazardous fuel reduction projects during that period. Of those,
only 20 (or 1 percent) had been appealed by any interested party,
including recreation groups, conservationists, industry interests
or individuals. (General Accounting Office, "Fuel Reduction
Projects" GAO-01-114R, August 31, 2001)
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Statement:
"Sound science shows that we can prevent such fires by
managing forests with controlled fire, cleaning out the
underbrush and thinning the areas that are vulnerable to intense
fires and insect attacks."
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Facts:
The facts show that Bush's statement is misleading. The
Administration's forest policy is not based on the best available
"sound science" and will fail to control the threat of wildland
fire. No single cause can explain the variety or number of
wildfires that may occur. Therefore, solutions must be determined
on a case-by-case basis. There is no simple, proven prescription
for meeting the threat of wildfires and solutions require
treatments adjusted to local needs.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The Forest Service's Fire Science Laboratory found that the
most critical steps to protecting homes and lives are 1) to clear
away fuels from within 100-200 feet of homes, and 2) to fireproof
buildings. (USDA Forest Service, "Reducing the Wildfire Threat to
Homes: Where and How Much?" Cohen, Jack D. 1999)

that the most effective means of reducing the risk of fires to
western communities is through careful thinning of small diameter
trees near homes and towns. (Dale Bosworth, Testimony before
House Subcommittee on Forests and Forest Health, June 12, 2002)
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- An August, 2002 study by the Center for Biological
Diversity revealed similar findings. The study found that
protecting houses and communities from the threat of forest fire
depends on the proper treatment of the Community Protection Zone
-- the area directly adjacent to homes and communities.
According to the study, the protection of houses depends entirely
on treatment of the home ignition zone -- the house itself and
the area within 60 meters of the home. (Center for Biological
Diversity, The Community Protection Zone: Defending Houses and
Communities from the Threat of Forest Fire, Brian Nowicki, August
2002)
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Most importantly, the study showed that the largest
community protection zone required under maximal conditions is
less than 500 meters wide. However, most communities require
treatment extending less than 400 meters from the house. (Center
for Biological Diversity, The Community Protection Zone:
Defending Houses and Communities from the Threat of Forest Fire,
Brian Nowicki, August 2002)
