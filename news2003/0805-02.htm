- August 5 - Calling the sentence in Jakarta's last trial on East Timor &quot;ajoke,&quot; the East Timor Action Network (ETAN) today urged the United States 
and United Nations to guarantee real justice for East Timor by establishing 
an international tribunal.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The punishment does not fit the crime,&quot; said John M. Miller, spokesperson for ETAN. &quot;Today's 3-year sentence for General Damiri is a joke and has 
done nothing to boost the laughable credibility of Indonesia's court. The 
international community has been taken for a ride. The question is: 'What 
is it going to do about it?'&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;An international tribunal is needed if the many victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity in East Timor are to see genuine justice. The East 
Timorese deserve no less than Iraqis, Rwandans, and Bosnians. The Bush 
administration must work to create an international tribunal for East 
Timor,&quot; added Miller.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesia's Ad Hoc Human Rights Court for East Timor convicted Major General Adam Damiri and sentenced him to three years in prison for failing 
to control his troops in 1999, when he was commander of the region which included East Timor. The prosecutors, who had consistently presented weak 
and misleading cases, last month urged that charges against Damiri be 
dropped. The widely-criticized court had delayed its verdict after Damiri missed several court appearances. Damiri said he was busy with preparations 
for the current military (TNI) assault on Aceh, the largest operation since the 1975 invasion of East Timor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In late February, the joint UN-East Timor Serious Crimes Unit indicted 
Damiri for crimes against humanity for murder, deportation and persecution. 
He and other Indonesian officers are accused of funding, arming, training and directing the militia in the systematic campaign of violence in 1999.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesia set up the court to deflect calls in early 2000 for an 
international tribunal. The United Nations said at the time that the Indonesian judicial process must be credible and that it would revisit the 
question of justice at the end of the Jakarta trials.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spokespeople for ETAN are available for interviews. ETAN works with civil society in East Timor and Indonesia in calling for an 
international tribunal to prosecute crimes against humanity that took place 
in East Timor since 1975 (see www.etan.org).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 18 people tried by the ad hoc court, all but 6 were acquitted. All but one of those convicted received less than the legal minimum sentence, 
and all remain free pending appeal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During its illegal occupation of the island nation from 1975 to 1999, the 
Indonesian military was responsible for the deaths of more than one-third of the population (200,000 people). After the East Timorese people voted for independence in 1999, the Indonesian military retaliated by killing 
more than one thousand people, raping hundreds of women and girls and 
destroying most of the country's infrastructure. In the months following </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1999's devastation, two UN bodies called for the establishment of an 
international tribunal. Instead, Indonesia promised to try its own and 
eventually established the Ad Hoc Human Rights Court for East Timor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Indonesian court has been criticized for its limited mandate, with 
jurisdiction over only three of East Timor's 13 districts during just two 
months (April and September 1999) of a 24-year military occupation. 
Indonesia will not try anyone for the many atrocities that occurred outside 
of these very narrow time periods and locations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The defendants were primarily accused of failing to prevent the actions of 
others rather than for acts they may have directly committed. The 
prosecution repeatedly described the violence in 1999 as the result of 
conflict among East Timorese factions and portrayed the UN administration 
of the referendum as biased and anti-Indonesian.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">None of the top-ranking officers and officials named by Indonesia's own
human rights commission in January 2000 was seriously investigated, much less indicted. Powerful military officers routinely attended the court in 
an effort to intimidate. Fearing for their safety, most East Timorese 
witnesses called to testify refused. Those who did were harassed. The 
prosecution failed to make use of vast amounts of UN documentation available to them as evidence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The joint UN-East Timor Serious Crimes Unit has indicted a number of 
high-ranking Indonesian officials, including General Wiranto, the commander-in-chief and defense minister in 1999. However, Indonesia refuses 
to extradite anyone to East Timor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this year, former Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid called the 
Indonesian court &quot;corrupt.&quot; He said it &quot;has no rigor or influence. 
Everything can be bought and while things are like this it will not be 
possible to achieve justice for Timor.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In legislation passed last month, the U.S. House of Representatives said Indonesia's ad hoc court had &quot;inadequately brought to justice the 
perpetrators&quot; of crimes in 1999 and called on the State Department &quot;to push 
for a comprehensive United Nations review&quot; of the ad hoc court on East 
Timor and &quot;to consider alternative mechanisms of justice for East Timor, </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">including the establishment of an ad hoc international tribunal.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In late June, 14 U.S. Senators said that &quot;the international community has a 
responsibility to ensure justice&quot; for East Timor. They wrote Secretary of State Colin Powell to urge &quot;the administration to work towards the 
establishment of an international tribunal...&quot; The letter stated that the 
United States &quot;should not abrogate international responsibility to the 
just-born East Timorese government, with its limited political, economic, and human resources... [and] should clearly communicate to East Timor's government and the UN Secretary-General that it supports justice and 
opposes immunity in these cases&quot; dating back to 1975.  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In late May, 90 U.S.-based religious leaders and organizations issued a 
similar call.</font></p>
