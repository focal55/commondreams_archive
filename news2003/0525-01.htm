-  
May 25  - On Sunday, May 25, at about 4 pm, four Catholic Workers, calling themselves 
the Riverside Ploughshares, went aboard the USS Philippine Sea during the 
16th Annual Fleet Week hosted by the Intrepid Museum in New York City.  
During a tour of the USS Philippine Sea, Sr. Susan Clarkson, Mark Colville, 
Brian Buckley, and Joan Gregory poured their blood and hammered on the 
missile hatches that hold Tomahawk Cruise Missiles.  Kneeling on top of the 
missile hatches, Mark Colville held up pictures of Iraqi children who had 
been injured and maimed by US weapons. Mark read the statement the group had 
written, and read from the scriptures.  Brian unfurled their banner which 
read, "Riverside Ploughshares: Disarm and Choose Life."
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Catholic Workers said that they came to the Fleet Week event to enflesh the words of the prophet Isaiah to "hammer swords into plowshares."  They believe that nonviolence will lead to peace, and that

violence will only lead to more violence.   They were arrested and
escorted 
off the ship into an awaiting  unmarked blue van.  The tour that the 
Catholic Workers were on was cut
short.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tomahawk cruise missiles are long range missiles that fly at a low altitude 
and therefore are difficult to detect.  The USS Philippine Sea has launched 
Tomahawk cruise missiles against the people of Iraq, Afghanistan, and 
Yugoslavia.   The ship has also been used to enforce the sanctions
against 
Iraq.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mark Colville, who lives at the Amistad Catholic Worker community in 
Connecticut, father of 6 children, said that "We cannot love neighbor or

enemy without disarming ourselves.  We cannot serve the poor without 
defending them against the violence of the state." We cannot affirm life

without standing directly, nonviolently in confrontation with all that deals 
death."
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Catholic Worker Movement, founded by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in

1933, is grounded in a firm belief in the God-given dignity of every human 
person.  Today over 185 Catholic Worker communities remain committed to 
nonviolence, voluntary poverty, prayer, and hospitality for the homeless, 
exiled, hungry, and foresaken. Catholic Workers continue to protest 
injustice, war, racism, and violence of all forms.

<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Riverside Ploughshares Statement</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
Fleet Week, New York City, May 2003
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We come here today to enflesh the prophecy from Isaiah, "They shall beat

their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks" (2:4).  
With hammers we have initiated the process of disarming this battle ship, of 
transforming this carrier of mass destruction into a vessel for peace. The 
USS Philippine Sea uses Tomahawk cruise missiles, depleted uranium munitions 
and the Aegis radar system to enforce the US Empire's will on other nations 
and regions. We pour our blood on this ship to reveal the blood of the 
innocent already shed by the use of this weaponry.  We also pour our blood 
to repent for our complicity in the pervasive violence of our world.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are trying to follow Jesus Christ's commandments to love our enemies and 
neighbors, to forgive those who do us harm and to repent. We seek to stop 
the injury of war on the human family and heal our communities by living
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">nonviolently and seeking justice for all. The peace and security that comes 
from an empire wielding weapons of war and intimidation are false and 
illusory. With hammers we disarm this weapon of mass destruction and with 
blood we reveal its purpose.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the spirit of Dorothy Day, who co-founded with Peter Maurin, the Catholic 
Worker in New York City seventy years ago, we try in our daily lives to 
practice the Works of Mercy, set out in Matthew, Chapter 25.  We feel that 
to follow God's will we must do more than serve the broken of our society. 
It is also our duty to challenge, as Christ did, that which causes poverty. 
Until we convert weapons that end life into tools that enhance life, poverty 
will continue to cripple our society.  For this we pray and for this we act. We are Susan Clarkson, Mark Colville, Joan Gregory and Brian Buckley from 
urban and rural Catholic Worker communities.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"I feel urged to act today because of the exposure I've had over the past 
three years to the charism of the Catholic Worker.  The recent horrors of 
the massacres in Afghanistan and Iraq, the iniquitous sanctions imposed on 
Iraq since the first Gulf War, and my own Government's shameful alliance

with the US, against the wishes of the majority of the British public, 
compels me to take this step of symbolic and practical disarmament, united 
with my American brothers and sisters."                    </i>Sr. Susan

has been in her religious congregation for thirty-seven years and has been a 
member of the Dorothy Day Catholic Worker community in Washington DC since 
May 2002.  She sees her part in this ploughshares action as a coming 
together of many strands in her life: her religious vocation; peace activism 
in Britain; long time membership of the British Campaign for Nuclear 
Disarmament; an M.A in Peace Studies; work with young people in the 
industrial North of England and with homeless people in London.

<i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The example of Christ is clear:  We cannot love neighbor or enemy without 
disarming ourselves.  We cannot serve the poor without defending them 
against the violence of the state.  We cannot affirm life without standing 
directly, nonviolently in confrontation with all that deals death.  War is 
the worship of death.  Preparation for war is the denial of God. Therefore 
I join the Riverside Ploughshares in an act of faith, offered to God as a 
plea for the lives of my children, and all children.  Disarm.  Choose Life.  
AMEN."</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
