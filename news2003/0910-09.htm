-  
September 10 - On September 7, 2003, George W. Bush spoke to the nation about the &quot;war on terror,&quot; and particularly about the new &quot;terror front,&quot; Iraq. It is 
obvious that Bush is still listening to former corporation heads, military 
planners, and advisers who have oil tankers named after them.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         But not to ordinary people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         The Bush administration is not listening to the thousands of 
people who lost their jobs last month, or the hundreds of thousands who 
have lost their pensions as more and more money is taken from the people's 
economy and put into the war economy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Bush is about to ask Congress for an additional $87 billion to 
fight against and kill people in Iraq. That request alone accounts for 
twenty percent of all federally funded programs for the people. Spread out 
over the five months we've been in occupation of Iraq, it works out to be 
about $402,000 a minute-and that's not counting the cost of the invasion, 
with its &quot;extra&quot; budgetary request of nearly $75 billion. The 
administration is not listening to teachers, or students and their parents, 
who would tell him what they could accomplish with all that money. Or to 
graduates with student loans. Or to people struggling with staggering 
housing costs. Or to people without medical insurance-ordinary people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Nor is the administration listening to New Yorkers, who bore, and 
continue to bear, the brunt of the September 11 attacks. The New York City 
Council joined dozens of other cities across the nation and voted against 
the invasion of Iraq last March 13, reflecting New York City polls that 
counted nearly 75 percent of the people against the invasion. &quot;We of all 
cities,&quot; said City Councilmember Alan Gerson, &quot;must uphold the preciousness 
and sanctity of human life.&quot; Since that day, New York has led the economic 
decline, left to fall with less and less support from the federal 
government. This week, a New York Times poll showed that now, after the 
invasion of Iraq, more New Yorkers are afraid of a terrorist attack than 
they were the year before. A new national poll shows that more people think 
that the invasion of Iraq has increased the risk of terror, rather than 
decreased it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Well, ordinary people would say, it makes sense to be more afraid. 
If you send hundreds of thousands of troops into a place, bombing and 
shooting, destroying cities and buildings and lives, collapsing a 
government and bringing massive internal chaos-and then delay and delay in 
restoring order and power and clean water and medicine-ordinarily, people 
will get upset with you. If the administration had listened to those in the 
peace movement who had gone to Iraq and talked to the ordinary people 
there, it would have known that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         In fact, we were not suffering any terrorist attacks in Iraq 
before the invasion (or in Afghanistan either, for that matter). Now we 
are. And under the constant threat of the terrifying situation the invasion 
has created, &quot;coalition&quot; troops (who are most often ordinary people under 
the command of their officers or of fear) fire upon buildings and crowds, 
killing civilians. And that gets more people upset, and wanting to drive 
the United States out. Troops parade Iraqi arrestees blindfolded or naked 
into the streets, or they pat down the women, searching for weapons, and 
mortally insult the families, creating lethal hostility.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         And what is the administration's solution to this? Hire the 
Mukhabarat, the Iraqi secret police, to find out who is behind these lethal 
attacks. But wait-wasn't that one of the ex post facto justifications for 
the invasion: To end that kind of tyranny? And, ordinary people might 
continue to ask, where are the weapons of mass destruction that we went to 
war to destroy? In the mind of those advisers, maybe. By the way, is there 
a rule that says that we can go over there and kill their civilians, but 
they can't come over here and kill our civilians? Maybe we could ask the 
administration about that-if only it were listening to ordinary people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Now the administration wants to go to the United Nations to ask 
for help. Ordinary people urged Bush to do that before he went to war. But 
when it was clear that 11 of the 15 members of the Security Council would 
not authorize an illegal invasion, the Bush administration never brought it 
to a vote, and the killing commenced.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         And continues-more U.S. dead than before &quot;major hostilities 
ended,&quot; according to Bush. And, since no one is keeping count of the Iraqis 
who are dying during and since the invasion, who knows how many of them? 
Does the administration want the United Nations to legitimate the U.S. 
occupation? Bush wants U.N. members to supply troops (more ordinary people), but put under U.S. command. That way, not so many ordinary Americans will be killing and dying, because ordinary people from other 
countries will. That ought to &quot;mend the fences&quot; among our allies after Bush 
did not listen to them before the war, right? How much U.S. pressure and 
money will have to be employed (and how many more ordinary people will have 
to be unemployed) before other governments agree to that? But the 
administration is not listening to the kind of questions ordinary people 
would ask.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Here is something else they probably won't listen to. The Iraqis 
never attacked us-not on September 11 or any other time. We attacked them: 
in the first Gulf War, then in twelve years of bombing and sanctions that 
human rights observers called &quot;genocidal,&quot; and now with this invasion and 
occupation. And yet those in the peace movement who go over to Iraq find an 
astonishing wellspring of good will toward the U.S. people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         Ordinary people know that making and keeping friends is hard work. 
And when you hurt a friend, you say you're sorry, and try to make it up to 
them. In the case of Iraq, that would mean a program of reparations for all 
our attacks. It would mean funding a nonviolent international body, chosen 
by Iraqis, to help Iraqis reconstruct the people's economy so devastated by 
invasions, sanctions and bombing. It would mean returning the 
reconstruction effort to ordinary Iraqis, not to White House crony 
corporations and the Vichy-style occupation government in Iraq. And of 
course, it would mean an end to the occupation. All that would cost a lot 
less than the ongoing war and occupation, and reclaim for us the friendship 
we used to have with the Iraqi people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         The War Resisters League believes that such a program, with the 
help of the entire international community, is the way to overcome terror. 
Really, ordinary people would tell the administration, the way to make sure 
there is no &quot;terror front&quot; in Iraq is to treat ordinary people with dignity 
and even humility; make them your friends.</font></p>
