                - March 13 - With the United States poised to attack Iraq to disarm 
                it of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD), the Nuclear Program 
                at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) thought it was time 
                for a clear-eyed look at the potential consequences of using biological, 
                chemical or nuclear weapons in a U.S.-Iraqi war. Using satellite 
                imagery and special computer software developed by the Defense 
                Department, NRDC experts have run simulations of a number of plausible 
                scenarios that would threaten Iraqi troops and civilians, U.S. 
                and allied troops, and Israeli citizens. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How likely 
                is it for Iraq to resort to using weapons of mass destruction? 
                Most experts believe that Iraq does not possess nuclear weapons 
                or the capability to produce them anytime soon. Furthermore, either 
                out of fear of retaliation or the inability to effectively employ 
                them, Iraq did not use chemical or biological weapons during the 
                1991 Persian Gulf War against coalition forces or Israel. But 
                this time may be different. The U.S. objective of overthrowing 
                Saddam Hussein might prompt him to use chemical or biological 
                weapons -- if he possesses them. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If Hussein 
                did use chemical or biological weapons, how should the United 
                States respond? Both President Bush and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld 
                have stated that they reserve the right to use whatever is necessary 
                in Iraq, including nuclear weapons. The United States also is 
                considering using nuclear weapons -- so-called "bunker busters" 
                -- against deep underground military facilities. After weighing 
                the relative threats of battlefield biological and chemical weapons 
                compared to nuclear weapons, NRDC has concluded that any American 
                use of nuclear weapons in retaliation to a chemical or biological 
                attack would be a disproportionate response. It also would encourage 
                other nations to acquire and use nuclear weapons. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How NRDC Does 
                WMD Computer Simulations NRDC performed its calculations using 
                a Department of Defense computer code called HPAC, which is an 
                acronym for Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability. HPAC 
                is actually a large collection of computer models primarily intended 
                to assist the Pentagon in planning U.S. attacks against targets 
                that house nuclear, biological or chemical materials. Secondarily, 
                HPAC supports emergency response to accidents or terrorist attacks 
                at chemical, biological and nuclear facilities in the United States. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the HPAC 
                computer models, how and where a biological or chemical agent 
                disperses depends on atmospheric conditions (temperature, winds 
                and humidity) and the terrain (e.g., vegetation or desert). HPAC 
                models include the physical properties and toxic effects of a 
                wide variety of chemical and biological agents, as well as basic 
                data about the use of these agents in weapons (e.g., typical chemical 
                or biological fills for bombs, rockets or mortars). HPAC also 
                can calculate the effects of nuclear explosions -- blast, thermal, 
                initial radiation and fallout. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scenarios Involving 
                Chemical and Biological Weapons Chemical weapon systems come in 
                many forms, from long-range systems such as attack aircraft and 
                ballistic and cruise missiles, to shorter-range systems such as 
                artillery, multiple rocket launchers and mortars. Chemical attacks 
                are more militarily effective if they occur over large areas for 
                long durations and therefore require large quantities of the agent. 
                Biological and toxin weapons can be in the form of bombs, missiles, 
                artillery rounds or aircraft spray tanks. For a weapon to effectively 
                disperse a biological agent, it would have to produce a cloud 
                of suspended microscopic droplets (each droplet containing minute 
                quantities of the biological agent) and keep the agent alive long 
                enough after delivery to cause infection. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iraq has had 
                extensive experience with chemical weapons on the battlefield 
                and against civilian populations. During the Iran-Iraq war in 
                the 1980s, Iraq used chemical weapons to repel enemy advances 
                or "prepare" an area for an offensive. Following such an attack, 
                Iraqi forces would wait for favorable winds or for the effects 
                of the agent to diminish before moving into the attacked area. 
                Nonetheless, large numbers of Iraqi troops were inadvertently 
                killed as a result of these chemical tactics. By the end of the 
                Iran-Iraq war, Iraqi forces routinely used chemical weapons. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response 
                to the public controversy over the Gulf War Syndrome, the federal 
                government declassified a large number of documents on Iraqi weapons 
                of mass destruction, which are available online. According to 
                these and other materials, Iraq's "preferred" delivery system 
                for chemical agents are 155-mm artillery guns with about 3 kilograms 
                of GB (sarin), GF (cyclosarin) or HD (sulfur mustard) agent per 
                shell. Iraq likely used these same agents in ballistic-missile 
                warheads, with 500 to 600 kilograms of agent in the short-range 
                (300 km-range) Scud B warheads and up to half of that in the longer-range 
                (Al Husayn or Al Abbas) missile warheads. Iraq did not fire missiles 
                with chemical or biological weapons during the Persian Gulf War. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iraq is known 
                to have weaponized biological agents in the form of bombs. Recently 
                U.S. intelligence has emphasized the possibility that Iraq's remotely 
                piloted vehicles could deliver either chemical or biological agents 
                using spray tanks. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Using HPAC, 
                NRDC calculated the consequences of Iraqi chemical artillery and 
                ballistic missile attacks. NRDC also calculated what would happen 
                if U.S. or Iraqi forces destroyed biological weapons facilities 
                and released anthrax, or Iraqi forces delivered anthrax using 
                a remotely piloted vehicle. NRDC concluded that chemical weapons 
                represent much less of a threat than biological agents. The number 
                of infections from either accidental or deliberate release of 
                anthrax could number in the hundreds of thousands, whereas even 
                an intense barrage of chemical artillery or an attack using a 
                chemical ballistic missile warhead might result in thousands of 
                casualties for unprotected individuals. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nuclear Attacks 
                Versus Chemical and Biological Attacks In his 1998 book, "Chemical-Biological 
                Defense: U.S. Military Policies and Decisions in the Gulf War," 
                Albert Mauroni, a career U.S. military officer and an expert in 
                chemical and biological warfare, downplayed the threat of such 
                weapons on the battlefield: </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only if CB 
                [chemical and biological] weapons were used on civilians and population 
                centers, would they truly be "weapons of mass destruction." On 
                the military battlefield, these weapons, shorn of the ridiculous 
                air of menace given to them by politicians and the media, are 
                merely another tactical-operational factor like enemy air attacks 
                or unforeseen terrorist attacks; military forces can and do take 
                steps to minimize the effects of chemical-biological contamination. 
                If a military force invests a small amount of time and funds in 
                planning, defensive equipment and training, the immediate threat 
                of mass casualties is avoided, and chemical-biological weapons 
                become merely "weapons of mass disruption" instead of destruction. 
                It's really that simple -- if the military invests in equipment 
                and training, they maintain a viable combat force. If they do 
                not, their troops become as vulnerable as unprepared civilians. 
                Mauroni's view of chemical and biological warfare is characteristic 
                of current U.S. military thinking, and speaks to the issue of 
                whether a nuclear response by the United States would be warranted 
                and proportional to any Iraqi chemical or biological attack against 
                the U.S. military. A U.S. nuclear response, even one targeted 
                only at Iraqi military forces, could cause widespread fallout 
                and civilian casualties. A U.S. nuclear attack on Iraqi cities 
                would be catastrophic, killing millions of people. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other factors 
                could temper a nuclear response, such as the presence of U.S. 
                troops in areas where fallout might occur. Significantly, the 
                onset of disease from a biological attack and the full extent 
                of casualties would not be evident until days or weeks afterward, 
                during which time the war might progress to a point where nuclear 
                targeting of Iraq becomes impossible because of occupying allied 
                forces. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regardless, 
                last fall President Bush asked the Pentagon to plan for the use 
                of nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological weapon 
                attacks or even the mere threat of them. On September 14, he signed 
                a national security directive specifying two possible roles for 
                using nuclear weapons against adversaries such as Iraq: attacking 
                facilities located deep underground, and thwarting an enemy's 
                use of chemical or biological weapons. Merely planning to use 
                nuclear weapons could increase the likelihood that the president 
                would choose it as an option. At a time when the United States 
                should do everything it can to curb the spread of nuclear weapons, 
                planning for their use encourages proliferation and could prompt 
                other nations to consider nuclear weapons as just another option 
                on the battlefield. </font>
