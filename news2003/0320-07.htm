                Voluntary Cancellation of Virtually All Residential Uses of CCA-Treated 
                Wood </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contact: David 
                Deegan 202-564-7839 or deegan.dave@epa.gov </font> 
                <p></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 
                  17, EPA granted the voluntary cancellation and use termination 
                  requests affecting virtually all residential uses of chromated 
                  copper arsenate (CCA) treated wood. Under this action, affected 
                  CCA products cannot be used after Dec. 30, 2003 to treat lumber 
                  intended for use in most residential settings. This transition 
                  affects virtually all residential uses of wood treated with 
                  CCA, including play structures, decks, picnic tables, landscaping 
                  timbers, residential fencing, patios and walkways/boardwalks. 
                  This action was proposed in February 2002 by the registrants 
                  of CCA-pesticide products used to treat wood. Phase-out of the 
                  residential uses will reduce the potential exposure risks to 
                  arsenic, a known human carcinogen, thereby protecting human 
                  health, especially children's health and the environment. The 
                  current action follows up on the February 2002 publication of 
                  a notice of receipt of voluntary cancellation/use termination 
                  requests, which also provided an opportunity for public comments 
                  to be submitted to EPA. A notice of the cancellation order will 
                  be published shortly in the Federal Register, and that document 
                  will include the Agency's response to comments. Consumers may 
                  continue to buy and use the treated CCA wood for as long as 
                  it is available. The transition to using the new generation 
                  treatment products is well underway. The Agency is deferring 
                  any action on two uses involved in the termination requests, 
                  therefore wood used in permanent wood foundations and fence 
                  posts for agricultural uses may continue to be treated with 
                  CCA at this time. EPA is working with the registrant community 
                  and other stakeholders to ensure that safer, comparable alternatives 
                  will be available. EPA is continuing its work on an ongoing 
                  comprehensive reevaluation of CCA-treated wood that has been 
                  underway as part of the Agency's effort to reevaluate older 
                  pesticides to ensure that they meet current health and safety 
                  standards. More information on CCA treated wood is available

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA is working 
                  with other federal agencies, the states, tribes, water suppliers 
                  and the public to evaluate perchlorate - a component of rocket 
                  fuel - as an environmental contaminant. EPA has been revising 
                  its 2002 draft health risk assessment that contains preliminary 
                  risk estimates that could be used to establish an official reference 
                  dose for perchlorate. (A reference dose is a scientific estimate 
                  of a daily exposure level that is not expected to cause adverse 
                  health effects in humans). However, the 2002 health risk assessment 
                  is not final, and substantial uncertainties remain. EPA has 
                  decided to submit questions regarding perchlorate health science 
                  to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). EPA will not complete 
                  or disseminate a final risk assessment until the NAS scientific 
                  review is concluded and the NAS comments are addressed. Accordingly, 
                  EPA has reaffirmed that its 1999 guidance on perchlorate should 
                  remain in effect pending the outcome of the NAS study. EPA also 
                  is gathering data to determine whether a drinking water standard 
                  for perchlorate is appropriate. </font></p>

                  hazards that threaten the health of older persons, which include 
                  examining the impact a rapidly aging population will have on 
                  the environment and engaging older Americans to volunteer in 
                  their communities to reduce environmental hazards. EPA is encouraging 
                  public comment and participation in the development of the agenda. 
                  English- or Spanish-speaking callers may offer comments or request 
                  information regarding the National Agenda by calling 1-866-EPA-AGED. 
                  The line is open 24 hours a day, and a customer service representative 
                  will be available Monday - Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern 
                  Time. Callers may also register for six public listening sessions 
                  being held to collect input for the National Agenda. The meetings 
                  are scheduled for Tampa, Fla. (April 3); San Antonio, Texas 
                  (April 8); Iowa City, Iowa (April 15); Pittsburgh, Pa.(April 
                  23); Los Angeles, Calif. (April 29); and Baltimore, Md. (May 
                  7). Pre-registration is required to attend or to speak. An EPA 
                  web site describing the National Agenda was launched on March 
                  3, 2003 (<a href="http://www.epa.gov/aging" target="_new">http://www.epa.gov/aging</a>) 
                  and a Federal Register notice ? which is available on the web 
                  site ? soliciting public comment was issued on March 4, 2003. 
                  Comments on the National Agenda on the Environment and the Aging

                  government agencies and the electronics industry to offer citizens 
                  and small business opportunities to reuse and recycle old computer

                  sponsoring an electronics drop-off collection event this Sat., 
                  March 22, in Lindenwold, N.J., (near Camden) from 10 a.m. - 
                  3 p.m. All citizens in the Philadelphia area are invited to 
                  bring in their privately-owned computers and other consumer 
                  electronics for recycling and reuse. The eCycling program helps 
                  prevent toxic chemicals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and 
                  chromium from possibly endangering public health and the environment, 
                  and it saves precious landfill space. Launched in October 2001 
                  out of EPA's Mid-Atlantic regional office in Philadelphia, eCycling 
                  officials evaluate different methods of collecting end-of-life 
                  electronics, compile data about the costs of collecting, transporting 
                  and processing electronics and help define the roles and responsibilities 
                  of government, consumers, electronics manufacturers, retailers 
                  and recyclers in recycling. Using funds so far totaling at least 
                  half a million dollars from EPA, the Mid-Atlantic states, manufacturers 
                  and members of the Electronic Industries Alliance, eCycling 
                  held 45 drop-off events in 31 counties during the pilot project, 
                  collecting over 2700 tons of used electronics from Mid-Atlantic 
                  residents, and preventing over 22,000 cathode ray tubes (CRTs) 
                  in televisions from entering the region's landfills and incinerators. 
                  (CRTs are a source of the hazardous substance lead.) These collection 
                  events will continue to raise awareness of the need to recycle 
                  and reuse unwanted electronics, and will further enable government 
                  agencies to lead by example. All recyclers in the eCycling program 
                  using federal government money must certify that equipment is 
                  recycled safely and will not be dismantled or managed overseas. 
                  As part of these drop-off events, government and industry share 
                  the cost to collect, transport, and process the equipment, and 
                  electronics manufacturers Panasonic, Sharp and Sony pay to recycle 
                  their respective brands of electronics. The Electronic Industries 
                  Alliance, headquartered in Arlington, Va., is a partnership 
                  of electronic and high-tech associations and companies whose 
                  mission is promoting the market development and competitiveness 
                  of the U.S. high-tech industry through domestic and international 
                  policy efforts. For more information about these special electronics

                Waste Firm Owner Charged With Illegal Discharge to City Sewers 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David I. Kali, 
                former owner of Aseptic Services Inc., in Orem, Utah, was charged 
                with violating state pretreatment standards for allegedly discharging 
                wastes into publically owned sewage treatment systems. Aseptic 
                Services accepted approximately 300 boxes per month of medical 
                wastes from various federal medical facilities in Arizona, Utah 
                and Idaho. The wastes were incinerated and produced "quenching 
                fluid," which is a very caustic waste byproduct and contains chromium, 
                lead and zinc. Aseptic Services allegedly then discharged this 
                wastewater into the Orem City Sewers. The water container higher 
                than permitted levels of chromium, lead and zinc and was extremely 
                acidic, which then caused corrosion of the concrete sewer pipes 
                downstream from the Aseptic Services facility. The charged was 
                filed on March 10 in the Fourth Judicial District Court for Utah 
                County. The case was investigated jointly by EPA's Criminal Investigation 
                Division, the Utah Attorney General's Office and the FBI with 
                the assistance of the Orem Public Works Department; it will be 
                prosecuted by the Utah Attorney General's Office. The bringing 
                of charges is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed 
                innocent unless or until proven guilty in a court of law.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
