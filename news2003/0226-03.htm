                - February 26 - President George W. Bush is meeting today with 
                members of the Latino Coalition and others supporting the nomination 
                of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. 
                What President Bush will not tell Americans is that, contrary 
                to reports that the Hispanic community is evenly divided over 
                the Estrada nomination, a significant majority of major Hispanic 
                legal, civil rights, and worker rights organizations have joined 
                the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and other national and community 
                leaders in energetically opposing Estrada's confirmation. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is remarkable 
                hypocrisy and dishonesty demonstrated by those who complain that 
                the filibuster against Estrada's nomination is somehow unprecedented 
                or grounded in bigotry when many of the same people participated 
                in or supported filibusters and less public backroom blockades 
                against a number of President Clinton's well-qualified Hispanic 
                judicial nominees, some of whom never even got a hearing, and 
                some who were prevented from getting a vote for as long as four 
                years. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush 
                will probably not acknowledge that 15 former presidents of the 
                National Hispanic Bar Association recently signed a statement 
                opposing Estrada's nomination. They say Estrada's candidacy falls 
                short in the critical areas of having demonstrated a commitment 
                to the concept of equal opportunity and equal justice under the 
                law and the extent to which he has been involved in, supportive 
                of, and responsive to the issues, needs and concerns of Hispanic 
                Americans. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush 
                will most likely not call attention to the editorial published 
                by United Farm Workers Co-Founder Dolores Huerta decrying the 
                role that Estrada's nomination is playing in the larger effort 
                to shift the federal courts to the right. "To my friends who think 
                this is all about politicians fighting among themselves," she 
                wrote, "I ask you to think what would have happened over the last 
                40 years if the federal courts were fighting against workers' 
                rights and womens' rights and civil rights. And then think about 
                how quickly that could become the world we are living in." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush 
                will almost certainly not mention that in addition to the Congressional 
                Hispanic Caucus, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational 
                Fund (MALDEF), and the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education 
                Fund (PRLDEF), groups opposing Estrada's confirmation include 
                United Farm Workers of America, United States Hispanic Leadership 
                Institute, Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, 
                Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, La Raza Lawyers 
                Association of California, Farm Labor Organizing Committee, William 
                C. Velasquez Institute, Coalition of Immokalee Workers, PCUN (Pineros 
                y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste/ Northwest Treeplanters and Farmworkers 
                United), National Farm Worker Ministry, The Farmworker Association 
                of Florida, the California branch of the League of United Latin 
                American Citizens (LULAC) and LULAC of Montgomery County, Maryland. 
                These organizations and leaders have expressed their opposition 
                to Estrada's troubling record on issues facing the Hispanic community 
                such as discrimination and racial profiling, and his unwillingness 
                to discuss his judicial philosophy regarding constitutional law 
                and civil rights principles that are crucial to the protection 
                of individuals' civil rights. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush 
                will probably remain mum about the fact that Estrada's confirmation 
                is being aggressively championed by far-right organizations that 
                are trying to fill the federal courts with judges who embrace 
                the states' rights legal philosophy championed by the Federalist 
                Society of which Estrada is a member and by Supreme Court Justices 
                Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We sincerely 
                hope that Bush will not repeat the offensive suggestions by Republican 
                senators and former White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray that opposition 
                to Estrada's nomination is anti-Hispanic or motivated by bigotry 
                and a desire to deny job opportunities to Hispanic Americans. 
                The widespread opposition to Estrada's confirmation by so many 
                groups and individuals dedicated to promoting equal opportunity 
                and equality under the law makes it clear that that rhetoric is 
                unfair and untrue. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the 
                administration's allies on the Estrada nomination are conservative-leaning 
                business groups like the Latino Coalition and its affiliated Hispanic 
                Business Roundtable, which have been consistent cheerleaders for 
                the Bush administration's economic policies. The Latino Coalition 
                has accused the Senate of "racial profiling" of Hispanic judicial 
                nominations, but we have seen no evidence that the group, which 
                was founded in 1995, spoke out when the Republican-led Senate 
                blocked several well-qualified Hispanic appeals court nominees 
                from even getting a hearing or vote during the Clinton administration, 
                or denounced GOP senators for stalling the nomination of appeals 
                court nominee Richard Paez for four years. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lack of 
                credibility for accusations by the White House and Senate Republicans 
                that Estrada is being treated differently than other nominees 
                extends to other areas in which the facts have been made public 
                but Estrada's proponents keep sticking to the same misleading 
                talking points. Administration officials, for example, refuse 
                to acknowledge that there is ample precedent under both Republican 
                and Democratic administrations for the release of internal Justice 
                Department documents to senators evaluating judicial and other 
                high level nominees. Senator Patrick Leahy recently released documentation 
                for a number of examples in which the Senate has requested, and 
                past Justice Departments have provided, similar memoranda written 
                by Justice Department attorneys. The examples he cited included 
                the nominations of Robert Bork to become Associate Justice of 
                the Supreme Court; William Bradford Reynolds, Assistant Attorney 
                General for the Civil Rights Division, to become Associate Attorney 
                General; Benjamin Civiletti, nominated by President Carter to 
                become Attorney General; Stephen Trott, nominated to become a 
                judge in the Ninth Circuit; and then-Justice William Rehnquist, 
                who was nominated by President Reagan to become Chief Justice.
