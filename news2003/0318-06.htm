                YORK - March 18 - The American Civil Liberties Union today marks 
                the 40th anniversary of the historic Supreme Court decision in 
                Gideon v. Wainwright by calling on states to provide adequate 
                legal defense for the poor -- particularly those who face the 
                death penalty. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The landmark 
                1963 decision held that the Constitution guarantees every person 
                charged with a felony the right to an attorney even if he or she 
                cannot afford one. Subsequent cases have refined the ruling to 
                extend to misdemeanor cases and to require "competent" representation. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, 
                the promise of Gideon remains largely unfulfilled four decades 
                later because the legal representation many poor people receive 
                is grossly inadequate. Many states still do not have an indigent 
                defense system and rely instead on court-appointed attorneys who 
                are not required to meet any type of standard for competency. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ACLU has 
                developed a focused and sustained program of litigation and public 
                education aimed at improving indigent defense systems throughout 
                the nation. ACLU challenges to inadequate indigent defense programs 
                in Pennsylvania and Connecticut have brought about unprecedented 
                changes in each state’s public defender program. In both cases, 
                settlements have resulted in increased government funds flowing 
                into the representation of indigent defendants. Presently, the 
                ACLU is undertaking a series of non-litigation reform and public 
                education strategies in about 10 states. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nowhere is 
                the deficiency in counsel for the poor more sorely felt than in 
                the representation many people receive in capital cases. A glaring 
                example of this is the case of Delma Banks, Jr., a Texas man who 
                would be dead today if it weren’t for the last-minute stay he 
                received less than a week ago. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Banks had such 
                poor representation that former FBI Director and United States 
                District Judge William Sessions intervened and asked the Supreme 
                Court to temporarily stay his execution. As Judge Sessions wrote 
                in his brief, "When a criminal defendant is forced to pay with 
                his life for his lawyer’s errors, the effectiveness of the criminal 
                justice system as a whole is undermined." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Banks case 
                epitomizes the type of representation that poor people in capital 
                cases can expect -- especially in cases where the defendant is 
                black and the victim is white. The only evidence against Banks 
                was the testimony of an informant who received $200 and the dismissal 
                of an arson charge that could have gotten him a life sentence 
                as a habitual offender. Banks’ lawyer did not vigorously cross-examine 
                the informant, nor did he investigate the case. Had he done so, 
                he would have learned that Banks was in another city at the time 
                of the crime. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After a one-day 
                trial in which the prosecutors systematically struck all blacks 
                from the jury -- a move not challenged by Banks’ attorney -- Banks 
                was sentenced to death. Banks’ trial lawyer did not refute the 
                state’s claim that his client posed a "future danger to society" 
                -- a requirement for a death sentence in Texas - even though Banks 
                had no criminal record or history of violence. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Supreme 
                Court-the final protector of constitutional rights-has done little 
                to make good on Gideon’s guarantee of competent counsel. Last 
                year, the Court upheld death sentences in a Virginia case where 
                the lawyer had previously represented the murder victim and in 
                a Tennessee case where the lawyer offered no closing argument 
                on behalf of his client. Other courts have ruled that counsel 
                was competent in cases where the lawyer was unaware of the governing 
                law, intoxicated, or even asleep. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fortunately, 
                not all of the High Court justices are oblivious to the problem 
                of incompetent counsel. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg has been quoted 
                as saying that she has "yet to see a death case, among the dozens 
                coming to the Supreme Court on eve of execution petitions, in 
                which the defendant was well-represented at trial." Justice Sandra 
                Day O’Connor recently suggested "perhaps it’s time to look at 
                minimum standards for appointed counsel in death cases and adequate 
                compensation for appointed counsel when they are used." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The problem 
                of bad lawyering is not limited to Texas, nor is it limited to 
                death cases. According to the American Bar Association, no state 
                meets its standards for competent counsel in a death case. Judges 
                often appoint the attorney who will get the case through the system 
                the fastest, instead of the attorney who will most zealously safeguard 
                the rights of the accused. A recent report on indigent defense 
                in Georgia revealed some disturbing examples: </font> 
                <p></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A judge 
                  appointed a newly admitted member of the Georgia bar to handle 
                  a death penalty case on her fifth day of practice; </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An attorney 
                  who handled real estate cases out of his home asked to be relieved 
                  of representing juveniles in criminal cases because he did not 
                  have the experience, and when the judge declined he sued the 
                  county; </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One court-appointed 
                  attorney had 94 cases scheduled for trial on the same day; most 
                  were resolved by a hastily negotiated plea, and none went to 
                  trial. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Examples 
                  from other states include: </font> </p>
                <p></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Pittsburgh, 
                  Pennsylvania, a 19-year-old innocent man sat in jail for 15 
                  months because his public defender had neither the time nor 
                  the resources to visit him or to investigate his case; </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Connecticut, 
                  a 23-year-old mentally retarded man spent 18 months in jail 
                  after pleading guilty to a charge of attempted robbery on the 
                  advice of his public defender, who was unaware that the man 
                  was so disabled that he had been found incompetent to stand 
                  trial on a previous charge; </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Kentucky 
                  judge had difficulty finding someone to represent Gregory Wilson 
                  on a death case because a state statute capped attorneys’ fees 
                  at $2,500. The head of a local indigent defense program suggested 
                  sponsoring a cruise down the Ohio River to raise money for the 
                  defense. Instead the judge posted a sign on the courthouse that 
                  read, "Please help. Desperate." The lead lawyer who came forward 
                  provided a contact number at a bar called "Kelly’s Keg," and 
                  had recently been indicted for receiving stolen property. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Banks’ fate 
                  is still to be decided. The temporary stay may be short-lived 
                  and the state may yet carry out his execution. Hopefully, instead, 
                  the Justices will use this case as an opportunity to fulfill 
                  some of Gideon’s initial promise -- proving Banks with a competent 
                  lawyer who is capable of protecting his rights. If the Justices 
                  do not provide relief to Banks, then the concept of equal treatment 
                  under the law -- and under Gideon v. Wainwright -- remains unfulfilled.
