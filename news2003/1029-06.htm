- October 29 - A cadre of organizers and artists affiliated with the MoveOn.org Voter Fund Wednesday announced a nationwide search for a TV ad that tells the truth about George W. Bush&#146;s policy failures, and a prize for the person &#150; whether professional or amateur first-time producer &#150; who creates it.</font>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The winning 30-second ad will be the product of judging, first by visitors to the new website www.bushin30seconds.org during December, and then by a panel of entertainment and political experts.  It will be aired the week of President Bush&#146;s State of the Union address, early next year.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MoveOn.org&#146;s panel of judges includes the following entertainment personalities and political leaders:  Jack Black, Donna Brazile, James Carville, Margaret Cho, Hector Elizondo, Janeane Garofalo, Stan Greenberg, Moby, Michael Moore, Mark Pellington, Tony Shalhoub, Michael Stipe, Katrina vanden Heuvel, Gus Van Sant, Eddie Vedder, and others.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ad search is part of MoveOn.org Voter Fund&#146;s ongoing campaign to use television and print ads and other activities to get the message out of Washington and into battleground states, exposing the failures of the Bush Administration at home and in Iraq.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We know that the President is going to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in the next year, mostly from wealthy donors and special interests,&#148; said Eli Pariser, campaigns director for the MoveOn.org Voter Fund.  &#147;A lot of that money will go toward ads that will attempt to deceive and manipulate swing state voters about the President&#146;s agenda.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;There are two key strengths that we have on our side.  First, the truth is on our side.  Second, although we&#146;ll never have the kind of money President Bush can raise from his corporate friends, by bringing millions of ordinary Americans together, we can level the playing ground with the special interests,&#148; concluded Pariser.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Award-winning musician and performer Moby&#151;one of the project&#146;s organizers&#151;believes that President Bush has managed to hide behind a carefully constructed &#147;compassionate&#148; image. &#147;It is crucial that voters understand what President Bush's policies really mean for our country. And to do that, we need creative new ads that clearly show what's at stake,&#148; the artist said. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The &#145;Bush-in-30-Seconds&#146; ad contest has been developed by a small team of people. We've come together because we believe that by tapping into the vast talent pool of creative people beyond the Beltway, we'll find the right messages and ads to expose the failure of President Bush's policies,&#148; said Moby.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MoveOn and project organizers hope the &#145;Bush-in-30-Seconds&#146; project will inspire the electorate.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This is pretty exciting stuff. I have to say that I can&#146;t remember most of the political ads that I've seen lately,&#148; said Democratic political strategist Donna Brazile. &#147;If nothing is sticking out with someone like myself, then I worry what the average voter is taking from these ads. We have to start thinking outside the box. So I fully support the idea of finding ways to develop fresh, creative and inspiring ways to communicate in politics.&#148;</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The MoveOn.org Voter Fund is a Section 527 political organization affiliated with MoveOn.org, which will create and run political ads in swing states to challenge President Bush&#146;s policies and his administration.  MoveOn.org, the Voter Fund&#146;s sister organization, is an online grassroots advocacy organization with over 1.7 million members nationwide.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rules for the contest can be found on the website: <a href="http://www.bushin30seconds.org" target="_new">www.bushin30seconds.org</a></font></p>
