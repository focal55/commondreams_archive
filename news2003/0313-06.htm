                - March 13 - Following is a revised version of a statement released 
                yesterday by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities on House 
                budget cuts: </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The budget 
                that House Budget Committee Chairman Jim Nussle unveiled today 
                contains deep and widespread cuts in basic domestic programs such 
                as Medicare, Medicaid, veterans programs, student loans, school 
                lunches, child care, food stamps, cash assistance for the elderly 
                and disabled poor, and many other programs. (See the appendix 
                for an explanation of the calculations used in the paper.) The 
                budget would require Congressional committees to cut "mandatory" 
                programs by $470 billion over the next ten years. If enacted, 
                these would represent the deepest cuts in such programs in U.S. 
                history. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The cuts are 
                reminiscent of those proposed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
                in 1995 and included in the Contract with America budget legislation 
                that President Clinton vetoed that year. While Chairman Nussle 
                did not provide the specific amounts by which each program would 
                be cut, his budget assumes cuts of a given percentage in all mandatory 
                programs except Social Security and military retirement, and provides 
                a figure to each Congressional committee that specifies how much 
                that committee must cut mandatory programs in its jurisdiction. 
                For example, the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction 
                over Medicare and various other, much smaller programs, would 
                have to cut programs within its jurisdiction by $262 billion over 
                ten years. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees 
                Medicaid, would have to produce cuts of $111 billion, </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the committees 
                cut all programs within their jurisdictions by the same percentage, 
                the cuts would include: -- $214 billion in Medicare reductions 
                over ten years (the budget also provides $400 billion for a Medicare 
                prescription drug benefit); -- $93 billion in Medicaid, the basic 
                health insurance program for low-income families, children, and 
                elderly and disabled people; -- $15 billion in veterans programs; 
                -- $12 billion in food stamps; and -- $7 billion in farm programs. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Deep cuts in 
                Medicare and Medicaid would be unavoidable, as the Ways and Means 
                Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee would have no 
                other way to come up with the reductions they would be required 
                to make. The Nussle budget also would cut "discretionary" or non-entitlement 
                programs (other than defense spending) well below the President's 
                request. Non-defense discretionary programs would be cut $200 
                billion over ten years below the Congressional Budget Office baseline, 
                which equals the 2003 levels for these programs, adjusted for 
                inflation. These cuts could affect a wide variety of programs 
                from education programs to environmental protection programs to 
                programs for poor children. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While requiring 
                deep cuts in domestic programs, the budget makes room for most 
                of the President's large tax-cut package, including $1.4 trillion 
                in tax cuts. The tax cuts in the President's "growth" package 
                alone, all of which are included in the Nussle budget, would cost 
                $725 billion over ten years and would, according to the Tax Policy 
                Center, result in tax reductions averaging $90,000 each in 2003 
                for those Americans who have incomes of more than $1 million. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Class warfare 
                turns out to be alive," Center director Robert Greenstein commented. 
                "It is a centerpiece of the Nussle budget, with deep budget cuts 
                that could harshly affect the poor, the vulnerable, and many middle-class 
                Americans, alongside lavish tax cuts for the nation's richest 
                individuals. With this budget, we would be marching down the path 
                toward a new Gilded Age." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The Nussle 
                budget serves one very useful purpose." Greenstein added. "It 
                shows that these large tax cuts aren't free, and that at bottom, 
                the issue is one of national priorities. This ought to trigger 
                a national debate. Are tax cuts averaging $90,000 a year for millionaires 
                so high a priority that we should cut health care programs, increase 
                the ranks of the uninsured, reduce the cost or limit the availability 
                of student loans, and increase hardship among the disabled, poor 
                children, and others to free up room for massive tax cuts?" </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">APPENDIX: Calculating 
                selected budget cuts in the House Budget Committee's plan </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The budget 
                resolution presented by Chairman Nussle to the House Budget Committee 
                on March 12, 2003, assumes cuts in almost all entitlement programs. 
                The Chairman indicated that he assumed entitlement programs would 
                be reduced proportionally; he said this was the basis on which 
                the figures for each budget "function"" and each "reconciliation 
                target"" were derived. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At markup, 
                the Chairman distributed a table showing the "reconciliation targets" 
                for each committee -- i.e., the amounts by which each committee 
                is required to reduce entitlement programs, relative to current 
                law. He also distributed a table showing the resulting level of 
                "mandatory" spending in each budget function. These tables show 
                -- </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- A $15 billion, 
                ten-year reduction in veterans benefits (such as compensation, 
                pensions, and education benefits). The reconciliation table shows 
                that the Veterans Affairs Committee is required to cut programs 
                within its jurisdiction by $15.1 billion. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- A $214 billion, 
                ten-year reduction in Medicare payments. In this case, the text 
                of the budget resolution includes a special provision "reserving" 
                $400 billion over ten years to pay for a prescription drug benefit, 
                the amount requested by the President. The table of mandatory 
                spending shows a total, ten-year level of spending in Function 
                570 (Medicare) that is $186 billion above the amount CBO says 
                will be spent under current law. Because the net increase is $186 
                billion, the function total must consist of $400 billion in increases 
                for prescription drugs and $214 billion in decreases for Medicare 
                payments generally. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, 
                the total, ten-year level for mandatory spending in Function 570 
                is $215 billion below the President's level, as estimated by CBO, 
                consistent with the conclusion that the budget plan calls for 
                Medicare cuts of that magnitude, outside of a prescription drug 
                benefit. Moreover, the reconciliation table shows the Ways and 
                Means Committee is reduce entitlements $262 billion over ten years. 
                Because Social Security is off budget for purposes of budget resolutions, 
                Medicare is by far the largest remaining program under the that 
                Committee's jurisdiction; it would be implausible for the Ways 
                and Means Committee to cut entitlements under its jurisdiction 
                by $262 billion unless a substantial portion of that amount was 
                derived from reductions in Medicare. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- A $12 billion, 
                ten-year reduction in Food Stamp benefits and a $7 billion reduction 
                in farm programs. The reconciliation table shows that the Agriculture 
                Committee is required to cut programs within its jurisdiction 
                by $19 billion. At the same time, the table of mandatory spending 
                shows a total, ten-year level of spending in Function 350 (the 
                budget function devoted to farm programs such as price supports 
                and crop insurance) that is $7 billion below the amount CBO says 
                will be spent under current law; payments to farmers must be cut 
                by $7 billion. The Agriculture Committee therefore must cut entitlement 
                programs outside of Function 350 by the remaining $12 billion. 
                But the Agriculture Committee has jurisdiction over only one major 
                program outside of function 350 -- Food Stamps, which is in Function 
                600 (Income Security). Thus, a $12 billion cut must be assumed 
                in Food Stamps. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- A $93 billion, 
                ten-year reduction in Medicaid. The table of mandatory spending 
                shows a total, ten-year level of spending in Function 550 (Health) 
                that is $101 billion below the amount CBO says will be spent under 
                current law; that is, payments for health entitlements other than 
                Medicare(1) must be cut $101 billion. The health function contains 
                a number of entitlements: Medicaid, the State Children's Health 
                Insurance Program, health insurance subsidies for federal employees, 
                etc. Medicaid constitutes about 93 percent of the entitlement 
                spending in this function, and so its proportionate share of the 
                $101 billion cut is $93 billion. </font>
