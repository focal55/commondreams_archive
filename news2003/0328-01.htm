                - March 28 - As U.S. and coalition forces prepare an assault on 
                the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, U.S. forces have a responsibility 
                to prevent the eruption of inter-ethnic violence, Human Rights 
                Watch said today. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 
                Watch said widespread reprisal killings, retaliatory forced displacement, 
                and other acts of violence against resettled families are possible 
                once tens of thousands of forcibly displaced people return to 
                reclaim their homes. Oil-rich Kirkuk, currently under Iraqi government 
                control, has been the target of U.S. aerial bombing for the last 
                several days. U.S. paratroopers have landed in Iraqi Kurdistan 
                and it is likely that U.S. and coalition ground forces will enter 
                the city in the near future. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Kirkuk is 
                a disaster waiting to happen," said Hania Mufti, London director 
                for the Middle East and North Africa Division, now based in Arbil. 
                "If a plan for the gradual and orderly return of these displaced 
                civilians is not drawn up soon and implemented before the ground 
                offensive begins, there is a real possibility that the city will 
                erupt into inter-ethnic violence." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the 1991 
                Gulf War, the Iraqi government has systematically expelled an 
                estimated 120,000 Kurds, Turkomans, and Assyrians from Kirkuk 
                and other towns and villages in this oil-rich region. Most have 
                settled in the Kurdish-controlled northern provinces. Meanwhile, 
                the Iraqi government has resettled Arab families in their place 
                in an attempt to reduce the political power and presence of ethnic 
                minorities, a process known as "Arabization." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those who were 
                displaced were forced to abandon their homes, were stripped of 
                most of their possessions, and were deprived of any means of livelihood. 
                Scores of expelled Kurds and Turkomans interviewed by Human Rights 
                Watch during a September 2002 mission to Iraqi Kurdistan described 
                the relentless pressure by the state to drive them from their 
                homes by making their daily lives intolerable. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 
                Watch researchers now based in Iraqi Kurdistan said the United 
                States has not prepared for returning displaced residents of Kirkuk. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We have found 
                no evidence that U.S. political and military leaders have prepared 
                for the consequences of a massive influx of returnees with grievances 
                against those who forced them from their homes, as well as those 
                who now live in their homes," said Mufti. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During talks 
                in Ankara in March 2003, U.S., Turkish and Iraqi opposition officials 
                discussed the idea of creating a coalition commission to oversee 
                issues relating to the northern front, including the orderly return 
                of internally displaced people to Kirkuk. To date, however, no 
                such commission has been established. Kurdish officials told Human 
                Rights Watch that they were uncertain as to the role of their 
                armed forces during any eventual ground offensive on Kirkuk. Both 
                Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Mas'ud Barzani and Patriotic 
                Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani have agreed to 
                commit their Pesh Merga forces only with U.S. approval and under 
                its command. Until now, the United States has not asked for such 
                participation, but that position could change in the light of 
                Turkey's refusal to grant access to U.S. forces through its territory. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is paramount 
                that the United States immediately address the consequences of 
                a future assault on Kirkuk," said Mufti. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 
                Watch urged the United States to make concrete plans for the gradual 
                and orderly return of forcibly displaced residents, for the control 
                of mass population flows, for the removal of land mines and unexploded 
                ordinance, and for the implementation of security measures to 
                deal with any outbreaks of violence. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent days, 
                Human Rights Watch researchers have met with representatives of 
                the Iraqi opposition, including the PUK, KDP, the Iraqi Turkoman 
                Front, and the Iraqi National Congress, to discuss what preparations 
                have been made to regulate the return of displaced families to 
                Kirkuk. Kurdish officials have expressed serious concern about 
                the potential for inter-ethnic violence in the city, but said 
                there was very little they could do to stop a large-scale return 
                since displaced families had every right to reclaim their homes 
                as soon as possible. Some also said that "a significant number" 
                of Arab families settled in Kirkuk had already left and that they 
                hoped their departure would mitigate any violence. However, more 
                recent information indicates that the Iraqi government has forcibly 
                returned some of these Arab families to Kirkuk and to a number 
                of villages in the province that were also included in the "Arabization" 
                process. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 
                Watch called on all parties to the conflict in Iraq to respect 
                the safety and freedom of movement rights of all Iraqi citizens, 
                including their right to choose a place of residence, and to move 
                to a place of safety either inside or outside Iraq. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under international 
                humanitarian law, the U.S.-led forces have a duty to restore and 
                ensure public order and safety in territories under their authority 
                from the moment they establish effective control over them. In 
                order to do so, they need to devote enough personnel to ensure 
                public safety, grant protection to all noncombatants, and prevent 
                the occurrence of acts of reprisal or revenge. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 
                Watch called upon the U.S. government and its coalition partners 
                to undertake, as a matter of urgency, the following measures to 
                prevent the possibility of inter-ethnic violence in Kirkuk: </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">. Call publicly 
                for a gradual and orderly return of internally displaced persons 
                to Kirkuk and other affected areas. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">. Establish 
                a commission of coalition partners to address matters relating 
                to the return of the former residents of Kirkuk, including the 
                control of population flows, the clearance of land mines and unexploded 
                ordinance, and the prevention of inter-ethnic strife. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">. Make every 
                effort to secure government buildings in Kirkuk that could contain 
                Iraqi government documents pertaining to the "Arabization" policy, 
                including property deeds and nationality registration records. 
                Such documentation will be essential for a speedy and fair resolution 
                of all claims on homes and property, for family tracing and reunification 
                efforts and for future accountability for crimes committed by 
                Iraqi officials. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 
                Watch also called upon the Kurdish authorities to go beyond making 
                general appeals to returning families that no reprisals be carried 
                out against Arab families settled by the Iraqi government in Kirkuk. 
                The Kurdish authorities should: </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">. Develop a 
                plan, to be made public as soon as possible, for the gradual and 
                orderly return of displaced families to Kirkuk. For example, organizing 
                the return of groups of displaced civilians according to the districts 
                from which they were expelled. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">. Continue 
                to compile records establishing the ethnicity and place of origin 
                of displaced civilians, including duplicates of nationality correction 
                forms, confiscated expulsion orders, and ration cards. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">. Provide a

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, Human
