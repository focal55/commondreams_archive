                - February 26 - A group of University of Colorado faculty and 
                staff who are opposed to a preventive war in Iraq is coordinating 
                a "teach-in" to coincide with a planned March 5 student moratorium. 
                The goal of the all-day public event on the CU Boulder campus 
                is to encourage a more thoughtful and peaceful solution to the 
                Iraq crisis. At an organizational meeting on February 18, CU Regent 
                Jim Martin spoke in support of the efforts of the 98 faculty and 
                staff who gathered to form Faculty and Staff Against War (FASAW). 
                Addressing the overflow gathering, which included members of 32 
                different departments and units at the Boulder campus plus faculty 
                from Naropa University, Martin called university campuses "the 
                moral conscience of the nation." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FASAW is promoting 
                March 5 as a "Day of Discussion" about the proposed war, to include 
                the teach-in on the University campus. Members of the public are 
                encouraged to attend and participate. The teach-in, titled "Books, 
                Not Bombs" is planned for the full school day, from 8AM to 5PM 
                on March 5. CU Boulder faculty and other speakers will educate 
                and lead discussions on many issues regarding the proposed war 
                that have been ignored by much of the media. These include the 
                history of Iraq and US foreign policy, the consequences of war, 
                and alternatives to war. The teach-in will also include a poetry 
                reading, which will feature the works of local and internationally 
                known poets who are opposed to war as a solution to human problems. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many FASAW 
                faculty members will be bringing their classes to the teach-in 
                to support the day of discussion. "We find ourselves at a historic 
                moment, which may change the course of human history," said FASAW 
                member Dylan Clark, a CU geographer. "We are asking people to 
                take a break from their normal routine long enough to reflect, 
                think, and discuss the options that lie before us." Part of the 
                role of a University is to foster discussion of the issues relevant 
                to our society in the media, in the classrooms, and in the community.

                Tom Mayer or visit <a href="http://www.fasaw.net" target="_new">www.fasaw.net</a>.

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following the 
                teach-in, Flemish Anthropologist and Internationally Acclaimed 
                Nonviolence Expert Dr. Pat Patfoort will speak on the topic "There 
                ARE Alternatives To War" at 7PM in the Glenn Miller Ballroom in 
                the University Memorial Center, on the CU Boulder Campus. Dr. 
                Patfoort has worked to resolve conflicts among Rwandan refugees, 
                as well as Kosovar Albanians and Serbs. The Rocky Mountain Peace 
                and Justice Center and the International Women's Week Committee 
                are sponsoring her talk. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the February 
                18 meeting, 213 people have joined FASAW's membership list, and 
                have been actively planning for the teach-in and related anti-war 
                activities. FASAW invites all concerned members of the University 
                community, as well as those from other academic institutions, 
                to attend the next meeting of FASAW AT 7:00 p.m. on Monday, March 
                3 in UMC room 247. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FASAW believes 
                that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must be contained through 
                deterrence and inspections, not a preventive war. FASAW will promote 
                discussion of the following issues, seldom noted in the mass media, 
                in support of this position: </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) Deterrence, 
                sanctions, and international monitoring have been highly effective. 
                Fear for his own survival prevented Hussein from using chemical 
                and biological weapons against US troops and Israel during the 
                Gulf War, and in the 12 years since. International monitoring 
                of Iraq's military strengths and strategies makes any belligerent 
                move on Iraq's part suicidal. Hussein has never gone to war in 
                the face of a clear deterrent threat. "FASAW supports enlarged, 
                permanent UN weapons inspection teams, as called for by Nobel 
                Peace Laureate Jimmy Carter and others, to disarm Iraq." said 
                FASAW member Vicky Sama, a CU journalism instructor. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) Despite 
                tremendous pressure from the Bush Administration, US intelligence 
                has failed to provide any evidence of cooperation between the 
                Iraqi regime and terrorists. The threat of U.S. retaliation is 
                very effective in keeping Iraq from supporting terrorists. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) Thousands 
                of innocent Iraqi civilians will be killed, and thousands more 
                will suffer grave injury because of this war. The Pentagon strategy 
                called "shock and awe" will rain more cruise missiles on Baghdad 
                in each of the first two days of war than were fired in the entire 
                1991 Gulf War. One Pentagon official who has been briefed on the 
                plan told CBS News, "There will not be a safe place in Baghdad." 
                One of the authors of this strategy likened its effects to the 
                atomic bombing of Hiroshima. After the bombing ceases, the lack 
                of safe drinking water, electricity, communication, bridges, and 
                infrastructure, will lead to disease, death, and tremendous further 
                suffering. "Americans, who suffered needless killing of innocents 
                on September 11, 2001, do not wish to inflict the same on another 
                country." said FASAW member Aaron Miller, a CU biochemist. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4) An American-led 
                war effort that causes much suffering and destruction will create 
                more reason for terrorists to commit acts of terrorism against 
                US citizens, cities and military bases around the world. "I believe 
                an attack on Iraq increases the likelihood for terrorist attacks 
                here," worries FASAW member Alex Stemm-Wolf, a CU biologist. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5) The preventive 
                strike strategy sets a dangerous precedent that will undoubtedly 
                haunt us in the future when other countries follow our lead. The 
                potential for proliferation of war on this basis is grave. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6) The costs 
                of war and of rebuilding Iraq will be staggering. While our allies 
                financed the majority of the costs of the 1991 Gulf War, our share 
                nonetheless dragged the US economy into recession. Now, many of 
                those same allies are unwilling to finance a new war, which would 
                likely be even more expensive. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7) The commitment 
                and ability of the U.S. to building a peaceful, democratic, and 
                free society in a post-Hussein Iraq is questionable. The U.S. 
                failed to bring democracy and freedom to Kuwait. The Bush administration 
                is little focused on the widespread warlordism, drug trafficking, 
                terrorism, and attacks on foreign troops in Afghanistan. Whether 
                the US is seen as liberator or conqueror of Iraq will depend less 
                on the courageous men and women fighting against Saddam's troops 
                than on political and economic decisions made in Washington. "Afghanistan 
                has faded so quickly from our radar screen, and democracy is faltering 
                there," said FASAW member Michael Mills, a CU atmospheric scientist. 
                "How long will U.S. commitment to democracy in Iraq last before 
                we move on to the next war?" </font> 
                <p></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The March 
                  5 all-day teach-in will bring together students, academics, 
                  and the public to explore a peaceful resolution to the crisis 
                  over Iraq.</font></p>
