- May 6 - I want to applaud the courageous and effective leadership of the District's Congressional delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, and a number of City Council members who have taken a principled stand for public schools and against this federal voucher proposal.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When it comes to vouchers, it's critically important to separate the fiction from the facts. Many of these facts have been brought to life from reports compiled by People For the American Way Foundation and other researchers. Here's what the facts show.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, parents and the public don't want it. In the 1980s, the people of D.C. had a chance to vote on whether they wanted to divert public tax dollars to private or religious schools. District voters overwhelmingly rejected this proposal. In addition, every one of the eight states that has placed a voucher or tuition tax credit proposal on its election ballot has seen voters firmly reject this approach. As recently as December, a poll of D.C. voters found that 76 percent of them oppose a taxpayer-funded voucher program. Respecting "home rule" means respecting the views of District parents and citizens.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Second, there is no clear evidence that vouchers work. Indeed, only a few weeks ago, a new study of the Cleveland voucher program showed that public schools students made greater academic gains than the students in the participating private schools. Two years ago, the General Accounting Office looked at a variety of studies on voucher programs and found "little or no difference" in the academic performance of public school students and voucher students.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Third, voucher programs are not accountable to parents and taxpayers. Private schools that participate aren't held to the same standards for testing students, releasing financial data and other areas. Accountability is supposed to be the cornerstone of the No Child Left Behind Act, which President Bush championed. Yet the administration's voucher proposal for D.C. doesn't hold private schools to the same standards that public schools must meet under this Act.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fourth, vouchers are a fraud. The groups that back vouchers promise parents "choice," but the real choice belongs to private schools. Many private schools refuse to participate in voucher programs. Parents can and do encounter many obstacles as they approach private schools-tuition, entrance exams, classroom capacity, transportation, academic programs and other factors. Furthermore, the amount of money proposed for the D.C. voucher program would permit less than 1 percent of public school students to attend private schools in the District. The U.S. House of Representatives just voted against a proposal to provide vouchers for students with disabilities across the country. If it's a bad idea for those students, why is it a good idea for D.C. students?
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, vouchers will drain critical funding for D.C.'s public schools and undermine the progress that so many of these schools have made in raising test scores and improving learning. Even worse, this proposal would subsidize parents who are already sending their children to private schools.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For all of these reasons, People For the American Way stands with the Coalition for Accountable Public Schools, a grassroots coalition of D.C. parents and residents. We urge the White House and Congress to focus on reforms that really work-such as smaller class sizes, early intervention, attracting and retaining talented teachers-instead of gimmicks such as vouchers. 

</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statement by

REV. GRAYLAN HAGLER, Pastor

Plymouth Congregational United Church of Christ (Washington, D.C.)

and Member, African-American Ministers in Action:
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1981, I joined many in my congregation and the overwhelming majority of District voters in rejecting a tax-credit initiative to subsidize parents who sent their children to private or religious schools. More than 20 years have passed, but neither the parents nor residents believe that vouchers will genuinely improve education. Two years ago, a report by the General Accounting Office concluded that there was virtually no difference in the academic achievement of voucher students and public school students.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No one needs to tell teachers, parents or those in my congregation that there are too many D.C. children who aren't getting a quality education. But we are truly starting to make progress. Test scores are increasing at most District schools, and several elementary schools have raised their math scores by over 20 percent. How can we undermine this progress by diverting our attention and funding away from the public schools? That is exactly what vouchers would do.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A voucher plan for D.C. will leave the vast majority of children behind in struggling, financially squeezed public schools. Our mayor suggests that he has made a deal with the White House for more public school funding, but any supposedly 'new' funds would-at best-only lessen the pain caused by education cuts already included in the Bush budget. One of those cuts would wipe out all funding for Comprehensive School Reform, a program that has helped low-achieving schools in our city. When someone takes a dollar from our public schools and then agrees to throw a quarter back to us, we should be angry, not grateful.
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, the Bush administration's push for vouchers ignores the views of parents, the superintendent, most elected city officials, the District's delegate to Congress, and others who firmly oppose vouchers. President Bush has called education "the great civil rights issue of our time," but, if he really believed that, why won't he allow a black-majority city to set policy for its own schools? And would he support a new form of "separate but equal" by steering D.C.'s students toward schools that aren't held to the very standards Congress just passed under the No Child Left Behind Act.
