- July 16 - The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence United with the Million Mom March today released a list of 10 gun dealers who data shows sold exceptionally high numbers of guns used in crimes, according to the data maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The list was released as gun violence victims, all with pending lawsuits against negligent gun sellers, came to Washington to demand that the U.S. Senate turn back legislation that would protect the worst players in the gun industry - gun sellers that recklessly operate their businesses and allow criminals to get guns. The bill would deny many victims of gun violence their right to their day in court, and would require the dismissal of many cases that have been upheld in the courts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our children, our neighbors, our American family members are losing their lives because of the negligence and recklessness of bad apple gun dealers who don't take the most basic precautions to try to prevent killers from arming themselves. People are dying as a result,&quot; said Mike Barnes, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence United with the Million Mom March. &quot;Now Congress is close to passing S. 659, a bill that would send bad apples like Bull's Eye Shooter Supply a loud message that their reckless behavior is not only acceptable, but a protected privilege. No other industry has broad legal immunity no matter how irresponsible their conduct. All of America should be outraged at this proposal.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National crime gun trace data from 1989 through 1996 gathered by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) indicate the following gun dealers sold the highest numbers of crime guns in America and exhibited crime gun tracing patterns that ATF considers to be indicative of gun trafficking. (More current data is not available from the government.) Whereas most gun dealers have been associated with no gun traces, guns sold by these suspect gun dealers turn up in the wrong hands over and over again:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Badger Outdoors Inc., West Milwaukee, Wis. From 1989 through 1996, this dealer sold 554 guns traced to crime; 475 of those guns had a &quot;short time to crime&quot; as defined by ATF. The guns were involved in at least 27 homicides, 101 assaults, 9 robberies, and 417 additional gun crimes. The dealer also sold at least 1563 handguns in multiple sales. From 1994 to 1996, straw purchaser Lawrence Shikes bought 10 guns from Badger. In one case, he immediately sold the gun to an undercover federal agent who told Shikes he was a felon. Several weapons Shikes purchased have been recovered from a killer, a rapist (Marcus D. Hawkins -- a convicted armed robber who raped a 22-year-old woman at gunpoint with her 17-month-old son nearby), a man who shot at a police officer (Charles Jennings), and three juvenile shooting suspects (including Roosevelt Poveda -- a drug felon and a member of the Gangsta Disciples who was arrested as an accomplice to the murder of Stevie Blunt in 1996; one of Shikes' guns was later found in his home). Robert Mallette Jr. (a member of the Brothers of the Struggle gang in Chicago) and Edgar Richmond were arrested for straw purchases conducted at Badger. One of their guns was found by the body of their uncle Charles Holley (who had a drug history) when he was murdered by a rival gang member in March 1998.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Realco Guns Inc., Forestville, Md. From 1989 through 1996, this dealer sold 518 guns traced to crime; 394 of those guns had a &quot;short time to crime&quot; as defined by ATF. The guns were involved in at least 35 homicides, 31 assaults, 7 robberies, and 445 additional gun crimes. The dealer also sold at least 514 handguns in multiple sales.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Southern Police Equipment Co. Inc., Richmond, Va. From 1989 through 1996, this dealer sold 447 guns traced to crime; 293 of those guns had a &quot;short time to crime&quot; as defined by ATF. The guns were involved in at least 25 homicides, 32 assaults, 4 robberies, and 386 additional gun crimes. The dealer also sold at least 35 handguns in multiple sales. Ian Ralph Blackstock, a convicted New York drug dealer and the mastermind behind a major gunrunning operation, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for illegally obtaining 115 guns from March 1990 to February 1991 from this dealer and two others through straw sales. Fifteen of those weapons were used in crimes in New York and Washington. In 1999, a handgun was seized from a Richmond juvenile in connection with a drug crime 10 months after being sold by this dealer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Atlantic Gun &amp; Tackle, Bedford Heights, Ohio. From 1989 through 1996, this dealer sold 426 guns traced to crime; 256 of those guns had a &quot;short time to crime&quot; as defined by ATF. The guns were involved in at least 5 homicides, 72 assaults, 15 robberies, and 334 additional gun crimes. The dealer also sold at least 613 handguns in multiple sales.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Colosimo's Inc., Philadelphia, Pa. From 1989 through 1996, this dealer sold 425 guns traced to crime; 206 of those guns had a &quot;short time to crime&quot; as defined by ATF. The guns were involved in at least 10 homicides, 85 assaults, 30 robberies, and 300 additional gun crimes. The dealer also sold at least 360 handguns in multiple sales.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Don's Guns &amp; Galleries Inc., Indianapolis, Ind. From 1989 through 1996, this dealer sold 398 guns traced to crime; 311 of those guns had a &quot;short time to crime&quot; as defined by ATF. The guns were involved in at least 7 homicides, 12 assaults, 2 robberies, and 370 additional gun crimes. The dealer also sold at least 2012 handguns in multiple sales. Numerous gun traffickers have &quot;straw purchased&quot; dozens of guns from Don's Guns in recent years. For example, between October 2001 and January 2002, Etely Diamond used two straw purchasers to buy 25 handguns from Don's Guns and then resold them on the streets of Chicago. Another trafficker, Jerome Steele, used straw buyers to obtain 12 and 9 guns on two different occasions in 2002 from Don's Guns and then resold them illegally in Chicago. A third trafficker, Willie Soward, also used straw buyers to obtain guns from Don's Guns for resale in Chicago.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Breit &amp; Johnson Sporting Goods Inc., Elmwood Park, Ill. From 1989 through 1996, this dealer sold 347 guns traced to crime; 271 of those guns had a &quot;short time to crime&quot; as defined by ATF. The guns were involved in at least 27 homicides, 46 assaults, 3 robberies, and 271 additional gun crimes. The dealer also sold at least 459 handguns in multiple sales. Anthony Garner was arrested for gunrunning after he bought 16 handguns from Breit &amp; Johnson that were then sold to Chicago gang members. At least one of those guns was used in a gang-related killing. In a similar incident, Andrew Young, age 19, was killed by Mario Ramos, also 19, a gang member with a gun from Breit &amp; Johnson. The gun was purchased by Mariano DiVittorio, a known gun trafficker, for Daniel Escobedo who told the store's owner that he was a felon and could not purchase the gun for himself. Breit and Johnson is a defendant in ongoing cases filed by Chicago and Cook County and the family of Andrew Young for making illicit or negligent firearm sales.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Trader Sports Inc., San Leandro, Calif. From 1989 through 1996, this dealer sold 337 guns traced to crime; 181 of those guns had a &quot;short time to crime&quot; as defined by ATF. The guns were involved in at least 27 homicides, 26 assaults, 2 robberies, and 282 additional gun crimes. The dealer also sold at least 3091 handguns in multiple sales. A San Francisco police inspector wrote in 1992 that Trader Sports sold more than 800 guns to a man who in turn sold them on the streets of San Francisco. That same year, ATF agents identified 24 people, all ineligible to purchase guns, who it suspected of obtaining those guns through straw buyers from Trader Sports. Trader Sports has been a defendant in several suits involving allegations of illicit or negligent sales, including a 1991 case brought by Sharon Ellingson whose husband was killed with an assault rifle allegedly straw purchased from this dealer a month before the murder. She obtained a $400,000 out-of-court settlement. Trader Sports is also a defendant in the lawsuits filed by 12 California jurisdictions in 1999, and at one point the owner lost his federal firearm license for &quot;gross disregard&quot; of the law.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Miller's Dealers Outlet, Tucson, Ariz. From 1989 through 1996, this dealer sold 297 guns traced to crime; 260 of those guns had a &quot;short time to crime&quot; as defined by ATF. The guns were involved in at least 13 homicides, 39 assaults, 2 robberies, and 243 additional gun crimes. The dealer also sold at least 533 handguns in multiple sales.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Turner's Outdoorsman, Chino, Calif. From 1989 through 1996, this dealer sold 251 guns traced to crime; 148 of those guns had a &quot;short time to crime&quot; as defined by ATF. The guns were involved in at least 10 homicides, 31 assaults, 4 robberies, and 206 additional gun crimes. The dealer also sold at least 144 handguns in multiple sales. Turners is a defendant in the lawsuits filed by 12 California jurisdictions in 1999, which allege that the dealer engaged in unfair or unlawful business practices.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because ATF has only released dealer crime gun trace totals through the end of 1996, and those traces comprise less than one-third of the national crime gun traces to date, the actual crime gun totals for these dealers is likely to be much higher. The following major gun manufacturers have sold their firearms through all ten of these 'bad apple' dealers and had them traced to crime: Beretta, Davis, Glock, Sturm Ruger, and Smith &amp; Wesson</font>.</p>
