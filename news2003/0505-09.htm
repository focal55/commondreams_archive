- May 5 - "Major combat 
operations" in Iraq have ended, but the war against disease and 
hunger continues for the Iraqi people, especially Iraq's children, 
according to global humanitarian agency Church World Service (CWS), 
concluding a weeklong assessment in Baghdad that ended Saturday, 
May 3. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Church World Service Emergency Response Consultant Steve Weaver 
reports a high incidence of diarrhea among children, overcrowding 
in hospitals and clinics, and a general lack of sources of protein. 
"According to UNICEF," Weaver said, "90 percent of children coming 
to Baghdad's Central Child Hospital have diarrhea." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Baghdad Central Child Hospital is receiving 2,000 patients a 
day," said Jonathan Frerichs of Lutheran World Relief, traveling 
with Weaver. The hospital has so far had to bury 100 people in its 
garden. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"One pediatric hospital we visited," CWS' Weaver said, "which 10 
days ago had 40 patients today has 140." Even before the war, 
UNICEF reported that the average Iraqi child suffers 14 episodes of 
diarrhea per year. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The best passport for travel to deprived areas is anti-diarrhea 
medicines, or other cures for the age-old plagues that take high 
tolls on human life," said Frerichs, also press officer for Action 
By Churches Together (ACT). 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We saw beds shared by two or three children, with their mothers 
alongside. Many women had babies. Many patients were on cots or 
blankets on the ground, overcrowded and making do." Weaver relates. 
"That hospital needs 50 beds with sheets and blankets immediately." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To help meet those needs, Church World Service and its partner 
agencies announce they are providing $75,000 additional in their 
ongoing $1 million All Our Children Campaign, funding medicines and 
medical supplies for pediatric hospitals in Baghdad. CWS is a 
founding member of the multi-agency All Our Children Campaign, 
established before the war to benefit the severe and longstanding 
health crisis among Iraq's children. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to UN and other sources, between 500,000 to 1 million 
children have died in Iraq since 1991. The death rate of children 
under 5 is reported as 2.5 times greater than in 1990. 
  
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since December 2002, the All Our Children Campaign has provided 
$268,800 in medicine, medical equipment and supplies to pediatric 
hospitals and clinics. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New $75,000 Project for Baghdad's Institutionalized, Street 
Children and Orphans 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The latest All Our Children allocation funds a fourth and fifth 
project, in the campaign, totaling nearly $75,000, with both 
projects designated to benefit street children, orphans and other 
institutionalized children, and those separated from their families 
by the war -- among the most vulnerable of the country's 
population. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One $60,000 project, being administered in Baghdad by 
German-based NGO Architects for People In Need-Iraq (AFP), will 
supply badly needed medical examination tables, instrument tables, 
refrigerators for medicine storage, and supplies such as syringes, 
eye drops, bandages and surgical gloves, and numerous types of 
medicines. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The All Our Children contribution will fund fully one fourth of 
APN's medical care project. The funds will assist 9,100 children in 
the APN program's first phase, aimed at identifying and treating 
children with chronic and untreated medical conditions. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clinics that are being reactivated include Habibiya 1, Habibiya, 
Al Safaa 1 and New Baghdad. "The APN clinics are seeing hundreds 
and hundreds of patients a day," CWS' Weaver reported. "They are 
overflowing with patients coming for medical care. They are seeing 
a tremendous amount of dysentery and other water-borne illnesses." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another $15,000 project, to be administered by NGO Enfants du 
Monde (EMDH) In Baghdad, will address similar needs and will 
attempt to identify and register children separated from their 
families, aiming to reunite children with their families as fast as 
possible. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"President Bush says the United States will see the war on 
terrorism to the end," commented Church World Service Executive 
Director the Rev. John L. McCullough, New York City. "We also have 
to see our humanitarian responsibilities to the end. The war 
against hunger and disease continues for the Iraqi people." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. and aid officials agree that currently there is no 
"humanitarian crisis" in Iraq," which means people are not on the 
verge of death," said CWS Emergency Response Director Rick 
Augsburger, New York City. "But there is severe humanitarian need 
that, if not met quickly, could result in a higher mortality rate 
for children and others who are vulnerable." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CWS' Weaver said chronic diseases being reported among children 
in Baghdad include diarrhea and vomiting, believed caused by 
dysentery and amoebic dysentery, typhoid, epilepsy, iron 
deficiency, anemia, skin diseases including scabies, chicken pox, 
measles, and burns by benzene or gas. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the Baghdad assessment team, Frerichs reports that, beyond 
the imposing monuments of Baghdad's remaining skyline, lie the 
"unauthorized, hidden showcases of poverty newly accessible on the 
outskirts of town." There, Frerichs describes, are the millions 
who live in and around Saddam City -- mostly Shiites who migrated 
from the south and who were marginalized by the previous regime. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In one of those communities, the community of Hai El Mahdi, the 
assessment team reports that they saw mothers whose infants did not 
hold up their heads and other signs of severe malnutrition. "One of 
the first people you meet," Frerichs recalls, "is a child standing 
with a bandaged foot on a large piece of dung." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CWS' Weaver and his colleagues have visited a number of health 
care facilities in Baghdad, and report that, while health care 
workers are doing what they can to provide services and return to 
work, chaos remains in the city. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One psychiatric hospital the team visited was "looted down to 
the light switches, wires, and windows, with the patients still 
there," Weaver reported. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weaver also noted that, across all populations, while there 
appeared to be plenty of flour, noodles, and rice, "There is a lack 
of protein." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weaver, CWS' consultant in Amman, Jordan, has been in Baghdad 
since April 23. He and Frerichs are accompanied during the Baghdad 
assessment by Menno Weibe, Mennonite Central Committee, Amman, 
Jordan and Edward Miller, Mennonite Central Committee. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NGO partners in the All Our Children Campaign include CWS, 
Jubilee Partners, the Mennonite Central Committee (MCC), the 
National Council of Churches USA (NCC), Oxfam America, Sojourners, 
and Stop Hunger Now. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Church World Service's participation in the All Our Children 
Campaign continues the international agency's decade-plus 
commitment to assisting the ongoing needs of the Iraqi people. CWS 
has provided more than $3.8 million since 1991 for UN-sanctioned 
humanitarian assistance in Iraq. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of its own $1.5 million appeal for the Iraqi people, 
launched prior to the war's outbreak, CWS has already sent a 
$110,000 grant to its on the ground partner the Middle East Council 
of churches (MECC). Four thousand CWS blankets are scheduled for 
shipment into Iraq next week. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During Iraq's reconstruction and rehabilitation, CWS will 
continue to focus on health needs, especially those of children, 
women, the elderly and low-income people with inadequate access to 
health care. 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CWS Executive Director John L. McCullough said that "because of 
CWS' local partners and church relationships, we are able to 
continue providing assistance within Iraq regardless of conditions 
in the country." 
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">McCullough adds that the agency can also "serve in an 
independent and impartial manner, because CWS chose not to be part 
of humanitarian assistance that was part of an effort, organized or 
coordinated by the U.S. military. Fortunately," he adds, "the 
local partners we work with are also able to administer to the 
community independently from the U.S. military." 
</font>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Church World Service is a global humanitarian agency of 36 
member denominations, working with local organizations in more than 
80 countries to support sustainable self-help and development, meet 
emergency needs, aid refugees and address the root causes of 
poverty and powerlessness.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
