                - March 17 - A new position paper from the National Council on 
                Disability (NCD) calls for Congress to strengthen the ability 
                of states to assist families with disabilities on welfare to transition 
                from welfare to work. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is now 
                a very strong record that indicates that significant numbers of 
                parents with disabilities and parents with children with disabilities 
                are in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. 
                The record also indicates that many of these families have been 
                sanctioned and have not received the services and supports they 
                need to succeed. Some of the states, using the flexibility that 
                Congress gave them in 1996 and the TANF funds freed up due to 
                falling cash assistance caseloads, have taken very practical steps 
                to assist these families. The federal legislation should include 
                provisions to ensure that people with disabilities receive the 
                appropriate supports and services to enable them to transition 
                to work successfully. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People with 
                disabilities often face multiple barriers to work. In addition 
                to the barriers faced by most low income Americans as they attempt 
                to work, such as inadequate transportation and limited opportunities 
                to improve education and skills, people with disabilities must 
                meet the specific challenges of their physical or mental impairment 
                or health condition-often requiring assistive technology, access 
                to accessible transportation, sign language interpreters, or personal 
                care assistance, work place supports etc. in order to participate 
                in programs designed to assist them in finding work. When appropriate 
                assessments of individual needs for reasonable accommodations 
                are provided, people with disabilities are afforded equal opportunity 
                for full participation, independent living, and economic stability. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paper 
                summarizes research about people with disabilities and TANF and 
                some of the proposals being offered for consideration to improve 
                how TANF-funded programs address the needs of families with a 
                member with a disability. NCD makes the following recommendations 
                for the TANF reauthorization: </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Increase 
                TANF and childcare funding; -- Ensure that parents with disabilities 
                are screened, in a timely manner, with appropriate diagnostic 
                tools; -- Prohibit states from sanctioning families until the 
                state has taken steps to identify barriers, provided the family 
                with assistance in meeting the rules; and modified rules, if necessary 
                to address the parent's or child's disability so that the family 
                can comply with TANF requirements; -- Provide states with flexibility 
                in how they define countable work activities, including rehabilitation 
                and participation in other activities that will help the parent 
                to become work-ready, and how they determine the length of time 
                a particular individual or family will need the specific services 
                or treatment; -- Provide states with additional resources to train 
                case workers and other staff who serve TANF recipients about issues 
                unique to disabilities, including how to provide timely and effective 
                screening, and how to identify programs, resources, and opportunities 
                for collaborative community initiatives to achieve systemic improvements 
                in services for people with disabilities; -- Create advisory panels 
                at the state level to assist states in addressing the needs and 
                barriers of people with disabilities; -- Facilitate access to 
                continued Medicaid or other health coverage when recipients move 
                from welfare to work; -- Assist states to better coordinate and 
                provide services needed by children with disabilities and their 
                families to address the multiple challenges facing parents and 
                children with disabilities; and -- Ensure that TANF programs and 
                services comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 
                504 of the Rehabilitation Act. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The TANF block 
                grant, first created in 1996 to replace Aid to Families with Dependent 
                Children (AFDC), was scheduled for reauthorization in 2002. Rather 
                than undertaking the full reauthorization, Congress passed a short 
                extension, which has since been extended to the end of June 2003. 
                It is likely to be reauthorized by Congress in the next few months. 
                As part of the reauthorization process, there have been many proposals 
                to strengthen protections for parents and children with disabilities 
                participating in TANF-funded programs. It is important that the 
                law establish policies that reflect both the intention and desire 
                of people with disabilities to work, and the reality that certain 
                individuals may still have severe work limitations requiring long-term 
                assistance in order to work. </font>
