                - April 8 - The Bush Administration's air pollution plan, euphemistically 
                called the "Clear Skies Initiative," would shred current Clean 
                Air Act protections, the nonprofit Clean Air Trust noted today. 
                The Administration plan is supported by some of the nation's biggest 
                polluters and environmental outlaws such as American Electric 
                Power. And no wonder: the plan would eliminate numerous tools 
                in current law designed to produce cleaner air and better public 
                health. It would give special deals to big polluters. Environmental 
                experts have noted that it would mean more pollution in the future 
                than would faithful enforcement of current law. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A United States 
                Senate subcommittee has scheduled its first hearing on the plan 
                today. Although the Bush Administration has touted this as a bill 
                that would only affect electric power plants, other smokestack 
                industries would also be permitted to take advantage of huge new 
                loopholes. The Clean Air Trust undertook this analysis to examine 
                some of the key tools in existing law that would be eliminated 
                or modified by the Administration plan. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among other 
                things, the bill: </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Could postpone 
                achievement of public health standards for nearly a quarter of 
                a century. The Administration plan would automatically postpone 
                deadlines for meeting public health standards for smog (ozone) 
                and fine particle soot (PM 2.5) until 2015. (Existing law would 
                require health standards to be met by 2009 or earlier.) It would 
                also create a whole new category of "transitional" areas for 8-hour 
                ozone or PM 2.5 if states claim they will meet the standards by 
                2015. But if a "transitional" area fails to meet the standards 
                by 2016, the deadlines simply get postponed even farther into 
                the future. (The bill says EPA must designate such an area as 
                "nonattainment" in 2017, after which the state would have until 
                2020 to submit a cleanup plan. The actual cleanup wouldn't happen 
                until well into the 2020s.) Because of the "banking and trading" 
                provisions of the Administration proposal, its pollution targets 
                might not be achieved until around the same time frame. As our 
                colleagues at the Environmental Integrity Project have noted, 
                the Administration's alleged "pollution caps" would not be met 
                even by 2026! </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would exempt 
                affected smokestack plants from new source review requirements, 
                meaning that existing plants could legally increase their pollution. 
                These plants would also avoid the current requirements to use 
                the cleanest possible technology (the "lowest achievable emission 
                rate") and to offset any increased pollution in areas with unhealthful 
                air. In other words, they could cause more public health damage 
                in areas that already have dirty air. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Lets other 
                smokestack industries off the hook. The Administration would allow 
                every major industrial source built or modified in "transitional" 
                areas to make health problems worse by evading current requirements 
                to offset new emissions and use the cleanest possible technology. 
                In other words, the Administration would grant new loopholes to 
                refineries, chemical plants, paper mills, cement plants and other 
                smokestack factories. All would be allowed to belch out more pollution 
                in areas that already have dirty air. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would help 
                the road-building lobby. The bill would also help the road-building 
                highway lobby (cement, asphalt, etc.) by exempting "transitional" 
                areas from requirements that transportation plans dovetail with 
                state air quality plans. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Throws much-touted 
                future emission reductions in doubt. The Administration plan would 
                require EPA, in "consultation" with the Department of Energy, 
                to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the "second phase" of emission 
                limits (slated for 2018). In 2009, EPA would report the findings 
                separately for each pollutant to Congress, which could then change 
                the emission limits. (This raises the very real prospect that 
                EPA could declare that emission reductions for nitrogen oxides 
                and mercury don't pass the cost test; certainly industry would 
                make that argument as it has in the past. EPA and the Department 
                of Energy would also examine the impact of controls on "fuel diversity" 
                and "electric reliability" - buzzwords used by industry to block 
                pollution controls.) </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would permit 
                any industrial plant that emits sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides 
                pollution "only through a stack or duct" to take advantage of 
                all the bill's loopholes. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would eliminate 
                current mercury pollution standards for electric power plants. 
                Under existing law, mercury pollution would be reduced by up to 
                90 percent -- by December 2007 under a prior legal consent agreement. 
                These standards would be repealed under the Administration plan, 
                which would delay any reduction in mercury until 2010. Even in 
                2018 - more than a decade later than the deadline under current 
                law - mercury emissions could be higher than current law would 
                require in 2007. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would permit 
                "hot spots" of toxic mercury. The Administration plan would permit 
                electric power companies to "trade" emission "credits" for mercury 
                - something that cannot be done under existing law. Indeed, existing 
                law does not permit trading of any toxic air pollutant. Under 
                the Administration plan, some plants could actually increase their 
                mercury emissions. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would eliminate 
                "residual risk" requirements for mercury. Existing law says EPA 
                must require additional mercury controls if the first phase of 
                controls - which are technology-based - continues to leave people 
                at risk. The Administration bill would kill this requirement. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would delay 
                toxic pollution (MACT) standards for other pollutants from electric 
                power plants until after 2018. Under existing law, standards for 
                other toxic pollutants are to be met by December 2007. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would freeze 
                the development of cleaner technology for electric power plants 
                by stipulating that new plants need only meet a static "new source" 
                standard rather than a "best available technology" standard that 
                achieves greater emission reductions over time as technology evolves. 
                Indeed, the Administration plan would ensure that new plants are 
                built with obsolete technology. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would eliminate 
                current protections for national parks. Would eliminate the current 
                requirement that requires cleanup of existing big sources of pollution 
                that threaten national parks (The so-called "Best Available Retrofit 
                Technology" or BART requirement). It would also eliminate requirements 
                for new electric power plants that could harm national parks. 
                Requirements would be maintained only for sources within 50 kilometers 
                (30 miles) of a national park, even though sources hundreds of 
                miles away can harm air quality in the parks. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would weaken 
                current requirements designed to keep clean-air areas clean. New 
                or modified plants could pollute all the way up to public health 
                standards. This, in effect, would repeal the "nondegredation" 
                provisions of existing law that are designed to protect clean-air 
                areas from air quality degredation. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Would gut

                any downwind state from bringing an action to force cleanup in 
                upwind states' interstate cleanup before 2012; afterwards, the 
                bill says EPA shall not require emission reductions in upwind 
                states unless it determines that the reductions can happen at 
                least as cost-effectively as control of other sources AND that 
                the emission reductions would improve air quality in the downwind 
                state at least as cost effectively as other cleanup measures. 
                This is a fundamental attack on states' rights. </font>
