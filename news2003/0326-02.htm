                WA. - March 26 - Wade Hudson, co-coordinator of the war crimes 
                monitoring aspect of the Iraq Peace Team, sent a report via email 
                from Baghdad earlier today describing some of what he and his 
                fellow delegates witnessed while visiting wounded civilians at 
                the Alyarmouk hospital in Baghdad on March 23rd. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Alyarmouk 
                hospital is a university teaching hospital and one of the largest 
                and most modern hospitals in Iraq. It is one of three medical 
                centers prepared by the authorities to receive victims of the 
                attack by the US. Many foreign doctors and surgeons, Americans 
                included, are in Baghdad to offer their services to these hospitals 
                during the war. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the 
                patients the Peace Team delegates met with was Rahab Wedad Mohammad, 
                age 25, who had just come out of surgery under general anesthesia. 
                She was the moved to the women's section of the hospital where 
                some of the Iraq Peace Team delegates were able to visit with 
                her. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Her right cheek 
                was swollen and her right forearm was heavily bandaged. According 
                to a female doctor on staff, Mohammad's tendons had been severed 
                by shrapnel. Surgeons had sewn the tendons back together, along 
                with nerves and blood vessels. In conversations with Mohammad, 
                the delegates learned that she was in her home in the residential 
                district of Hayy Jamiya on Saturday night (the 3rd straight night 
                of US bombs raining down on her home city) when a bomb detonated 
                nearby. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zaha Seheil 
                lay quietly on a bed opposite Mohammad's. Zaha is six years old. 
                The doctor informed the Peace Team members that Zaha was wounded 
                in her back, suffering a spinal injury which has made her paraplegic. 
                </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the men's 
                section of the hospital, Hudson and his team members visited with 
                Rusul Salim Abbas. Abbas, 10 years old, was hit by shrapnel in 
                the chest and on the right hand. He suffered his injuries on Friday 
                night when the bombing was the heaviest, lasting for four continuous 
                hours. "He was going to close the door when he was hit", says 
                Salim Abbas, the boy's father, seated on the edge of his son's 
                bed. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On a nearby 
                bed lay Salah Mehdi, age 33. Mehdi was walking down the street 
                Saturday night in the residential district of Amariya when a missile 
                exploded nearby. "I just saw a huge fireball and I lost consciousness" 
                he says with difficulty. Mehdi bore shrapnel wounds in the stomach, 
                on his right hand and his right ear. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the next 
                bed Omar`Ali, 12 years old, was one of twelve members of his family 
                injured Friday night in the residential district of Al Shorta 
                when a bomb hit near their house. On nearby beds were also Majid 
                Mahmoud, aged 57 and father of two, injured the very first night 
                of bombing, and Hussein Jassim Fleh, aged 36 and father of a young 
                daughter, injured Saturday night. Fleh was wounded in the back, 
                as well as on both arms and legs. </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hudson asks 
                in his online journal (available at <a href="http://inlet.org/wade" target="_new">http://inlet.org/wade</a>) 
                "Was the shrapnel from US missiles and bombs, or from falling 
                Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery? Given the delicate hospital conditions 
                in which these visits were made, and the lack of expert ballistics 
                evidence, it is difficult to tell what actually caused these injuries 
                and scores of others like them in hospitals across the country." 
                Hudson quotes an Iraqi TV reporter who was also at the hospital 
                to film the wounded: "Whatever the origin of the shrapnel, Bush 
                must bear full responsibility because he chose to impose this 
                war on Iraq." </font> 
                <p></p>
                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of 
                the delegation were able to take photos of some of the injuries 
                which are available online at <a href="http://iraqpeaceteam.org" target="_new">http://iraqpeaceteam.org</a> 
                The Iraq Peace Team is a project initiated by Voices in the Wilderness, 
                a joint US/UK campaign working to end the economic sanctions against 
                the people of Iraq since March of 1996. The delegates of the Iraq 
                Peace Team do not consider themselves to be 'human shields' nor 
                are they affiliated with any 'human shield' projects </font>
