<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since September 11th, our  readership has soared. In August, Common Dreams website received just over 3 million hits. In November, hits had skyrocketed to nearly 8 million/monthly and climbing. It's clear that progressives are hungry for news and views that they aren't finding in the mainstream media.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, in recent months our expenses have also climbed dramatically. Our web site fees alone have risen by over 500% as traffic to our site soared.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are a non-profit funded exclusively by our members and supporters - no corporate money, no advertising, no hidden agendas. With a small staff and a network of volunteers, we are proud of what we've accomplished on a shoestring budget over the past four years. But we can't keep moving forward without your help.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you support the work we do, we need to ask for your help now. Please make a contribution to Common Dreams. And, please, be as generous as possible. Thank you.</font></p>
