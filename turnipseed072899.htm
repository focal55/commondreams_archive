<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><b>Paying The Price of Economic 
Oppression</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
By Tom Turnipseed<br>
July 28, 1999</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">Columbia, 
S.C. -- The boycott of South Carolina led by the NAACP, fellow civil rights groups 
and people of goodwill throughout the nation that encourages people to stay away 
from our state until the Confederate flag is removed from its position of sovereignty 
atop our capitol dome carries the same kind of economic price experienced for 
centuries by black folks struggling against injustice in the United States.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black service workers in the tourism industry in 
South Carolina will pay a price for the boycott against the Confederate flag, 
a symbol of their economic oppression. According to the New York Times and other 
media accounts, they've been paying for years - as many wake up at 4 AM, feed 
their children, and then ride a Rural Transportation Authority bus, sometimes 
for 2 hours or more to Hilton Head or Myrtle Beach, make beds, clean rooms and 
perform other low wage jobs for the multi-billion dollar tourist industry all 
day, then return home at 8 PM to feed and put their children to bed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacrifice is an honorable and heroic heritage for 
African-Americans. When Rosa Lee Parks, a black seamstress, refused to sit behind 
the symbolic line of white supremacy on a Montgomery, Alabama city bus in 1955, 
the thousands of maids, yard boys, waiters, and other black service workers who 
joined the Montgomery bus boycott suffered for 382 days until they finally raised 
the consciousness of our nation whose judicial system erased the symbolic line 
of oppression and blacks won the right to sit anywhere on the bus.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White politicians lacking the courage to face up 
to their own acceptance of such symbols of racial oppression insultingly argue 
in South Carolina in 1999, as they did in Alabama in 1955, that blacks are only 
hurting themselves because they are suffering the most from the boycotts. They 
lack the will to apply the Golden Rule and empathize with the 400 years of racial 
and economic injustice suffered by African-Americans. White privilege and political 
expediency have veiled their eyes and hardened their hearts to the suffering of 
blacks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;African-Americans have given "their last, best measure" 
for the cause of freedom and racial justice throughout our history. From the martyrdom 
of Denmark Vesey and his 34 comrades of color who were publicly hanged for their 
attempt to lead slaves to freedom in Charleston in 1822, to the killings of Martin 
Luther King, Jr. and several of his fellow civil rights freedom fighters in the 
1960's, African-Americans have been willing to pay the ultimate price.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vesey, a free black carpenter, was something of 
an evangelist who was focused on the biblical story of the deliverance of the 
children of Israel from enslavement in Egypt and was so appalled at the barbarity 
of slavery that he led an armed slave revolt against the enslavement of his people, 
knowing he might die as a consequence. His life in Charleston, a seaport city 
in South Carolina through which more slaves entered the United States than any 
other, exposed him to the horrors of slavery. Later, the Confederacy was birthed 
in South Carolina, with the "first shots" to start the Civil War fired at Fort 
Sumter by Citadel cadets in Charleston, and South Carolina being the first state 
to secede from the Union.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Martin L. King, Jr. was willing to pay the supreme 
price for the cause in the tradition of Jesus and Gandhi, his role models for 
his peaceful, non-violent resistance to injustice and activism for social change. 
The night before his assassination in Memphis he told his followers that "longevity 
has its rewards" but he had "been to the mountaintop" and "seen the other side" 
and he was "not afraid anymore." Dr. King had been threatened so much that he 
had a premonition of his destiny to die for the cause of freedom and social justice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's inspiring to see Dr. King's son, Martin L King, 
III, leading his martyred father's civil rights organization, The Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, and joining in the struggle to remove the Confederate flag 
from the dome of our capitol in South Carolina. Like his Dad, who led the Montgomery 
boycott in 1955 to rid the city's busses of their symbol of oppression, Martin 
King is a leader in a broad-based boycott to rid our State House of such a symbol. 
Sadly, white politicians, now as then, can't muster the empathy to understand 
the continuing economic sacrifices of oppressed people.</font></font></p>
