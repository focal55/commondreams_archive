OTTAWA - Lloyd Axworthy is agitated. Breathless, he's rushing to catch a commuter flight from Victoria to Vancouver where he will teach his first class since leaving politics to head a West Coast international affairs think tank.
<P></P>
But it is not his new life that is giving Axworthy fits. Early in the morning of the first working week in September, Canada's former foreign affairs minister is suffering a recurrence of one of his nasty bouts with Washington.
<P></P>
"This is a government that has retreated so far back into the dark ages that there isn't even a candle lit any more," he says over the telephone.
<P></P>
The government Axworthy is talking about is the new administration of the younger, far more doctrinaire George Bush. And the dark ages that he fears will extinguish the candle of hope are the bad old days of nuclear proliferation.
<P></P>
Sometime in the next six weeks, the U.S. is expected to signal a significant shift in its defense policy by withdrawing its objections to China's plans to strengthen a now relatively modest nuclear arsenal. Timed for Bush's October visit to Beijing, the watershed reversal is intended to calm Chinese fears about the controversial U.S. proposal to unfold a missile defense umbrella in space.
<P></P>
Washington's thinking, telegraphed through diplomatic channels in recent weeks, is that China's nuclear expansion is inevitable. By acquiescing now, the U.S. hopes to support its case that the controversial Son of Star Wars project is aimed at rogue states, not Beijing or any other Cold War adversary.
<P></P>
Axworthy, along with equally vocal critics in the U.S., Is horrified. He dismisses the U.S. rationale as "sophistry" and a self-fulfilling prophecy that puts at risk 40 years of intense, if imperfect, efforts to limit the world's exposure to weapons of mass destruction.
<P></P>
Those efforts have had some effect. Nuclear capability is limited to a handful of nations and while the U.S. Senate refused to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1999, a strong international consensus exists against both proliferation and renewed testing.
<P></P>
All that could be turned on its head by Washington's determination to forge ahead, apparently at almost any cost, with the unproven national missile defense shield. The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, considered the cornerstone of international arms control, would be rendered obsolete by construction of the now banned defense system. And the development of more sophisticated missiles would inevitably lead to a new round of environmentally hazardous tests.
<P></P>
What worries Axworthy almost as much is Washington's determination to impose its will on the world. 
<P></P>
To get its way on a missile defense system that may never work and promises only very limited protection from the broad spectrum of terrorist threats, it is willing to jeopardize international stability.
<P></P>
That instability would begin with China increasing its long-range ability to strike and spread across Asia to the flashpoint of India and Pakistan. Ironically, it could even provide a catalyst for the development and spread of weapons capable of defeating the search and destroy capabilities of the proposed missile defense system.
<P></P>
Those risks are so great that Axworthy believes Canada must now climb down from its comfortable spot on the diplomatic fence. It should tell Washington that by flexing its muscles as the last superpower it is trading short-term gains for long-term losses in everything from defense and trade to human rights and democracy.
<P></P>
Don't expect to hear that soon from the government Axworthy served until last year. Ottawa still clings to the hope that it will be spared a difficult decision by the current political stalemate in the U.S. and by the time it will take to make a missile defense system viable.
<P></P>
That position hasn't changed since spring when Washington told Canada to wait quietly on the sidelines while it consults its worried European allies, as well as Russia and China. What has changed is that the U.S. Is now scuffing its toe along a line drawn in this country's sand long ago.
<P></P>
As important as the U.S. Defense and economic relationship is to Canada, the doctrine of nuclear non-proliferation is not negotiable north of the border. While Canada would welcome a more sophisticated deterrent than the dated and dangerous Cold War threat of mutual annihilation, it would be absurd to bargain a suspect space shield in exchange for a world bristling with more weapons.
<P></P>
Prudence and history suggest Prime Minister Jean Chr&eacute;tien will opt for a more subtle message than the one Axworthy advocates. But to opt for equivocation now would be to join ranks with Bush in what is increasingly an obvious march of folly.
<P></P>
