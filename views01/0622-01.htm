What we see is what we get, or so the adage goes. But when we see 
the designs of mass media, what do we truly get? That's a troubling 
question for those who wonder what the constant barrages of media-generated 
images are doing to our lives.

         <p>Journalists who use words on the job are not the only media 
professionals who have cause to doubt the merits of their labors. The 
visual images that surround us -- whether on screens, printed pages, 
billboards, T-shirts or store shelves -- are the products of highly skilled 
designers, enormous amounts of money and state-of-the-art technology. 
Behind the images, some of the talent is growing vocally restless.

         <p>For a couple of years now, many designers and art directors have 
hotly debated "First Things First 2000," a global manifesto urging "a 
reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic 
forms of communication -- a mindshift away from product marketing and 
toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning." The 
original signers, 33 prominent design professionals, have been joined as 
endorsers by hundreds of colleagues.

         <p>"Designers who devote their efforts primarily to advertising, 
marketing and brand development are supporting, and implicitly endorsing, a 
mental environment so saturated with commercial messages that it is 
changing the very way citizen-consumers speak, think, feel, respond and 
interact," the statement says.

         
<p>While assessing the arguments sparked by "First Things First," the 
latest issue of Adbusters magazine (<a href="http://www.adbusters.org" target="new">www.adbusters.org</a>) offers observations 
that are directly relevant to various aspects of the media industry. Today, 
we face "the desperate need to preserve a space for other forms of thinking 
and ways of being -- a protected zone free of the commercial inferno."

         <p>When dissident designers lament the impacts of prevalent visual 
images, their comments also apply to routine journalistic output. Rick 
Poynor, founding editor of the international journal Eye, puts it this way: 
"What we are rapidly losing sight of, in the rush to add seductive 
stylistic value to commercial goods and services and to transform life into 
a brand- and status-obsessed shopping spree, is the idea that design, as a 
way of thinking about systems, structures and relationships -- large and 
small, conceptual and visual -- could have uses other than commercial 
promotion."

         <p>Visual design, Poynor suggests, "might also be an imaginative tool 
for solving non-commercial problems; for shaping a sustainable environment 
and an equitable public realm; for encouraging democratic participation and 
new kinds of social interaction; for expressing ideas, values and ways of 
feeling that originate down below, among ordinary people -- us! -- in our 
own neighborhoods, from our own concerns." Creative design could be used 
"in service to our collectively determined community needs, not just to 
deliver top-down fashion diktats and purchasing imperatives from megacorp 
boardrooms and conquer-the-world marketing teams."

         <p>Privatization of public space -- from sports stadiums and museums 
to buses, classrooms and "public broadcasting" -- has been on an insidious 
bender for decades. We become accustomed to what was once unthinkable, and 
the trend moves in only one direction. Public reclamation of corporately 
privatized space is rare. Big money commonly rolls over other concerns.

         <p>Reversing such momentum would mean reclaiming truly public areas 
while banishing the endless panoplies of logos, branded concessions and 
investor-driven joint ventures. But even when no commercial interests seem 
to be involved, the heavy hand of capital often provides a strong tilt, 
with key media outlets continuously inflicting their relentless priorities 
on the public.

         <p>So, simultaneously, on one afternoon in late June, the hosts of 
programs airing on CNN and MSNBC were talking about the by-now-famous 
incident in San Jose when a man flung a dog named Leo into oncoming 
traffic. Ostensibly about a murdered pooch, the coverage reflected the 
ability of profit-fixated networks -- owned by companies like AOL Time 
Warner, Microsoft and General Electric -- to focus national attention on 
psychodramas like the gruesome demise of a doggie.

         <p>This enormous power to subject the American public to serial 
triviality is far from trivial. It has everything to do with the leverage 
exerted by multibillion-dollar media conglomerates as they skew the words 
and images undergoing mass distribution.

         <p>We're told that the public's appetite for human interest stories 
about crime and punishment is insatiable. But most of all, the latest 
breathless news sagas are cases of force-feeding. Crammed down the throats 
of the public, the scoops and scandals of the day seldom tell us anything 
about dominant power structures and ongoing inequities while we consume the 
latest frothy media sensations.
<p><i>Norman Solomon's latest book is "The Habits of Highly Deceptive Media." His 
syndicated column focuses on media and politics.</i>
