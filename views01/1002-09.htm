<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->In our imminent war in the Middle East, it might be wise for our leaders to 
step back and study the pages of history. After Germany was destroyed in 
World War I, the world allowed that country to wallow in squalor, providing 
the perfect environment for Nazism to fester and grow into a monster. When 
we finally beat this new monster in World War II, our leaders understood 
that in order to permanently prevent another inter-continental conflict we 
would have to address the desperate economic situations that created the war 
environment in the first place. America responded with the Marshall Plan 
that sent billions in economic aid abroad, and the result has been one of 
the strongest alliances between two continents in modern history.

<p>Now, instead of fighting fascism, we are fighting terrorism, but the lesson 
the Marshall Plan taught us about how to create a lasting solution should be 
the same. In our new war, we must not only pursue the terrorists who 
perpetrated the September 11th attack, but also aggressively attack 
international poverty that provides the breeding ground for terrorism in the 
first place.

<p>Historically, humans tend to confront only the immediate threat - the 
intruder, the enemy - and not underlying motivations. In science, this is 
called a fundamental attribution error. It is as if a doctor tried to cure a 
painful cancer by giving the patient a painkiller instead of removing the 
tumor. War, violence and religious fundamentalism are merely the symptom. 
The true disease is poverty, oppression and hopelessness that allow these 
evils to fester. The more desperate a population, the more susceptible it is 
to embracing extremism and becoming a trouble spot. Terrorist demagogues 
like Osama bin Laden may mask their goals in religious themes - but the 
reason their rhetoric finds such a captive audience is because they are 
preaching an us-versus-them message to a population looking for something – 
anything – to cling to. The September 11th disaster was merely the latest 
success in their populist campaign.

<p>But now we live in an age where suicidal barbarians can kill thousands at a 
time, right on our own soil. The threat is now so great, that need something 
other than our normal strategy of  “containment.” We must finally address 
the real problem of international poverty that has helped transform 
anti-Americanism sentiment into the monstrous deeds of September 11th.  That 
means reversing our recent decrease in foreign aid and investing capital 
abroad not only to strengthen our own economy and corporate assets, but to 
strengthen the host country's economy and standard of living as well 
(Israel, Taiwan, and South Korea are just a few successes). That means 
countering the image of American opulence spread by the media with a serious 
commitment to making sure that there is as little squalor throughout the 
globe as possible. In short, that means embarking on a groundbreaking 
campaign to finally engage impoverished areas of the world that we have 
until now largely ignored.

<p>To be sure, we must bring the perpetrators of the September 11th massacre to 
justice. Their crimes are unspeakable and they pose a serious security 
threat to our nation. Additionally, though, we must seize this moment to 
begin addressing how to end terrorism now - and forever. Whereas before, 
internationalism may have been altruism, it is now clearly in our own 
self-interest to prevent more countries from falling into the same type of 
squalor that has galvanized extremism in parts of the Middle East. In the 
heightened stakes of a nuclear age, we need not only a jihad against 
terrorism, but a jihad against the roots of jihad itself.
