<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans
        who watched the news media rush to judgment on Election Night -- first
        awarding Florida to Al Gore and then giving it to George W. Bush and
        then settling on &quot;too close to call&quot; -- might have thought the
        national press corps had learned its lesson.
</font>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You might have thought
        that major news organizations would at least wait for the final tallies
        in the unofficial recounts now underway before calling a winner.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you had that expectation,
        you'd be disappointed again.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The latest bizarre example of
        the news media's compulsive rush to judgment has come in the handling of
        a <i>Miami Herald/USA Today</i> report about an unofficial tally of
        Miami-Dade &quot;undervotes,&quot; ballots that were rejected by
        counting machines as registering no choice for president.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The latest facts were these:
        After examining Miami-Dade's 10,646 undervotes -- out of about 60,000
        statewide -- this unofficial tally found Gore closing to within about
        140 votes of Bush. In other words with nearly 50,000 undervotes still to
        be examined, only about 140 votes separated the two candidates.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those who have been following
        the work of other Florida news organizations in other counties also
        would know that hundreds of uncounted votes clearly intended for Gore or
        Bush had been discovered over the past two months, both in &quot;undervotes&quot;
        and in &quot;overvotes&quot; in which voters had marked their ballot for
        a candidate and then written in the candidate's name.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From these other unofficial
        tallies, Gore had made surprising net gains in some counties that had
        favored Bush overall. By some counts, Gore even had pulled ahead of
        Bush, though clearly the outcome of these unofficial tallies remained in
        doubt.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once all the counting was over,
        it seemed plausible that either Bush might hold on to a narrow lead or
        that Gore might inch ahead.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Either result, of course, would
        not change the fact that Bush had been awarded Florida’s 25 electoral
        votes and had become the first national popular-vote loser in more than
        a century to claim the White House.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nor would the unofficial tallies
        change the reality that Gore almost certainly was the choice of a
        plurality of Floridians -- if not for the confusing ballot in Palm Beach
        County, which apparently caused thousands of elderly Jews to vote for
        Pat Buchanan, and the state's alleged purging of thousands of
        African-Americans from the rolls on the grounds that their names were
        similar to those of convicted felons.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The unofficial newspaper tallies
        were intended only as an historical marker. So why the rush? Wouldn’t
        it make sense to wait until the statewide tallies were complete so as
        not to sow any more confusion and distrust? At minimum, wouldn’t it be
        reasonable to make clear how limited any new partial tally was?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Not in the Cards</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That apparently is not how the
        American news media works anymore. The big-name news organizations
        seemed to have learned nothing from Election Night.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rather than cautious, balanced
        stories about the limits of the new Miami-Dade tabulation, the news
        media rushed to declare Bush the legitimate winner in Florida and thus
        of the presidency.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“If a manual recount of
        presidential ballots had gone forward in Miami-Dade County, George W.
        Bush likely would have won the presidency outright,” wrote the <i>Miami
        Herald</i>. [Feb. 26, 2001]</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Review Finds Bush Won Despite
        Miami Recount,” declared a headline in <i>The Washington Post</i>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“A review of Florida ballots
        suggested Gore wouldn’t have gained enough in a recount to win the
        presidency, the <i>Miami Herald</i> said,’’ summarized the <i>Wall
        Street Journal</i>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By Monday evening on television,
        the limited findings of the <i>Miami Herald</i> had been transformed
        into the final word that Bush really did win the election. Without
        doubt, millions of Americans who still have faith in the national news
        media will go away with that impression.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, besides exaggerating the
        conclusions, the articles were misleading in another way. They suggested
        that the only recounts that mattered were the ones in South Florida
        where the Gore campaign first raised questions about the results. The
        hook for the <i>Miami Herald</i> story really was that if Bush and his
        campaign had not frustrated those early recounts, they still would have
        been slightly ahead.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the decisive recount issue
        was not the count in South Florida. It was Bush's success in having his
        five conservative allies on the U.S. Supreme Court overturn a ruling by
        the Florida Supreme Court that had mandated a <i>statewide</i> recount
        of the so-called undervotes.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That recount of 69 Florida
        counties was underway on Dec. 9 when the five conservative justices in
        Washington took the unprecedented step of halting the counting of votes
        in a U.S. presidential election. Then, on Dec. 12, they prevented a
        resumption of the recount, effectively handing the presidency to Bush.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If there were to be any
        meaningful measure about whether history was altered by that decision,
        it should have been made against the statewide recount, not simply the
        recount in South Florida.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even more to the point is the
        question of what was the will of the Florida voters. Even casting aside
        the irregularities, did ballots registering clear intent of voters favor
        Gore or Bush?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These key issues were ignored by
        virtually all the news reports on Monday. The story was quite simple:
        Bush wins, this time for real.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
As on Election Night – though
        without the excuse of the deadline pressure – the national press corps
        had demonstrated once more how much of a threat it has become to the
        goal of an informed electorate.
