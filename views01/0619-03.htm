THE TITLE of most buffoonish member of Congress is not lightly given because, I
suppose, there are so many contenders.
<P>
    Until this week, everybody's favorite was James A. Traficant, the nominal
Ohio Democrat who votes with the Republican caucus and whose ravings on the
House floor often border on incoherence. But Traficant, who is so original that
even his haircut looks like a space alien's, brings an agreeable degree of
honest eccentricity to a Congress saturated with tedious conventionality.
<P>
    Bob Barr (R-Ga.) is an obvious choice but he ruins his chances for the
prize because he is not as stupid as he is stupefyingly mean.
<P>
    Some people would nominate Dan Burton (R-Ind.), unfairly I would say,
because even the clownish inquisitions his government reform committee
frequently undertakes are honestly reflective of the sturdy right wing Hoosiers
who populate Indiana's Sixth Congressional District.
<P>
    Tom DeLay (R-Texas), the reformed former termite exterminator who says he
used to drink 12 martinis a night, would be on anybody's list for no better
reason than that this self-described "God-centered" man doesn't, it was
recently revealed, even speak to his own mother and three siblings.
<P>
    Still, that's an anecdotal irrelevance compared with the unarguable
effectiveness of his shoot-the-wounded style of House leadership that has
earned him the nickname "the Hammer."
    Now it suddenly appears that the embarrassment of being Congress' worst
embarrassment belongs hands down to an obscure congressman and piece of work
named Jim Hansen (R-Utah). He's the one who went on National Public Radio last
week and, with breathtaking bad taste, trashed Puerto Ricans. What provoked
Hansen was President Bush's decision to stop bombing the island of Vieques to
smithereens but not until 2003.
<P>
    Read Hansen's own words: "I come down to the idea where I don't see where
Puerto Rico should get any favorite treatment over the rest of these people.
<P>
Now what have they done to get it? They sit down there on welfare and very few
of them paying taxes, got a sweetheart deal. I just don't see the equity in it
but maybe I don't understand it."
    There are so many things the thick-witted congressman must not understand
such as the last thing Bush needs is some raving bigot blowing up the bridges
he is so assiduously trying to build to the nation's Hispanic population.
<P>
Hansen expresses the sort of vulgar, ignorant and inelegant philosophy usually
spouted by people who say "All Puerto Ricans are ..." and then fill in the
blanks with whatever vile insult pops into their heads.
<P>
    There are, I suppose, a lot of ignorant people who would make mindless
generalizations about blameless people who live in Utah. These would include
such slanders as Utah is a state full of sex-crazed polygamists or that it is
populated by intolerant fanatics because until recent years black people were
excluded from the Mormon Church.
<P>
    The splendid people of Puerto Rico have seen their language and culture
thrive and prosper in the face of worse insults and patronizing mainland
attitudes. So I hope the good citizens of Utah will rise above the indignities
and shame Hansen invites on them.
