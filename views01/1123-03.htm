Say it! We don't have a health-care system. We have a business-to-business enterprise 
that is unsustainable. We have no goals, no outcomes, no objectives other than 
controlling costs and preventing or containing epidemics. Neither accountability 
nor responsibility exist. Instead, everyone is pitted against each other for their 
own economic survival. 
<P> And, it is going to get much worse. Hospitals and clinics are competing against 
each other for employees and are giving salary increases and signing bonuses just 
to get them. Check the want ads. All this does is increase their overhead. 
<P> But, while these costs are going up, the economy is tanking. We are in a recession. 
This means more layoffs, more uninsured. If the number of uninsured increased 
by 10 million people in the middle of our greatest economic growth, what in the 
world is going to happen in the midst of this recession? Safety net? Hardly. 
<P> Hospital and physician clinics have been bleeding for years. Clinics are closing 
or merging. People are losing jobs in droves. Some think the number of uninsured 
in Spokane alone will be as high as 25 percent. 
<P> Over $1.8 billion is now coming out of the state budget. Where is that coming 
from? Off the backs of the weakest and most vulnerable: children, the poor, the 
elderly and chronically mentally ill. What will happen to them? Where will they 
go? What care will they not get? 
<P> We can no longer keep whacking each other in the health-care blame-and-game 
battlefield. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a 
different result. It is time to stop re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic. 
<P> We are at the tipping point. Health-care costs are going up too much to be 
sustainable for businesses or individuals or the government. More people will 
be uninsured, as much as from the economy as from Sept. 11. We have never before 
acted as a community when it comes to our health care. We have only come at it 
from cost, as an employee benefit, not for the health of the nation. 
<P> This must change. We must look at the health of our communities together. 
But, before we do so, we need some guiding principles. So, I offer a "Health Care 
Magna Carta" to hold us all accountable for the decisions that will be made. 
<P> We need a national dialogue, state by state, on what a system of health care 
should do. We have never asked this question as a society, a state or a nation. 
Oregon tried in Oregon Health Choices with its community dialogues. But, they 
asked the wrong questions. 
<P> We need to ask what a system of care should do, how each of us can participate 
in it, and outline our respective roles and responsibilities. Then, and only then, 
can we create a system of care with rights, responsibilities and accountabilities 
rather than point fingers of blame as we all game to our economic self-interest. 
<P> To that end, I offer here excerpts from that Magna Carta: 
<P> &#149; We believe we must all participate in health-care decisions and that 
health care is too important to be left to someone else; 
<P> &#149; We believe everyone who participates in the health-care system should 
pay for it &#151; individuals, businesses and government; 
<P> &#149; We believe all people should have access to a common set of health-care 
services that promote the health and well-being of our nation; 
<P> &#149; We believe no person should face bankruptcy because of catastrophic 
health-care costs; 
<P> &#149; We believe in the freedom of employers to offer more than a common 
set of health-care services; 
<P> &#149; We believe we should all be in the same risk pool rather than separate 
our society into smaller and smaller segments; 
<P> &#149; We believe we all need clear and succinct information about health-care 
services and benefits; 
<P> &#149; We believe we need central standards and management of health-care 
financing and services, just as we have central standards and management for the 
banking industry, but we also need local flexibility to meet the specific health-care 
needs of our communities; 
<P> &#149; We believe funds for health-care services should not be dictated by 
the specific health-care categories; 
<P> &#149; We believe we must hold a structured national dialogue so we can define 
the goals of a health-care system that can sustain the health and well-being of 
our nation and of our people. 
<P> To that end, I have created a contest and pledge my own funds to start it. 
I invite corporations to compete with a $1,000 entry fee, which will be used in 
part to manage the contest and to fund a scholarship for the colleges and universities 
that will participate.
