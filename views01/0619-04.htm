Ward Connerly supports white privilege by speaking the language of a 
colorblind society.  His proposed ballot measure — the Racial Privacy 
Initiative — would prohibit many California agencies from seeking racial data. 
<p>Connerly, who has to get about 1 million signatures by mid-August to 
qualify the Racial Privacy Initiative for the March 2002 ballot, thus seeks 
to turn the reality of skin color on its head.

<p>Meanwhile, white privilege is many things.  One is not thinking about the 
meaning of being white.  Pointing this out is unacceptable in the 
mainstream.  Connerly is thus able to avoid the subject of white privilege, 
which makes it more powerful.

<p>W.E.B. Du Bois said that white privilege pays a “public and psychological 
wage” in America.  Much of his point about white skin color rings true 
today.

<p>Publicly, being white includes avoiding police stops based on skin color.  
Nonwhite Americans live differently.  Just listen to them.

<p>A little over a year ago, I went to one of a series of town hall meetings on 
racial profiling being held throughout California, sponsored by the Racial 
Justice Coalition. Dozens of black and brown men and women testified clearly 
and forcefully how their skin color has spurred harmful stops and arrests by 
law-enforcement officers. One young woman of color who attends CSU, 
Sacramento said that a police officer in an unmarked car fol-lowed her for 
miles at night, and then finally showed identification after stopping and 
requesting her driver's license. The police were attempting to “clear some 
garbage from the streets,” he told her.  “I may have been many things in my 
life,” the young woman said, “but being a piece of garbage isn’t one of 
them.”

<p>In the meantime, the voices of the racially profiled have been downplayed by 
Connerly, a Republican, and California Governor Gray Davis, a Democrat.  In 
fact, the governor has opposed legislation for all of the state’s 
law-enforcement agencies to collect data on the racial profiles of people 
stopped and arrested.

<p>White privilege also means improved job opportunities.  Nationwide, the May 
jobless rate was 4.4 percent—whites, 3.8 percent, blacks, 8.0 percent and 
Latinos, 6.2 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

<p>Consider white privilege and the reforming of welfare recipients into hourly 
workers.  “Compared to their white counterparts, black recipients were more 
likely to be required to take a pre-employment test, less likely to obtain 
employment regardless of educational background and less likely to report 
receiving job or educational information from caseworkers,” the American 
Friends Service Committee recently reported.

<p>Equality of job opportunity is a myth.  White privilege matters when it 
comes to finding work.

<p>Recall that Connerly, a Sacramento businessman and University of California 
Regent, backed the state’s Proposition 209, which voters passed in 1996. 
Proposition 209 was a ballot measure that stopped state government 
preferences based on race and gender.  Supposedly, this was the way to 
return California to a level playing field where citizens competed equally 
and the most qualified were rewarded.

<p>Biologically, of course, there is a single race.  We are all part of the 
human race.

<p>Yet racial ideology is a different thing.  Consider changing definitions of 
who is white and nonwhite.

<p>Before World War I, America’s WASP elite viewed my Jewish immigrant 
ancestors from Europe as racially inferior.  Later, they and many like them 
“whitened,” as Karen Brodkin Sacks demonstrated in “How Did Jews Become 
White Folks?”

<p>Irish immigrants to America, once thought to be a separate race, also become 
white.  Noel Ignatiev’s book analyzes this subject in stark detail.

<p>My point?  Race doesn’t always have to be a skin color issue.  America just 
seems that way in 2001.

<p>Psychologically, white-skin privilege is very complex.  In America, the 
enslaving of Africans and conquering of Natives created and sustained the 
idea of nonwhite people who deserve their oppression. Thus arose a 
definition of whiteness based on theft of labor and land from the 
darker-skinned “Other.”

<p>With the American ethnic cleansing came the ideology of white privilege.  
Later as industrial capitalism began, white workers’ additional loss of 
humanity opened a new chapter of white privilege, David Roediger wrote.

<p>On one hand, job insecurity is partly the story behind the political use of 
white privilege in California.  The military base closures and corporate 
downsizings and restructurings that cut stable, well-paying jobs during the 
1990s paved the way for attacks on immigrants and affirmative action in the 
state.

<p>On the other hand, appeals to economic class that sidestep white privilege 
and all that it conceals and reveals are limited.  Ralph Nader’s two 
presidential campaigns (that I supported) are cases in point.

<p>White privilege is a misfortune and a part of economic class relations.  Not 
one or the other but both.

<p>White Californians can’t be free if their nonwhite counterparts are unfree.  
Ending white privilege is a step towards true equality.  Let that be a 
response to Connerly.
