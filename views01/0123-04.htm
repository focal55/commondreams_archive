I'M ONE of the idiots who figured George W. wouldn't do much damage as 
president. He struck me as someone whose conservative principles would be 
tempered by generational realities.
<P>  In other words, because he had spent nearly his entire adult life in a 
country where abortion was legal, and because he is the father of two 
daughters and husband to a woman who is pro-choice, he would understand why 
abortion needs to be available to women, even if he is personally opposed to 
it.
</P>
<P>  I believed him when he said his top priorities were education and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>  Today, I feel as stupid and gullible as the California Legislature's 
deregulation advocates.
</P>
<P>  Yesterday, on Bush's very first workday as president, he announced he would 
block U.S. financial aid to international family-planning organizations that 
provide abortion and/or abortion counseling. Let's be clear. These 
organizations do not use the U.S. money to pay for abortions. Even under 
Clinton that was illegal and has been since 1973. What Bush is doing is 
yanking all aid to all organizations that have the temerity to spend their own 
money on providing abortions.
</P>
<P>  This ban comes from a man whose scope of international travel begins and 
ends in Mexico. Bush has no clue about life in an African village or an 
overcrowded slum in India. Do you think he knows that 585,000 women in Third 
World countries die each year of pregnancy-related complications, according to 
the World Health Organization? Do you think he knows how many women die 
drinking pesticides or bleach attempting to end their pregnancies? Does he 
know how many lives are saved by the wide range of work these organizations do,
</P>
<P>aside from abortions?
</P>
<P>  He can't know or he couldn't have said, with a straight face, that he made 
this decision because life is precious.
</P>
<P>  "Funding for reproductive health and rights is an issue of life and death 
for women," said Kavita N. Ramdas, president and CEO of the Global Fund for 
Women. "Instead of being a champion of women's rights, Bush shows the United 
States will set them back tremendously."
</P>
<P>  But wait! There's more!
</P>
<P>  It wasn't enough that Bush nominated two diehard abortion opponents to his 
Cabinet in John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson, or that he is imposing this ban 
on international funding. Bush also said yesterday he was ordering a review of 
the government's approval four months ago of the RU-486 abortion pill.
</P>
<P>  "I'm not surprised," said Belle Taylor-McGhee, the executive director of 
California Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. "But this is a 
sobering reminder that Bush is going to push his anti-abortion agenda, despite 
what Americans feel about the issue. Look, women are dying around the world. 
It's not compassionate conservatism to say to women in undeveloped countries 
that we're going to make your decisions about what's best for you."
</P>
<P>  If people are surprised by Bush's actions, Taylor-McGhee said, it's because 
the media didn't press him enough about abortion during the campaign. I agree, 
and I plead guilty. I remember interviewing Bush last year and asking him why 
he was pro-life. He stammered a bit before answering, "My pro-life position is 
I believe there's life. It's not necessarily based in religion. I think 
there's a life there, therefore the notion of life, liberty and pursuit of 
happiness."
</P>
<P>  His fuzzy answer suggested to me at the time that abortion wasn't a burning 
issue for him. Now, I know that he wasn't being lukewarm but simply 
inarticulate.
</P>
<P>  I underestimated Bush. I didn't pay close enough attention. I still believe 
he's in over his head as president. But now I know better than to think he 
won't do much damage. One day in office and he already has.
