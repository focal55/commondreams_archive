            Ariel Sharon's decision not to blast the Palestinians out of existence 

            after last week's suicide bombings is, at first sight, mystifying. 

            While jets blew up the Palestinians' police station in Ramallah and 

            Israeli soldiers occupied their East Jerusalem headquarters, these 

            reprisals were far less bloody than most people had predicted. 

            <P>Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain this uncharacteristic 

              restraint. Sharon is seeking to keep faith with his more conciliatory 

              foreign minister, Shimon Peres. He is hoping to collect some moral 

              credit, which he will use to defend much fiercer intervention at 

              a later date. The seizure of Palestinian offices does more to hurt 

              their cause than the murder of prominent figures. All these explanations 

              are plausible, but there is another possible interpretation, overlooked 

              by almost everyone. In killing Palestinians, Ariel Sharon can no 

              longer be sure that he is killing only Palestinians. 

            <P>For the past few weeks, foreign peace activists belonging to the 

              international solidarity movement have been arriving in Jerusalem 

              and the West Bank, joining demonstrations, staying in the homes 

              of threatened Palestinians, turning themselves into human shields 

              between the Israeli army and its targets. A few days ago they were 

              joined by one of the most remarkable forces in British politics, 

              a group of mostly middle-aged or elderly campaigners called Women 

              in Black UK. These Hell's Grannies have moved straight into the 

              front line, ensuring that the brutality with which the Palestinians 

              are routinely treated now has international repercussions: Israel 

              can't hurt local people without hurting them too. 

            <P>For the past few nights, members of the solidarity movement have 

              been sleeping in the homes of Palestinians in the Bethlehem suburb 

              of Beit Jala. Eight hundred and fifty homes here have been shelled 

              by soldiers stationed in the neighboring Jewish settlement of Gilo, 

              as the army seeks to expel the Palestinians in order to expand Israel's 

              illegal plantation. 

            <P>The foreigners have been standing at army checkpoints, photographing 

              soldiers when they stop people trying to leave or enter their communities 

              and recording the names of those they arrest. The soldiers hate 

              this scrutiny, but whenever the monitors arrive at a checkpoint, 

              there's a marked reduction in the violence there. 

            <P>The Women in Black also helped to organize the demonstrations outside 

              Orient House, the Palestinian headquarters seized by Israel on Friday. 

              They established the physical and political space in which Palestinians 

              could protest non-violently. Arrested and beaten up with the local 

              people, the women witnessed the torture of Palestinian prisoners 

              in the police station, which would otherwise have gone unrecorded. 

            <P>In short, these volunteer peacekeepers are seeking to do precisely 

              what foreign governments have promised but failed to do: to monitor 

              and contest abuses of human rights, to defuse violence, and to challenge 

              Israel's ethnic cleansing program. Their actions put us all to shame. 

            <P>As well as seeking to enforce peace, they are trying, hard as it 

              is in the current atmosphere, to broker it. They have been suggesting 

              to their Palestinian hosts some of the novel means by which injustice 

              can be confronted without the use of violence. They have plenty 

              of experience to draw on. 

            <P>Some of these activists have been involved in the Trident Ploughshares 

              campaign which, over the past fortnight, has been running rings 

              round the marines guarding the nuclear submarines in Scotland. To 

              the astonishment of the guards, the protesters there have managed 

              to evade the tightest security in the UK, swimming into the docks 

              in which the submarines are moored and spray-painting the words 

              "useless" and "illegal" on their sides. They have launched canoes 

              and home-made rafts into the paths of submarines trying to leave 

              their berths. They have cut through the razor wire and roamed around 

              the base, hoping to arrest its commander for crimes against humanity. 

              A few days ago, they blocked the main gates of the nuclear warhead 

              depot, their arms embedded in barrels of concrete, bringing work 

              to a halt as the police tried to figure out how to extract them. 

            <P>Two years ago, three of these women climbed into the Trident program's 

              floating research laboratory on Loch Goil and, as a delightful new 

              video commissioned by the Quakers shows, threw all its computers 

              into the sea. In Greenock court, they were acquitted of criminal 

              damage, after the sheriff accepted their defense that the Trident 

              program. infringes international law: rather than committing a crime, 

              they were preventing one. Soon afterwards, the women "borrowed" 

              a police boat from the Trident base in Coulport and drove it into 

              the submarine docks at Faslane. Among them was one of the women 

              who were also found not guilty in 1996 after smashing up a Hawk 

              aircraft bound for East Timor. The subsequent publicity forced the 

              government to stop exporting Hawks to Indonesia. 

            <P> Though they're acquitted as often as they're convicted, Hell's 

              Grannies have spent much of the past few years in jail. They take 

              full responsibility for their actions. If the police fail to spot 

              them, they ring them up and ask to be arrested. Their candor, clarity 

              and humor have played well in court, but the risks of this accountable 

              campaigning are enormous. The prosecution began yesterday of 17 

              British and American Greenpeace activists, who are being tried on 

              terrorism charges after peacefully occupying the Californian launch 

              pad being used for George Bush's missile defense tests. In the Middle 

              East such tactics are likely to be still more dangerous, as Israeli 

              soldiers have shown no hesitation in killing protesters in cold 

              blood. But, as Gandhi recognized, the brutal treatment of non-violent 

              campaigners can destroy the moral authority of the oppressor, generating 

              inexorable pressure for change. 

            <P>The Women in Black are clearly prepared not only to die for their 

              cause, but also to make what Dostoevsky correctly identified as 

              a far greater sacrifice: to live for their cause. They are ready 

              to lose their homes, their comforts, their liberty, to be vilified, 

              beaten up and imprisoned. Their accountable actions require a far 

              greater courage than throwing bricks at the police. 

            <P>Most importantly perhaps, these campaigners never cease to acknowledge 

              the humanity of their opponents. They seek not to threaten but to 

              persuade. The results can be astonishing. The MoD police who pulled 

              the Trident swimmers out of the water ferried them back to their 

              camp, rather than arresting them, while massaging their legs to 

              stop cramp. When Angie Zelter, one of the coordinators of Women 

              in Black, was on remand for her attempts to demolish the British 

              military machine, she was visited in prison by a timber merchant 

              whose business she had once tried to shut down. He had, as a result 

              of her campaign, stopped importing mahogany stolen from indigenous 

              reserves in Brazil, and started refashioning his business along 

              ethical lines, and now he needed her advice. 

            <P>All this is a long-winded way of saying something which, in the 

              21st century, sounds rather embarrassing: these people are my heroes. 

              They confront us with our own cowardice, our failure to match our 

              convictions with action. We talk about it, they do it. Hell's Grannies 

              are walking through fire. If they can, why can't we all?
