AS LONG AS WE STILL HAVE IT, I'm going to make the most of the First 
Amendment: What we are doing in, above, and to Afghanistan is short-sighted, 
counterproductive and immoral. That I am among a mere 6 or 10 percent of 
Americans (depending on the poll) who feel this way hurts my heart.
<P>The amount of nonthink, or flat-out denial, that is required to support 
Operation Enduring Freedom is painful to contemplate. Sending thousands of 
kids -- "our brave men and women in uniform" -- to risk their lives for it is 
unbearable.
<P>We Americans have never been known for critical thought and analysis. 
Context and historical perspective rank low on our national priorities list, 
somewhere below foreign language skills but above gas conservation. Add to 
that our deliberate myopia and chronic impatience, and you have the U.S. 
military trashing big chunks of Kabul, Kandahar and Mazar-I-Sharif in pursuit 
of a cave-dwelling, mass murderer and his worldwide band of suicidal disciples.
<P>Damn the advice from seasoned experts on terrorism and the Middle East; 
full speed ahead with the cruise missiles.
<P>After all, we had to do something.
<P>That phrase. It has been uttered so many times since Sept. 11, I expect to 
see it printed on our currency any day now. People who call themselves 
pacifists, people who admit that they are uneasy with the destruction we are 
raining down on Afghanistan -- people who can't see how this frenzy of B-1's 
is actually going to get Osama bin Laden -- offer up the phrase as if it were 
a bona fide moral escape clause: We had to do something.
<P>Lord, yes. We'd waited more than three weeks before we started dropping 
bombs. Such restraint. Why don't we at least cut the b.s., and own up to 
exactly what it is we are doing?
<P>First, does the phrase "collateral damage" sound familiar? When Persian 
Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh used it to describe the 168 children and 
adults he murdered in the Oklahoma City bombing, we took it as proof of his 
evilness, as the justification that we needed to execute him.
<P>What is it proof of when U.S. generals use it to describe the Afghan 
civilians that our bombs already have killed? How about the untold numbers who 
will die from hunger or disease on their way to refugee camps that can't take 
them?
<P>Likely, because McVeigh shocked us with the term, "collateral damage" seems 
to have given way to a new euphemism. As Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld put 
it last week:
<P>"There is no question but that when one is engaged militarily that there 
are going to be unintended loss of life." Lest anyone think him cold, Rumsfeld 
added, "And there's no question but that I and anyone involved regrets the 
unintended loss of life."
<P>When U.S. civilians are killed, it's a travesty. When the dead are from 
someplace else -- especially a backward, poverty-stricken country such as 
Afghanistan -- it's regrettable.
<P>Second, let's be honest about the blowback, the truly lethal, political 
time bombs that we plant with every payload among millions of mainstream 
Muslims in the Middle East and Asia. George W. Bush can insist that "the 
United States is a friend to Islam." How many regrettable losses of life do 
reasonable Muslims tolerate before they begin to doubt our friendship?
<P>Without a doubt, after Sept. 11, we did have to do something, something 
that takes time, deep and true coalition-building and patient cunning. Instead, we've chosen to play into a mass murderer's hands and prove that our 
reverence for human life starts diminishing at America's borders.
