Fiscal restraint.  Is this why Republicans and Democrats are scared to spend 
what the Congressional Budget Office projects is a $153 billion federal 
budget surplus on unmet human needs?  If not now, when is it the right time 
for more public spending to improve child and health care, jobs, schools and 
housing?

<p>Today, conventional wisdom holds that fiscal policy should be restrained.  
Presumably, expanding public spending is a thing to avoid.  It can cause 
dependency, which leads to poverty, etc.  But where is the proof?

<p>Does anybody recall the GI Bill of Rights for veterans of World War II and 
the Korean War?  Public spending funded the GI Bill.  It benefited 16 
million (mainly white, male) returning military personnel in the areas of 
employment, business and home loans and education.

<p>Returning to the dawn of the Clinton years, federal budget surpluses emerged 
when the government spent less than it collected.  Then-president Clinton 
and his economists boasted that the federal budget surplus was helping to 
drive the economic expansion, which featured a booming stock market.

<p>Wealth hasn’t trickled downward, however. According to the Economic Policy 
Institute, “One in three working families with young children cannot afford 
to meet their basic needs.”  That’s a crime in America, the world’s richest 
nation.

<p>Under the Bush administration, the nation's economic activity is slowing to 
a snail’s pace.  Hourly workers are facing an intensified challenge to make 
ends meet.  When economic growth slows, joblessness grows.

<p>Cynically feeling workers’ pain, Bush got his $1.35 trillion tax cut over 10 
years.  It will halt the current economic slowdown, he said, and put money 
in the hands of the people where it belongs.  Yet the “how” of Bush’s claim 
doesn’t square with the details, though they do indicate who will get most 
of the pain relief.

<p>The top one percent of income earners gets 37 percent of the tax cut total.  
The bottom 60 percent of income earners get 15 percent of the tax cut total. 
  According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, the working-poor 
and their family members, some 12.2 million Americans, get no tax savings 
under the Bush tax-cut. Thus those who need the tax-cut benefits the most 
get the least.

<p>Bush has a differing view of his tax-cut limitations.  That would be 
Congress over-spending this fall and busting the budget, he warned in a 
recent radio talk.

<p>I completely disagree.  We need to broaden the debate about federal fiscal 
policy.  Now is the time to question the assumption of the president and 
Congress that federal spending (on society, not the military) should be 
restrained.

<p>Let’s spend the $153 billion federal surplus projected by the CBO on the 
unmet needs of American people today.  Public spending for them can be a 
solution, not the problem, to what is basically a failure of the private 
sector.  To be sure, government is no panacea, but it can provide what 
people need to live decent lives.

<p>Currently, false assumptions about public spending yield false conclusions.  
In a nutshell, here’s why.  Too many Democrats and Republicans represent 
dollars instead of people.  Progress will come when politicians begin 
responding to the needs of the general population instead of financial 
markets.

<p>Additional funds to make up any federal budget shortfalls in spending to 
improve people’s living standards could come from taxing the super rich and 
cutting the military budget.  Such fiscal alternatives present political—not 
technical—challenges to the status quo.

<p>The sooner the public catches on that they can influence politicians’ fiscal 
policy the better.  Many must challenge the few.  Where there’s a popular 
political will, there’s a way.
