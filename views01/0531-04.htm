Those who expect President Bush to move to the center now that Jim
Jeffords has defected from the Republicans are the same people who
expected that Bush would govern from the center once in office. He didn't
then, and he won't now.
<p>The recent Senate inversion will slow him down, to be sure, but not
alter his basic strategy. After all, it worked for the tax cut,
attracting 12 defectors among Senate Democrats. So it's likely to work
with the other two planks of Bushism--the missile defense shield and the
accelerated move toward fossil fuels and nuclear energy with minimum
regard for the environment.
<p>All three planks have been sold as rational responses to current or
pending crises--a major economic turndown; an escalating probability of
attack from China, North Korea or a "rogue" state; an energy crisis. But
each of these so-called crises has been manufactured by the White House.
<p>The economy has slowed, but it's hardly in free-fall. The fundamentals
(growth, productivity, unemployment) continue in relatively good shape.
And the Federal Reserve is responding to the downturn with interest rate
cuts.
<p>There's no new foreign peril. China is every day growing more
dependent on global capital that would flee if China even slightly
threatened the West. Russia is weaker than ever. North Korea was on the
verge of making peace with South Korea before the Bush administration
pulled the plug. There are dangers, to be sure, but no "rogue" nation has
even close to the capacity to launch an ICBM in our direction.
<p>And apart from California's own zany energy system, the U.S. has no
energy crisis other than a long-term need to conserve. Gas prices are
moving upward because of a temporary shortage of refining capacity. In
the short run, the nation also needs more electric power generators and a
better strategy to address supply bottlenecks, but no major new sources
of energy.
<p>Bush's ostensible solutions to these crises were cooked up in the
early days of his presidential campaign, before these alleged crises. He
was trying to sell his giant tax cut long before the economy slowed. He
advocated a missile defense shield way before the tensions with China and
North Korea escalated. And he was flogging gas, oil, coal and nuclear
power before California utilities collapsed and before gas prices across
the country started rising.
<p>It's possible that Bush was remarkably prescient, but it's more likely
he and his crew have cleverly exploited every event that could be twisted
or exaggerated to support their preconceived plans.
<p>It gets only more bizarre when you realize that Bush's proposed
solutions won't even deal with the supposed problems.
<p>The huge tax cut mostly for the rich will not turn the economy around
because the rich won't spend or invest their new windfall quickly enough
to affect the current slowdown. Trickle-down economics is, at best, a
trickle. Besides, most of the cuts occur in future years.
<p>A giant missile-defense shield won't protect the United States from
nations or groups bent on terrorism because terrorists don't launch
intercontinental ballistic missiles. They put bombs in cargo holds, send
lethal germs through the mail and destroy computer software through the
Internet.
<p>And an immense program to get more oil, gas and coal out of the ground
and build new nuclear plants won't keep up with U.S. energy "needs"
because it's those very needs that are the problem that has to be
addressed. Consumer prices must rise before American buyers tame their
appetites and conserve in a big way and before alternative sources of
energy become economical.
<p>Even more puzzling is the fact that the American public hasn't been
exactly enamored of any of these three big plans. Until recently, polls
showed scant support for a giant tax cut. For years now, "Star Wars"
schemes have been greeted with skepticism. Bush's giant back-step on the
environment and simultaneous push for coal, oil and nuclear power are
profoundly unpopular, especially among all-important independent and
suburban swing voters. So if the crises have been manufactured, if the
proposed solutions don't even solve them, and if the public is dubious at
best, why are these three big plans likely to stay on track?
<p>First and foremost, all are deeply held tenets of the Republican
right, and Bush and Dick Cheney are true believers, albeit for
ideological reasons rather than for those publicly enumerated.
<p>Second, Jeffords' defection notwithstanding, Republicans have held
together in support of each of the president's goals while the Democrats
haven't held the line against them.
<p>Third, the big plans are big, and their sheer boldness has given them
momentum.
<p>Yet I think the basic reason these plans will move forward is that the
president and his key staff don't care what anyone else thinks. They feel
under no compulsion to respond to facts and arguments summoned by
distinguished scientists, academicians, policy experts or journalists.
They figure if they stick to the script, reiterating the same illogic and
perpetrating the same deceptions, the public will eventually see the
world their way. They are corporate executives paying singular attention
to the bottom line, which is just getting it done.
<p>The strategy is the exact opposite of President Clinton's. He spread
his (and his administration's) energies over a vast terrain of ideas,
initiatives and programs. And after the health care debacle, his
initiatives were tiny, appearing in so many incremental steps that the
public all but lost interest in them.
<p>Yet Clinton also respected the process of democratic deliberation in
which science, logic and common sense counted for something. These guys
don't.
