            Israeli officials have now publicly acknowledged a policy of &quot;targeted 
            attacks&quot; on Palestinians believed to be involved in terrorism. 
            These are planned assassinations, quite rightly called &quot;criminal 
            acts ... murder&quot; by Moshe Neghi, a respected Israeli journalist, 
            and denounced by Israeli peaceniks.
            <p>Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said on the radio that the 
              policy was unequivocal. &quot;If anyone has committed or is planning 
              to carry out terrorist attacks, he has to be hit. ... It is effective, 
              precise and just.&quot;
            <p>The government gives no details. Some Israeli peace activists say 
              there have been eight or nine of these killings. Some Palestinians 
              say the figure so far is 20 or 30. It is not known who gives the 
              order - the chief of intelligence, the secret police, the defense 
              minister, the prime minister? In any case, there is no kind of judicial 
              process, no charge and no defense.
            <p>This is the latest revelation of the damage that the festering 
              war with the Palestinians has done to Israel, and the division it 
              is imposing on its people.
            <p>For reasons of moral conviction, Israeli criminal justice has no 
              death penalty. The only exception was Adolf Eichmann, the planner 
              and organizer of Nazi death camps, after a long and well publicized 
              trial.
            <p>There is no way to reconcile this policy of deliberate official 
              murder, without appeal and unaccountable, with Israel's founding 
              principles of democracy and rule of law.
            <p>Palestinian killings, whether random terrorism or premeditaded 
              vengeance, are equally despicable, but in no way can they justify 
              Israelis' violation of their own laws, their own sense of a moral 
              society.
            <p>It shows how very badly the Jewish state has come to suffer from 
              its interminable fight with the other people who claim the same 
              land, how much it has to lose by refusing to compromise.
            <p>This policy shows what sort of development might be expected if 
              Ariel Sharon wins election as prime minister on Feb. 6, as polls 
              indicate is likely.
            <p>Mr. Sharon is probably right when he argues that the current violence 
              was provoked by the fear of diehards (but on each side) of an unacceptable 
              peace after Camp David. But he is certainly wrong that a relatively 
              calm status quo can be restored by abandoning the idea of a permanent 
              settlement in the foreseeable future. The Palestinians are not going 
              to sit back and wait, and Israeli force, all the more under his 
              ruthless intransigence, will escalate the violence.
            <p>Already in 1996, Israeli intelligence assassinated a Palestinian 
              bomb expert known as &quot;The Engineer&quot; by booby trapping 
              his mobile phone. That did not stir any particular sense of shame 
              on the Israeli side because the man was seen as a dangerous enemy.
            <p>What has sparked a new outrage, at least among a quite limited 
              group of peace activists, is the killing of Thabet Thabet, a middle-aged 
              dentist, by Israeli soldiers using long-range machine guns as he 
              left his home on New Year's Eve. He was well-known to Israelis trying 
              to promote reconciliation with Palestinians, but the military considered 
              him a terrorist.
            <p>His widow has filed a petition to the Israeli Supreme Court to 
              rule that such &quot;orders to execute people without trial&quot; 
              are illegal. Is it naive, an appeal of desperation or a propaganda 
              maneuver to expose Israeli hypocrisy? In any case, it is important 
              to bring before the public this conflict of how Israelis see their 
              issues of security and justice.
            <p>According to the Washington Post correspondent Keith Richburg, 
              the policy was expanded to target planners of violence when the 
              attempt to pick off known troublemakers from amid crowds of stone-throwers 
              led to criticism for excessive force, including killing children. 
              Nor did the ensuing policy of attacking Palestinian police and official 
              buildings with helicopter missiles have the desired effect.
            <p>Whatever it does to Israel's image in the world, this assassination 
              policy is obviously not going to inspire thoughts of peace or new 
              submission among Palestinians. And it can only undermine Israelis' 
              confidence in their own righteousness.
            <p>President Bill Clinton has been trying with all the wit and wile 
              at his command to press for the beginning of an agreement at least 
              so as to revive some hope for the embattled populations. He will 
              probably fail, which won't hurt him; he has done his best. But it 
              is frightening to contemplate what lies ahead in this region. The 
              poison is virulent.
