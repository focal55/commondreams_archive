You ask me if I think the American press is "too free." "Too free for your country 
and culture?" "Too free for your taste?" "Too free for its own good?" you say.
<p>You want to know if I wish my country's press had its freedom protected the 
way it is here. </p>
<p>Well, in theory it has. Freedom of expression is stated in the Constitution 
of Ecuador. The state guarantees free access to public information and the right 
to write or speak without censorship. </p>
<p>Does that mean that the press is free? Let's see. Last January during the last 
Indian revolt, four people were shot and killed in confrontations with the military. 
Several broadcast stations faced pressure to quash the story; a few smaller ones 
did. In various towns, reporters received threatening phone calls and a group 
of soldiers even "visited" one of the public radio stations for several hours. 
</p>
<p>Last September, the security guards of a governmental office in Quito, the 
capital city, detained a press photographer, forcing him to develop his film after 
he photographed a protest held by a group of ecologists. In my country, as in 
almost every country on the American continent, what is written in the law (and 
the way it is written) creates conflicts between a citizen's right of privacy 
and the people's right to be informed. The same law that, in theory, protects 
free speech has obstacles. A short phrase in the Constitution regarding "objective, 
truthful, plural and opportune information" gives the government a tool to try 
to press the independent media to censor material, especially in time of war or 
internal revolts. </p>
<p>Preserving "the values of the community" is a constitutional limit. And according 
to the Constitution, Ecuadorian journalists have the right to express and give 
their opinion through any mass media "without damage to the responsibilities anticipated 
in the law." (Which means that, in case of a suit, they will be treated as any 
other person and eventually end up in jail.) </p>
<p>An open law creates a stronger press. In contrast, tricks and vacuums are usually 
reflected in obstacles to the journalist's job, especially when it has to do with 
investigative reports. </p>
<p>The pressure can have many faces. Here are just two from my own experience: 
A government official can refuse to talk with a journalist if he doesn't like 
her. A government office can withhold information even if it's in public files. 
So even if freedom of expression is in the Ecuadorian Constitution, that doesn't 
mean that the press in my country is completely free. </p>
<p>Freedom of expression is also in the U.S. Constitution. Does that mean that 
the press of this country is free? </p>
<p>Let's see. A few days after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 in New York and 
Washington, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer asked journalists to "watch what 
they say and watch what they do," after the host of a late-night talk show said 
the plane hijackers were not cowards but warriors. </p>
<p>In the past three months, at least three columnists were fired because of their 
dissenting opinions and President Bush warned this country that many things about 
this war will never be known. The president's national security adviser Condoleezza 
Rice urged networks to "exercise judgment" and not air taped broadcasts by Osama 
bin Laden spokesmen in their entirety, and some networks agreed. </p>
<p>Five months ago, I came to this country eager to learn what it is like to work 
with a guaranteed protection of the freedom to speak, to ask and to write. Because 
of so many examples of excellent investigative journalism in this country, I was 
sure this was the right place. My fellowship in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer 
came at a tough time for the U.S. press -- it is caught between the need to inform 
the public, a national wave of patriotism and the secrets of this "new" type of 
war. During this time, I received mixed messages. </p>
<p>I feel almost daily delight listening to the remarkable job of the journalists 
on public radio who keep an unbiased line in each report. I enjoy the articles 
in newspapers across the country that make open debate stronger. I learn about 
good journalism in all the reports that approach "the enemy" in all its complexities 
-- beyond the simple concept of the "evil doer." </p>
<p>But I also see journalists not making enough effort to separate the government's 
interests from the need of the public to be informed. I have watched flags, logos 
and patriotic songs framing TV reports. I listen to journalists talking about 
"us" when referring to this country in war. </p>
<p>Tom Gutting, former columnist for the Texas City Sun who was fired after he 
criticized Bush's leadership, wrote after the incident, "America is under a microscope 
more than ever and that means it is more important than ever to adhere to our 
ideals." I guess he is right. I guess this country is under a microscope and its 
press is too. </p>
<p>And that is why I think the question now is not if the United States is "too 
free," but if it is free enough to keep its well-deserved reputation of independence 
and excellence.</p>
