With little fanfare, on November 13, grocery chain Trader Joe's announced
plans to remove genetically engineered ingredients from its private label
products.

<p>This is not insignificant news, as 85 percent of the products sold by Trader
Joe's are emblazoned with the store name. It also brings the fast-growing
company into a small group of grocery chains, including Wild Oats and Whole
Foods Market, which have made similar pledges.

<p>Although Wild Oats and Whole Foods Market worked willingly to ensure the
purity of their products, Trader Joe's decision followed in the wake of
pressure from its customers.

<p>Prior to the announcement, the CEO was receiving more than 100 letters a day
demanding the removal of genetically engineered (GE) food from store
shelves. In addition, a coalition of grassroots groups organized anti-GE
demonstrations in front of Trader Joe's stores in more than 20 cities.
Similar campaigns in Europe led to removal of GE ingredients from store
labels of most major grocery chains, as well as a moratorium on planting or
importing new GE organisms since 1998.

<p>Why has it taken so long for a movement against GE food to achieve a victory
in the United States? Conventional wisdom has it that Americans do not care
about the quality or purity of their food. This was the rationalization for
a double standard over the past three years, as manufacturers removed
genetically engineered ingredients for European markets, but took no such
steps for the US market.

<p>For example, Aldi stores in Europe removed GE ingredients from store brands
in 1999, but Theodore Albrecht (from one of the wealthiest families in the
world) did not extend this policy to the Aldi or Trader Joe's stores he owns
in the US.

<p>Recent surveys suggest that in point of fact, most Americans were unaware of
the recent introduction of GE organisms into the food supply. A Gallup poll
released April 11, 2000 indicated that only 14 percent of US citizens had
heard a great deal about the issue. This lack of awareness is intentional.

<p>Chemical and pharmaceutical corporations like Monsanto have deliberately
introduced genes from viruses, bacteria and other organisms into our food
supply, nearly in secret. Monsanto, through its influence on political
appointees in the EPA, FDA, and USDA, has successfully prevented GE food
from being labeled as such, despite opposition from scientists within these
government agencies.

<p>Genetic engineers are well aware that consumers will reject food polluted
with foreign genes, if given a choice. The power of the industry is such
that they were successful in taking away this choice from US citizens in
1993, when the first GE foods slipped into grocery stores unannounced. As a
result, as much as 70 percent of the processed food in a typical grocery
store contains GE organisms, according to the Grocery Manufacturers of
America.

<p>Trader Joe's recent decision suggests that the chemical and pharmaceutical
industry victory may have been Pyrrhic. As activists expose government
complicity with these corporations, faith in the safety of the US food
supply is weakening and resistance to GE food is growing.

<p>In response to the campaign against it, Trader Joe's recently conducted a
poll of customers and found that more than 90 percent would avoid GE
products if given a choice. This mirrors survey results from Europe, and
suggests that Americans care just as deeply about food. The rapid growth in
sales of organic foods, which do not contain GE organisms (unless
contaminated by neighboring fields), underscores this concern. As awareness
of GE foods reaches levels seen in Europe, the wholesale rejection of what
the British have dubbed "Frankenfood" is likely to be duplicated in the US.
