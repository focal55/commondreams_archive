In the first few months of the Bush administration, international 
treaties have been falling faster than old-growth trees. The rebuke 
of the Kyoto global warming accord grabbed the headlines, but there 
have been a slate of others: the convention on small arms trade, 
the chemical and biological weapons treaty, the international ban 
on whaling, and the <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/treaties/abmpage.html" target="_new">Anti-Ballistic 
Missile treaty.</a> Now the Bush administration wants to end the 
moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and junk the <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/treaties/ctbt/ctbt1.html" target="_new">Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty.</a>
<p>Bush fumed against the test ban treaty repeatedly during his campaign, 
alleging that it undermined national security. Since the election, 
Bush has remained stubbornly mute on his personal position on resuming 
nuclear tests. (The current moratorium on nuclear testing was put 
into place as a pre-election ploy by his father in 1992.) But Defense 
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney have been 
less coy. Both have argued that the United States needs to resume 
nuclear testing to ensure the reliability of the Pentagon's nuclear 
weapons cache. </p>
<p>This is an old canard. The only parts of the nuclear stockpile 
likely to deteriorate are the non-nuclear components, which already are regularly tested and 
evaluated by the weapons teams without encroaching on the terms of 
the treaty. "All non-nuclear parts to a weapon can be extensively 
lab tested and replaced as needed--if needed at all," says Jay Coghlan, 
director of <a href="http://www.nukewatch.com/" target="_new">NukeWatch.</a> "The 
nuclear parts, specifically plutonium and surrounding high explosives, 
have been found to actually achieve greater stability with age." 
<p>The purported rationale for the U.S. nuclear stockpile, which now 
totals some 12,000 nukes and 10,000 plutonium pits (or triggers), 
is deterrence. Coghlan suggests that the real interest of the testing 
faction isn't to assure reliability, but to shift to more tactical 
uses. "U.S. nuclear weapons are certainly reliable in the sense 
that they are sure to go off," he says. "The concern that the military 
has with reliability is that weapons are not only guaranteed to 
go off, but explode close to design yield. This is important not 
for mere deterrence, but for nuclear warfighting." </p>
<p>One of the great myths of the Clinton era was that Clinton supported 
total abolition of nuclear testing. In fact, Clinton authorized 
a series of so-called subcritical nuclear tests and a number of 
other nuclear programs that quietly flouted the test ban treaty--which 
he simultaneously heckled the Senate for failing to approve. The 
Bush administration, of course, has no intention of seeking approval 
for the test ban treaty from the Senate, where it has languished 
for more than two years. But its top arms control negotiator, John 
Bolton, undersecretary of state for arms control and international 
security, has determined that the administration can't unilaterally 
withdraw the treaty from consideration. The Senate has two options: 
It can approve the treaty by a two-thirds vote, or it can send it 
back to the president for renegotiation through a simple resolution, 
which requires only a majority. </p>
<p>Currently, 161 nations have signed onto the treaty, and 77 nations 
have ratified it, including the rest of NATO. For the treaty to 
go into effect, it must be approved by 13 other nations. The other 
holdouts include China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel. 
But this renegade status doesn't seem to have deterred Bush in the 
least. Indeed, the president has loaded the top levels of his administration 
with full-blooded nuclear hawks, including <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/" target="_new">Defense 
Department</a> flacks Douglas Feith, <a href="http://www.inthesetimes.com/web2507/naureckas2507.html" target="_new">Richard 
Armitage</a> and Paul Wolfowitz, all of whom have railed against 
the limitations of the test ban treaty. </p>
<p>The most fanatical of the brood may well be Jack Crouch, Bush's 
pick for assistant secretary of defense for international security 
policy. In the mid-'90s, Crouch, then a professor at Southwest Missouri 
State, wrote a series of articles attacking the test ban treaty 
and the testing moratorium. He also argued that the United States 
should deploy nuclear weapons in South Korea and consider using 
them against North Korea if they did not accede to U.S. demands 
to drop their nuclear and biological warfare programs. Crouch reiterated 
his support for nuclear testing and his opposition to the test ban 
treaty during his confirmation hearings before the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/%7Earmed_services/" target="_new">Senate 
Armed Services Committee.</a> "I think that considering the resumption 
of testing is something that the administration ought to consider," 
Crouch said.</p>
<p> Consider it they are. Shortly after taking office, the Bush crowd 
heard from an advisory committee that had just completed a study 
on the "reliability, safety and security" of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
The panel was headed by John Foster, former director of <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/" target="_new">Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory,</a> who now serves as an adviser 
to TRW, one of the nation's top defense contractors. The Foster 
group urged the administration to begin taking steps to resume testing 
as quickly as possible and to begin training a new crop of weapons 
designers who could develop "robust, alternative warheads that will 
provide a hedge if problems occur in the future." </p>
<p>Even though most other nuclear scientists disagree, Foster, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; 
of Edward Teller, dismissed computer modeling as a substitute for 
real nuclear explosions. "There are a number of underground tests 
we can't reproduce," Foster told a gathering of weapons designers 
at the <a href="http://www.ndu.edu/" target="_new">National Defense University</a> 
in June. "We have these enigmas." </p>
<p>For Foster the answer to every enigma seems to be a nuclear explosion. 
He argues that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is aging and growing ever 
more unreliable. The average age of nukes in the U.S. weapons stockpile 
is 18 years, which Foster claims is six years older than their intended 
design life. "They will be many times their design life before they 
are replaced," Foster said. "We have opened some of the warheads 
and found some defects that are worrisome." </p>
<p>Using the Foster report as an excuse, in June the Bush administration 
instructed the <a href="http://www.energy.gov/" target="_new">Department of Energy</a> to study 
how to shorten the time it takes to prepare nuclear tests at the <a href="http://www.nv.doe.gov/nts/default.htm" target="_new">Nevada 
Test Site,</a> the 1,350-square-mile bombing range 65 miles northwest 
of Las Vegas. Currently, the DOE says it will take at least 36 months 
to resume testing. But hard-liners in the Bush administration, such 
as Gen. John A. Gordon--director of the <a href="http://www.nnsa.doe.gov/" target="_new">National 
Nuclear Security Administration,</a> a shadowy wing of the DOE that 
manages nuclear weapons research, development and testing--want this 
time reduced to less than four months. "We are conducting an internal 
review on how we can improve significantly our readiness posture to 
conduct a nuclear test, should we ever be so directed," Gordon testified 
before the House. "This is not a proposal to conduct a test, but I 
am not comfortable with not being able to conduct a test within three 
years." 
<p>The move to truncate the readiness period for tests exposes yet 
another double-standard in the Bush administration's foreign policy. 
As the Pentagon moves ever closer toward resumption of testing, 
Secretary of State Colin Powell continues to chide India and Pakistan 
about dire consequences if either nation conducts new nuclear tests. 
"The Nuclear Security Agency's site readiness effort will unfortunately 
send exactly the wrong message to other would-be testers and test 
ban treaty hold-out states, including India, Pakistan and China," 
says Daryl Kimball of the <a href="http://www.clw.org/pub/clw/coalition/" target="_new">Coalition 
to Reduce Nuclear Dangers.</a> "It leaves the door open to a global 
chain reaction of nuclear testing, instability and confrontation 
in the future." </p>
<p>However, the rising anxiety over the Bush administration's frank 
talk about resuming live testing of nuclear weapons may serve to 
distract attention from a more ominous venture: the development 
of a new class of nuclear weapons systems. Most of the action these 
days is in the innocuous sounding <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/factsheets/wmd/nuclear/ctbt/fs_991008_stockpile.html" target="_new">Stockpile 
Stewardship Program.</a> The stated intent of the program was to 
maintain an "enduring" arsenal of nuclear weapons and components. 
But that mission has discreetly changed. Now the Pentagon and the 
DOE talk about the "evolving" nature of the stockpile. Evolving 
is a code word for improving. The nuclear labs are busy turning 
old nukes into new ones. </p>
<p>During testimony before the House, Gordon groused that for the 
past decade the Pentagon had not been able to actively pursue new 
weapons designs. He said he wanted to "reinvigorate" planning for 
a new generation of "advanced nuclear warheads." "This is not a 
proposal to develop new weapons in the absence of requirements," 
Gordon told the committee in a gem of Pentagon doublespeak. "But 
I am now not exercising design capabilities, and because of that, 
I believe this capacity and capability is atrophying rapidly." </p>
<p>Gordon wasn't being entirely truthful. The Pentagon and its weapons 
designers have been busy quietly crafting a variety of new weapons 
over the past decade. In 1997, they unveiled and deployed the B61-11, 
described as a mere modification of the old B61-7 gravity bomb. 
In reality, it was the prototype for the "low-yield" bunker blasting 
nuke that the weaponeers see as the future of the U.S. arsenal. 
</p>
<p>The testing issue may be a kind of political bait-and-switch designed 
to garner more money for the Stockpile Stewardship Program. The 
gambit goes likes this: If you won't let us test the weapons, you've 
got to appropriate more money. Lots more. "The nuclear testing issue 
is a kind of red herring," says Greg Mello, director of the <a href="http://www.lasg.org/hmpgfrm_a.html" target="_new">Los 
Alamos Study Group.</a> "All discussion of possible 'nuclear testing' 
as the problem distracts attention from the real work of the complex, 
which does not need nuclear testing for 80 to 90 percent of its 
work. It is a form of blackmail." </p>
<p>Instead of pursuing disarmament, the big prize for the weapons 
labs has been the lavishly funded <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/testimony/000321/00032103.htm#E11E6" target="_new">Stockpile 
Life Extension Program,</a> an array of projects designed to stretch 
out the operational life of existing weapons for at least another 
30 years. Currently, four major nuclear weapons are undergoing major 
upgrading under SLEP: the B61, known as a "dial-a-yield" bomb with 
a yield of 10 to 500 megatons; W76, the warhead for the Minuteman 
III ICBM with an explosive power of 170 kilotons; the W80, a warhead 
for cruise missiles; and the W87, a warhead for the Peacekeeper 
ICBM. The Pentagon wants another 11 systems modified. </p>
<p>These developments subvert the Pentagon's own official policy, 
signed by President Clinton in 1994, calling for "no new nuclear 
weapons production." The weaponeers at the Pentagon and the DOE 
are very touchy about the way they talk about these new bombs, being 
careful to speak in euphemisms like "reliability" and "safety" and 
"stewardship" of the "stockpile." "Energy Department managers have 
been sensitive to the hypocrisy in this program," Mello says. "The 
DOE honchos have even suggested that, given the political environment, 
the use of the word 'warhead' may not be acceptable." </p>
<p>There's a reason that the Pentagon and the labs have fixated on 
the idea of producing a new line of low-yield nukes: They can be 
redesigned and deployed without a new round of underground tests. 
And that may be a big part of the bait-and-switch approach, with 
the Pentagon arguing that since they were prohibited from testing 
new weapons, they were forced to retool old ones into the new mini-nukes 
favored by the Bushies--nukes that are geared not for deterrence, 
but for use against recalcitrant regimes. </p>
<p>But just because there's a push to build mini-nukes doesn't mean 
that the hawks have forgotten the big ones. According to the Bush 
squad, Russia still remains a threat and a justification for maintaining 
a robust strategic arsenal of bombs capable of leveling large cities. 
In this spirit, the <a href="http://www.navy.mil/" target="_new">Navy</a> is teaming 
up with the <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/worldview/" target="_new">Los Alamos</a> 
and <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/" target="_new">Sandia</a> labs on a project 
called the Submarine Warhead Protection Plan. The labs and the Pentagon 
are desperate to protect their bomb-making mission, and they've 
done a good job of keeping the new schemes funded, including upgrades 
of several of the nuclear packages for Trident submarines. Los Alamos 
is also working on the development of new systems that will allow 
older "air-burst" weapons to be converted into bombs that explode 
close to the ground, thus becoming what Rear Adm. George P. Nanos 
delicately refers to as "hard-target killers." </p>
<p>Beyond these pursuits, a host of other weapons design programs 
are up and running coast-to-coast, including: the insanely expensive 
<a href="http://www.llnl.gov/nif/index.html" target="_new">National Ignition Facility</a> 
at Lawrence Livermore; plutonium pit factories; pulsed power plants; 
dynamic radiography facilities; tritium production plants; magnetized-target 
fusion research; an advanced facility designed to generate 3-D movies 
of imploding nuclear pits. These are the multibillion-dollar research 
toys of the modern weapons designer. </p>
<p>In the end, the nuclear game always comes down to one overriding 
obsession: money. For the past 50 years, the nuclear programs of 
the Pentagon and allied agencies have been among the most extravagantly 
funded and sacrosanct items in the federal budget. During the height 
of the Cold War, annual federal spending on nuclear weapons programs 
averaged about $4 billion in today's money. The fiscal year 2002 
budget proposed by Bush earmarks $5.3 billion for DOE nuclear programs, 
a figure that will almost certainly be generously boosted by Congress. 
Indeed, New Mexico Sen. Pete Dominici, the Republican guardian of 
the Los Alamos and Sandia labs, vowed in July to hold the entire 
federal appropriations bill hostage unless spending on military 
programs, including nuclear weapons research, was substantially 
hiked. </p>
<p>In the political economy of nuclear weapons, enough is never enough. 
Endless expansion is the relentless logic of a monopoly protected 
by secrecy. "The nuclear weaponeers want it all," says Marylia Kelley, 
director of Tri-County Cares, a Livermore watchdog group. "This 
remains true regardless of who is president." </p>
