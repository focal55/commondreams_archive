<i>"Sit in your cell as in paradise. Put the whole world behind you and 
forget it."
</i>
<P align="right">-- 11th century Benedictine St. Romuald
<P>THEY RESIDE two miles above state Highway 1 and the Big Sur coast on 899 
acres of land covered with redwood, oak, madrone and laurel: 30 monks and 
hermits of the New Camaldoli branch of the Roman Catholic order of 
Benedictines.
<P>Contemplatives in every sense of the word, they pray, meditate, sing and 
eat their vegetarian meals in silence. As part of their 1,000-year-old mission,
<P>the monks work hard, physically and spiritually, to maintain a profoundly 
peaceful retreat for hundreds of weary souls who come to their door each year, 
battered by the outside world and needing healing.
<P>But if the U.S. Navy has its way, the monks and their holy retreat will 
become the backyard of ground zero for some 2,800 annual practice bombing runs 
by F/A-18 fighter jets.
<P>"The Navy says the monks won't be able to hear the noise from the jets, but 
they will," said Rep. Sam Farr, D-Carmel. "Up there at the monastery, you can 
hear sea lions from two miles away in the Pacific."
<P>The Camaldolese community was founded in 1027 by an Italian monk and 
eventual saint, Romuald. The hermitage in Big Sur (actually perched above the 
mini-hamlet of Lucia) was opened in 1958.
<P>Besides their retreat rooms and trailers, which rent for a modest fee per 
night with meals, the monks support their work with a bookstore and by baking 
and selling fabulous brandy-dipped fruitcakes and date-nut cakes.
<P>For three months in 1999, when wildfires destroyed almost 100,000 acres of 
the surrounding Los Padres National Forest, they scrambled side-by-side with 
professional firefighters to keep their beautiful, spare chapel and fragrant 
hillsides from joining the casualty list.
<P>Now, "to save resources and money," the Navy wants to expand its aerial 
bombardment training program in the area. Instead of aiming at target ranges 
in Nevada, Arizona and elsewhere in California, pilots would concentrate on 
what is now a minimally used segment of Hunter Liggett, a deactivated Army 
base just east of Lucia.
<P>That means 12 practice sorties, five days a week, for 47 weeks in the 
valley behind the monastery. This translates daily into 12 Hornet fighter jets 
taking a dozen shots each at a red-and-white, 500-foot bull's-eye target.
<P>Most of the jets would take off from Lemoore Naval Air Station, 67 air 
miles from the proposed practice area. Others would fly in off the Pacific, 
directly over the hermitage, from aircraft carriers. All would descend to 
about 1,500 feet to drop their 10-to-25-pound, non-explosive fake bombs.
<P>Lest one think the reclusive Camaldolese monks are the only Big Sur 
residents who will be affected by the Navy's jet-fueled noise, one should log 
onto pelicannetwork.net. Hundreds of angry folks -- from environmentalists to 
vintners -- are using the site to gather information about the proposal and to 
protest.
<P>Along with losing peaceful hikes, the locals see a host of endangered plant 
and animal species in the Navy's crosshairs. Not the least of these are more 
than a dozen California condors, brought back from the edge of extinction and 
living in the Ventana Wilderness.
<P>Historians who are trying to restore the language and culture of the 10,000-
year-old Salinan Nation worry about painted caves and a sacred sandstone arch 
that were created by the Native American tribe. Among other things, the 
Salinans believed the world began in the dramatic Santa Lucia Mountains of Big 
Sur.
<P>If ever there were a time for California's two U.S. senators to speak up 
about the Navy's planned invasion, it is now -- especially Dianne Feinstein, 
who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee and a host of its 
subcommittees, including military construction, defense and interior.
<P>Farr has been almost a lone voice in Congress on the issue. He could use 
some help.
<P>"This really deserves national attention," he said. "Where else do you bomb 
condors and monks?"
