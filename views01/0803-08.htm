Things go missing. It's to be expected. Even at the Pentagon. Last 
              October, the Pentagon's inspector general reported that the military's 
              accountants had misplaced a destroyer, several tanks and armored 
              personnel carriers, hundreds of machine guns, rounds of ammo, grenade 
              launchers and some surface-to-air missiles. In all, nearly $8 billion 
              in weapons were AWOL.
<p>Those anomalies are bad enough. But what's truly chilling is the 
              fact that the Pentagon has lost track of the mother of all weapons, 
              a hydrogen bomb. The thermonuclear weapon, designed to incinerate 
              Moscow, has been sitting somewhere off the coast of Savannah, Georgia 
              for the past 40 years. The Air Force has gone to greater lengths 
              to conceal the mishap than to locate the bomb and secure it. </p>
<p>On the night of February 5, 1958 a B-47 Stratojet bomber carrying 
              a hydrogen bomb on a night training flight off the Georgia coast collided with an 
            F-86 Saberjet fighter at 36,000 feet. The collision destroyed the 
            fighter and severely damaged a wing of the bomber, leaving one of 
            its engines partially dislodged. The bomber's pilot, Maj. Howard Richardson, 
            was instructed to jettison the H-bomb before attempting a landing. 
            Richardson dropped the bomb into the shallow waters of Warsaw Sound, 
            near the mouth of the Savannah River, a few miles from the city of 
            Tybee Island, where he believed the bomb would be swiftly recovered. 
            
<p>The Pentagon recorded the incident in a top secret memo to the 
              chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. The memo has been partially 
              declassified: "A B-47 aircraft with a [word redacted] nuclear weapon 
              aboard was damaged in a collision with an F-86 aircraft near Sylvania, 
              Georgia, on February 5, 1958. The B-47 aircraft attempted three 
              times unsuccessfully to land with the weapon. The weapon was then 
              jettisoned visually over water off the mouth of the Savannah River. 
              No detonation was observed." </p>
<p>Soon search and rescue teams were sent to the site. Warsaw Sound 
              was mysteriously cordoned off by Air Force troops. For six weeks, 
              the Air Force looked for the bomb without success. Underwater divers 
              scoured the depths, troops tromped through nearby salt marshes, 
              and a blimp hovered over the area attempting to spot a hole or crater 
              in the beach or swamp. Then just a month later, the search was abruptly 
              halted. The Air Force sent its forces to Florence, South Carolina, 
              where another H-bomb had been accidentally dropped by a B-47. The 
              bomb's 200 pounds of TNT exploded on impact, sending radioactive 
              debris across the landscape. The explosion caused extensive property 
              damage and several injuries on the ground. Fortunately, the nuke 
              itself didn't detonate. </p>
<p>The search teams never returned to Tybee Island, and the affair 
              of the missing H-bomb was discreetly covered up. The end of the 
              search was noted in a partially declassified memo from the Pentagon 
              to the AEC, in which the Air Force politely requested a new H-bomb 
              to replace the one it had lost. "The search for this weapon was 
              discontinued on 4-16-58 and the weapon is considered irretrievably 
              lost. It is requested that one [phrase redacted] weapon be made 
              available for release to the DOD as a replacement." </p>
<p>There was a big problem, of course, and the Pentagon knew it. In 
              the first three months of 1958 alone, the Air Force had four major 
              accidents involving H-bombs. (Since 1945, the United States has 
              lost 11 nuclear weapons.) The Tybee Island bomb remained a threat, 
              as the AEC acknowledged in a June 10, 1958 classified memo to Congress: 
              "There exists the possibility of accidental discovery of the unrecovered 
              weapon through dredging or construction in the probable impact area. 
              ... The Department of Defense has been requested to monitor all 
              dredging and construction activities." </p>
<p>But the wizards of Armageddon saw it less as a security, safety 
              or ecological problem, than a potential public relations disaster 
              that could turn an already paranoid population against their ambitious 
              nuclear project. The Pentagon and the AEC tried to squelch media 
              interest in the issue by a doling out a morsel of candor and a lot 
              of misdirection. In a joint statement to the press, the Defense 
              Department and the AEC admitted that radioactivity could be "scattered" 
              by the detonation of the high explosives in the H-bombs. But the 
              letter downplayed possibility of that ever happening: "The likelihood 
              that a particular accident would involve a nuclear weapon is extremely 
              limited."</p>
<p> In fact, that scenario had already occurred and would occur again. 
            </p>
<p>That's where the matter stood for more than 42 years until a deep 
              sea salvage company, run by former Air Force personnel and a CIA 
              agent, disclosed the existence of the bomb and offered to locate 
              it for a million dollars. Along with recently declassified documents, 
              the disclosure prompted fear and outrage among coastal residents 
              and calls for a congressional investigation into the incident itself 
              and why the Pentagon had stopped looking for the missing bomb. "We're 
              horrified because some of that information has been covered up for 
              years," says Rep. Jack Kingston, a Georgia Republican. </p>
<p>The cover-up continues. The Air Force, however, has told local 
              residents and the congressional delegation that there was nothing 
              to worry about. "We've looked into this particular issue from all 
              angles and we're very comfortable," says Major Gen. Franklin J. 
              "Judd" Blaisdell, deputy chief of staff for air and space operations 
              at Air Force headquarters in Washington. "Our biggest concern is 
              that of localized heavy metal contamination." </p>
<p>The Air Force even has suggested that the bomb itself was not armed 
              with a plutonium trigger. But this contention is disputed by a number 
              of factors. Howard Dixon, a former Air Force sergeant who specialized 
              in loading nuclear weapons onto planes, said that in his 31 years 
              of experience he never once remembered a bomb being put on a plane 
              that wasn't fully armed. Moreover, a newly declassified 1966 congressional 
              testimony of W.J. Howard, then assistant secretary of defense, describes 
              the Tybee Island bomb as a "complete weapon, a bomb with a nuclear 
              capsule." Howard said that the Tybee Island bomb was one of two 
              weapons lost up to that time that contained a plutonium trigger. 
            </p>
<p>Recently declassified documents show that the jettisoned bomb was 
              an "Mk-15, Mod O" hydrogen bomb, weighing four tons and packing 
              more than 100 times the explosive punch of the one that incinerated 
              Hiroshima. This was the first thermonuclear weapon deployed by the 
              Air Force and featured the relatively primitive design created by 
              that evil genius Edward Teller. The only fail-safe for this weapon 
              was the physical separation of the plutonium capsule (or pit) from 
              the weapon. </p>
            
<p>In addition to the primary nuclear capsule, the bomb also harbored 
              a secondary nuclear explosive, or sparkplug, designed to make it 
              go thermo. This is a hollow plug about an inch in diameter made 
              of either plutonium or highly enriched uranium (the Pentagon has 
              never said which) that is filled with fusion fuel, most likely lithium-6 
              deuteride. Lithium is highly reactive in water. The plutonium in 
              the bomb was manufactured at the Hanford Nuclear Site in Washington 
              State and would be the oldest in the United States. That's bad news: 
              Plutonium gets more dangerous as it ages. In addition, the bomb would 
              contain other radioactive materials, such as uranium and beryllium. 
            </p>
            <p>The bomb is also charged with 400 pounds of TNT, designed to cause 
              the plutonium trigger to implode and thus start the nuclear explosion. 
              As the years go by, those high explosives are becoming flaky, brittle 
              and sensitive. The bomb is most likely now buried in 5 to 15 feet 
              of sand and slowly leaking radioactivity into the rich crabbing 
              grounds of the Warsaw Sound. If the Pentagon can't find the Tybee 
              Island bomb, others might. That's the conclusion of Bert Soleau, 
              a former CIA officer who now works with ASSURE, the salvage company. 
              Soleau, a chemical engineer, says that it wouldn't be hard for terrorists 
              to locate the weapon and recover the lithium, beryllium and enriched 
              uranium, "the essential building blocks of nuclear weapons." What 
              to do? Coastal residents want the weapon located and removed. "Plutonium 
              is a nightmare and their own people know it," says Pam O'Brien, 
              an anti-nuke organizer from Douglassville, Georgia. "It can get 
              in everything--your eyes, your bones, your gonads. You never get 
              over it. They need to get that thing out of there." </p>
            <p>The situation is reminiscent of the Palomares incident. On January 
              16, 1966, a B-52 bomber, carrying four hydrogen bombs, crashed while 
              attempting to refuel in mid-air above the Spanish coast. Three of 
              the H-bombs landed near the coastal farming village of Palomares. 
              One of the bombs landed in a dry creek bed and was recovered, battered 
              but relatively intact. But the TNT in two of the bombs exploded, 
              gouging 10-foot holes in the ground and showering uranium and plutonium 
              over a vast area. Over the next three months, more than 1,400 tons 
              of radioactive soil and vegetation was scooped up, placed in barrels 
              and, ironically enough, shipped back to the Savannah River Nuclear 
              Weapons Lab, where it remains. The tomato fields near the craters 
              were burned and buried. But there's no question that due to strong 
              winds and other factors much of the contaminated soil was simply 
              left in the area. "The total extent of the spread will never be 
              known," concluded a 1975 report by the Defense Nuclear Agency. </p>
            <p>The cleanup was a joint operation between Air Force personnel and 
              members of the Spanish civil guard. The U.S. workers wore protective 
              clothing and were monitored for radiation exposure, but similar 
              precautions weren't taken for their Spanish counterparts. "The Air 
              Force was unprepared to provide adequate detection and monitoring 
              for personnel when an aircraft accident occurred involving plutonium 
              weapons in a remote area of a foreign country," the Air Force commander 
              in charge of the cleanup later testified to Congress. </p>
            <p>The fourth bomb landed eight miles offshore and was missing for 
              several months. It was eventually located by a mini-submarine in 
              2,850 feet of water, where it rests to this day. </p>
            <p>Two years later, on January 21, 1968, a similar accident occurred 
              when a B-52 caught fire in flight above Greenland and crashed in 
              ice-covered North Star Bay near the Thule Air Base. The impact detonated 
              the explosives in all four of the plane's H-bombs, which scattered 
              uranium, tritium and plutonium over a 2,000-foot radius. The intense 
              fire melted a hole in the ice, which then refroze, encapsulating 
              much of the debris, including the thermonuclear assembly from one 
              of the bombs. The recovery operation, conducted in near total darkness 
              at temperatures that plunged to minus-70 degrees, was known as Project 
              Crested Ice. But the work crews called it "Dr. Freezelove." </p>
            <p>More than 10,000 tons of snow and ice were cut away, put into barrels 
              and transported to Savannah River and Oak Ridge for disposal. Other 
              radioactive debris was simply left on site, to melt into the bay 
              after the spring thaws. More than 3,000 workers helped in the Thule 
              recovery effort, many of them Danish soldiers. As at Palomares, 
              most of the American workers were offered some protective gear, 
              but not the Danes, who did much of the most dangerous work, including 
              filling the barrels with the debris, often by hand. The decontamination 
              procedures were primitive to say the least. An Air Force report 
              noted that they were cleansed "by simply brushing the snow from 
              garments and vehicles." </p>
            <p>Even though more than 38 Navy ships were called to assist in the 
              recovery operation, and it was an open secret that the bombs had 
              been lost, the Pentagon continued to lie about the situation. In 
              one contentious exchange with the press, a Pentagon spokesman uttered 
              this classic bit of military doublespeak: "I don't know of any missing 
              bomb, but we have not positively identified what I think you are 
              looking for." </p>
            <p>When Danish workers at Thule began to get sick from a slate of 
              illnesses, ranging from rare cancers to blood disorders, the Pentagon 
              refused to help. Even after a 1987 epidemiological study by a Danish 
              medical institute showed that Thule workers were 50 percent more 
              likely to develop cancers than other members of the Danish military, 
              the Pentagon still refused to cooperate. Later that year, 200 of 
              the workers sued the United States under the Foreign Military Claims 
              Act. The lawsuit was dismissed, but the discovery process revealed 
              thousands of pages of secret documents about the incident, including 
              the fact that Air Force workers at the site, unlike the Danes, have 
              not been subject to long-term health monitoring. Even so, the Pentagon 
              continues to keep most of the material on the Thule incident secret, 
              including any information on the extent of the radioactive (and 
              other toxic) contamination. </p>
            <p>These recovery efforts don't inspire much confidence. But the Tybee 
              Island bomb presents an even touchier situation. The presence of 
              the unstable lithium deuteride and the deteriorating high explosives 
              make retrieval of the bomb a very dangerous proposition--so dangerous, 
              in fact, that even some environmentalists and anti-nuke activists 
              argue that it might present less of a risk to leave the bomb wherever 
              it is. </p>
            
<p>In short, there aren't any easy answers. The problem is exacerbated 
              by the Pentagon's failure to conduct a comprehensive analysis of 
              the situation and reluctance to fully disclose what it knows. "I 
              believe the plutonium capsule is in the bomb, but that a nuclear 
              detonation is improbable because the neutron generators used back 
              then were polonium-beryllium, which has a very short half-life," 
              says Don Moniak, a nuclear weapons expert with the Blue Ridge Environmental 
              Defense League in Aiken, South Carolina. "Without neutrons, weapons 
              grade plutonium won't blow. However, there could be a fission or 
              criticality event if the plutonium was somehow put in an incorrect 
              configuration. There could be a major inferno if the high explosives 
              went off and the lithium deuteride reacted as expected. Or there 
              could just be an explosion that scattered uranium and plutonium 
              all over hell." </p>
<p><b>Oops, You May Be Glowing </b></p>
<p>It hasn't been an easy couple of years for the Department of Energy: 
              contaminated workers, nuclear fuel rods misplaced (or lost), Hanford 
              continuing to leak its immortal poison into the Columbia River, 
              the Wen Ho Lee debacle, embarrassing contempt citations for the 
              cover-up at Colorado's Rocky Flats, campaign finance scandals, contractors 
              screwing things up royally then declaring bankruptcy and on and 
              on. So for the past few months, the agency, anxious to be at the 
              center of the Bush nuclear project, which runs the gamut from new 
              nuclear power plants to another round of underground nuclear weapons 
              testing, has been in full image-polishing mode. </p>
<p>As part of this new PR rehab program, the DOE is allowing the public 
              and the press into places that previously had been as difficult 
              to access as Area 51. But when the secretive Savannah River nuclear 
              site opened its gates for a public tour on July 9, things didn't 
              quite turn out as planned. </p>
<p>Savannah River, the big DOE waste dump/weapons complex in South 
              Carolina, has had its own share of problems, including a massive 
              spill of highly radioactive tritium into the Savannah River in 1991. 
              Plant managers are trying to ease public anxiety enough so that 
              the DOE can go forward with a Clinton-era plan to build a mixed-oxide 
              fuel fabrication plant, a ludicrously dangerous scheme that involves 
              the reprocessing of 36 tons of weapons-grade plutonium into fuel 
              for commercial nuclear reactors. </p>
<p>The 25-person tour of the site included reporters, environmentalists 
              and neighbors of the plant. The tour was supposed to highlight the 
              DOE's newly tightened operations. But it turned out to reveal just 
              how dangerously slipshod the agency remains. After the tour group 
              left the site's F-Area "tank farm," where the most highly radioactive 
              waste is stored in underground tanks, Savannah River workers failed 
              to monitor the group for radiation exposure. "This was an appalling 
              breach of safety standards," says Tom Clements, head of the Nuclear 
              Control Institute, who was on the tour. </p>
<p>Savannah River managers admit the mistake, but blame it on a logistical 
              screw-up. "We never intended for them to get off the bus there," 
              says Rick Ford, a spokesman for the DOE. </p>
<p>This is refreshingly candid, but far from reassuring.
