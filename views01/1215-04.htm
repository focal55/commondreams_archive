<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Walt Whitman
often liked to do, one evening in the mid-1850s, he joined the rush
hour crowds to make the journey across New York Harbor, a habit that
gave him awing views of the great city.&nbsp; In the middle of his
beloved public, workers of all types, he reveled in the ways history
might be made to speak in the idioms of everyday life.&nbsp; Taking in
the awesome skyline of Manhattan, the ships, the sea-gulls, the water,
the boat itself, he later produced his psalm not only to the heroism
of commuting, but to the places we move to and from, places which are
both physical and temporal.&nbsp; &quot;Crossing Brooklyn Ferry&quot;
is that psalm, and its lyrics seem to speak to the collossal absence
we feel in the sights of September 11, 2001.&nbsp;
</font>
<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>What is it then between us?<br>
What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?<br>
<br>
Whatever it is, it avails not -- distance avails not, and place avails
not,<br>
I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,<br>
I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the waters
around it,<br>
I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,<br>
In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,<br>
In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon
me,<br>
I too had been struck from the float forever held in
solution</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rather than offer
silence to the statesmen, as Yeats would have it, we ought to
insist-as progressives, as artists, as scholars, as people of
faith-on hearing poetry now.&nbsp; Because now, in moments of great
pain when nations seek to gather their voices and de-pluralize them,
is when language is most burdened, most distorted, most cynically
employed.&nbsp; Whitman advises us to perceive the &quot;evil&quot; in
each of us, to remember that those who we might not know are more like
us than we might admit.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,<br>
The dark threw its patches down upon me also,<br>
The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious,<br>
My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality
meagre?<br>
Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,<br>
I am he who knew what it was to be evil,</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>I too knitted the
old knot of contrariety....</i></font>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Surely there is a
nationalist register in the poem, but it is the kind that progressives
need to hear and echo in these moments.&nbsp; We need to recognize
that the people who died and those who work to rescue them are the
citizens of a democracy, the very catalogue of culture and class, not
of centers of corporate trade.&nbsp; They died working in a society
that finds some of its best emblems in the artifice and the scenes of
modern cities.&nbsp; Whitman does not celebrate the commerce and
finance generated by the skyline, he sees the labor that made it.&nbsp;
This is the democracy that seems to get lost in the grind of daily
commutes and in the crush of enormous collapsing towers, not to
mention the misrepresentations of the conservative media.&nbsp; But
Whitman's solution is still floating near the mass grave that is
lower Manhattan.&nbsp; Poets can remind us what to do with what
we've seen--to not let death leave us speechless, to think ahead into
life, to look into an absence and somehow see our friends, and our
history.</font>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are,<br>
You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul,<br>
About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung out divinest
aromas,<br>
Thrive, cities -- bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and
sufficient rivers,<br>
Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual,<br>
Keep your places, objects than which none else is more
lasting.</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>
You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers,<br>
We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate
henceforward,<br>
Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from
us,<br>
We use you, and do not cast you aside -- we plant you permanently
within us,<br>
We fathom you not -- we love you -- there is perfection in you
also,</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>You furnish your
parts toward eternity,</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Great or small, you
furnish your parts toward the soul.<br>
