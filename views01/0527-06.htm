Well, times change.
<p>I am thinking now about the price of electricity. The new Republican
administration in Washington is pretty clear on this: California and the
West will pay the going rate, whatever.
<p>Updated for the 21st century, the GOP platform has a whole different
idea of the "public interest," it seems. Correct me if I'm wrong, but
this administration sees a higher duty now. Our free market system is
under attack. Government must fight the menace of creeping socialism, the
toll be damned. "We shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we
shall fight in the hills, we shall never surrender," Dick Cheney
declared. Or was that the other conservative, Winston Churchill?
<p>Doesn't matter. The thinking is the same.
<p>Temporary price caps on energy will do nothing for supply and demand,
we're told. Of course not. Temporary price caps will only serve to
temporarily cap prices.
<p>But this is surrender, Cheney says. It will discourage the oil and gas
boys back in Texas. You slice a zero off those 600% profit margins, and
you're yielding ground to the creeping socialists. What possible
incentive will anyone have to keep America great if the government
meddles with their aspirations for unlimited profit? No, it's better that
we citizens clean out our savings accounts and send them to Houston and
keep free market morale up. Think of your check as a war bond.
<p>It is no coincidence, of course, that Cheney and his understudy in the
Oval Office drew the battle lines on energy, where they know the terrain.
<p>But this is only one front in a larger war. Once he's mopped up his
victory on energy, Cheney will have his hands full elsewhere in the
nation. I'm sure he was shocked when he took office and opened the books
on the federal budget to find just how deeply the socialists have crept
into our culture. Look around, and pity the poor vice president his task
to restore our free markets to their full glory before it's too late:
<p><i> Milk. </i> My heavens, did you know that the some dairy farmers
have created a cartel to set their own prices? Worse, the government sets
the minimum prices for the rest of them. That's not creeping socialism,
that's socialism at a full gallop. I'm afraid we'll have to forego milk
and cheese for a few years while Cheney straightens out this mess.
<p><i> Sugar. </i> Can you believe this? Socialists have actually crept
into our candy bars and breakfast cereals. No free market for these guys.
They get propped up at both ends to the tune of $1.9 billion a year.
Government agents protect our borders against cheaper imported sugar.
Thus our domestic growers can produce sugar here at higher prices, and
the government buys and pays to store all the surplus.
<p><i> Timber. </i> Loggers are sometimes thought to be kissing cousins of
the oilmen. Actually, they turned their back on the free market and went
socialist a long time ago. Have you noticed, for instance, they all wear
red plaid shirts? In 1998, taxpayers spent $126 million opening up roads
so that the timber industry could cut down trees in national forests.
This year, with government help, the industry blocked the free market
import of lumber from Canada on grounds that Canada's subsidies, oh dear,
were higher than ours. The result: The price of a sheet of plywood has
gone up 40% in the U.S.
<p><i> Fish. </i> For years, commercial fishermen resisted government
intrusion into their business--right up to the moment when they stripped
too many fish from the oceans. In a free market system, they'd face
bankruptcy. Instead, they're going for a socialist handouts. West Coast
fishermen will soon share in a $50-million taxpayer bailout--selling
their boats directly to the government if fishermen promise to stop
fishing for fish that are not there.
<p><i> Boeing. </i> Sad but true, socialism has crept into our big
industry too. One recent example: The Pentagon announced it would
subsidize production of Boeing's C-17 cargo plane, which nobody but the
Air Force seems to want. If you're an airfreight hauler and buy a C-17,
the Pentagon says it will channel shipping business your way, never mind
the free market system of bids.
<p>This is just a sampler, but you can see what Cheney is up against. He
might wonder why the United States hasn't collapsed entirely, instead of
being well fed and prosperous by tinkering with the principles of the
free market.
<p>But that won't happen with energy, he vows. No socialist price caps
for California and the West. It's time to stand up against those who
think government should go meddling. It's time to let the markets work
their wonder. Gather 'round your candles, friends. Listen to Dick
Cheney's ringing battle cry. Or was it Churchill's? Doesn't matter:
"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so
few."
