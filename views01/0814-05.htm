            <p> Ah, the power of deterrence! An arraignment is taking place in 

              Los Angeles today of fifteen Greenpeace activists and two journalists 

              who stand accused of felonies in the disruption of the Pentagon's 

              antimissile defense test at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California 

              last month. The charges, which carry a maximum sentence of more 

              than 11 years in prison and fines totaling half a million dollars, 

              are among the stiffest yet handed down to anti-Star Wars protesters 

              at Vandenberg. Apparently, the government is trying to send a message 

              to deter future activists. Will it work? All you need to do is look 

              across the courtroom at today's arraignment to get your answer. 

              <br>

              <br>

              Representing the Greenpeace fifteen is Katya Komisaruk of the Just 

              Cause Legal Collective. You might recognize her thick black hair 

              and quizzical expression from Seattle, where she worked around the 

              clock in the rainy streets and was instrumental in getting all the 

              charges against close to 600 World Trade Organization protesters 

              dropped. <br>

              <br>

              In Washington DC, where demonstrations confronted the International 

              Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings, she joined civil rights attorneys 

              in negotiating a plea that got serious charges against about 800 

              arrestees reduced to the equivalent of a traffic ticket. In Los 

              Angeles, she worked hand-in-glove with activists to get charges 

              dropped against protesters arrested during the Democratic National 

              Convention. To thousands of demonstrators, Komisaruk has become 

              "our lawyer." <br>

              <br>

              It stands to reason that she'd be representing Star Wars protesters 

              at Vandenberg. But it also makes a mockery of the government's belief 

              that stiff sentencing deters protest. You see, fourteen years ago, 

              it was Komisaruk breaking into Vandenberg and Komisaruk in the dock. 

              It hasn't deterred her. Far from it. <br>

              <br>

              In fact, her experience spurred her to become a people's lawyer 

              -- an "organizer attorney" as she puts it. According to colleague 

              Frances Olsen of UCLA Law School, "Katya is potentially the leading 

              criminal defense attorney in the U.S." Which wasn't quite the government's 

              idea. <br>

              <br>

              Late one June night in 1987, when she was 28, Komisaruk hitchhiked 

              to Vandenberg, north of Santa Barbara. Armed with a poem, a box 

              of cookies, a bunch of flowers, a hammer, some spray paint and an 

              electric drill, she walked through an open gateway and left her 

              offerings for the absent guards, then made her way to what she believed 

              was the headquarters of the NAVSTAR navigation system. NAVSTAR enabled 

              the United States to launch a first strike nuclear missile attack 

              -- in violation of international laws against initiating nuclear 

              war. <br>

              <br>

              Next, Komisaruk hacked at an IBM mainframe computer and dented a 

              satellite dish, aiming to disable the military's satellite guidance 

              system, a critical component in the Pentagon's arsenal. She scrawled 

              "Geneva Convention" and "No first strike" on the walls. Two hours 

              later, still no guards in sight, she hitchhiked home, got legal 

              advice, held a press conference and gave herself up. <br>

              <br>

              The government came down hard on Komisaruk, too. What followed was 

              a landmark trial -- standing-room only in Los Angeles' federal court. 

              The government prosecutor pioneered a new strategy on Komisaruk: 

              gag the defendants. They've been using the same tactic on political 

              prisoners ever since. On a prosecution request, the judge banned 

              all talk of "nuclear missile," "Geneva Convention," or "necessity 

              defense," along with any description of NAVSTAR, or first strike. 

              The words were literally forbidden to be said in the court. <br>

              <br>

              Powerless to explain her motives to the judge or the jury, "it was 

              like one of those nightmares," Komisaruk said afterwards. "Where 

              you're trying to scream for help or give some warning and no sound 

              comes out." Equal parts furious and inspired, she decided to become 

              a lawyer. <br>

              <br>

              Convicted on felony damage charges and sentenced to five years, 

              Komisaruk studied furiously for the LSATs at Camp Geiger, a minimum 

              security federal prison near Spokane. She applied to Harvard from 

              prison, was accepted on her release and in 1994 she set up practice 

              in the San Francisco Bay Area where she has been practicing law 

              on behalf of political activists, the poor, and those caught up 

              in the state's draconian drug net ever since. <br>

              <br>

              Today her clients are six Americans, two Germans, two Britons, two 

              Australians, one Indian, one Canadian and one Swede who are charged 

              with "conspiracy to violate a safety zone." A Spanish videographer 

              with a green card and a British photographer (both freelance journalists) 

              face similar charges. <br>

              <br>

              Reflecting on the arraignment today and the parallels between her 

              position twelve years ago and where she stands now, Komisaruk says 

              "it's eerie." It should also be instructive. If her clients are 

              as inspired by Komisaruk as she was by her lawyer, the Greenpeace 

              fifteen may be the movement's next most valuable recruits. <br>

              <br>

              It's funny how the government never seems to catch on. Making martyrs 

              of activists makes more impassioned activists. (Not to mention some 

              pretty motivated lawyers.) I guess that's why they say Military 

              Intelligence is a contradiction in terms.
