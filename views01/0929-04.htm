I just received a letter from a friend who lives in New York City.  He wrote 
that he fears for the future after the September 11 terrorist attacks there 
and at the Pentagon.  In Sacramento, I share his emotion.

<p>September 11 has left many people in a state of anxiety.  Understanding the 
centrality of this condition is crucial.  Here’s why.

<p>The desire for safety is a natural condition of human beings.  This is their 
true interest.  When safety is absent, people seek its return in many ways.

<p>As I see it, the question is how to restore a sense of safety.  I say a 
“sense” because absolute safety is absolutely illusory.  This truism bears 
attention precisely because of the recent monumental event that ended life 
for innocent people of all backgrounds on American soil.

<p>This crime against humanity has created a void.  It’s been said that nature 
abhors a void.  Confronting it, we do well to see that in our interrelated 
world, every action causes a reaction.

<p>No people stand outside this equation.  Innocent victims of violence share a 
bitter fate.  Accepting this fact is part of the healing process.

<p>One other thing is certain.  We can count on unforeseen outcomes of our 
government’s responses to Sept.  11.  Its militarized policies of the past 
offer a guide to future militarism at home and abroad.

<p>Consider America’s “War on Drugs.”  Has it made anybody safer from the 
violence associated with the illegal drug trade?  Instead, what this war has 
done is incarcerate mostly nonwhite Americans whose labor is unneeded on the 
job market.  The economics of America's skin color relations are nothing 
nice.

<p>Did the U.S.-led Gulf War against Iraq bring peace in the Middle East?  On a 
related note for us now, President Bush’s father did build some “national 
unity” for this war.  This was one example of a political leader 
manufacturing public consent for an international butchery.  It continues 
today, though less visibly, with the economic sanctioning of Iraq causing 
the deaths of more than 500,000 Iraqi kids.

<p>Many Americans, in their grief and shock after September 11, want something 
to be done to make them safe.  Who can argue?  Our idea of safety has been 
violated in the most horrific way, and we are hurting.

<p>In every end there is a new beginning.  Which means many things.  One is 
that during emotional times of loss, people are vulnerable.  Political 
leaders and mainstream news media owners skillfully exploit this emotion to 
consolidate their power over the public mind.

<p>Not that politicians need the excuse of a crisis to weaken our freedom.  
Recall that President Clinton, during the so-called “economic boom,” backed 
the anti-terrorism and crime bills, major rollbacks of civil rights that 
weakened habeas corpus.  In a global economic downturn currently flowing 
from the U.S., President Bush and his administration are trying to build on 
this repressive legislation under the guise of promoting public safety.

<p>To be sure, fear of the future can paralyze some into silence.  For them, 
the unacceptable could become acceptable.  Elites’ solutions to the current 
crisis are meant to cow people into embracing measures that will make a bad 
situation worse.  To paraphrase Audre Lorde, their silence offers them no 
protection.

<p>For other people, fear can vitalize them into new ways of thinking.  Never 
underestimate the ability of ordinary folks to mobilize and organize in ways 
that encourage the best in themselves and others.  I mean the qualities of 
sympathy and solidarity that have stood history’s test of adversity.

<p>Now is the time for Americans to turn our collective fear of being unsafe 
into an opportunity for renewal.  The future doesn’t have to be one of 
conflict resolution through violent confrontation.  Solutions based on 
nonviolent cooperation are emerging, however underreported in America’s 
mainstream news media, in the U.S. and around the world.

<p>In the end, the solutions to social problems will have to come from 
humanity's majority if society is to survive.  It’s the hour for us to teach 
our leaders by example.  They have many lessons to learn.
