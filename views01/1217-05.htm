[A talk to Independent Allies, San Antonio, TX, December 6, 2001]
</i>
<p>After a recent antiwar talk in which I sharply criticized U.S. foreign 
policy, a student asked me, "Don't you find it hard to live being so 
cynical?" When I responded that I thought my comments were critical but not 
cynical, he looked at me funny and said, "But how can being so critical not 
make you cynical?"

<p>The student was equating any critique of injustice produced by institutions 
and systems of power with cynicism about people. His question made me 
realize how easy is cynicism and how difficult is sustained critique in 
this culture, which shouldn't surprise us. People with power are perfectly 
happy for the population to be cynical, because that tends to paralyze 
people and leads to passivity. Those same powerful people also do their 
best to derail critique -- the process of working to understand the nature 
of things around us and offering judgments about them -- because that tends 
to energize people and leads to resistance.

<p>Understanding the difference between critique and cynicism -- and the 
difference between hope and optimism -- is crucial to the future of any 
struggle against injustice. At this moment in history, those struggles must 
not only be about trying to win changes in policies but also about the 
reinvigoration of public life -- a call for participation, for politics, 
for radical citizenship in reactionary times.

<p>I don't use radical and reactionary in this case to describe specific 
political positions, left versus right. I am talking instead about an 
approach not just to politics, narrowly defined, but to the central 
questions of what it means to be a human being in connection with others. I 
think the world we live in is reactionary because it is trying to squeeze 
those important human dimensions out of us in the political sphere and 
constrict the range of discussion so much that politics does seem to many 
to be useless. I want to argue that our only hope is to be radical, to be 
political, and to be radical in public politically.

<p>To do that, I will talk about my own journey from cynicism to hope, my own 
struggle both for greater understanding of my self and an understanding of 
something greater than me. I am going to talk about love and justice. I am 
going to risk being seen as naive or self-indulgent or just plain silly. 
That's OK; I'm just a good-natured hick from North Dakota. We're generally 
plodding and slow and often don't realize we're being naive, or when people 
are making fun of us for it.

<p>Let me start the story when I was younger, in my teens and 20s. I saw that 
the world was in pretty awful shape. When I looked around at the world, I 
saw a whole lot of pain. The United States had just ended its terrorist 
campaign in Southeast Asia -- what we commonly call the Vietnam War -- and 
was pursuing another by proxy in Central America; rich people seemed 
unconcerned that their luxury was built on the backs of the suffering of 
literally billions of poor people around the world; people all over the 
place were still getting kicked around simply because they were women or 
non-white or gay or different in some fashion; and many people seemed not 
to care that the ecosystem that sustained our lives was in collapse.

<p>I looked around at all this, and I got cynical. Human beings, it seemed to 
me, were pretty unpleasant creatures. Human nature, I assumed, had to be 
pretty rotten for all this suffering to go on and on, generation after 
generation. Even with the advances in social justice -- and there have been 
advances, such as the end of slavery, greater recognition of the basic 
rights of women, etc. -- it is hard to be upbeat moving out of the 20th 
century, one of the most brutal and bloody in human history, into the 21st 
century, which promises to be just as, if not more, brutal.

<p>Being cynical appeared to have some advantages. I could step back from all 
the chaos and be hip. I could make jokes about how stupid people were. I 
could pretend not to care. I could turn away from the suffering of others 
because I, one of the hip and cynical, understood just how pathetic a 
species we were. I thought I was the one who saw it all so clearly.

<p>I stayed cynical, and disengaged, for some time. The fact that I was 
working at newspapers didn't help; for journalists, cynicism is an 
occupational hazard that takes great intelligence and maturity to resist, 
and I didn't possess either quality in adequate amounts. So cynical I 
stayed, until I went to graduate school and was given the luxury of time to 
read, think, and study. Lots of people go to graduate school and become 
cynics, or their cynicism deepens; universities can do that to people. But 
I got lucky and met some exceptional people -- many of them outside the 
university -- who helped me see another way.

<p>For me, that way began with feminism. I read a lot and listened to women. I 
started to not only learn about gender and sexism, but I also picked up a 
new way to understand the world, a new method of inquiry for examining the 
ideas and institutions that shape our world. I learned to look at how 
systems and structures of power operate. I learned to see past the surface 
to the core elements of those systems and structures. When I did that, I 
realized that things were far worse than I had thought -- the world was in 
more trouble than I had ever imagined. I learned about new levels of 
suffering and oppression.

<p>That's when I stopped being cynical and began to feel full of hope.

<p>That may seem counterintuitive. How did a deepening sense of the scale and 
scope of injustice and suffering make me hopeful? The answer is simple. For 
all those years, I was cynical for two basic reasons: I had the wrong view 
of human nature, and I didn't understand how the world worked. I thought 
the evil and stupidity all around me were the product of an inherently evil 
and stupid human nature, and therefore I didn't see any way to fight 
against injustice. It all seemed beyond our control.

<p>Once I started to understand the nature of illegitimate structures of 
authority, I realized that in fact people (including me) were not 
inherently evil or stupid, and that human nature (including mine) was 
complex and sometimes maddening, but not inherently aimed at the 
destruction of the world. I came to realize that the authority structures 
that so bent our lives were powerful and deeply entrenched.

<p>I also realized that most of the channels that the dominant culture offered 
us for working to make the world a better place were themselves deeply 
embedded in those authority structures, so that often the solutions were 
part of the problem. I realized that the analysis and action that could 
save us had to be more radical than I ever could have imagined. I also 
realized that at the moment in history in which I lived, there were 
relatively few people who would agree with any of this: People had begun to 
talk about a "postfeminist" age; the attacks on affirmative action and 
ethnic studies were emerging; the fall of the Berlin Wall "proved" that 
capitalism was the only possible economic system; and the United States was 
celebrating the slaughter of the Gulf War.

<p>So, at the moment I realized the depth of the problem and the forces 
stacked against justice, I got hopeful. The hope comes not from some 
delusional state, but from what I would argue is a sensible assessment of 
the situation. Cynicism might be an appropriate reaction to injustice that 
can't be changed. Hope is an appropriate response to a task that, while 
difficult, is imaginable. And once I could understand the structural forces 
that produced injustice, I could imagine what a world without those forces 
-- and hence without the injustice -- might look like. And I could imagine 
what activities and actions and ideas it would take to get us there. And I 
could look around, and look back into history, and realize that lots of 
people have understood this and that I hadn't stumbled onto a new idea.

<p>In other words, I finally figured out that I should get to work.

<p>So hope emerged out of cynicism. I began to see the power of radical 
analysis and the importance of collective action. I began to take the long 
view, to see that we face a struggle, but that it is not a pointless 
struggle. The exact choices we should make as we struggle are not always 
clear, but the framework for making choices is there.

<p>Hope and optimism

<p>I have hope, but that does not mean I am optimistic.

<p>Just as we have to distinguish between critique and cynicism, we have to 
realize that hope is not synonymous with optimism. I am hopeful, but I am 
not necessarily always optimistic, at least not about the short-term 
possibilities. These systems and structures of power, these illegitimate 
structures of authority, are deeply entrenched. They will not be dislodged 
easily or quickly. Optimism and pessimism should hang on questions of fact 
-- we should be optimistic when the facts argue for optimism.

<p>For example, I am against the illegitimate structure of authority called 
the corporation. I want to see different forms of economic organization 
emerge. I am hopeful about the possibilities but not optimistic that in my 
lifetime I will see the demise of capitalism, corporations, and wage 
slavery. Still, I will do certain things to work toward that.

<p>The same can be said of the problem of U.S. aggression against innocent 
people in the rest of the world, particularly these days in Afghanistan, 
where the aggression is most intense. Given the bloody record of the United 
States in the past 50 years and the seemingly limitless capacity of U.S. 
officials to kill without conscience, I must confess I am not optimistic 
that such aggression will stop anytime soon, in large part because those 
corporate structures that drive the killing are still around. But I will do 
certain things to work against it.

<p>Or take the large state research university. I am concerned about how the 
needs of students are systematically ignored and the needs of corporate 
funders are privileged, how critical thinking is squashed not by accident 
but by design. I am concerned about the illegitimate structures of 
authority that I work in and that compel me to act in ways against the 
interests of students. I am not optimistic that the structure of big 
research universities is going to change anytime soon. But I will do 
certain things to work against the structures.

<p>So, why would I do any of those things if my expectations of short-term 
success are so low? One reason is that I could be wrong about my assessment 
of the likelihood of change. I've been wrong about a lot of things in my 
life; the list grows every day. For all I know, corporate capitalism is on 
the verge of collapse, and if we just keep the pressure on it will start to 
unravel tomorrow. Or perhaps public discontent with murderous U.S. foreign 
policy is just about ready to crystallize and mobilize people. Or perhaps 
the contradictions of these behemoth universities are becoming so apparent 
that the illegitimate structures of authority are about to give way to 
something that deserves the label "higher education."

<p>History is too complex and contingent for any of us to make predictions. We 
simply don't have the intellectual tools to understand with much precision 
how and why people and societies change. History is a rough guide, but it 
offers no social-change equation. Still, there's really no reasonable 
alternative except to keep plugging away. Basically, there are two choices, 
which are common sense but that I didn't figure out until I heard them 
articulated by Noam Chomsky: We can either predict the worst -- that no 
change is possible -- and not act, in which case we guarantee there will be 
no change. Or we can understand that change always is possible, even in the 
face of great odds, and act on that assumption, which creates the 
possibility of progress. (See Chomsky's interview with Michael Albert at 
<a href="http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/interviews/9301-albchomsky-2.html" target="_new">http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/interviews/9301-albchomsky-2.html</a>)

<p>Every great struggle for justice in human history began as a lost cause. 
When Gabriel Prosser made plans to take Richmond, Virginia, in 1800, the 
first large-scale organized slave revolt, he was fighting a lost cause, for 
which he was hanged. When eight Quakers got together in 1814 in Jonesboro, 
Tennessee, to form the first white anti-slavery society in the United 
States (the Tennessee Society for the Manumission of Slaves) they were 
fighting a lost cause. A lost cause that eventually won.

<p>But that can't be the only answer to the question "why should I be 
politically active." We are human beings, not machines, and we all have 
needs. It is hard to sustain yourself in difficult work if the only reward 
is the possibility that somewhere down the line your work may have some 
positive effect, though you may be long dead. That's a lot to ask of 
people. We all want more than that out of life. We want joy and love. At 
least every now and then, we want to have a good time, including a good 
time while engaged in our work. No political movement can sustain itself 
indefinitely without understanding that, not just because people need -- 
and have a right -- to be happy, but because if there is no joy in it, then 
movements are more likely to be dangerous. The joy -- the celebration of 
being human and being alive in connection with others -- is what must fuel 
the drive for change.

<p>People find joy in many different ways. As many people over the years have 
pointed out, one source of joy is in the struggle. I have spent a lot of 
time in the past few years doing political work, and some of that work 
isn't terribly fun. Collating photocopies for a meeting for a progressive 
political cause isn't any more fun than collating photocopies for a meeting 
at a marketing company.  But it is different in some ways: It puts you in 
contact with like-minded people. It sparks conversation. It creates space 
in which you can think and feel your way through difficult questions. It's 
a great place to laugh as you staple. It provides the context for 
connections that go beyond superficial acquaintanceships.

<p>The joy is in the struggle, but not just because in struggle one connects 
to decent people. The joy is also in the pain of struggle. Joy is 
multilayered -- one key aspect of it is discovery, and one way we discover 
things about ourselves and others is through pain. Struggle confronts pain, 
and confronting pain is part of joy. The pain is there, in all our lives; 
there is no human life without pain. Pain can become part of joy when it is 
confronted. Struggle confronts pain. Struggle produces joy.

<p>The joy is in the struggle. The struggle is not just the struggle against 
illegitimate structures of authority in the abstract. The struggles are in 
each of us -- struggles to find the facts, to analyze clearly, to imagine 
solutions, to join with others in collective action for justice, and 
struggles to understand ourselves in relation to each other and ourselves 
as we engage in all these activities.

<p>I realize that this struggle doesn't seem appealing to many. I have heard 
lots of people lately say that they can't cope with the complexity of 
politics. It seems too much, too big, too confusing. All they can handle, 
they say, is to focus on their individual lives and do the best to fix 
their lives. I think these folks misunderstand not just their moral 
obligation but the nature of progress, individual and collective. We don't 
fix ourselves in isolation. We don't build decent lives by cutting 
ourselves off from problems just because they are complex. Yes, there are 
times when difficult situations force us to turn inward and deal with 
pressing problems in our lives. I have done that, and I see no need to 
apologize for it. But I am arguing against the permanent division of our 
lives into these artificial categories. Our problems are never wholly 
individual, and hence they can't be fixed in individual ways. Part of the 
solution is always to be found in the bigger struggle, in which we all have 
a part.

<p>I have learned that there is great joy in that bigger struggle. And that 
leads us back to the abandonment of cynicism and the embrace of hope. 
Cynicism is a sophomoric and self-indulgent retreat from the world and all 
its problems. Hope is a mature and loving embrace of the world and all its 
promise. That does not mean one should have unfounded or naive hope. 
Wendell Berry reminds us that history shows that "massive human failure" is 
possible, but:

<p>"[H]ope is one of our duties. A part of our obligation to our own being and 
to our descendants is to study our life and our condition, searching always 
for the authentic underpinnings of hope. And if we look, these 
underpinnings can still be found." [Sex, Economy, Freedom & Community (New 
York: Pantheon, 1993), p. 11.]

<p>Hope is one of our duties. But that does not mean it is always easy. There 
are many times, especially since September 11, that I have had to struggle 
to hold onto hope. The combination of seeing the World Trade Center towers 
fall in an instance and then watching the unfolding of an illegal and 
immoral war on Afghanistan has tested my own sense of hope. I managed to 
hold on for a couple of months, but in the few days before I sat down to 
write this I could feel my sense of hope fading. At the same time that I 
have been writing and thinking about the war, I also have been continuing 
my work on sexual violence and pornography. Both spark the same feeling in 
my gut -- despair over how cruel people, especially men, can be. When I 
have to face humans' willingness to inflict pain -- and ability to find 
pleasure in inflicting pain -- whether in the realm of the global or the 
intimate, some part of me wants to die; I can't bear it. Maybe some part of 
me does die.

<p>In the few days before I wrote this, I especially was having trouble in the 
mornings; lying awake in bed in the dark; trying to reclaim that sense of 
hope so that getting out of bed would make sense; trying not to think about 
the war but realizing that not thinking about it would be even worse; dying 
a little bit inside every morning, in the dark.

<p>But those authentic underpinnings of hope remain. On the day I wrote this, 
I had a meeting with a student on my campus who had read something I had 
written about the war and wanted to talk. She said she didn't have anything 
in particular to ask me. She just wanted to talk to someone who didn't 
think she was crazy. All around her at work and school, people -- pro, con 
or neutral -- were refusing to talk about the war, she said. So we talked 
for a bit. We did politics, in a small way, the way politics is most often 
done. We talked about how she might organize a political group on campus. 
But maybe more important, we shored up each other's sense of hope. We could 
talk about the pain and craziness of the war without turning away.

<p>Real hope -- the belief in the authentic underpinnings of hope -- is 
radical. A belief that people are not evil and stupid, not consigned merely 
to live out pre-determined roles in illegitimate structures of authority, 
is radical. The willingness to act publicly on that hope and that belief is 
radical.

<p>We all live in a society that would prefer that we not be radical, that we 
not understand any of this. We live in a society that prefers productive 
but passive people. I work at a university that is part of that society, 
and has many of the same problems. Many classes at the university are 
either explicitly or implicitly designed to convince students that 
everything I have argued here is fundamentally loony. The same goes for 
much of what comes to us through the commercial mass media. Some of what I 
say indeed may be misguided; as I said, I understand that I could be, and 
often am, wrong.

<p>But, even if I'm wrong in some ways, I'd rather be wrong with hope than 
cynicism. I'd rather be naive than hip. I'd rather work for a just and 
sustainable world and fail than abandon the hope. I understand that this 
position is not wholly logical; it is based on a sense of how we can best 
make good on the gifts that come with being part of the human community. It 
is based on a faith in something common to us all, a capacity that is 
difficult to name, but which is perhaps best summed up by a phrase once 
used by the Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. Our task simply put, Freire 
said, is "to change some conditions that appear to me as obviously against 
the beauty of being human." [Myles Horton and Paulo Freire, We Make the 
Road by Walking (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1990), p. 131.]

<p>In the end, that is the central hope: We can join together to help build 
not a utopia but a world in which we can struggle -- individually and 
collectively, through the pain and with joy -- to get as close as we can to 
the beauty of being human.
