In 1998, Trillium Asset Management Corporation (TAMC) attended a
shareholder meeting at California-based Unocal Corporation.  TAMC was
protesting a gas pipeline deal that would have put millions of dollars into
the hands of a regime that oppressed women and ethnic minorities, sponsored
the opium trade, and had connections to terrorists. The proposed partner was
Afghanistan's fledgling Taliban regime. The pipeline would have transported
natural gas from Turkmenistan to Pakistan's Persian Gulf ports. Two months
later, Unocal suspended the project, and by year's end, ended it altogether.

        
        <p>By Unocal's own admission, the deal would have meant $50 to $100
million in annual revenues to the Taliban  over a quarter of a billion
dollars by the time of the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon.  At the time, the only groups protesting the deal were a
coalition of activists and TAMC.  Not the State Department (sanctions had
yet to be imposed) nor Wall Street.  
        
       <p> Unfortunately, Unocal's ill-fated deal with the Taliban was not an
isolated incident.  The world is littered with similar partnerships.  Just
last year social investors, human rights activists, environmental groups and
national security experts joined forces to protest the initial public
offering of PetroChina Co., a subsidiary of China's mammoth state-owned oil
company, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).  CNPC owns 90% of
PetroChina Co.  Investors in the Goldman Sachs- led IPO now own the rest.
        
       <p> CNPC has ties to the Sudan, a one-time haven of Osama bin Laden and
a state subject to sanctions by the U.S.  Since PetroChina is controlled by
CNPC, the IPO freed up capital for CNPC's operations in the Sudan and
elsewhere.  It is estimated that CNPC has invested over $700 million dollars
developing Sudanese oil fields  a boon to the war torn nation.  Under
pressure from activists, however, the IPO raised only $2.9 billion dollars
half of what CNPC was expecting.   
        
       <p> Policing companies that do business with oppressive regimes is a
matter of principle for socially responsible investment (SRI) managers like
TAMC, but it is also an investment strategy.  Companies themselves are faced
with these decisions all the time. More often than not, they fail the test.
In Germany, U.S.-owned companies helped Adolf Hitler rather than oppose him.
After World War II, Swiss banks made no effort to find heirs of slaughtered
Jews who had accounts with them; they simply took their money.  It took
years for Nike to recognize that the people protesting working conditions in
their Asian plants had a legitimate gripe.  And so it is today with the oil
fields beneath the Sudan and those accessible through Afghanistan.
        
        <p>Arguments are always made that capitalism fosters democracy.  In
reality, it is more often the reverse.  Capitalism, by itself, is just a
system to make money.  If it is imposed without respect for basic human
rights, it lacks the restraint to create a balance between human and natural
resources. 
        
       <p> As a result of the September 11th attacks, the United States has
been forced to cope with unspeakable loss and the prospects of war with a
nation-less enemy. The Nation must also learn to defend itself from attack
while at the same time defending civil rights.  
        
        <p>For SRI managers, the September 11th attacks underscored the
importance of putting pressure on companies that support oppressive regimes
or don't uphold the ideals of democracy, freedom and human rights. Some
things are always worth fighting for.
