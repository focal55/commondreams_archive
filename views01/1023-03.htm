<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Winter is coming in Afghanistan.  The Bush administration says 1.5 
million Afghanis will lack food.  A UN World Food Program official puts the 
number closer to 6 million.  But no matter how many might starve, our 
government is committed to ending terrorism, once and for 
all.  Right?   Well, yes . . . and no.
     
<p>President Bush called the war "a task that does not 
end."  Vice-President Cheney said, "There's not going to be an end date 
when we're going to say, `'There, it's all over with.''' Secretary of 
Defense Rumsfeld explained that we "surely will not" eliminate terrorism 
"completely from the face of the Earth. . . . You can't stop [terrorists] 
from doing things that are unpleasant to their neighbors or their 
neighboring countries."  It sounds like "Operation Enduring War."  If we 
can never defeat terrorism, what is the point of endless war and endless 
deaths?
      
<p>Rumsfeld says we can win by redefining victory:  "We can continue to 
live in a world with powerful weapons and with people who are willing to 
use those powerful weapons . . . and that will be a victory," as long as 
"the American people and our interests and friends and allies and deployed 
forces can go about our business not in fear."  But if terrorists are still 
around with powerful weapons, how can we ever live "not in fear"?
        
<p>"Business" and "interests," not safety, sound like the operative 
words here.  Listen to the president: "The stakes of this fight are 
high:  our lives, our way of life and our economic future." "Terrorists 
want to turn the openness of the global economy against itself.  We must 
not let them."  "Out of the sorrow of September 11th, I see opportunity . . 
. to expand our ties of trade." "We cannot let the terrorists achieve the 
objective of frightening our nation to the point where we don't conduct 
business or people don't shop.  That's their intention."  When the going 
gets tough, the tough go shopping.
        
<p>Rumsfeld was a bit more sophisticated:  "We have to engage in that 
world as free people because the linkages we have across this globe are so 
centrally a part of our lives that we have no choice but to contribute to a 
more peaceful and stable world."  In the vocabulary of U.S. political and 
business elites, a "stable world" means a world predictably safe for 
long-term international investments.  Bush understands that.  He told the 
Asian Pacific Economic Conference that we will defeat terrorism when 
"nations accept the rules of the modern world" -- rules written by the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, the guardians 
of stability.
         
<p>International investments and financial rules are the essential 
"linkages we have across the globe."  They afford many Americans a very 
comfortable way of life.  Rumsfeld has defined victory as protecting that 
way of life.  "The United States is linked with so many nations across the 
globe that we need to be able to engage in the kinds of things that 
Americans engage in," he said.  Victory is when "you are satisfied that the 
American people are going to be able to live their lives in relative 
freedom and have the kinds of linkages with the rest of the world that we 
feel are so central to our well being."
        
<p>"Relative freedom"?  Does that mean always having murderous 
terrorists out there, as long as the American way of life, based on 
multinational corporate interests and linkages, survives?  Rumsfeld seemed 
to say so:  "What we are attempting to do is to assure that we can prevent 
people from adversely affecting our way of life. . . . Children have to go 
off to school and we have to have reasonable expectation that they'll be 
coming home from school."
        
<p>Well pardon me, Mr. Secretary, if I want more than a "reasonable 
expectation" that my child will come home from school.  Why should we 
continue running any risk of terrorism?  Why do we have this risk now?
         
<p>Rumsfeld himself answered that question:  "Mostly what 
[terrorists] hate, I suppose, is any infringement on their extreme beliefs, 
whether it comes from us or another country."  Osama bin Laden's "extreme" 
belief is that U.S. troops should not be in the holy Muslim land of Saudi 
Arabia, and the U.S. should not continue sanctions that kill people in 
Iraq.  Those are the infringements he hates most.  As the vice-president 
said, "his objective, obviously, is to try to influence our behavior, to 
force us to withdraw from that part of the world."
<p>Why not withdraw our troops and our sanctions, if it will insure 
our safety?  Perhaps it has something to do with the most vital interest of 
all, our linkage to the world's largest pools of oil (one in Saudi and the 
other just north of Afghanistan).  Perhaps we should call the operation 
"Enduring Free Trade" or "Enduring Free Enterprise."   Is it worth risking 
our children's lives, and the lives of millions of Afghanis, to stabilize 
the global interests and linkages that preserve our way of life?  Shouldn't 
we at least have a national debate about it, before the next terrorist 
attack?
