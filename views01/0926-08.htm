Among the tragedies of Sept 11 was that airports were publicly forewarned as 
long as five years ago about nonexistent security and chose to do nothing. 
Did the profit motive get in the way?

<p>One of the doomed jets took off from Newark Airport, in New Jersey. In 1996, 
the Federal Aviation Administration began investigating a story in the 
Record of Hackensack, New Jersey, in which a reporter easily slipped through 
security at Newark Airport, walked freely around the baggage area, observed 
security guards sleeping at their posts, even made his way onto the tarmac 
and stood with his foot on the tire of an airliner. This story appeared in 
the Record on September 11, 1996. The FAA’s conclusion? Security at Newark 
Airport is lax. Exactly five years later, that fact would be conclusively 
and terribly demonstrated.

<p>Up until now in the United States, airport security has been handled by the 
airlines themselves, which contract with security services, such as 
Huntleigh Corporation, the largest airport security provider in the country. 
Huntleigh also happens to be one of three security contractors at Sea-Tac 
Airport. These agencies pay between $6 and $10 per hour, in most cases do 
not provide any benefits, do not support unionization, and provide what many 
employees and critics agree is inadequate training. In most other countries, 
certainly those in Europe and the Middle East which have had more immediate 
experiences with terrorism, airport security is considered a matter of 
national importance. Security personnel are trained professionals, not 
over-worked minimum-wage earners in Captain Kangaroo jackets.

<p>On Sept. 19, 2001, the Seattle Times reported that a Huntleigh-employed 
security screener named Teuila Tuitele was “sent home” when she showed up 
for work the morning after her comments about poor training and working 
conditions at the airport appeared in the Seattle Sunday Times. Tuitele had 
told the Times that she didn’t feel she had been properly trained, that 
security workers were not rotated to reduce fatigue as stated by company 
policy, and that Huntleigh does not test employees’ vision as required by 
the FAA. Tuitele’s salary, after 11 months, is $8.05 per hour. A Huntleigh 
corporate memo dated Sept. 14 stated that employees could be fired for 
talking to the media, though Huntleigh denies that Tuitele has been fired. A 
Huntleigh representative did not return my phone calls.

<p>The failure of the low-bid system to provide for public security is not a 
surprise to anyone with even a passing familiarity with economics and 
incentives. This would seem not to include most free-market zealots, who 
maintain that privatization is the answer to our problems. In order to 
secure contracts, security companies must under-bid competitors.  Seeking to 
push up stock value and maintain shareholder confidence, airlines and their 
security contractors cut costs, and, as with all corporations, those cuts 
aren’t going to come from the salaries of executives. Rather than eliminate 
costs through low worker pay and poor training, though, the result is that 
those costs have been dumped onto society.  On September 11, our society 
paid dearly.

<p>Over the next months and probably years we’ll be asking ourselves how this 
happened. The major news-media did a fine job of keeping us informed in the 
terrible moments following the attack, but have since slipped back into 
their familiar role of  government cheerleader. The other evening on 
“Nightline,” Ted Koppel got not-so-wildly-divergent views from two men, the 
first of whom advocated striking Afghanistan immediately and powerfully, the 
second of whom advised waiting a bit before striking powerfully. 
Unsurprisingly, there was no room made for discussion of any option other 
than decisive military action. Another idea that you probably will not hear 
discussed on “Nightline” or any of the other mainstream news programs is 
that lax airport security, which was unquestionably one the of the factors 
contributing to the heinous success of the terrorist’s attack, highlights a 
failure of the free market to provide for our safety.
