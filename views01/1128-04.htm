In the folklore of the business press, a widely held explanation has 
already congealed for the upswing that led optimists to proclaim the emergence 
of a "new economy." The now conventional wisdom flows as follows: together with 
Congress, the Clinton Administration got the ball rolling by balancing the 
federal budget, and moving it towards surplus. This caused long-term interest 
rates to fall, which led to an investment boom&#8212;especially in the high-tech 
sectors&#8212;and stimulated such interest-sensitive purchases as housing.

<p>All that new investment caused productivity to grow by leaps and bounds. 
Since productivity&#8212;the amount of goods or services that an hour of labor can 
produce&#8212;is the basis of economic growth, this raised incomes across the 
spectrum. The virtuous circle was completed by the response of the Federal 
Reserve: because of the surge in productivity, we are told, the Fed didn't have 
to worry about rapid growth leading to accelerating inflation. Thus the Fed was 
able to lower short-term rates, and allow for a record-long expansion, with 
unemployment falling to a 30-year low of 3.9 percent.
</p>

<p>Sounds plausible, doesn't it? And familiar. Now let's look at the 
numbers. Over the course of the business cycle,  real (inflation-adjusted) interest 
rates on mortgages and high-grade corporate bonds fell by only 0.8 percent. This 
certainly doesn't look like enough to stimulate an investment or housing boom, 
and it wasn't. Housing barely increased at all, as a percentage of the economy. 
And if we look at both investment components of GDP (investment plus net 
exports), the investment share actually declined slightly.</P>

<p>Productivity growth did increase, as compared to the business cycle of 
the 80s. But it was still considerably lower than the growth of the 50s and 60s 
business cycles. If we adjust for the increased share of output that was used up 
in more rapid depreciation&#8212;mostly computers and software&#8212;the productivity growth 
of the 90s cycle does not even beat the 70s. And wage growth for a typical 
worker was a paltry 0.5 percent a year.</P>

<p>So much for the "new economy." Still, it was a long expansion, and a 
pleasant memory compared to what we are facing right now. So what was behind it, 
if the official story doesn't hold up to the numbers? Most importantly, there 
was a consumption boom that was driven by an enormous bubble in the stock 
market. Personal savings rates fell to zero as upper-income households&#8212;the ones 
that hold stocks&#8212;saw the value of these assets soar.</P>

<p>The Fed's change in policy allowed the expansion to continue. Prior to 
1995, it would slow the economy when unemployment fell below 6 percent, on the 
theory that this was the best we could do. But this drastically important policy 
change&#8212;even today, we have millions of additional jobs as a result&#8212;could have 
been made at any time. It was not a result of 1990s productivity increases, but 
rather the Fed's belated realization that its prior theory was wrong.</P>

<p>Understanding the 1990s expansion, and its collapse, is vitally important 
to getting us out of the current recession. The evaporation of $8 trillion in 
stock market wealth translates into more than $300 billion in reduced 
consumption. This means we need a stimulus package  more than twice as large as the one 
that Senate Democrats are 
proposing (the House Republican plan contained hardly any stimulus at all, 
consisting mostly of tax breaks for corporations and high-income 
households).</P>

<p>Diehard policymakers and economists&#8212;including many Democrats&#8212;still cling 
to the notion that fiscal conservatism brought us prosperity. They ache to 
resume paying off the entire national debt at the earliest opportunity. Many 
others welcome the re-inflation of the stock market bubble&#8212;which still exists, 
and has lately been growing.</P>

<p>And 
while the Fed has been doing the right thing by lowering interest rates since 
the slowdown began, it could still revert to its old ways before the recovery is 
on track. This is especially true if our overvalued dollar&#8212;another largely 
unnoticed bubble from the 1990s expansion&#8212;were to drop sharply, raising the 
price of imports.</P>

<p>
The new economy may be dead, but the mythology that created it survives. Let's hope 
that it doesn't cause us any further trouble.</P>
