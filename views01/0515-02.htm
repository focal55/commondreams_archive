<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How does someone who is not a monster commit a monstrous act? That's the seemingly paradoxical question being asked by many of those who knew you, Tim. Can I call you Tim? Or should I address you as Mr. McVeigh?<BR>
<br>
I suppose the rules of polite society seem trivial to you, especially now, as you prepare to be executed by the very government you consider your enemy.<BR>
<br>
Many people all over this great country think of you as a monster. A self-<IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>righteous judgment it may be, but I can't say I fault them for it. I mean, blowing up a federal building and killing 168 people, including kids in a day care center, is beyond horrific.<BR>
<br>
But I think I know why some of the folks who have been close to you say that you are not a monster.<BR>
<br>
"He cries frequently when he thinks about the people in Waco. There occasionally are flickers of that depth of feeling about family members, about lost opportunities in life... . He is not a monster," said your former lawyer, Richard Burr.<BR>
<br>
The fact that you have genuine sympathy for the victims of the Waco atrocity is indisputable proof of your humanity and, therefore, your potential for tremendous acts of compassion.<BR>
<br>
Although it is true that you have caused unspeakable grief for so many and have had no positive effect in the delivery of your political message, you still offer us two important lessons.<BR>
<br>
1.) It is individually and collectively self-destructive to ignore the nonviolent truth embodied in the lives of Jesus, Tolstoy, Gandhi, Rev. King and, more recently, the 14th Dalai Lama.<BR>
<br>
2.) If you are going to be an adherent of the religion of righteous violence, which most of us are thoroughly steeped in, you had better worship at the altar of the state, and even though most of us profess to believe in some transcendent Benevolent Being who considers idolatry the pinnacle of sin, anyone who publicly deviates from state ideology and its war theology runs the risk of being silenced or killed.<BR>
<br>
Yes, some of us pretend that when the state kills it is being done on the people's behalf. Even if that were true, which it clearly is not, this one inescapable fact remains: "Violence always produces the results of violence. In the victims, the results of violence are either resentful hostility, leading ultimately to counter-violence, or else - if the violence has been 'successful' - utter, sub-human abjection" (Aldous Huxley).<BR>
<br>
"In the perpetrators, the results of violence are the formation of a habit of brutality and a growing determination to retain power by even the foulest means," Huxley reminds us.<BR>
<br>
"A violent revolution does not result in any fundamental change in human relations; it results merely in the confirmation of the old, bad relations of oppressor and oppressed, or irresponsible tyranny and irresponsible passive obedience. In de Ligt's own phrase, 'the more violence, the less revolution'."<BR>
<br>
I don't know of a single case where violence has not produced the results that violence seeks to eradicate. It's amazing that I get letters and e-mails accusing me of being an unrealistic utopian for advocating nonviolent politics. There are countless historical examples where nonviolence has not only achieved its political objective but actually transformed enemies into allies. There's not a single example of violence not leading to more violence and, still, I can be called unrealistic!<BR>
<br>
Of course, all "civilized" people have renounced personal revenge. But official legalized revenge, which is what the death penalty is, we still revel in.<BR>
<br>
The deterrence argument has been debunked so many times most death penalty proponents are embarrassed to even bring it up anymore. Now, they rely on half-baked, vague, philosophical arguments like "justice requires punishment." Since when did "justice" come to mean that somebody "sees to it" that somebody else gets hurt; not something good, or helpful, but something that hurts?<BR>
<br>
In my dealings with convicted criminals - that small minority of lawbreakers who are either unlucky enough, poor enough, stupid enough or blatant enough to get caught - one thing is clear: It is the feeling of revenge that impels most offenders to do what they do. Except for professional criminals, those who are arrested, convicted and sentenced are almost always out to avenge some perceived wrong or injustice.<BR>
<br>
Their victims are always people the perpetrator believes are either rivals, unloyal friends, an unfaithful mate, mean parent, someone "out to get them" - or someone who symbolizes one of those people.<BR>
<br>
Punishment may be what some of us deserve. The problem is it doesn't work and it doesn't make us feel any more safe.<BR>
<br>
Something that Nietzsche wrote in "Beyond Good and Evil" comes to mind. "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And when you look into the abyss, the abyss also looks into you."</font></p>
