This week a team of international scientists shared the incredible revelation that homo sapiens has about 30,000 genes. There was then a pause while everyone tried to gauge whether they should be amazed that this number was so high or so low. It transpires that they'd been expecting the American citizens from whom they took their samples to have many more genes than the nematode worm, but I suppose that's what happens when you base your research on the president. 
<P>Worms were used in the genome project because it was presumed that their genetic code would be so simple to decipher that everyone could knock off early on Friday afternoon. But now the papers have had to report the uncomfortable truth that there's not that much difference between ourselves and the worm; the simple, primitive, stupid worm. Frankly   worms have been patronised terribly in the media this week, and ought to take their case to the press complaints commission, except they won't of course, because they're so stupid.  
<P>Alongside the illustration of the humble nematode, all the papers have featured similar drawings of a homo sapiens - though the human in the Sun had bigger breasts. The other creature that was analysed was the fruit fly. It turns out that these have around 13,000 genes, which sounds like more than they need. You'd have thought there were only two pieces of information you needed to give a fruit fly: 1) You fly. 2) You like fruit. And then simplest of all was yeast with 6,000 genes which was only analysed so they could make the French scientist taste Marmite.  
<P>Whereas we humans, we're so clever, surely we must have millions and millions of genes? Not so apparently, we   only have five times more than the yeast and the scientists tell us that we only need 11% of those. The rest are all junk apparently, although I would be reluctant to throw them out just yet.  
<P>The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that if less information is genetically inherited, then more of our behaviour must be determined by social factors. So now we know - there is no gene that says you'll have a liking for the Bay City Rollers and tartan flares; it's because you grew up in Scotland in the 70s. There's nothing in the male's genetic make-up that   instructs him to leave two bits of sweetcorn at the bottom of the sink after he's washed up. There is no female gene that makes her want to have a taste of everyone else's pudding. Most of our behaviour is acquired. People who say that our behaviour is predetermined only say that because their mum and dad did. The nature versus nurture question is as old as human society itself (unless it's even older and we inherited the debate from a bunch of precocious gorillas).  
<P> But now the balance has shifted irreversibly in favour of those who believe that people are the same all over the world. The multimillion dollar genome research project has reached the same conclusion as the lyrics of Ebony and Ivory. It is, of course, a left versus right issue. Conservative politics are based on the philosophy that people just are the way   they are, and that it's their own fault if they don't do more with their lives.  
<P>George Bush is president because he worked harder and was more brilliant than some black woman who grew up in a one-parent family in Detroit - end of story. If you believe people are born good or bad or clever or stupid then there is no point in trying to change the world. The Australian penal colonies were founded on the belief that there was simply a criminal class who begat more criminals and if they could all be exported then crime would disappear from society.  
<P>The idea got a huge cheer at the 1800 Conservative party conference, though it would probably be considered a bit liberal today. If it were true then modern day Sydney would still be full of people stealing silk handkerchiefs and singing "You've gotta pick a pocket or two!" In reality only parts of it are like that.   
<P>Irrespective of how many genes we have, the genome project has confirmed what many of us had instinctively known for a very long time; that nurture counts for more than nature. The debate is over for ever; clearly the worm just wriggles around in mud all day because he just never got the breaks in life.  
<P>But at a time when the fate of all the creatures on the planet depends on us, a little humility would not do humankind any harm, even if it's hard to accept that we have so much in common with such a basic life form as yeast. After all what has yeast ever done? It just reproduces in enormous numbers, consumes everything within its environment and then finally poisons itself with the toxins it has produced. You could hardly imagine us humans ever doing anything so stupid.
