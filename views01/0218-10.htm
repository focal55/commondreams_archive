One of my favorite scenes in best picture nominee "Traffic" shows Michael Douglas, who plays America's new drug czar, trying to learn quickly the details of his job. He's on an airplane surrounded by top aides. 
<p>
Who's responsible for treatment, he asks. After an awkward pause, one says, "uh, no one, sir." 
<p>
It's a movie filled with ugly truths about drugs in America. This is one of them - in the War on Drugs, treatment is an afterthought. 
<p>
That may be about to change. Finally, pop culture and mainstream media are reflecting what many ordinary folks have been saying for years - local, state and federal drug policies are seriously flawed. 
<p>
Last week, in a report on fighting addiction, Newsweek magazine captured that sentiment, calling it an American epiphany, a nation that now believes "perhaps the only way to win the drug war is to do more to treat its victims." 
<p>
In this state, law-enforcement officials and legislators in both parties have heard the message and seem ready to embrace reforms in drug laws. 
<p>
Tomorrow in Olympia, King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng will lead a delegation in support of reduced sentences for certain drug offenders and, most significant, a shift of state dollars from prisons to treatment.
<p>
Maleng is no radical reformer. He is cautious and pragmatic and a tiny bit defensive. In a recent conversation, Maleng recalled the Omnibus Drug Act of 1989. "In 12 years, we've been successful with law enforcement. We controlled crime against neighborhoods, but nothing else happened." 
<p>
"Drug addiction," he said, "is a terrible tragedy. The question is, can we be more effective?" 
<p>
The answer is, Yes. 
<p>
A fifth of this state's inmates are jailed primarily on drug charges. That's the largest single category of the prison population. Additionally, many property crimes are committed by addicts supporting their habit. Not all will respond to treatment, but many will. Treatment is costly, but reformers, including Maleng, are right to argue that it makes more sense to spend money to treat an addict than to lock him up. 
<p>
Proposals now before the Legislature to reduce sentences and shift money from lock-up to treatment are too little, too late for those threatening a ballot initiative that would go farther, faster. 
<p>
Unfortunately, Maleng and legislators are in somewhat of a reactive mode on this issue. But better to react to the threat than to the reality of bad new law that swings too far in the opposite direction, which is what has happened in California. 
<p>
Voters there approved Proposition 36 last fall. It sentences drug offenders to treatment rather than prison. Typical of many initiatives, it is overly simplistic in its approach and totally unaffordable. 
<p>
Haven't we had enough of bad law by initiative in this state? The serious, bipartisan effort now going on in Olympia is a significant bend in the road, away from costly failures and omissions of the tough-on-crime era.
<p>
And speaking of omissions, what about prevention? Two weeks ago, I wrote about research that shows carefully designed prevention programs can be successful in keeping young people away from drugs. Linwood Carlson runs the student assistance program for Seattle Public Schools. He wrote to tell me that, according to an independent evaluator, prevention programs in Seattle schools also are working. 
<p>
Like all successful prevention programs, it is comprehensive, intensive and persistent. The Seattle approach involves students in peer mediation, parents, community professionals and school staff.
<p>
Carlson's letter was one more reminder that if treatment has been an afterthought in the war on drugs, prevention has not even been in the battle plan.
<p>
Yet, research shows that just as drug addiction is treatable, drug use is preventable. 
<p>
All this means that even if drug laws are reformed this session along the lines Maleng and others propose, much work remains in the battle against drug use and its corrosive effects on our communities. There is no hope of real progress, let alone victory, unless prevention is an integral part of the strategy.
