As police fired rubber bullets through tear gas in Quebec City, 
many reporters echoed the claim that "free trade" promotes democracy. 
Meanwhile, protesters struggled to shed light on a key fact: The proposed 
hemispheric trade pact would give large corporations even more power to 
override laws that have been enacted -- democratically -- to protect the 
environment, labor and human rights.

        <p> Newsweek responded to the turmoil at the Summit of the Americas 
with a column by Fareed Zakaria, a favorite policy analyst in elite 
circles. He declared that "the anti-globalization crowd is antidemocratic 
... trying to achieve, through intimidation and scare tactics, what it has 
not been able to get through legislation." In recent decades, of course, 
the same was said about cutting-edge demonstrations for such causes as 
civil rights, peace in Vietnam and environmental safeguards.

         <p>Protests against the likes of the World Trade Organization, and 
now the Free Trade Area of the Americas, have great impact because they 
resonate widely. Foes of global corporatization are speaking and acting on 
behalf of huge grassroots constituencies.

         <p>The ABC television program "This Week" deigned to air a discussion 
with a real-live progressive activist, Lori Wallach of Public Citizen's 
Global Trade Watch. Journalist Cokie Roberts voiced befuddlement: "It's 
gotten to the point where any time there are global meetings, world leaders 
meeting, we have a sense that the protesters are going to be there, and 
there's not much sense of exactly what you're protesting." The interview 
only lasted a couple of minutes.

         <p>Most news outlets showed little interest in the content of 
alternative forums in Quebec City that drew thousands of activists from all 
over the hemisphere. Likewise, a big march in the city, with some estimates 
ranging above 60,000 participants, got underwhelming coverage. For that 
matter, most reporters didn't seem very deeply interested in the several 
thousand people who bravely engaged in militant, nonviolent direct action 
-- risking and sometimes sustaining injuries from police assaults -- while 
confronting the official summit.

         <p>What did get plenty of media attention was noted at the outset of 
the April 24 lead editorial in the Wall Street Journal, which yearned for 
"a world where TV cameras prefer trade agreements to black-clad 
anarchists." Some of those few "black-clad anarchists" call themselves the 
Black Bloc.

         <p>Routinely slipping by, with scant journalistic scrutiny, is what 
we could dub the "White Bloc" -- a nexus of immense media power serving 
corporate interests.

         <p>The White Bloc is not monolithic. But on the issue of "free 
trade," it's difficult to find a major U.S. publication that does not 
editorially support accords like NAFTA, WTO and the new FTAA.

         <p>The Wall Street Journal's editorial page, at the right edge of the 
Bloc, is much honored by the media establishment. Last year, Journal 
columnist Paul Gigot won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary. This year, in 
mid-April, the same award went to another very conservative columnist for 
the newspaper, Dorothy Rabinowitz. But it's the unheralded daily output of 
the White Bloc that can be most breathtaking.

         <p>On the day Rabinowitz's prize was announced, for instance, the 
editorial page of the Wall Street Journal featured a freelance article that 
began this way: "In the early 1990s, America's major cities were on 
life-support, suffocating under socialistic policies that left them looking 
like Soviet-bloc relics." (It was not a humor piece, by the way.) Farther 
down the page was a column headlined "The Monarchy Is Worth Saving," 
written by the Journal's deputy editorial features editor, who earnestly 
argued that British citizens need their monarchy "as a source of authority."

         <p>But the White Bloc has a liberal side, too. Several New York Times 
columnists take turns condemning those who have the gall to stand in the 
way of corporate Progress.

         <p>Free-marketeers at the Times know how to pound away at the same 
line. While heads of state prepared to leave the Quebec summit, Paul 
Krugman ended his column by writing that the protesters "are doing their 
best to make the poor even poorer." Two days later, Thomas Friedman 
concluded his column by explaining that "these 'protesters' should be 
called by their real name: The Coalition to Keep Poor People Poor."

         <p>The White Bloc (which includes people of all colors if suitably 
conformist) has its own forms of hip solidarity. On the "Hardball" national 
TV program, airing on both MSNBC and CNBC, host Chris Matthews closed his 
April 18 interview with Friedman exactly this way:

         <p>Matthews: "You are the future, my man. Thomas Friedman of the New 
York Times."

         <p>Friedman: "Thanks, bro."

         <p>Matthews: "The smartest columnist in the world."
<p><i>Norman Solomon's latest book is "The Habits of Highly Deceptive Media." His 
syndicated column focuses on media and politics.</i>
