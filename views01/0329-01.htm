My idea of a better-ordered world is one in which medical discoveries would 
be free of patents and there would be no profiteering from life or death. </i>- Indira Ghandi
<P>Decisions on how and where our genetic information will be used rest in the 
hands of those hoping to profit from a mutation or two.
<P>The 10 largest drug companies last year collected $179 billion, of which 
$121 billion was in gross profit. And now, drug companies are lobbying to 
wrest our DNA from the realm of private property into their own proprietary 
databanks.
<P>The loss of hegemony over our DNA is perhaps the least visible and most 
insidious new direction of the genetic revolution. In fact, the drug companies 
and partnering biotechnology information companies would love nothing more 
than for the public to continue to be caught up in discussions of cloning and 
its implications while legislative clauses claiming genetic material as 
private property get wiped from the books.
<P>After all, personalized biotechnology-oriented drugs have a seductive ring 
and seem tame in comparison to visions of reproductive cloning. And, while we 
fidget with creating policies to rein in human reproductive cloning, drug 
companies and insurance companies are hammering out legislation to protect 
their interests - your DNA.
<P>
<P>Who Will Really Profit?
<P>The average voter has not heard of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and 
Researchers of America (PhRMA). This association includes all of the major 
drug manufacturers. It has one lobbyist for every two members of Congress. 
Before we pass this industry off as insignificant, recall that pharmaceutical 
profits have soared 36 percent in the past two years, making it the most 
profitable industry in the United States.
<P>This group ostensibly promotes the patenting and researching of DNA-based 
drugs. But behind the scenes, it quietly champions the removal of the last 
vestiges of legislation associating individual property rights with our DNA.
<P>Making certain the biotech gold rush remains uncluttered with regulatory 
complexities and potential pitfalls, PhRMA has been working overtime to assist 
state lawmakers with language for new "genetic privacy" bills.
<P>
<P>Legislative Jeopardy
<P>Take the case of a bill sitting before the Oregon Senate Judiciary 
Committee headed by Republican Sen. John Minnis. SB114 is considered by PhRMA 
and other research-based organizations as critical to protecting the future of 
gene-based pharmaceutical commercialization. This bill imposes civil and 
criminal penalties for violations of "genetic privacy," establishes research 
procedures and creates a genetic privacy advisory committee.
<P>As praiseworthy as these objectives might be, the Oregon bill would amend a 
prior genetic privacy bill, effectively removing all of the areas which had 
declared DNA and personal genetic material to be individual property.
<P>Oregon is one of a handful of states with bills retaining the idea that 
genetic information and DNA samples are the property of the individual.
<P>When I spoke with Scott Manchester of Oregon's Office for Health Plan 
Policy and Research, who had a key role in the development of the new bill, he 
said the waiving of property rights was the consequence of a "concerned 
research community."
<P>Manchester specifically mentioned PhRMA as lobbying for the deletion of 
property rights because it would make commercializing and exploiting 
biotechnology-derived pharmaceutical products more difficult.
<P>Robert Koler, a retired researcher from Oregon Health Sciences University, 
has also been involved in supporting SB114. He confirmed that PhRMA has been 
paying for the lobbying efforts to have the private property clause removed. 
They see it not as an impediment to the research as much as an obstacle to the 
commercialization of future blockbuster biotechnology-based drugs.
<P>Koler mentioned that in the eyes of the drug companies, having a private 
property clause on the Oregon books is akin to having a lien on your house. 
Drug companies may actually have to share profits if valuable genetic material 
is used as the basis for a pharmaceutical.
<P>If bills like SB114 are successful, they may force us to make a Faustian 
bargain. They may accelerate the commercialization of products from 
bioengineering discoveries while requiring us to cede any claim to the roots 
of our own individuality.
<P>The very basis for our uniqueness and complexity will no longer belong to 
us, but instead will become raw material which can be extracted and exploited 
for corporate gain.
<P>If we are going to begin to commercialize our living genetic material, 
should not all parties be able to partake in the gold rush?
