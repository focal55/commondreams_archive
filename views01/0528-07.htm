Memorial Day will be celebrated ... by the usual betrayal of the dead,
 by the hypocritical patriotism of the politicians and contractors
 preparing for more wars, more graves to receive more flowers on future
 Memorial Days. The memory of the dead deserves a different dedication. To
 peace, to defiance of governments.

<p>In 1974, I was invited by Tom Winship, the editor of the Boston Globe,
 who had been bold enough in 1971 to print part of the top secret
 Pentagon Papers on the history of the Vietnam War, to write a bi-weekly
 column for the op-ed page of the newspaper. I did that for about a year and
 a half. The column below appeared June 2, 1976, in connection with that
 year's Memorial Day. After it appeared, my column was canceled.
<p align="center"> * * * * * 


<p>Memorial Day will be celebrated as usual, by high-speed collisions of
 automobiles and bodies strewn on highways and the sound of ambulance
 sirens throughout the land.

<p>It will also be celebrated by the display of flags, the sound of bugles and
 drums, by parades and speeches and unthinking applause.

<p>It will be celebrated by giant corporations, which make guns, bombs,
 fighter planes, aircraft carriers and an endless assortment of military
junk
 and which await the $100 billion in contracts to be approved soon by
 Congress and the President.

<p>There was a young woman in New Hampshire who refused to allow her
 husband, killed in Vietnam, to be given a military burial. She rejected the
 hollow ceremony ordered by those who sent him and 50,000 others to their
 deaths. Her courage should be cherished on Memorial Day. There were the B52
 pilots who refused to fly those last vicious raids of Nixon's and
 Kissinger's war. Have any of the great universities, so quick to give
 honorary degrees to God-knows-whom, thought to honor those men at this
 Commencement time, on this Memorial Day?

<p>No politician who voted funds for war, no business contractor for the
 military, no general who ordered young men into battle, no FBI man who
 spied on anti-war activities, should be invited to public ceremonies on
this
 sacred day. Let the dead of past wars he honored. Let those who live pledge
 themselves never to embark on mass slaughter again.
<p>"The shell had his number on it. The blood ran into the ground...Where
 his chest ought to have been they pinned the Congressional Medal, the
 DSC, the Medaille Militaire, the Belgian Croix de Guerre, the Italian gold
 medal, The Vitutea Militara sent by Queen Marie of Rumania. All the
 Washingtonians brought flowers .. Woodrow Wilson brought a bouquet of
 poppies."

<p>Those are the concluding lines of John Dos Passos angry novel 1919. Let us
 honor him on Memorial Day.

<p>And also Thoreau, who went to jail to protest the Mexican War.

<p>And Mark Twain, who denounced our war against the Filipinos at the turn of
 the century.

<p>And I.F. Stone, who virtually alone among newspaper editors exposed the
 fraud and brutality of the Korean War.

<p>Let us honor Martin Luther King, who refused the enticements of the
 White House, and the cautions of associates, and thundered against the
 war in Vietnam.

<p>Memorial Day should be a day for putting flowers on graves and planting
 trees. Also, for destroying the weapons of death that endanger us more than
 they protect us, that waste our resources and threaten our children and
 grandchildren.

<p>On Memorial Day we should take note that, in the name of "defense," our
 taxes have been used to spend a quarter of a billion dollars on a
 helicopter assault ship called "the biggest floating lemon," which was
 accepted by the Navy although it had over 2,000 major defects at the
 time of its trial cruise.

<p>Meanwhile, there is such a shortage of housing that millions live in
 dilapidated sections of our cities and millions more are forced to pay
 high rents or high interest rates on their mortgages. There's 90 billion
for
 the B1 bomber, but people don't have money to pay hospital bills.

<p>We must be practical, say those whose practicality has consisted of a
 war every generation. We mustn't deplete our defenses. Say those who
 have depleted our youth, stolen our resources. In the end, it is living
 people, not corpses, creative energy, not destructive rage, which are our
 only real defense, not just against other governments trying to kill us,
but
 against our own, also trying to kill us.

<p>Let us not set out, this Memorial Day, on the same old drunken ride to
 death.
