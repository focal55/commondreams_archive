E.J. Dionne Jr., who some years back penned a brilliant book titled, 
              &quot;Why Americans Hate Politics,&quot; joined me for a round of 
              visits to election night parties Tuesday. And I think it&#146;s 
              fair to say he found a lot to love in the way Madison does politics.
<P>Dionne, who earlier in the day had delivered the University of 
              Wisconsin School of Journalism&#146;s Nafzinger Lecture, enjoys 
              election nights, as any good political reporter does. And we had 
              a fine night, running into likely candidates for governor -- Attorney 
              General Jim Doyle and Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk -- dozens 
              of state and local officials, labor leaders and a healthy cross-section 
              of Madison political characters.</P>
<P>Dionne was appropriately intrigued by <a href="http://www.newparty.org/pd/Home.html">Progressive Dane&#146;s</a> party 
              at the Orpheum Theatre. What better place to get a taste of Madison&#146;s 
              distinctive politics than at a victory party for what may well be 
              the most successful homegrown political party in the United States?</P>
<P>As outgoing District 5 Ald. Jose Sentmanat told Dionne, &quot;This 
              is a great night for PD.&quot; Every single Progressive Dane-endorsed 
              candidate won, and the party/movement flexed its electoral muscle 
              as never before. In the city&#146;s three most tightly contested 
              City Council races, Progressive Dane-endorsed candidates -- newcomers 
              Brenda Konkel in the 2nd, Jessy Tolkan in the 5th and Todd Jarrell 
              in the 8th -- easily prevailed over contenders of more moderate 
              Democratic or Republican stripes. Those wins mean that Progressive 
              Dane now has eight council members who are committed to its activist 
              social and economic justice agenda -- a record total.</P>
<P>Especially satisfying for Progressive Dane was Jarrell&#146;s landslide 
              victory over incumbent Ald. Mike Staude in the student-dominated 
              8th. Staude got himself in a load of trouble with the PD crew by 
              cozying up to bar owners, landlords and other business interests. 
              This spring, Staude threw everything he had at Jarrell, including 
              last-minute ads attacking the challenger for having backed Green 
              Ralph Nader over Al Gore in last fall&#146;s election. But Progressive 
              Dane, which has been working closely with the Greens, countered 
              with a grass-roots, issue-oriented campaign that dispatched Staude 
              by a 2-1 margin.</P>
<P>Progressive Dane also played a critical role in electing Shwaw 
              Vang to the Madison School Board. Vang, the first Hmong to win local 
              elected office, faced an equally able and appealing opponent, Teresa 
              Tellez-Giron. In a contest between a pair of newcomers with little 
              money, the dozens of Progressive Dane activists who delivered more 
              than 25,000 Vang leaflets to doors across town have to be seen as 
              a critical factor in the race -- as was the presence of Progressive 
              Dane stalwart and all-around good guy Andy Heidt as Vang&#146;s 
              campaign manager.</P>
<P>As Dionne said when we walked away from the Orpheum, &quot;There&#146;s 
              so much talk about how young people are disengaged from politics, 
              but here you&#146;ve got all these people in their 20s working on 
              campaigns, running campaigns.&quot; Dionne wondered whether the 
              Madison model for independent progressive politics could be reproduced 
              nationally.</P>
<P>He&#146;s a good journalist and that&#146;s a good question. There&#146;s 
              no doubt that unique political factors -- a progressive tradition, 
              a highly energized multigenerational activist community, a large 
              student population -- have aided Progressive Dane&#146;s rise. But 
              similar groups allied with the New Party have made breakthroughs 
              in Missoula, Little Rock and other towns; the Greens are in charge 
              of Santa Monica and several other California cities; Vermont&#146;s 
              independent Progressive Party is dominant in Burlington. In addition, 
              left-wing Democrats are pushing the limits of their party in San 
              Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Minneapolis and dozens of smaller 
              cities.</P>
<P>I am convinced that issue-based, grass-roots progressive politics 
              represent a vital force in American politics -- posing a serious 
              and necessary challenge to the rightward drift of the national Democratic 
              Party. And I&#146;m glad I got a chance to show one of the finest 
              political writers in the country how that force is reshaping Madison 
              politics.
