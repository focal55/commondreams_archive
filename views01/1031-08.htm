Most of us over the age of forty can remember the old television show about 
the Lone Ranger, who galloped along on his white horse followed by his 
sidekick, Tonto. The Lone Ranger always knew who the good guys were and 
where the bad guys hung out, and he always managed to arrive just in the 
nick of time. He always saved the girl -- or the farm, the cattle or the 
pioneers -- and then modestly refusing gratitude, he rode off into the 
sunset as someone inevitably asked, 'Who was that masked man?'

<p>The Lone Ranger was just a character in a long-outdated TV show. And yet 
there are parallels between that fictional character and our own country's 
behavior in the international community.  We speak and act as though other 
nations were our sidekicks or followers, with nothing to offer us but their 
admiration. We seem sure of where the line divides the good guys from the 
bad guys, and we think we know how to deal with the bad guys, no matter what 
anyone else might say. We ourselves are never the bad guys, no matter what 
suffering might come from our actions.  We ride off into the sunset and 
rarely look back to find out how the story ends, as the dust from our action 
finally settles.

<p>At a time when we need friends in the world as never before, it has been 
shocking to hear again the voice of the Lone Ranger, instructing the other 
countries of the world that they are either with us or against us. Despite 
warnings and pleas from nations with far more knowledge of the religious and 
political realities, we have gone into Afghanistan in what appears to be the 
only way we know how: something akin to trying to kill a hornet swarm with a 
submachine gun.


<p>We need to tell the truth about our bombing campaign in Afghanistan. There 
is nothing left in that devastated country to use as a target for our 
enormous weapons. Our top-of-the-line smart bombs have been dropped on the 
same Red Cross relief station twice, and each day brings the wretched news 
of   children, women and noncombatant men killed.

<p>Fighting terrorists is like fighting ghosts: they are never where we are 
aiming; they seem to come out of the walls and floors we had believed were 
solid, and they slip away only to reappear when we least expect it. And like 
ghosts, terrorists can be born of the dead. In the unlikely event that we 
actually kill Osama bin Laden, he is likely to prove more powerful an 
inspiration dead than he has been alive.

<p>Here is a hard truth most of the rest of the world has known for a long 
time:  there is no absolute safety. There is no way to be sure, finally and 
forever, that someone will not do us harm. We will not become safe if we 
sanction racial profiling or throw out of our country everyone who comes 
from the Middle East. We will not become safe by whittling away at our civil 
liberties, increasing police powers and quietly stifling doubt and dissent. 
We certainly won't become safe through the blatant corporate give-aways 
being arranged right now as slippery, cynical attachments to new defense 
spending. And we will not become safe by bombing Afghanistan.

<p>But there are things we can do to become safer. Right at the top of the list 
is the choice to relinquish our lovely fictions about being the world's Lone 
Ranger. There is nothing we can do that has consequences only for ourselves; 
we share a very small stage, and there is no sunset into which the Lone 
Ranger can ride. The intimacy brought about by our permeable borders and 
merged economies calls us toward a democracy we've been reluctant to 
practice outside our borders, however jealously we've guarded it within 
them.  Democracy listens intently to the voices of all concerned, in order 
to discern the wise course of action through the collective wisdom.

<p>The current collective wisdom has been trying urgently to tell us that Osama 
bin Laden  is more important as an idea than he is as a person. As an idea, 
he will live and multiply if we do precisely what we are doing right now. At 
other times in our history, we have understood the wisdom of combating a bad 
or destructive idea with a better one, and there are some better ideas out 
there than bombing an already devastated land. The United Nations  estimates 
that well over seven million Afghan refugees are now in danger of death by 
starvation and exposure. Seven million beating hearts, each singular, 
frightened one of them connected to us by what we do or fail to do.

<p>What might happen in the seething refugee camps and angry cities of Pakistan 
if we immediately stopped the bombing and poured our efforts into food and 
shelter for these seven million souls? Maybe the ghosts of terrorism would 
begin to starve, as we, their putative enemy, fed the living while it was 
still possible, clothed the naked, gave shelter and care to the sick.  At 
the very least we would know we were acting out of the soul of our soul, 
living up to who we believe ourselves to be. And if we did it well, surely 
we would see the ranks of the terrorists begin to dwindle:  it is hard to 
demonize those who save the life of your child.

<p>We are the most powerful nation in the world, economically and militarily. 
No nation in the world disputes that strength. But in our national soul of 
souls, we have never believed that we should lead other nations merely 
because we're the strongest; that is the leadership of the bully and the 
despot. Power does not equal authority, and what we really yearn for is 
authority: the leadership that is born of wisdom under fire and goodness 
that sees beyond our own self-interest.   Such wisdom and goodness are born 
from acting in the world as though we know we share it with everyone else.
