Propaganda - most simply, 
      information used to persuade a group - is as old as civilization. The 
      Aztecs used it to rationalize human sacrifice. Alexander the Great 
      understood its symbolic power and had his image etched on coins. 
      
<P></P>
But propaganda has always been most crucial during periods of 
      conflict and war. 
      
<P></P>
So today, with advertising and other forms of modern persuasion 
      ubiquitous, how do leaders slice through the muddled cacophony and target 
      citizens with messages? 
      
<P></P>
"The whole notion of propaganda now is up for grabs," says Robert 
      Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University. "In this age of 24-hour news 
      and spin, where there is constant coverage, propaganda has come out of the 
      closet and it really lives among us every day." 
      
<P></P>
If Thompson is right, what does this mean to the "War Against 
      Terrorism," which seems to be moving toward a more active phase in 
      Afghanistan this week? 
      
<P></P>
Unlike past military efforts, the White House has warned the new 
      war will unfold with "unprecedented secrecy." Though it's now a cliché, it 
      is important to remember truth is often the first casualty of war. 
      
<P></P>
Ironically, says Thomas DeLuca, a political science professor at 
      Fordham University in New York, the sheer magnitude of the Sept. 11 
      terrorist attacks created a temporary "propaganda-free zone" because 
      people were simply horrified by the visceral images. 
      
<P></P>
For days there were no television commercials. Almost all news 
      coverage was devoted to the story. The entire world seemed to collapse 
      into the deepening tragedy. 
      
<P></P>
"This is an unprecedented event in U.S. history," DeLuca says. 
      "There has never been an attack like this. Concentration on this event is 
      highly focused. People want the president to have a plan, to reassure 
      them, to be straightforward. 
      
<P></P>
"So George Bush will have an enormous benefit as his words cut 
      through the propaganda that is usually around us." 
      
<P></P>
Anthony Pratkanis, professor of psychology at the University of 
      California in Santa Cruz, and author of <I>Age Of Propaganda: The Everyday 
      Use And Abuse Of Persuasion</I>, agrees. But he says in the weeks ahead, 
      as collective shock begins to ebb, Bush will be faced with a number of 
      daunting challenges. "If Bush wants to maintain and sustain the effort, 
      the emotional propaganda will be okay for a short war, but in the long 
      term he needs to deliver persuasion. He needs to form consensus and argue 
      with substance, not slogan." 
      
<P></P>
That seemed to be the case recently, as Bush addressed U.S. 
      Congress. As cameras rolled and politicians and lawmakers frequently 
      wobbled to their feet, and to thundering applause, Bush delivered a 
      rousing, evocative speech. 
      
<P></P>
But the raw emotion and patriotism that has since bloomed atop the 
      rubble in New York and Washington is not necessarily beneficial to anybody 
      in the long run, says Nancy Snow, assistant director with the Center for 
      Communications and Community at UCLA. "A `war mentality' needs to be 
      decontextualized. It needs to be very clear, black and white, good guys 
      versus bad guys," says Snow, author of <I>Propaganda Inc.: Selling 
      America's Culture To The World</I>. 
      
<P></P>
"So you end up with a single enemy, with slogans like `Wanted: Dead 
      or Alive,' ones that simplify the issues. Bush is using an `everyman' 
      approach to what is actually a very complex problem, burdensome in a 
      historical and economic context." 
      
<P></P>
And this simplification, whether deliberate or not, can cloud 
      fundamental issues. In times of conflict, things are not always as they 
      appear. 
      
<P></P>
Before the Persian Gulf War, for example, the world gasped with 
      reports that Iraqi troops were yanking sick babies from hospital 
      incubators and leaving them to die on the floor during the invasion of 
      Kuwait. The "dead babies" account was repeated hundreds of times, in the 
      media and in speeches by U.S. leaders, who were now clearly on a war 
      footing. Other reports - that Iraq had amassed thousands of troops along 
      the Saudi Arabia border - were also used to convince the public that 
      military action was necessary. 
      
<P></P>
Both of those reports proved incorrect, but not until the war was 
      over. 
      
<P></P>
Larry Jacobs, a political science professor at the University of 
      Minnesota, says the Persian Gulf War took traditional propaganda to a new 
      level as U.S. authorities controlled the flow of information in the media 
      and expanded the lexicon of military euphemisms. Cruise missiles. Smart 
      bombs. Collateral damage. Safe bunkers. Hard targets. Hit ratios. Surgical 
      strikes. To western television viewers, the war must have appeared 
      essentially bloodless. 
      
<P></P>
John R. MacArthur, publisher of <I>Harper's</I> magazine and author 
      of <I>Second Front: Censorship And Propaganda In The Gulf War</I>, says he 
      believes the war on terrorism will unfold with even more secrecy and 
      censorship. "Already we have a kind of `ahistoricality' setting in," he 
      explains. "Nobody here is talking about some very important issues. You're 
      simply not allowed to discuss the history of American foreign policy." 
      
<P></P>
Such discussions are seen as unseemly, morally ambiguous, and 
      steeped in preposterous and offensive anti-Americanism. The issue, to 
      many, is simple good versus evil. 
      
<P></P>
Says Jacobs: "The whole notion of propaganda raises a larger 
      question: How do you control and manage press reports and the information 
      that is reaching the general public?" 
      
<P></P>
During the uprising in Germany, as the Nazis gained power, Josef 
      Goebbels was able to impart nationalist rhetoric and manufacture consent 
      through selective advertising, state-produced films, and elaborate, 
      orchestrated public events. (Adolf Hitler also asked Leni Reifenstahl to 
      film the Nazi Party's annual rally in Nuremburg. Her film, <I>Triumph Of 
      The Will</I>, is now considered a seminal exercise in fascist propaganda.) 

      
<P></P>
Decades later, Slobodan Milosevic created "demo networks" - ragtag 
      groups of unemployed youth that would optically boost the size at rallies 
      held for Serbian nationalism. 
      
<P></P>
More recently, Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile U.S. Authorities 
      are calling the prime suspect in the recent attacks, has filmed several 
      training videos. As tools of propaganda, the grainy, disjointed footage is 
      used to mollify moderates and recruit new soldiers for the Holy War. 
      (During its bloody war with Russia, Afghan rebels were given camcorders to 
      record their triumphs.) 
      
<P></P>
In totalitarian states, persuasion is straightforward. Citizens are 
      simply told what to believe and how to behave. But in democratic nations, 
      governance has nuance, inextricably tethered to divergent principles of 
      individual freedom and mass control. 
      
<P></P>
As scholar Noam Chomsky says: "Propaganda is to democracy what 
      violence is to totalitarianism." 
      
<P></P>
In this context, says Pratkanis, where propaganda is concerned, 
      governments realize the importance of the media. "The mass media is now 
      the primary place where we have political discussions. So one of the keys 
      to effective political leadership is being able to control the news 
      media's agenda. That agenda is not necessarily <I>how </I>you are talking 
      about something, but <I>what</I> you are talking about." 
      
<P></P>
In the war against terrorism, he says, there have been a number of 
      examples where U.S. Authorities announced, "they were planning to release" 
      certain information in the future. This allows the media to run a story 
      about the "future release" of information, rather than the information 
      itself. 
      
<P></P>
"This war will be a challenge for democracy itself," Pratkanis 
      predicts. "Because democracy thrives when everything is in the light of 
      day. Now democracy in the United States will require a high degree of 
      trust." 
      
<P></P>
And trust is a commodity in rapid decline. The Internet, decades of 
      independent research, and the rapid evolution of alternative media has 
      created a population that is much more sophisticated in its ability to 
      recognize and decipher propaganda - irrespective of the source. 
      
<P></P>
"Audiences throughout the world are constantly becoming more 
      exposed to the latest in international mass media entertainment, they are 
      better trained, more aware, often more cynical," notes Oliver Thomson, 
      author of <I>Easily Led: A History of Propaganda</I>. 
      
<P></P>
Randall Bytwerk, a professor of communication at Calvin College in 
      Michigan, author and a foremost expert in propaganda, says: "Propaganda, 
      and the control of public opinion, becomes harder when you lack control 
      over the images." 
      
<P></P>
This proved to be the case in Vietnam, where public support 
      suddenly dipped as the horrifying images of war were broadcast back home. 
      "Vietnam was a turning point because there were reporters all over the 
      place," Bytwerk says. 
      
<P></P>
In the stormy, post-Vietnam years, the U.S. has taken a cautious 
      approach to war. (In fact, the number of firefighters and police offices 
      who died during rescue efforts at the World Trade Center is more than the 
      total military personnel who have fallen in combat since the 1983 invasion 
      of Grenada.) 
      
<P></P>
Given the global scope of the new war, and the potential 
      repercussions, Garth Jowett, a communication professor at University of 
      Houston, says Bush has to be very careful in the propaganda he uses. "I 
      fully expected a propaganda onslaught that was going to be totally 
      irrational. But as I understand it, there was an internal conflict within 
      the Bush administration in terms of what kind of message to give the 
      American public." 
      
<P></P>
Jowett says many people have compared the attacks with Pearl 
      Harbor. But the analogy is problematic. In that case, there was a clear 
      nation-state enemy. And it's important to remember, he adds, that most 
      Americans did not see footage of the Japanese attack for almost a year. 
      
<P></P>
"In terms of propaganda, those visual images (of planes striking 
      the World Trade Center) could not be matched by any other imaginable 
      images," says John Lampe, chair of the Department of History at the 
      University of Maryland. "In fact, if there is any propaganda campaign at 
      play at all, it is to prevent the violent, stereotypical response we have 
      seen domestically in the past." 
      
<P></P>
Lampe is referring to the threats and attacks that have been 
      leveled at Arab-Americans and Muslims throughout North America. The 
      violence, including suspected murder, has raised the specter of the 
      Japanese internment camps during World War II. 
      
<P></P>
As Jowett notes: "Bush has to maintain the public's confidence that 
      the government will actually do something. But he also doesn't want to get 
      the public so riled up so that they are running out murdering their own 
      citizens." 
      
<P></P>
And as Bush said during his speech to Congress: "I also want to 
      speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world. We respect your 
      faith. It's practiced freely by many millions of Americans and by millions 
      more in countries that America counts as friends." 
      
<P></P>
First Lady Laura Bush went on <I>60 Minutes </I>recently to discuss 
      the importance of solidarity and urge Americans to not attack their fellow 
      citizens. And during the recent celebrity telethon, <I>America: A Tribute 
      To Heroes</I>, a number of stars, including Will Smith and Muhammad Ali, 
      urged tolerance. 
      
<P></P>
Similarly, this week, U.S. Authorities have scrambled with messages 
      about the safety of air travel - even though Ronald Reagan Washington 
      National Airport has remained closed (it will open partially tomorrow). 
      And a number of experts have also started appearing on television telling 
      Americans their country is prepared for any biological attack, even though 
      other non-government sources warn the opposite is true. 
      
<P></P>
"We are an action oriented culture," Snow says. "We are not an 
      introspective culture. 
      
<P></P>
``And that's where the sloganeering and jingoism comes into play. 
      
<P></P>
``We are almost given a script and walking papers in terms of how 
      we are supposed to respond."
