Americans have had the feeling
for quite a while now that pharmaceutical companies are sticking it to them.
<p>Faced with accusations of price-gouging, Big Pharma’s refrain
has been, We need to make huge
profits because we spend so much
on research and development. The
industry tells us that were it not
for its beneficent R&D, which they
fund with those big profits, we
might never have seen some of the
drugs that have saved lives and
improved our quality of life.
<p>What they don’t say is what a
report a couple of years ago by the
Congressional Joint Economic
Committee pointed out: that several of the most important drugs
developed since the mid-’60s—
including Tamoxifin (for breast
cancer), AZT (for AIDS), Taxol
(for cancer), Prozac (for clinical
depression) and Capoten (for
hypertension)—were created
with the help of federally funded
research.
<p>They also don’t tell you what the
healthcare advocacy group Families USA reported last week: that
drug manufacturers spend twice
as much on advertising, marketing and administration as they
do on R&D.
<p>A close look at the 2000 annual
reports of the nine leading pharmaceutical companies revealed
information quite embarrassing
to Big Pharma. Families USA
discovered that industry giant
Merck & Co., which had $40.4
billion in net sales last year,
allocated 15 percent of its total
revenue to advertising, marketing
and administration costs, and a
mere 6 percent to R&D.
<p>BristolMyers Squibb Co., meanwhile, set aside 30 percent of total
revenue for marketing, advertising and administrative expenses, and 11 percent for developing
new or improved medications.
The two firms also racked up
net profits that more than doubled
their R&D budgets.
<p>The Families USA report
caused the drug industry to once
again repeat the argument that
record-breaking profits actually
serve the greater good. “When the
pharmaceutical industry does
well, patients do even better,” one
PR flack said.
<p>No one can deny that Big
Pharma is doing well these days.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers
represent the most profitable
sector of U.S. industry, according
to Families USA. Profit margins
for drug makers were four times
that of the average Fortune 500
company in 2000.
<p>But those fat profits aren’t
doing much to help older Americans at a time when the prices of
the 50 drugs they are most
commonly prescribed are rising
at more than twice the rate of
inflation.
<p>Big Pharma’s profiteering also
isn’t doing much for patients who
come to places like the Moss Free
Clinic in Fredericksburg, Va. The
residents who visit the clinic as a
last resort (they have no private
health insurance and do not
qualify for Medicaid or Medicare)
almost always need at least one
prescription.
<p>The clinic pharmacy can dispense free drug samples that
temporarily stave off calamity;
and if patients are able to jump
through all the bureaucratic
hoops and can wait two or three
months, they might even get
medication through drug companies’ indigent patient programs
(which are tax writeoffs for the
firms).
<p>But places like the Moss Clinic
can’t help everyone get the prescription drugs he or she needs.
Medicare patients (who number
40 million nationwide) are ineligible for the services offered at
free clinics, yet their benefits do
not cover prescription drugs.
Consequently, many seniors
and disabled people on Medicare
go without medications necessary
for their well-being.
<p>While these people certainly
aren’t doing “even better” as a
result of Big Pharma’s business
success—drug firms’ bigwigs
apparently are. The average compensation for the highest-paid
executive at each of the nine
companies included in the Families USA study came to almost $19
million last year.
<p>On top of this salary, these same
nine executives also have unexercised stock options that total
$890 million in value. C.M. Heimbold Jr., chairman of BristolMyers Squibb, is holding stock
options worth $228 million. That’s
$28 million more than the United
States has offered to pony up for a
new global fund to fight HIV/
AIDS and other infectious diseases that are ravaging poor
countries.
<p>But drug manufacturers don’t
just throw money at their head
honchos. They also see to it that
buckets of cash wind up with the
politicians who have the greatest
ability to affect drug companies’
bottom line.
<p>Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., who
heads the House Ways and Means
Committee and as such may be the
most important member of Congress when it comes to legislation
concerning Medicare and prescription drugs, can count drug
makers Eli Lilly and Allergan as
his two top campaign contributors. And Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn.,
another major player in the
Medicare reform debate, was one
of Big Pharma’s top beneficiaries
during the 1999-2000 election cycle,
receiving more than $260,000.
<p>In all, the pharmaceutical and
health-products industry donated
more than $26 million in PAC, soft-money and individual contributions to federal candidates and
committees in 1999-2000, according
to the Center for Responsive
Politics.
<p>What do the drug companies
want for their money? They want
to make certain that their servants in Washington don’t get any
silly ideas—such as creating a
Medicare drug benefit that would
impose some form of price controls and thereby take a bite out of
their profits.
<p>Big Pharma is betting that the
money it has invested in our
politicians will enable it to continue bilking Americans. And
until we fix some of the ills that
afflict our political system, that
might be a safe bet.
