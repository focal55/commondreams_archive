George W. Bush campaigned for President as
a "uniter, not a divider," a "compassionate
conservative," who was going to "bring civility back
to government."

<p>"I'll work with Republicans and Democrats,"
he said.

<p>He didn't even wait to be sworn in before
launching a jihad -- a holy war -- against the enemies
of his party.

<p>How else to describe the nomination of a man
with such an atrocious civil rights record for the
nation's top legal officer? Not to mention an anti-
environmentalist to protect the nation's federal lands
and forests, and an anti-labor crusader for Secretary
of Labor.

<p>That last one, Linda Chavez, got "Borked" last
week. (The reference is to Robert Bork, nominated to
the Supreme Court by President Reagan in 1987 and
rejected after a harsh fight in the Senate). But Chavez
was defeated on a technicality. John Ashcroft, George
W. Bush's nominee for Attorney General, hasn't been
caught with any undocumented workers doing his
housework. So the Democrats may have to reject him
on more substantive grounds.

<p>This shouldn't be all that hard to do; the man
has a record. Take voting rights-- given what
happened in our last Presidential election, it's
probably more of an issue today than at any time
since the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

<p>As Governor of Missouri, John Ashcroft did
his best to keep the number of registered voters to a
minimum-- at least in those areas with higher
concentrations of African-Americans, poor and
working people, and of course Democrats.

<p>In 1988 the Missouri legislature passed a law
that allowed for deputy registrars to go out and
register voters in the city of St. Louis, just as they did
in some outlying areas where there were more
Republican and white voters. Ashcroft vetoed that bill
on the grounds that it wasn't fair for the state
government to apply this law to St. Louis and not to
the rest of the state.

<p>So the next year the legislature came back
with a bill that applied to the whole state. Governor
Ashcroft vetoed that one, too.

<p>As anyone who has been involved in voter
registration drives can tell you, these outreach
programs can be very effective in increasing voter
participation. This is especially true for people who
might otherwise find it difficult register at city hall or
another municipal office during working hours. To
deny this opportunity to one part of the population,
while allowing it for others-- this by itself should be
enough to disqualify John Ashcroft for the position of
U.S. Attorney General.

<p>But there is more-- a lot more. He fought
vehemently against even voluntary desegregation of
St. Louis public schools. In 1999 he accepted an
honorary degree from Bob Jones University, which
had a ban on interracial dating. And then there is his
very friendly interview with the white supremacist
magazine Southern Partisan, in which he defended the
cause of the Confederacy.

<p>Ashcroft's record on women's issues is also
that of an extremist. He supported legislation that
could be used not only to ban abortion but even some
forms of contraception such as birth control pills. His
efforts to restrict access to abortion while Attorney
General in Missouri showed a lack of respect for the
law-- for example, requiring hospital rather then
outpatient treatment in order to make the procedure
more expensive and difficult to obtain; or attempting
to limit the professional services of nurses. Ashcroft
pursued such restrictions even when they were clearly
unconstitutional and would be reversed by the courts.

<p>And when it comes to gay rights-- whether it's
protection from discrimination in employment, or the
appointment of a gay official, Ashcroft has found
himself in the hard-core opposition.

<p>There are a lot of good reasons why Mr.
Ashcroft lost to a dead man in his Senate race last
year. The question now is: will the 50 live Democrats
in the Senate have the spine to stop him from taking a
much more powerful position in which he is clearly
not fit to serve? Or will they kick up a lot of dirt and
then cave, deferring to a President who lost the
popular vote (and never really won the election,
either)?

<p>Bork him.
