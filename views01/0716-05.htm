It should come as no surprise that in a country enamored of the death penalty so many people still think that you can beat goodness into a wayward child.
<P>Earlier this month the wire services and television carried stories about a 14-year-old boy serving time in an Arizona "boot camp" who had died after allegedly being forced to eat dirt.
<P>The boy, Tony Haynes, had been sent to the camp because he had slashed the tires on his mother's car. The camp, located in a desert near Buckeye, Ariz., is operated by something called America's Buffalo Soldiers Re-Enactors Association. The head of this organization, which bills itself as being a non-profit group dedicated to helping troubled children, was identified as Charles Long, age 56. Long calls himself Colonel Long, an apparently self-bestowed commission.
<P>To get an idea of how bad the camp is, it was shut down following Haynes' death by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Arpaio, as viewers of <i>60 Minutes </i>may recall, runs a tent county jail that would not be mistaken for Club Med. Except, perhaps, by kids who had been guests of the Buffalo Soldiers.
<P>The sadistic nature of the let's-pretend cavalrymen's camp came to light only after an inmate died. Since then, survivors have told tales of senseless brutality meted out by camp "sergeants," some little older than the children they were abusing.
<P>They told of being forced to eat dirt and being punched and kicked when they ran afoul of the camp's regulations.
<P>At about the same time the Arizona camp's story was unfolding, <i>The New York Times </i>ran a story about a similar, albeit slightly more sophisticated, gulag run by an evangelical zealot in Missouri. The Heartland Christian Academy in Newark, Mo., is the brainchild of Charles Sharpe, a retired insurance company executive and self-appointed instrument of God.
<P>Children who are sent to Heartland, according to <i>The Times </i>story, don't have to ingest filth. All they have to do is stand in it.
<P>Heartland's penchant for Old Testament-style behavior modification techniques came to light when it was revealed that 11 inmates, ages 13 to 17, had been marched into concrete basins filled with liquified cow manure and forced to stand there for varying lengths of time.
<P>At least that is how witnesses who complained to the Lewis County Sheriff's Department saw it. Sharpe saw it differently. The messy miscreants, Brother Sharpe explained, were simply part of a work detail.
<P>"A group of little men thinks they can stop God?" Sharpe was quoted in <i>The Times </i>story. Obviously the sheriff didn't know who he was dealing with.
<P>What's most appalling about the story is that of the 11 children who were rescued from Heartland's manure pits and sent home, eight were shipped right back by their parents. That says a lot about why the kids were sent there in the first place.
<P>Sharpe and others of his ilk argue that most of the kids who go through these tough love type programs come out changed. That's probably true. But changed into what?
