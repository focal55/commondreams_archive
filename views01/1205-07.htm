<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->The Wall Street Journal, the leading global newspaper of business, is
published by Dow Jones and Company who also operate the world's most widely
followed stock-market indicator tracking the world's largest stock market.
The Workers Vanguard, is a Marxist working class biweekly of the Spartacist
League of the United States, which is the U. S. Section of the International
Communist League.  Drawing from Cold War history and the present war in
Afghanistan, both have published recent articles that agree Afghanistan was
better off under Soviet control than that of the Northern Alliance.

<p>In the December 4, 2001 edition of the Journal, Alan Cullison reports from
Kabul, Afghanistan     on living conditions when the Soviets were there
under a heading of "Soviet-Era Vision of Afghanistan Gains New Life in Ruins
of Kabul Neighborhood."  Cullison story leads with, "In the wrecked remnants
of what was once one of Kabul's most prestigious neighborhoods, American
bombs have stirred a fragile and ironic hope: the revival of a Soviet-era
vision of Afghanistan whose destruction Washington used to trumpet as its
greatest Cold War triumph."
Cullison then quotes Siarah Parlika, one of the oldest residents of the
Soviet-built Microrayon neighborhood, who said, "It used to be
beautiful-there was glass in our windows and we had gardens."

<p>Then the Cold War turned Afghanistan into a proxy battleground between
Washington and Moscow and destroyed model communities like Microrayon.  Mr.
Cullison says, "It also trampled the first shoots of a secular political
class more interested in living standards than religious dogma."  The story
reveals that the Soviets built swimming pools, shops, and schools to serve
the complex that housed 140,000 people and that attendance at the schools
was compulsory for boys and girls.  It also reported that "Soviet-era
Microrayon represented a vision of Afghanistan's future far more in tune
with the West than the religious zealotry of the U.S.-backed mujahedeen
fighters who drove the Soviets from Afghanistan in 1989."

<p>The mujahedeen then overthrew the government left behind by the Soviets
in1992 and turned Microrayan and the capitol city of Kabul into a no-man's
land as they battled among themselves for spoils.  The Journal reported that
the apartments were occupied and looted by a succession of Northern Alliance
warlords.  Stray rockets hit a city power plant and Microrayan's heating
plant knocking out heat, lights and running water in 1993 and thieves
emptied the schools of their desks and chairs.  When the Taliban took over
in 1996 they abolished the study of math, geography and history and would
not allow the girls to go to school.  Cullison reported that now, " herds of
goats root through apartment courtyards"...and, "Most of the doctors,
teachers and government technocrats that were the neighborhood's original
residents fled."

<p>Also in the December 4 edition of the Wall Street Journal, Andrew Higgins
wrote from Kabul that, "Anti-Taliban troops who last month captured the key
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif have begun fighting among themselves,
prompting the United Nations to evacuate international staff from the area
and raising fears of a violent rift in the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance."
What's new!  Higgins said the fighting among the Northern Alliance threatens
to "badly blemish American strategy in Afghanistan: instead of bringing
peace, the defeat of the Taliban regime ignites a new round of conflict
among victors."  Although Kabul has been relatively peaceful, other areas
under the Northern Alliance control have also experienced unrest and
violence.  There are three main factions or ethnic groups involved:  the
Tajiks, the Uzbeks and Hazaras.   The Tajiks and Uzbeks are Sunni Muslims
whose roots are in the two former Soviet republics of Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan and the Hazaras are Shiite Muslims who are supported by Iran.
Higgins reported that "the potentially explosive ethnic, religious and
political fissures...risk dividing Afghanistan into a jumble of warlord
fiefdoms."

<p>The Workers Vanguard of November 30, 2001 was headlined "U.S.-Backed Killers
Take Kabul" and reported, "the Northern Alliance cutthroats are already
displaying the internecine feuding and murderous barbarity of their four
years of power in the mid-1990s."  The Vanguard said the Northern Alliance
was "Hailed as 'liberators' by Washington and the Western media", and "media
mouth-pieces have portrayed the Northern Alliance as bearers of freedom for
the Afghan masses, especially women."  The Vanguard said during the four
years the Northern Alliance ruled Afghanistan (1992-1996), "they killed
countless civilians, perpetrated mass rapes and enslaved women in the veil,"
and that "The display of crocodile tears by American rulers for the enslaved
women of Afghanistan is the most repulsive hypocrisy."   It calls Osama bin
Laden and the Taliban "Islamic fundamentalist killers unleashed by the U.S.
in the 1980s against the soviet Red Army."

<p>The Vanguard newspaper, published in New York, said, "the Soviet military
presence there was one of the few truly progressive acts carried out by the
Stalinist bureaucracy, which brought the only hope of emancipation for the
hideously oppressed women of Afghanistan."

<p>These ideological opposites of journalism overwhelmingly agree about the key
players in the  Cold War in Afghanistan, and the continuing conflict in that
war-torn country.  Isn't it time for the Bush administration and their
pandering propagandists, a/k/a news reporters, in the major television and
news organizations to begin telling the truth to the American people???
