As the clock progressed toward morning yesterday in Bonn, the world progressed with it. Finally, civilized countries had agreed to rules through which the Kyoto protocol on climate change would be implemented.
<P>I had the privilege of witnessing this historic moment. I also had the privilege of being a Canadian at a world environment meeting when, at last, Canada did the right thing.</P>
<P>In Bonn, the world did not simply recognize the grave threat that climate change presents, but agreed on a way to fight it. The means, the Kyoto protocol, is an imperfect tool, but like all first tools, it allows the job to get started and for future improvements to be made.</P>
<P>In Canada, the Liberal government should be pleased. Not only did Canada reject U.S. President George Bush's dangerous path of denial and agree to the protocol, but it also came away with more than it bargained for. The wording of the final amendments will give Canada twice the credit for its carbon sinks than it asked for. This achievement makes it incumbent upon the government to formally ratify the protocol in Parliament this fall.</P>
<P>Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray, head of the Canadian delegation, should be commended: His compromises facilitated a deal, and it is with that same spirit that Greenpeace supports the Bonn agreement.</P>
<P>Entering the negotiations, Canada held two positions at odds with Europe and most environmentalists. The first was the idea of getting emission credits for so-called &#34;carbon sinks,&#34; forests that absorb carbon dioxide; the second was receiving emissions credits for nuclear power exports to developing countries.</P>
<P>Canada won big on the sinks and yielded on nuclear exports.</P>
<P>When Canada signed the Kyoto protocol in 1997, it committed the country to a 6-per-cent cut in the 1990 level of greenhouse gas emissions. This year, Canadian emissions have already risen to 15 per cent above 1990 levels and, by 2008, are expected to go even higher. It is projected that Canadian emissions will be 200 million tons above the level Canada committed itself to back in 1997.</P>
<P>To help in reducing this 200 megaton excess, Canada wanted credit for absorbing 30 megatons in its carbon sinks. In the end, the deal permits credit for up to 60 megatons</P>
<P>The Bonn deal does not credit Canada with every tree in the country. Instead, it credits only for managed forests, such as British Columbia's Great Bear Rainforest. The amount of carbon stored in that forest will be measured in 2008 and again in 2012. Increased carbon storage will be credited to Canada; decreases will be debited.</P>
<P>Though Greenpeace will continue to push for more greenhouse gas cuts and less reliance on carbon sinks, we are very pleased that the Bonn agreement provides an effective legal framework for enforcing compliance. The world needs goals for emission reductions, rules for them and a way to enforce those cuts on countries.</P>
<P>We are also greatly pleased that Canada abandoned demands for credits for nuclear power exports to developing countries. The nuclear industry's attempt to profit from climate change was dealt a major blow in Bonn, one we hope will spur the world to rely on clean energy such as wind and solar power.</P>
<P>The world knows it must reduce its emissions by 2012. It knows by how much and through what method. It is no longer possible to claim that we don't know the rules.</P>
<P>There will be some who believe Kyoto is too weak. Their arguments are valid, but they should remember the landmark Montreal protocol on CFCs and the ozone layer. That agreement started out weak but, once the architecture was in place, the protocol quickly adapted itself to keep pace with scientific evidence of the ozone layer's depletion. There is nothing to suggest the Kyoto protocol cannot be similarly strengthened.</P>
<P>Also, there will be some who believe Kyoto is too strong. They will bemoan the economic costs, but conveniently ignore the economic opportunities that are presented by conservation and renewable energy -- not to mention the enormous costs if we do nothing. Science is not on their side. Nor is public opinion.</P>
<P>Public opinion was sufficient to defeat Mr. Bush's desire to kill Kyoto, and it was sufficient to disappoint the oil and nuclear industries. It is strong enough to overcome opposition in every province.</P>
<P>That became very clear as I felt the anger toward Canada on the streets of Bonn when it appeared Mr. Chr&#233;tien was backing away from a deal. The support shown to Greenpeace climbers highlighting Canada's position on the CN Tower was moving. The pressure felt by the government in Bonn was immense.</P>
<P>I hope the government remembers that pressure, and the will of Canadians. As Mr. Chr&#233;tien searches for a legacy, may I suggest history has just presented him with one. It's time to get to work. 
<p>
    <I>Peter Tabuns, executive director of Greenpeace Canada, attended the Bonn summit on climate change.</I>
