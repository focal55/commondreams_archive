I am one  of many deeply conflicted ex-activists who worked to stop the war 
on Vietnam but isn’t (at least as of October 10) quite sure how to act in the 
current situation.

<p>Let’s get the bona fides out of the way first. In the ‘60s and early-’70s, I 
was involved majorly in the anti-war movement, everything from Movement 
journalism, to  organizing and addressing rallies and demos, to running draft 
dodgers across the border into Canada. I  was threatened with arrest more 
than once, and I lost my college-teaching job because of my perceived 
“radicalism.”

<p>But that was another time, another war. It was clear from the git-go that the 
war in Vietnam was immoral and  doomed to failure in any case. (Even 
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara admits that he knew as early as 1967 
that the war was unwinnable.) The U.S. government was ignorant of Vietnamese 
history and culture, and was fighting a technological war for a long time 
against an invisible enemy of determined guerrillas fighting to expel the 
invaders. Le plus ca change... 

<p>Everything changed on September 11, 2001. The U.S. mainland itself was under 
attack from determined, clever,  ideologically resolute guerrillas, eager and 
willing to die in their religious/political frenzy. Regardless of  what one 
thinks of their political and policy complaints -- and regardless of what one 
thinks of U.S. foreign policy over the decades that might have contributed to 
the climate that breeds terror -- their crime against humanity and their 
single-minded determination to kill  U.S. civilians wherever and however they 
can puts them beyond any pale of civilized  behavior. These are very bad and 
dangerous people. They must be rooted out and dealt with.

<p>So I applaud President Bush’s pushing the issue of terrorism to the top of 
the world’s agenda, and organizing a coalition to begin attacking the terror 
networks in a wide variety of ways: diplomatically  (isolating  states that  
may have harbored terrorists), financially (trying to dry up their 
money-laundering accounts), through police work here and abroad (rounding up 
suspects, collapsing cells planning further attacks), waging an 
educational/propaganda campaign to drum up  moral support  for the 
anti-terrorism campaign.

<p>Where I, and perhaps many like me, grow more uneasy was with the U.S. rush to 
military action. I understand the desire  to strike back relatively quickly 
-- to throw the terrorists and their supporters into a disruption of normal 
patterns, to debilitate their assets, to assuage the U.S. population’s desire 
for retaliation, etc.  -- but I question the thinking behind that approach. 
(After all, it was President Bush from the very beginning who urged patience 
and said the campaign would take years; why the rush to the military option 
FIRST?  One can never put the toothpaste back in the tube.) And I wonder if 
the U.S. action, though it may yield short-term dividends, will  come back to 
bite us badly in the long term.

<p>For one thing, not only do we not have an exit strategy for this  war, it 
appears we didn’t even have an entry strategy. We bomb for three or  four 
days and then, say U.S. spokesmen, we’ll see what happens. In other words, 
other than bombing and putting ground troops in with no clear goals, it 
doesn’t seem as if we have much of a long-term strategy.  We want to find  
and capture (or kill) the elusive bin Laden and his lieutenants, and we’d be 
happy if the Northern Alliance forces would topple the Taliban, but clearly 
we have nothing yet that is respectable and institutionally viable with which 
to replace the Taliban. And there’s no indication that we’re prepared for 
nation-building tasks in a post-Taliban Afghanistan. Instead, there are 
rumbles in the Bush administration about moving on to bombing Iraq and going 
after Saddam Hussein and his lieutenants.

<p>We are leading a most fragile coalition that  is ready to break apart at any 
moment.  If  civilian casualties in Afghanistan begin growing, and especially 
if we attack another Muslim country, the coalition will implode, with 
potentially horrendous consequences. Bin Laden and his friends and supporters 
around the Middle East/South Asia will have fodder for their fire that this 
whole U.S.-led operation is another “crusade” (Bush’s original term, 
remember) against Islam.  (Remember the Italian prime minister’s racist 
remarks about Islam and how Christianity is far superior? No wonder Muslims 
are nervous.)

<p>Pakistan’s leadership may be overthrown, and has anybody emphasized that 
Pakistan now has nuclear weapons? Do we want to contemplate what bin Laden 
and the Taliban and their  allies might do with such nuclear missiles? 
Indonesia, the most populous Muslim state in the world, already politically 
shaky, could fall to fundamentalist extremists.

<p>Meanwhile, off  the geopolitical radar screen, what is China up to? While the 
U.S. is preoccupied with going after terrorists (and there are reports that  
China is moving   Chinese-Muslim troops near, or maybe even into Afghanistan, 
perhaps to aid the Taliban),  might China decide to engage in  some major 
mischief of its own? (Even more disturbing possibility: In exchange for its 
anti-terrorism support, the U.S.  seems to have given  Russia carte blanche  
to do what it wants in Chechnya; might we have made a similiar, 
under-the-table deal with China in regard to Taiwan?)

<p>Finally,  the U.S. -- from top governmental officials to ordinary American 
citizens -- seem utterly focused  on the terrorists we know, with virtually 
no attention being paid to the next generation of terrorists we don’t now 
know. In other words, we are forgetting to pay attention to finding a way to 
lower tensions in the Middle East. We know, if we think about it, that U.S. 
foreign/military policy has contributed to the growth of anti-U.S. sentiment 
in that explosive area of the world, even among  Arabs and other Muslims who 
consider the terror attacks on the U.S. a major crime of horror.  Should we 
not be  thinking, even a little bit, about  re-examining U.S. foreign 
policies that  bring risk to our country?

<p>It seems to me that  this would make sense, but we’re in the usual American 
mode of trying to remove the irritant to our system and then getting “back to 
normal.” If we go that route, we will have to deal not only with the 
dangerous terrorists from The Base but with a whole new crop just  waiting to 
join the Islamic extremists’ “jihad” against the U.S. and Western 
civilization in general. There is no “going back to normal”; we’d better get 
used to  it: This IS normal for the foreseeable future. Bin Laden's network 
is  so extremist/fundamentalist in its attitude that even if there were a 
just Israeli/Palestinian peace, he'd still be on his jihad against the U.S.; 
they've got to be stopped.

<p>What am I referring to in terms of what the U.S. can do? Well, for starters, 
how about the U.S. becoming energizingly engaged in trying to broker a peace 
between Israel and the Palestinians -- one that takes into account Israel’s 
desire for security and the Palestinians’ need for a contiguous  state? How 
about  re-thinking whether there’s another alternative to basing our troops 
in Saudi Arabia? How about weaning our economy and culture off Mideast oil 
(and I don’t mean opening up ANWAR in order that we can continue to drive 
gas-guzzling SUVs)? Etc. Etc.

<p>In sum, if we truly want to move intelligently beyond this current war effort 
-- assuming we can get through it without the Law of Unintended Consequences 
(Pakistan & nuclear weapons, China’s machinations, India& Pakistan going to 
war,   something else unforeseen) bringing havoc to the world  -- we’ve got 
as citizens to become better educated as to history, geopolitics, and learn 
how everything ties together. And then let our  political leaders know that 
we know.

<p>So, having said all that, what are we conflicted ex-activists to do, given 
that we support the idea of closing up terrorist cells around the world, but 
are anxious, and have many questions,  about  U.S. war policies? 

<p>I can’t speak for others, but for me, I will continue  raising these 
questions wherever I can -- to my senators and Congresspeople, in public 
dialogue in newspapers and on the internet, I will try to remind folks that 
once the war genie is let out of the bottle the Law of Unintended 
Consequences can lead to disasters, I will emphasize the need to re-examine 
American foreign policy in the Mideast and elsewhere that may be creating the 
conditions that lead to hatred and resentment of  America and Americans. And 
I will pray, and work, for  justice and eventual peace.
