We stare at TV screens and try to comprehend the suffering in the 
aftermath of terrorism. Much of what we see is ghastly and all too real; 
terrible anguish and sorrow.

<p>At the same time, we're witnessing an onslaught of media 
deception. "The greatest triumphs of propaganda have been accomplished, not 
by doing something, but by refraining from doing," Aldous Huxley observed 
long ago. "Great is truth, but still greater, from a practical point of 
view, is silence about truth."

<p>Silence, rigorously selective, pervades the media coverage of 
recent days. For policy-makers in Washington, the practical utility of that 
silence is enormous. In response to the mass murder committed by hijackers, 
the righteousness of U.S. military action is clear -- as long as double 
standards go unmentioned.

<p>While rescue crews braved intense smoke and grisly rubble, ABC 
News analyst Vincent Cannistraro helped to put it all in perspective for 
millions of TV viewers. Cannistraro is a former high-ranking official of 
the Central Intelligence Agency who was in charge of the CIA's work with 
the contras in Nicaragua during the early 1980s. After moving to the 
National Security Council in 1984, he became a supervisor of covert aid to 
Afghan guerrillas.

<p>In other words, Cannistraro has a long history of assisting 
terrorists -- first, contra soldiers who routinely killed Nicaraguan 
civilians; then, mujahedeen rebels in Afghanistan ... like Osama bin Laden.

<p>How can a longtime associate of terrorists now be credibly 
denouncing "terrorism"? It's easy. All that's required is for media 
coverage to remain in a kind of history-free zone that has no use for any 
facets of reality that are not presently convenient to acknowledge.

 <p>In his book "1984," George Orwell described the mental dynamics: 
"The process has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with 
sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring 
with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt.... To tell deliberate lies 
while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become 
inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back 
from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of 
objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which 
one denies -- all this is indispensably necessary."

<p>Secretary of State Colin Powell denounced "people who feel that 
with the destruction of buildings, with the murder of people, they can 
somehow achieve a political purpose." He was describing the terrorists who 
had struck his country hours earlier. But Powell was also aptly describing 
a long line of top officials in Washington.

<p>It would be very unusual to hear a comment about that sort of 
hypocrisy on any major TV network in the United States. Yet surely U.S. 
policy-makers have believed that they could "achieve a political purpose" 
-- with "the destruction of buildings, with the murder of people" -- when 
launching missiles at Baghdad or Belgrade.

<p>Nor are key national media outlets now doing much to shed light on 
American assaults that were touted as anti-terrorist "retaliation" -- such 
as the firing of 13 cruise missiles, one day in August 1998, at the Al 
Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, Sudan. That attack, depriving an 
impoverished country of desperately needed medical drugs, was an atrocity 
committed (in the words of political analyst Noam Chomsky) "with no 
credible pretext, destroying half its pharmaceutical supplies and probably 
killing tens of thousands of people."

<p>No one knows the exact number of lives lost due to the severe 
disruption of Sudan's meager drug supply, Chomsky adds, "because the U.S. 
blocked an inquiry at the United Nations and no one cares to pursue it."

<p>Media scrutiny of atrocities committed by the U.S. government is 
rare. Only some cruelties merit the spotlight. Only some victims deserve 
empathy. Only certain crimes against humanity are worth our tears.

<p>"This will be a monumental struggle of good versus evil," 
President Bush proclaimed. The media reactions to such rhetoric have been 
overwhelmingly favorable.

<p>But the heart-wrenching voices now on the USA's airwaves are no 
less or more important than voices that we have never heard. Today, the 
victims of terrorism in America deserve our deep compassion. So do the 
faraway victims of America -- human beings whose humanity has gone 
unrecognized by U.S. media.

<p>Underlying that lack of recognition is a nationalistic arrogance 
shared by press and state. Few eyebrows went up when Time magazine declared 
in its Sept. 10 edition: "The U.S. is at one of those fortunate -- and rare 
-- moments in history when it can shape the world." That attitude can only 
bring us a succession of disasters.
