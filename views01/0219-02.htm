            The number of ex-inmates living in some inner-city neighborhoods will 
            soon equal the number of other citizens living there, explained Rep. 
            Danny Davis (D-Ill) in a recent interview. The congressman was discussing--and 
            bemoaning--the many ways the criminal justice system retards community 
            development. 
            <P> Davis noted that, with the record numbers of ex-inmates returning 
              from prison, the worst is yet to come. "How can we have a desirable 
              quality of life in many of our communities with such a high number 
              of ex-offenders in the neighborhood who can't get a job?" he asked.
            <P> It was a rhetorical question, of course. The answer is as obvious 
              as it is frightening. Prisons have shifted their emphasis from rehabilitation 
              to punishment in recent decades so returning inmates have less training 
              or jobs skills. Without jobs and skills, ex-inmates will either 
              get work in the booming underground economy and eventually return 
              to prison, or wind up on the public dole or homeless. Either way, 
              their communities will suffer.
            <P> This is a deadly cycle in which there are no winners. The African-American 
              community loses the agency and energy of black youth at the prime 
              age of family formation, and this further debilitates a crime-ridden 
              community already lacking resources and role models. One small step 
              out of this quandary is being led by Illinois Rep. Constance Howard 
              (D-Chicago), who is expected to introduce legislation in Springfield 
              Friday that speaks directly to these issues. Howard will be presenting 
              seven bills all designed to address one important aspect of the 
              problem that so concerns Davis. Specifically, her legislation requires 
              that all traces of arrests be erased (expunged) from the records 
              of certain citizens.
            <P> Two of Howard's measures call for the expunging of arrest records 
              for those charged but not convicted and for those whose convictions 
              were overturned; opposition to those measures, even by law and order 
              fanatics, seems hard to justify.
            <P> Two other bills seek automatic expunging of records for minors 
              after their sentences have been served: one focuses on minors convicted 
              as adults and sentenced to probation, and the other on minors sentenced 
              to probation in juvenile court.
            <P> Howard's other three measures call for clearing records after 
              offenders have served time for their non-violent crimes and spent 
              additional time crime-free. These measures seem more politically 
              problematic. Law enforcement officials often insist on having arrest 
              records available for criminal investigations and generally resist 
              surrendering those files. And they have a point, since most studies 
              reveal that repeat offenders commit most crimes.
            <P> "I understand the perspective of law enforcement," said Rep. Howard. 
              "But at some point somebody's got to give. These ex-inmates can't 
              get adequate employment with prison records," she laments. Although 
              these returning ex-inmates have served their time for their criminal 
              behavior, the stain on their records serves to punish them for the 
              remainder of their lives. "You have to ask, what does it mean to 
              pay your debt to society?" Howard said.
            <P> Did I say there are no winners in our dysfunctional criminal justice 
              system? Well, that's not exactly true. Law enforcement agencies, 
              the holders of stock in companies that run prisons, private security 
              firms, corrections officers, police salaries and recruitment, all 
              benefit by making sure that crime remains a frightening specter 
              in our society. This is not to tarnish their motives, only to make 
              a sober assessment of where their best interests lie. As this nation 
              embarked on an incarceration spasm that has made us the world's 
              leading jailer, we've devoted increasing resources to police functions. 
              There's little doubt that were crime to become less of a social 
              concern, police agencies would lose much of their political clout.
            <P> We've also created more institutions with a vested interest in 
              a growing crime rate. Small cities, for example, clamor for prison 
              construction to help salvage their local economies.
            <P> It's an insidious relationship that needs to be altered. A society 
              that gains economic benefit from social failure is a scavenger culture 
              that ultimately will cannibalize itself. Perhaps the raging success 
              of a movie about a cannibal is a telling metaphor.
            <P> I'm not making any specific charges here, but perhaps we should 
              examine those opposing Howard's measures for any "cannibal" connections.
