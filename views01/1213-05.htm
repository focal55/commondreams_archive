AN aggressive attack on freedom has been launched upon America's college  campuses.  Its perpetrators seek the elimination of ideas and activities that place Sept. 11 in historical context, or critique the so-called war  on terrorism. 
<P>

   The offensive, spearheaded by the American Council of  Trustees and Alumni, a Washington-based group, threatens free  speech, democratic debate  and the integrity of higher education.   In an incendiary report, ``Defending Civilization: How Our Universities Are  Failing America,'' the American Council claims that ``colleges and university faculty have  been the weak link in America's response'' to Sept. 11.  It also asserts  that ``when a nation's intellectuals are unwilling to defend its civilization,  they give comfort to its adversaries.'' 
<P>

        The report documents 117 campus incidents as ``evidence'' of  anti-Americanism.  More than 40 professors are named, including the  president of Wesleyan University, who suggested in an open letter that  ``disparities and injustices'' in American society and the world can lead to  hatred and violence.
<P>

  Other examples abound.  A Yale professor is criticized  for saying, ``It is from the desperate, angry and bereaved that these suicide  pilots came.''  A professor emeritus from the University of Oregon is listed  for recommending that ``we need to understand the reasons behind the  terrifying hatred directed against the U.S.  and find ways to act that will not  foment more hatred for generations to come.'' 
<P>

   Dozens more comments, taken  out of context and culled from secondary sources, are presented as examples  of an unpatriotic academy. 
<P>

  The American Council of  Trustees and Alumni was founded in 1995 by Lynne Cheney, the vice president's wife, and  Sen. Joseph Lieberman.  Its Website claims that it contributed $3.4  billion to colleges and universities last year, making it ``the largest  private source of support for higher education.''  Cheney is cited several  times in the report, and is reportedly a close associate of its authors,  Jerry Martin and Anne Neal. 
<P>

     Although the council's stated objectives include the protection of academic  freedom, the report resembles a blacklist.  In a chilling use of  doublespeak, it affirms the right of professors to speak out, yet condemns  those who have attempted to give context to Sept. 11, encourage critical  thinking, or share knowledge about other cultures.  Faculty are accused of  being ``short on patriotism'' for attempting to give students the analytical  tools they need to become informed citizens.
<P>

    Many of those blacklisted are top scholars in their fields, and it appears  that the report represents a kind of academic terrorism designed to strike  fear into  other academics by making examples of respected  professors. 
<P>

   The report might also function to extend control over sites of  democratic debate -- our universities -- where freedom of expression is not only permitted but  encouraged. 
<P>

     At my campus, symposiums, teach-ins and lectures about religion, terrorism,  central Asia, the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy have been organized  recently.  A teach-in entitled ``Background for Understanding'' drew hundreds  of students, faculty and citizens from many political and intellectual  perspectives.  The audience had the opportunity to ask questions and comment  freely.   The discussion was lively and at times contentious. 
<P>

        As a microcosm of society, the university is a place where people of  different ethnicities, religions, generations, and class backgrounds  exchange ideas and opinions.  Anyone who has visited Bay Area colleges knows  that they are especially rich places for intercultural exchange.
<P>

   The  vigorous and often heated debates typical of such encounters are a hallmark  of democratic processes.  On most campuses this can still be done freely,  but official accusations of anti-Americanism might intimidate and silence  some voices.
<P>

   That is not patriotism, but fascism. The American Council's position is inaccurate and irresponsible.  Critique, debate, and  exchange -- not blind consensus or self-censorship -- have characterized America  since its inception.
<P>

   Our universities are not failing America.  On the  contrary, they are among the few institutions offering alternatives to  canned mainstream media reports.
<P>

  The targeting of scholars who participate in civic debates might signal the  emergence of a new McCarthyism directed at the academy.  Before it escalates  into a full-blown witch hunt in the name of ``defending civilization,''  faculty, students and citizens should speak out against these acts of  academic terrorism.
<P>
