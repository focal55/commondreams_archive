Since the evil events of Sept. 11, the religious community has 
been clear and consistent in condemning the terrorists who brought 
violence to our shores. We have also said that a morally rooted 
response to this terror must focus on bringing the perpetrators to 
justice, rather than military reprisals that do harm to more 
innocents. A broad spectrum of religious leaders has expressed a 
strong determination to protect both the innocent lives threatened 
by further terrorist attacks and the innocent civilians jeopardized 
by military retaliation. 

<p>We believe there was wisdom in the restraint shown for almost a 
month by the U.S. government, in the building of an international 
coalition against terrorism, and in the fact that the developing 
strategy to root out terrorism included not just military but many 
other fronts. Now that the air strikes have begun, that 
multifaceted approach must not be lost in a widening war. We cannot 
simply wish away the questions to be answered and problems to be 
solved -- we must punish those responsible for the mass murders and 
prevent further terrorist violence. But we are now at a critical 
moral turning point between pursuing justice or waging a wider war. 

<p>The central importance of the defense of innocent lives must be 
made clear and compelling in the midst of the air strikes now 
underway. Already, we've seen tragic unintended results of U.S. 
bombing in the deaths of Afghan civilians. Despite clear efforts 
to avoid civilian casualties and apologies from the Pentagon for 
bombs that have missed their targets, experience shows us that 
bombing always results in the suffering of the innocent -- both 
through "collateral damage" and through civilian dislocation. The 
human crisis in Afghanistan of enormous refugee dislocation has 
been made worse by the bombings, and relief agencies are warning of 
a massive humanitarian disaster in the making unless ground 
shipments of aid are restored. 

<p>Now that the Taliban's "command and communication" centers and 
its military capabilities have been greatly diminished by the air 
strikes, it is time to shift strategies. The most effective and 
morally defensible strategy would be one focused clearly on 
bringing the terrorists to justice, fully utilizing the rule of law 
and international forces, and employing multiple tactics. We should 
undertake a police operation with special forces from many 
countries to vanquish the terrorist networks, instead of the 
widening war that continued bombing will bring. The U.S. should 
also urge the U.N. Security Council to establish a special 
international tribunal to try those responsible. 

<p>Such a focused and international campaign would not only be 
morally superior to an escalating U.S.-led war against the states 
that sponsor terrorism (with a heavy cost to their people), it 
would also be far less dangerous, and ultimately more effective in 
actually defeating the terrorist threat. It is imperative to 
prevent the scenario of an expanding American war in the Arab 
world, increasing the danger of more terrorist attacks in America 
and Europe, prompting more escalation, and thereby risking a cycle 
of violence that becomes more and more difficult to stop. 

<p>This strategy may take more time. But applying discipline, 
patience, and perseverance to cripple the networks, assets, and 
capabilities of violent terrorists is more likely to produce 
lasting results than massive military actions whose targets and 
consequences are increasingly unclear. President Bush's best action 
now would be to follow his own words of "patient justice."
