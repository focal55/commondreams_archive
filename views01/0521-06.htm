REPUBLICANS NOW control the executive and legislative  branches of government and are aiming for a lock on the third  branch, the federal courts. All that stands in their way are 50 Democratic senators, 40 of whom can mount a filibuster. But   will the Democrats be as unified and as tough as the  Republicans?<P>
<P>We will get a preview of the Democrats' resolve when the Senate takes up the nomination of Ted Olson as solicitor  general. Olson, who was less than candid with the Senate Judiciary Committee about his role in the Clinton-bashing  Arkansas Project, would be the most partisan solicitor general  ever.<P>
<P>Orrin Hatch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, now wants to make it harder for home state senators to delay court nominations with so-called blue slips. Coincidentally, it was Hatch, in 1995, who hardened the blue-slip policy to allow a single senator to block a nomination  indefinitely.<P>
<P>Republicans used this system to block dozens of Clinton  nominations, which were conveniently left for George W. Bush to  fill. The GOP was particularly zealous in blocking appointments   to appeals courts, which decide matters of law.<P>
<P>Now that the shoe is on the other foot, Republicans and  their allies in the media are painting the Bush administration as the victim of Democratic partisanship.<P>
<P>William Safire of The New York Times wrote soothingly that Republican senators had blocked Clinton court nominees at about the same rate that  Democrats blocked President Reagan's conservative choices.<P>
<P>Not so. To a far greater degree than the Democrats who  controlled the Senate during six of the Reagan-Bush I years, the Republican Senate played relentless hardball to keep Clinton from appointing even moderate judges, especially to appeals   courts.<P>
<P>The Republican Congress also refused to create new  judgeships necessary to handle an expanding population and   caseload.<P>
<P>Under President Carter, 152 additional federal judgeships were created. Reagan and Bush each got 85, Clinton  just nine.<P>
<P>Under Reagan and Bush, the the Senate, then controlled by Democrats, typically approved presidential nominations to the appellate bench within three to four months.<P>
<P>When the roles  were reversed and Republican senators were in charge, the   average delay rose to more than seven months in Clinton's  second term and 280 days in Clinton's last two years, according to a tabulation by the Alliance for Justice.<P>
<P>By the end of 2000, the Senate had confirmed only 39  of 81 pending judicial nominees and just eight to appeals courts.   Forty-two were left to lapse.<P>
<P>By the end of the Clinton presidency, eight out of the 13 federal appeals courts were still dominated by Republican judges, and just one, the Sixth Circuit, had a narrow majority of Democratic appointees (plus four vacancies.)<P>
<P>While a few high-profile nominations of ultra-conservative judges by Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.  were indeed killed by the Democratic Senate, there was far less  blockage and delay.<P>
<P>Clinton, faced with tougher partisan  opposition, consulted closely with Republicans over nominations. In an effort to appease his Republican opponents, he appointed several conservative judges recommended by  conservative GOP senators.<P>
<P>Even so, dozens of nominations  were delayed and then either quietly killed or blocked in  committee.<P>
<P>President Bush has now sent forward his first 11  appointees, all of them to fill vacancies on courts of appeals. Three would fill seats on the Fourth Circuit, which Jesse Helms managed to keep vacant for nearly five years, blocking one black nominee after another.<P>
<P>The man named by Bush to fill one position, Judge Terry  Boyle of North Carolina, a protege of Helms's, is one of the most conservative on the federal bench.<P>
<P>For instance, he was the   author of two decisions on race and redistricting, both  overturned by a not-very-liberal Supreme Court, holding that  race can never be a factor in creating representative legislative  districts.<P>
<P>It is a shame that the federal judiciary, ordinarily the   most dignified and least politicized branch of government, has   become subject to such narrow partisan and ideological scrutiny.<P>
<P>Yes, Democrats, with rare conviction, did block appointment of Judge Robert Bork to the US Supreme Court - but the  Republicans turned ''Borking'' into a routine way of life.<P>
<P>President Bush, who assumed office in a tainted election  with a minority of the popular vote, would be wise to appoint   only moderate judges.<P>
<P>But since he owes his very office to the   partisanship of the conservative majority on the Supreme Court,   most of his appointments will apparently be right-wingers of the  same stripe.<P>
<P>It is up to Democrats to restore balance and moderation to the judiciary - but that, paradoxically, will take some partisan  nerve.<P>
