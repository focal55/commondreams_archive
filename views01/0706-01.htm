It was three and half years ago that
Helen Hunt brought cheers from movie
audiences across the country when she spat
out a string of expletives with the acronym
"H.M.O." nestled in the middle of it. She got
the Academy Award for Best Actress ("As
Good As it Gets"), and the industry's image
has continued to slide downhill.

         <p>The system of managed care --
getting our health care through HMO's and
other large insurers -- has failed. For a while
in the 1990s it seemed like these
organizations could solve the one problem
that employers worried about -- containing
costs. But now insurance premiums are
rising at double-digit rates again. In the
mean time the care managers' attempts at
cost-cutting seem to have succeeded only in
angering millions of Americans, while
simultaneously enriching some very highly
paid executives. (William McGuire, CEO of
UnitedHealth Group, led the pack with
$54.1 million in compensation last year,
adding to his $358 million accumulation of
stock options.)

         <p>But the exorbitant rewards at the top
of the managerial pyramid are only a small
fraction of the waste that makes our health
care system the most expensive in the world.
We spend nearly 14 percent of our national
income on health care, while the average for
other high-income countries is about 8
percent. And unlike other rich countries, we
leave one out of six of our citizens -- 43
million people -- without health insurance.

         <p>This result is altogether predictable
from a system that has private insurers
competing to cover the healthiest prospects
and abandon, as much as they can, the sick.
You don't need a degree in actuarial science
to see that this is the most effective way for
an insurer to make money, even it means
devoting enormous resources to these non-
health-care goals.

         <p>The legislation now slogging through
Congress will add another layer or two of
oversight -- including the court system -- on
top of the existing bureaucracy. Despite the
additional costs, this will be an
improvement, since there needs to be some
way under the present system to hold the
managed care industry accountable. If the
bill makes it through the House without too
much amputation, there will be some added
rights for at least some of the insured. These
include the right to external review when
treatment is denied, the right to sue insurers
for denial of covered care, and the right to
visit the nearest emergency room.

         <p>But the Patients' Bill of Rights will
not help the uninsured, or tens of millions
more -- including chronically ill patients
paying exorbitant premiums -- that are
underinsured. To solve these problems, and
to contain costs, we will need a universal
health insurance system, with the
government as the insurer.

         <p>The case for social insurance is a
simple one, based on the human condition
and some fundamental economic logic.
First, we all get old and sick eventually, so
it's best to insure against these hardships
when we are young, healthy, and working.
Second, the most efficient way to do this is
to put everyone into one big "risk pool" -- it
saves enormously on overhead costs. If you
don't believe this, just compare the
administrative costs of Social Security --
which provides social insurance for
retirement, life insurance, and disability -- to
those of the private life insurance industry:
0.8 percent versus 12 percent. And lastly,
health care is not a commodity like a DVD
player, but a basic human need. A decent
society does not let its fellow humans go
without it.

         <p>Medicare was an attempt to extend
the principles of social insurance, which
have been so successful in the realm of
Social Security, to health care for the
elderly. At the time (1965) it was assumed
that this would soon be extended to the rest
of the population.

         <p>The failure to achieve this goal
reflects a failure of our political system, a
somewhat limited form of democracy in
which insurance and pharmaceutical giants
purchase -- with their political contributions
-- the right to a veto over health care policy.
Last year the pharmaceutical companies
spent $30 million for a blitz of very
successful TV ads, in order to block
President Clinton's attempt to create a
prescription drug benefit for Medicare.

         <p>Now the insurance industry is
deploying its army of lobbyists to gut the
Patients' Bill of Rights, as much as it can.
But with the economy slowing and health
care costs rising at unsustainable rates, it is
only a matter of time until real health care
reform -- with universal social insurance --
is back on the political agenda.
