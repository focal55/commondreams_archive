It has become increasingly fashionable
for our government officials and their friends to
promote Washington's global agenda as a
helping hand to the world's poor. "If one is
concerned about the developing countries, both
history and recent studies would suggest an
open system is going to be the formula for
them," said Bob Zoellick, US Trade
Representative at a recent press briefing.

<p>Even less partisan observers such as
Joseph S. Nye, Jr., Dean of Harvard's Kennedy
School, assert that globalization "has improved
the lot of hundreds of millions of poor people
around the world."

<p>But what if it just weren't true? Is it
possible that globalization has been a losing
proposition for most of the countries -- and
people -- of the world?

<p>It is generally considered heresy to even
ask such questions. Everyone who has managed
to stay awake through an introductory
economics course knows that the world is better
off when trade expands -- at least in theory.

<p>But the real world is often more
complex. Over the last 20 years most countries
have increasingly opened their economies to
international trade and investment. They have
also adopted -- under the theory that "Uncle
Sam knows best" --  a host of related economic
policies promoted by Washington-run
institutions such as the IMF and the World
Bank.

<p>The real world results look very bad. For
the vast majority of countries, the last two
decades have shown considerably -- and often
drastically -- slower growth than was seen in the
previous 20 years (1960-1980). And the poorer
countries have generally suffered the worst
declines in the growth of income per person, the
most basic indicator of economic progress.

<p>The exceptions tend to be countries like
China -- which has highly protected domestic
markets, extensive currency controls, and a
banking system dominated by state-owned
banks. This is not to say that any of these
policies would necessarily work elsewhere, or
that there are no gains to be had from
international trade and investment.

<p>But there is clearly something wrong
with the prevailing orthodoxy. Strategies for
economic development have been abandoned,
and it is generally assumed that open markets,
privatization, and attracting foreign investors
will do the job.

<p>The last 20 years of globalization have
also shown substantially diminished progress in
health outcomes, such as infant and child
mortality, and life expectancy. The same is true
for other social indicators, including education
and literacy. Again, the slowdown in progress is
worse among the lower-income countries.

<p>A world in which half of humanity
survives on less than $2 a day cannot afford to
postpone development for the sake of being
"economically correct," or for the special
interests of transnational corporations. The
expansion of trade and international markets is
not an end in itself, however much it may
appear that way to our corporate and political
leaders.

<p>The Bush Administration is now
urgently seeking "Trade Promotion Authority"
to negotiate a Free Trade Area of the Americas,
stretching from Canada to Argentina. This
would mean that Congress would have only an
up-or-down vote on the FTAA, with no
amendments.

<p>It's going to be a hard sell, with our
economy at a virtual standstill, and no recovery
yet in sight. During the economic expansion of
the 1990s, it was easier not to notice the
millions of jobs lost to expanding trade. Even
then, workers who lost their jobs in
manufacturing usually ended up working for
lower pay (if they were lucky enough to find a
job at all). But now the economy is not even
creating enough jobs to keep unemployment
from rising. In June, employment actually fell
even in the service sector, for the first time since
1958.

<p>Labor can be expected to fight Trade
Promotion Authority and the FTAA. They will
be joined by environmental and public interest
groups who oppose granting corporations new
rights -- as NAFTA did -- to sue governments
directly and overturn regulations designed to
protect the environment and public health.

<p>The opposition will be accused of
turning their backs on the world's poor. But the
last 20 years of corporate-led globalization tell a
different story: the world's poor need a New
Deal even more than we do. American labor and
citizens' groups should ignore these self-
righteous and self-serving accusations, and carry
on against the FTAA -- as well as the IMF,
World Bank, and World Trade Organization --
with a clear conscience. They are not only
protecting American jobs, wages, and natural
resources -- they are also saving the rest of the
world.
