MY DAUGHTER came home from kindergarten and announced, "Tomorrow we 
all have to wear red, white and blue."
<P>"Why?" I asked, trying not to sound wary.
<P>"For all the people that died when the airplanes hit the buildings."
<P>I fear the sound of saber-rattling, dread that not just my taxes but even 
my children are being dragged to the cause of death in the wake of death. I 
asked quietly, "Why not wear black, then?  Why the colors of the flag, what 
does that mean?"
<P>"It means we're a country.  Just all people together."
<P>So we sent her to school in red, white and blue, because it felt to her 
like something she could do to help people who are hurting.  And because my 
wise husband put a hand on my arm and said, "You can't let hateful people 
steal the flag from us."
<P>He didn't mean terrorists, he meant Americans.  Like the man in a city near 
us who went on a rampage crying "I'm an American" as he shot at foreign-born 
neighbors, killing a gentle Sikh man in a turban and terrifying every brown-
skinned person I know.  Or the talk-radio hosts, who are viciously bullying a 
handful of members of Congress for airing sensible skepticism at a time when 
the White House was announcing preposterous things in apparent self-interest, 
such as the "revelation" that terrorists had aimed to hunt down Air Force One 
with a hijacked commercial plane. Rep. Barbara Lee cast the House's only vote 
against handing over virtually unlimited war powers to one man that a whole 
lot of us didn't vote for. As a consequence, so many red-blooded Americans 
have now threatened to kill her, she has to have additional bodyguards.
<P>Patriotism seems to be falling to whoever claims it loudest, and we're left 
struggling to find a definition in a clamor of reaction.  This is what I'm 
hearing: Patriotism opposes the lone representative of democracy who was brave 
enough to vote her conscience instead of following an angry mob. (Several 
others have confessed they wanted to vote the same way, but chickened out.)  
Patriotism threatens free speech with death. It is infuriated by thoughtful 
hesitation, constructive criticism of our leaders and pleas for peace. It 
despises people of foreign birth who've spent years learning our culture and 
contributing their talents to our economy. It has specifically blamed 
homosexuals, feminists and the American Civil Liberties Union.  In other words, the American flag stands for intimidation, censorship, violence, bigotry, 
sexism, homophobia, and shoving the Constitution through a paper shredder?  
Who are we calling terrorists here? Outsiders can destroy airplanes and 
buildings, but it is only we, the people, who have the power to demolish our 
own ideals.
<P>It's a fact of our culture that the loudest mouths get the most airplay, 
and the loudmouths are saying now that in times of crisis it is treasonous to 
question our leaders.  Nonsense.  That kind of thinking let fascism grow out 
of the international depression of the 1930s.  In critical times, our leaders 
need most to be influenced by the moderating force of dissent.  That is the 
basis of democracy, in sickness and in health, and especially when national 
choices are difficult, and bear grave consequences.
<P>It occurs to me that my patriotic duty is to recapture my flag from the men 
now waving it in the name of jingoism and censorship.  This isn't easy for me. 
<P>The last time I looked at a flag with unambiguous pride, I was 13.  Right 
after that, Vietnam began teaching me lessons in ambiguity, and the lessons 
have kept coming. I've learned of things my government has done to the world 
that made me direly ashamed. I've been further alienated from my flag by 
people who waved it at me declaring I should love it or leave it. I search my 
soul and find I cannot love killing for any reason. When I look at the flag, I 
see it illuminated by the rocket's red glare.
<P>This is why the warmongers so easily gain the upper hand in the patriot 
game:  Our nation was established with a fight for independence, so our 
iconography grew out of war.  Our national anthem celebrates it; our language 
of patriotism is inseparable from a battle cry.  Our every military campaign 
is still launched with phrases about men dying for the freedoms we hold dear, 
even when this is impossible to square with reality.  In the Persian Gulf War 
we rushed to the aid of Kuwait, a monarchy in which women enjoyed 
approximately the same rights as a 19th century American slave. The values we 
fought for and won there are best understood, I think, by oil companies.  
Meanwhile, a country of civilians was devastated, and remains destroyed.
<P>Stating these realities does not violate the principles of liberty, 
equality, and freedom of speech; it exercises them, and by exercise we grow 
stronger. I would like to stand up for my flag and wave it over a few things I 
believe in, including but not limited to the protection of dissenting points 
of view.  After 225 years, I vote to retire the rocket's red glare and the 
bullet wound as obsolete symbols of Old Glory.  We desperately need a new 
iconography of patriotism. I propose we rip stripes of cloth from the uniforms 
of public servants who rescued the injured and panic-stricken, remaining at 
their post until it fell down on them. The red glare of candles held in vigils 
everywhere as peace-loving people pray for the bereaved, and plead for 
compassion and restraint.  The blood donated to the Red Cross.  The stars of 
film and theater and music who are using their influence to raise money for 
recovery.  The small hands of schoolchildren collecting pennies, toothpaste, 
teddy bears, anything they think might help the kids who've lost their moms 
and dads.
<P>My town, Tucson, Ariz., has become famous for a simple gesture in which 
some 8,000 people wearing red, white or blue T-shirts assembled themselves in 
the shape of a flag on a baseball field and had their photograph taken from 
above.  That picture has begun to turn up everywhere, but we saw it first on 
our newspaper's front page. Our family stood in silence for a minute looking 
at that photo of a human flag, trying to know what to make of it.  Then my 
teenage daughter, who has a quick mind for numbers and a sensitive heart, did 
an interesting thing.  She laid her hand over a quarter of the picture, 
leaving visible more or less 6,000 people, and said, "That many are dead."  We 
stared at what that looked like -- all those innocent souls, multi-colored and 
packed into a conjoined destiny -- and shuddered at the one simple truth 
behind all the noise, which is that so many beloved people have suddenly gone 
from us.  That is my flag, and that's what it means: We're all just people 
together.
