When we think of Alaska's wild oceans we think of pristine waters, wide open spaces, abundant salmon and crabs, and a wealth of marine mammals and birds. Many of us may also recall the tangible historic connections between the traditional fishing community of Puget Sound and the fabled fisheries of Alaska's oceans.
<p>
But today, the Alaska ocean ecosystem is collapsing everywhere. The development of unsustainable, industrial levels of overfishing, tremendous waste of unwanted fish and wanton habitat destruction have been going on unchecked for far too long. The mining of the ocean floor off Alaska is not only wiping out the once plentiful fish and shellfish stocks, but also the sea lions, seals, sea otters, whales and millions of birds that historically have flourished in these rich waters. 
<p>
With these bygone riches of the most productive ocean in the world goes a thousand-year-old culture of hard-working independent people connected to the sea: the ones who truly understand the value of stewardship and conservation in the marine world. 
<p>
The same massive economic interests that rolled over the small-boat Washington fleet, all but eliminating a vibrant intergenerational fishing culture of independent fishing people, expanded its influence and moved north to continue the conquest of the Northern seas. 
<p>
Why should the people of the Northwest care about the demise of Alaska's oceans? Because the responsibility rests right here in Seattle, where most of the corporate trawler fleet is based. The "fish until all the fish are gone" mentality behind this lucrative Northwest industry is the same mindset that wiped out crab and shrimp stocks in the '80s and '90s and it is once again going to put Washington state boats out of business. But this time, the stakes are higher. This time, if we do nothing, we will have the death of one of the world's richest ecosystems on our hands. 
<p>
Bureaucratic timidity and conflicting duties within the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have hamstrung the agency in its responsibility to stand up to large corporate fishing interests and powerful political lobbies. NMFS has mismanaged fishery after fishery across the nation, blaming environmental causes beyond their control for each collapsing stock. They have left themselves no margin for error. The Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea fisheries are following right behind the North Atlantic demise, with no brakes in sight. 
<p>
The endangered status of the Steller's sea lion, the spotted owl of the Alaska marine ecosystem, has finally forced NMFS to issue a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) on federally managed groundfish fisheries in Alaska. The goal of the SEIS is to identify measures to protect Steller's sea lions and the diversity of all marine life in Alaska.
<p>
This is the first significant SEIS for fisheries in the nation. What happens in Alaska will influence all other fisheries around the country, in particular the ailing West Coast rockfish fisheries. 
<p>
This is a chance for NMFS to get it right, for Alaska and the nation, but the draft SEIS misses the mark. 
<p>
NMFS released 3,300 pages of documents in January for the public to review and comment on by July 25. In spite of its hefty size, the draft SEIS does not provide a framework to evaluate the connection between commercial fisheries and the ecosystem as a whole. Instead, it continues to approach problems on a piecemeal, species-by-species basis.
<p>
Each of the alternatives focuses on particular areas &#151; marine mammals, seabirds, target stocks of fish, non-target stocks, etc. &#151; and fails to evaluate the combined effect on the entire ecosystem of the past 30 years of fishing. NMFS does not offer any practical alternatives to the way groundfish are being managed today even though current management practices are failing all around them. 
<p>
Simply put, none of the alternatives in the draft SEIS will protect the abundant life in Alaska's oceans nor maintain the integrity and diversity of this exquisite ecosystem. 
<p>
Furthermore, the incredible cultural diversity of the fishing communities around the North Pacific rim is not acknowledged in the NMFS document, with its focus on broad-brush economic data. 
<p>
That diversity is reflected in the formation this year of the Alaska Oceans Network, a voluntary association of conservation groups, fishing groups, Alaska native organizations and Alaska groundfish fishery observers. The members of the network don't agree on every aspect of fisheries management but they do support the creation of a healthy-oceans alternative that would:
<p>
<ul>
&#149; Consider the health of the entire marine ecosystem;
<p>
&#149; Set lower fishing quotas, eliminate overfishing and minimize waste; 
<p>
&#149; Restrict destructive fishing practices from sensitive habitat;
<p>
&#149; Reduce harm to all marine animals; 
<p>
&#149; Honor the close ties between a healthy ocean, coastal communities and continued fishing opportunities; and
<p>
&#149; Clear the way for sustainable fishing practices. 
<p>
It is time for the National Marine Fisheries Service to understand that an integrated healthy-ceans approach is needed in our federal waters to protect the world's most productive marine ecosystems. 
<p>
</ul>
