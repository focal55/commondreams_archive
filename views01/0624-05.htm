When world leaders meet this week to discuss the fight against
global AIDS, the real questions will be how to finance the war and who
will provide such financing, especially in Africa, where 70% of the
world's 35 million people living with HIV or AIDS are struggling to stay
alive. Unless the external debts of African countries are canceled
outright this year, any overall strategy to defeat AIDS will surely fail.
<p>To suggest that Africa can even survive the onslaught of AIDS with a
scattering of philanthropy, while continuing to pay far greater amounts
to international financial institutions, is a cruel fantasy.
<p>The Global AIDS Fund, launched in April by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, is an important vehicle for financing the treatment and prevention
activities necessary to defeat AIDS. Yet, as the world's richest
countries falter in coming forward with adequate contributions to reach
the fund's modest target of $10 billion, they are neglecting the most
obvious way to enable African countries to tackle the crisis themselves.
If the richest creditor nations and institutions in human history are
serious about confronting the worst plague in human history, they must
cancel Africa's debt and remove the major economic obstacle to African
efforts to fight AIDS.
<p>Africa's external debt now tops $300 billion, costing its governments
more than $13 billion annually in debt service payments. The result is
that they have paid more in debt service to the World Bank, International
Monetary Fund and rich governments during the past two decades than they
have received in development assistance or in new loans. As a result,
African governments have been forced to divert more and more money from
basic social services to the debts. Africa's debt burden has led to a
dramatic decline in human development indicators (such as life
expectancy) and an increase in extreme poverty and has contributed to the
loss of more than 16 million lives to AIDS.
<p>Debt cancellation would immediately permit a greater financial
commitment from African governments to tackle the crisis. At April's
HIV/AIDS summit in Abuja, Nigeria, African leaders demonstrated their
commitment to fighting the pandemic by agreeing on a target of spending
at least 15% of their national budgets on health, two or three times
current levels. A recent study of countries that have received some debt
relief illustrates that the majority of the resources freed up have gone
to health and education and to combating the AIDS crisis. Debt
cancellation would make a real difference.
<p>Canceling Africa's foreign debt is also affordable. Recent studies
show that the World Bank and IMF could easily absorb the write-off
without negatively affecting their credit rating, while the treasuries of
rich creditor countries already hold the debt on their books at a vastly
discounted rate (10% of the actual figure) in tacit acknowledgment that
poor countries will never be able to repay the full amount anyway.
<p>It is time to face facts. Money is being drained out of Africa far
more quickly than it is trickling in. Without definitive debt
cancellation, new funding to combat HIV/AIDS, while desperately needed,
will be wholly inadequate. Unless African governments control their own
resources and can direct spending toward health care infrastructure and
delivery systems and prevention and treatment programs, international
donations will do little in the face of the raging pandemic.
<p>If the debt is not canceled, the fight against AIDS in Africa will
surely be lost.
