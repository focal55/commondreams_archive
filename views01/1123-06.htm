As 2001 lurches to a close, Americans are edgy. And who can blame them? The Sept. 
11 terrorist attacks led to the Afghanistan war. Then came corporate bailouts 
and job cutbacks, anthrax spores, military-police build-ups, civil rights rollbacks 
and government censors. The corporate news media has reported these events but 
failed to clearly connect them to the current rot in the capitalist system. Thus 
the American public is being deprived of a socio-economic context for recent events. 
<p>The past is in the present. Consider one of the system’s previous responses 
to crises. In a word, fascism. Historically, fascism has emerged in a time of 
economic turbulence, featuring one political party of big business that relies 
partly on symbols and themes of national unity to mobilize the public. 
<p>Today there are surely signs of economic trouble that could encourage fascist-like 
responses. The American economy is the world’s largest and is now leading the 
world slowdown. The stock market bubble that helped drive the record U.S. economic 
expansion of the past decade is a shadow of its former self. Unemployment is increasing 
for American workers as corporate profits move south. U.S. consumer and corporate 
debt is unsustainable. 
<p>Prospects for global growth look bleak. “Recent figures from the WTO show that 
world trade will barely grow this year, if at all,” the Nov. 16 London Economist 
reported. Nations that rely on exports to America are being especially hard-hit. 
Gulliver sneezes and Lilliput gets sick. 
<p>Returning to historical fascism, Germany in 1933 isn't the U.S. today. Yet 
there are similarities. In Germany, fascism claimed to support workers but actually 
neutered them. In "Fascism and Big Business," Daniel Guerin detailed how Germany's 
National Socialism attacked and defeated unions. 
<p>Supported by Republicans and Democrats, the corporate-led war against organized 
labor is one reason the U.S. is simply off the charts when it comes to social 
indicators versus other First World nations. Here are two examples. Over 40 million 
Americans lack health care and two million Americans are locked up. 
<p>Fascism has arisen when a country’s ownership class resorts to military solutions 
when its profits are threatened by market competition. Guerin wrote, “There is, 
certainly, a direct link between war and fascism. They grow out of the same dungheap; 
they are, each in its own way, the monstrous products of the capitalist system 
in decline.” 
<p>During the fascist era, world trade basically ground to a halt. National economies 
spiraled downward during brutal competition for resources in what’s now called 
the Third World. The main global resource today, of course, is oil, the essential 
energy for the system, playing no small part of the war in Afghanistan. U.S. control 
of Middle East oil weakens Europe and Japan. They are the main competition for 
the U.S. 
<p>During the period that preceded World War II, global market competition led 
to worsening living conditions for the German and Italian working classes. Big 
businesses in those nations protected their profits by relying on a strong central 
government to support social movements which sounded egalitarian. In Germany and 
Italy, the moneyed few forced the working many to labor longer hours for less 
pay, then wage war to protect that wealth and the power it controlled. 
<p>Before Sept. 11 in the U.S., the drive to create low-wage work was well underway. 
Corporate America—through think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute—supported 
the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. Welfare “reform” in 
other words. Now that some former welfare recipients have jobs, the same corporate-funded 
institutions oppose a “living” wage, preferring some workers to sleep in their 
cars and use food banks to make ends meet. Confusing? Not to those who choose 
to see that the system is based on the growth of capital through the exploitation 
of labor. 
<p>To keep the public fearful since Sept. 11, U.S. politicians and pundits have 
been supporting an inquisition of sorts against darker people deemed to be dangerous. 
This came on the heels of government repression against the anti-corporate globalization 
protesters who publicly criticized the system’s major institutions such as the 
WTO and IMF. Creating a climate of fear in the name of security is a cloud cover 
to eliminate popular dissent. 
<p>On a related note, the U.S. government is protecting the profits of corporate 
America with taxpayer dollars. Some politicians call this “economic stimulus,” 
though the public’s economic security is becoming shakier. The taxpayer bailout 
of U.S. airlines that got billions then fired over 100,000 workers is a case in 
point of how the U.S. corporate-state functions, putting profits before people. 
<p>The airline bailout was a current example of a decades-long class conflict 
in the U.S. The American public has been abandoned by the Democratic Party for 
the nation’s financial and industrial elite. Their swollen wealth has come in 
part from the hides of the U.S. working-class. 
<p>A friend who lived through the fascist coup in Chile on Sept. 11, 1973, said 
America would get fascism before it got socialism. Some might say that U.S. socialism 
already exists—for the corporate and high-income class, fattened by years of public 
funds for research, development, patent and copyright protection. 
<p>Since Sept. 11, 2001, the U.S. government has increased its power over the 
public, which is funding the war in Afghanistan that feeds cash to sectors of 
corporate America. The U.S. population pays and big business benefits. Ben Franklin 
summed it up nicely. He wrote, “War is robbery, commerce is generally cheating.”
