With most polls showing that well over 80% of Americans support the
bombing in Afghanistan, I recognize that my position is indeed not
popular.  Nonetheless, I am obliged by my conscience to oppose this
action.

<p>Clearly the work of the terrorists on September 11, 2001 was shocking
and horrific and whoever is responsible should be brought to justice.  
I have always believed, however, that the pursuit and capture of
murderous criminals should be accomplished with the least amount of
violence possible.  We Americans rely on that principle every day in
cities and towns across our nation.  We generally do not accept the
bombing of an entire building or city, and the death of scores of
innocent persons, in the pursuit of a criminal.  Fortunately, our law
enforcement professionals do not have policies that allow for that type
of "overkill" either.  The incidents at the MOVE house in Philadelphia
and at the Koresh Compound in Waco are two exceptions where law
enforcement did use massive force to capture a wanted person or
persons.  In both cases, massive property damage and the death of many
innocent men, women, and children were the result.  Most people have
come to see both of those events as examples of law enforcement
overstepping its reach and failing to be patient and creative in their
effort.  

<p>Now back to Afghanistan.  Why do we hold a different standard when the
situation is half a world away?  I don't understand why we are willing
to allow our tax dollars and our sons and daughters to be used to kill
innocent civilians and to level towns and cities in one of the poorest
nations on earth.   Sure, we'd all like to see Bin Laden and his gang
brought to justice, if they are responsible.  But is it worth billions
of dollars, risking our sons and daughters in combat, and killing (even
accidentally) innocent families while they rest in the safety of their
own homes?  

<p>Could we not have been more patient, developed better intelligence about
Bin Laden's whereabouts, and then sent in a massive "SWAT-like" team of
military commandos to capture him?  It seems we should have at least
tried something along these lines before we just went in and started
tearing a country apart.  

<p>Relief agencies are announcing, with increasing alarm, that millions of
Afghan men, women, and children are at extreme risk of dying of
starvation and exposure in the coming weeks of winter.  Many of them are
living in refugee camps along the borders with Iran and Pakistan, where
they have fled to escape the bombing campaign.  Many others who have
stayed in Afghanistan do not have adequate shelter, food supplies, and
clean water.  The bombs have caused this situation.  Isn't it at least
our responsibility to do as much for these persons as we're doing to try
to capture Bin Laden?  Sure the U.S. government is making a contribution
to this effort.  But relief agencies on the ground say the need is much
greater than what the U.S. government is offering.  We Americans ARE the
U.S. government and the bombs being dropped are paid for by our tax
dollars.  That makes us responsible.  Should we not, at least, be
pressing our elected officials to also spend a sufficient amount of our
money in bringing aid to the Afghan people who are as innocent, and in
equally great need, as the persons whose lives were shattered in New
York, Washington, and Pennsylvania on September 11th?   

<p>George Bush recognized this need, when he encouraged America's children
to contribute a dollar to help Afghan children who are affected by the
war.  The need, however, is much greater.  There are two things every
U.S. citizen could do to help.  First, contact your U.S. Representative
and Senators and ask them to do more to aid the innocent Afghan people. 
Secondly, you can make direct contributions of money, food, and
blankets, to one of the non-governmental relief operations.  Detailed
information about how to do this can be found at the websites of the
American Friends Service Committee (<a href="http://www.afsc.org/mediarel.htm" target="_new">www.afsc.org/mediarel.htm</a>) and the
Mennonite Central Committee (<a href="http://www.mennonitecc.ca" target="_new">www.mennonitecc.ca</a>).
