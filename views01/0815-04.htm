            <p> If St. Paul was right, that the wages of sin is death, is it a 

              stretch to say that the wages of the sin of white supremacy is the 

              death of colorblindness?<BR>

              <br>

              To suggest such a thing, I'm sure, makes a good number of white 

              brothers and sisters uneasy, thinking perhaps: "Black Americans 

              have deserted Dr. King's dream where people are judged by the content 

              of their character and not by the color of their skin."<BR>

              <br>

              Forget that King, just before his death, called for affirmative 

              action in his <img align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 src=images/seanlogo.jpg width=94 height=124 border=0>last 

              book, "Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?" His "dream" 

              wasn't that everyone would not recognize color, but that skin pigmentation 

              would not be used as the key measure of human potential.<BR>

              <br>

              King wasn't so naive to think a society steeped in centuries of 

              white supremacy would be magically transformed into a colorblind 

              utopia. I'm not suggesting that affirmative action is our salvation, 

              but neither is it "reverse racism" that some opponents claim.<BR>

              <br>

              A hard-working white person is sure to raise the question: Why should 

              I be made to "pay" for America's past racial sins? Evidently, voluntary 

              cooperation is not an option.<BR>

              <br>

              In a nation where the majority of its citizens are at least nominally-affiliated 

              Christians, it seems such questions are more knee-jerk deflection 

              than thoughtful reflection.<BR>

              <br>

              Eating of the fruit produced by sinful forbears is to partake in 

              the original sin, according to one of the central tenets of the 

              Christian faith.<BR>

              <br>

              Deuteronomy 5:9 says: "I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting 

              the iniquity of the fathers upon the children of the third and fourth 

              generation of them that hate me."<BR>

              <br>

              The point here isn't to promulgate evangelical Christianity. That's 

              Cal Thomas' job. I just find it hard to believe that people in a 

              Christian-saturated society are perplexed by the idea of paying 

              for sins committed by previous generations.<BR>

              <br>

              I haven't come across any studies that document how much wealth 

              black slaves were robbed of by two centuries of unpaid servitude, 

              laboring in the cotton industry - an industry central to America's 

              early economic success.<BR>

              <br>

              But, several years ago a University of California at Berkeley study 

              found that the value of lost income to black Americans because of 

              discrimination between 1929 and 1969 alone comes to about $1.6 trillion.<BR>

              <br>

              So contrary to Thomas Sowell's distortions, the idea of reparations 

              is not about convincing "people whose ancestors arrived in America 

              after the Civil War that they owe anybody anything for what happened 

              in the ante-bellum South." Clearly, black economic deprivation goes 

              far beyond the Civil War and the ante-bellum South.<BR>

              <br>

              It was after slavery that America allowed the Black Codes - a set 

              of laws designed to restrict the labor mobility of the newly freed 

              slaves, guaranteeing cheap labor for white planters. One code stipulated 

              that any freed slave without "lawful employment" would be subject 

              to arrest and then be leased to a white employer.<BR>

              <br>

              So there is a qualitative and quantitative difference between the 

              economic hardships faced by black America and those confronted by 

              every other immigrant group in this nation's history.<BR>

              <br>

              Check the history of U.S. housing market, for starters. Ford Foundation 

              member Dr. Melvin Oliver observes how many of his white colleagues 

              were able to buy a house because of a transfer of assets before 

              the death of their parents. This down payment on their homes was 

              a benefit available to few blacks because of bank red-lining and 

              other such policies.<BR>

              <br>

              Oliver also notes the central role Uncle Sam played in creating 

              a strong white middle class with the GI Bill and federal subsidies 

              of mortgages, to name just a few privileges inaccessible to most 

              blacks at the time.<BR>

              <br>

              As you read these words, state universities across America are looking 

              to replicate a new admissions approach at the University of California 

              at San Diego - hiring high school guidance counselors to review 

              the overwhelming number of applications they receive.<BR>

              <br>

              One of these counselors, moonlighting as an admissions officer, 

              is from Eastlake High School in San Diego - not exactly a bastion 

              of the underprivileged.<BR>

              <br>

              "The counselor, Nancy Nieto, gets inside information that students 

              crave: the outline for the perfect essay (and) the 'right' high 

              school classes," the Boston Globe reported last week.<BR>

              <br>

              "It's really interesting to see what other applicants write in their 

              essays, and how they write," Nieto told the Globe. "My kids can 

              compete better. I know what to tell them to put down."<BR>

              <br>

              As that story illustrates, all across America there is an informal 

              social network that gives whites preferential treatment in gaining 

              access to a limited range of economic opportunities. Can colorblindness 

              really be the answer, when, in a race-obsessed society, it renders 

              white-skin privilege invisible?
