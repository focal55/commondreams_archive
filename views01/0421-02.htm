As the waters of the Mississippi River crest and engulf towns in
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa, media attention highlights the heroic
efforts of midwestern citizens to stem the flooding.  With the
mobilization of local, state, and federal resources, these
overwhelmingly white residents are aided in their attempts to salvage
something of their threatened situation.
<p>Farther downstream from the banks of the Mississippi but on one of
its tributaries, the Ohio River, another disaster has seemingly come to
a close.  In the aftermath of the murder by a Cincinnati policeman of an
unarmed young African-American, Timothy Thomas, some black residents
exploded in rage and “rioted” for several days.  However, instead of
sympathy being extended to those whose emotions overflowed the natural
dikes of benign neglect, the “rioters” were denounced as violent and
out-of-control thugs.  There were no concerted efforts by federal,
state, or local authorities to deal with the underlying causes; only the
predictable condemnations by those in power and those blind to the
righteous anger of black citizens of Cincinnati.
<p>Part of the blindness to what African-Americans across the country
are up against with police brutality, racial profiling, and continuing
institutional discrimination and indifference inheres in the
invisibility of race as a factor in public policy.  Such invisibility
feeds what is construed as natural and unnatural disasters and what can
be done to alleviate the concomitant suffering.
<p>The privileging of white citizens at the federal level has often
hidden behind governmental policies on housing, public works, and relief
programs.  From the New Deal’s exclusion of black farm workers from
Social Security to federal housing programs that reinforced restrictive
covenants to highway construction that aided white flight and destroyed
black neighborhoods, whites have benefited at the expense of the
continuing disadvantaging of blacks.  Even so-called affirmative action
programs have had a greater impact on white woman than people of color.
No wonder many African-Americans still feel that “if you’re white,
you’re alright; if you’re black, get back!”
<p>Hence, when it comes to the recent flooding, no one questions why
people continue to live on flood plains, getting federal and state
assistance to fend off a “natural” disaster like flooding.  But what if
the situation were reversed?  What if the overwhelming number of people
affected by the flooding were African-Americans? Would they be exempt
from criticism of their stupidity for living on dangerous flood plains?
Would they be excoriated for getting government handouts to help them
pull themselves up by their water bootstraps?
<p>And what if an overwhelming black police force was shooting down
unarmed whites in city after city with no major change in policing
practices?  What if white males were constantly harassed by the police
and security guards because of alleged suspicious behavior?  What if the
media persistently pathologized white music and white youths as
potential dangerous predators who needed to be censored and controlled?
<p>So, what is natural and unnatural in all of this?  Are we destined
as a nation to turn a blind eye to the lingering vicious repercussions
of the invisibility of whiteness and the visibility of a blackness?  How
much longer do we ignore the sign of “no more flood, the fire next time”
before we are all engulfed in a conflagration of our own making?
