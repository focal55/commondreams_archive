NEW YORK -- I am hiding in my house in the heart of an Arab neighborhood in  Brooklyn, four miles from the terror that struck Manhattan. As an Afghan-American, I fear the retaliation in the aftermath of the tragedy.
<P>

<p>If this act of war is like Pearl Harbor, will Arabs and Afghans living in  America become targets of hate as Japanese-Americans did during World War II?
<P>



<p>From the roof of my brownstone home, I watched the billowing smoke darken  the sky above the World Trade Center. I heard the sirens, the screams of  victims falling to their deaths, and the rage that New Yorkers expressed afterwards. Americans are angry - rightly so - and want someone to  blame and attack. But I shudder thinking of the innocent Muslims who could be the victims of this fury.
<P>



<p>On New York radio stations, callers shouted slurs against Afghans and  Arabs, demanded they be killed, and called for war against Afghanistan,  whose rulers are suspected perpetrators of the attack. I turned off the  radio and in a daze walked to the Promenade, where people stood looking at  the disaster across the East River. Some held any extra fabric over their  mouths to block the fumes and stench of burning steel. A man appearing to  be in his 20s said to a friend, ''These damn Islamic people in this  country should be under surveillance. They're getting away with too  much.''
<P>



<p>In bars where patrons crowded to watch TV, men and women clapped as President Bush swore to seek revenge.
<P>



<p>I paced back home with my two Muslim friends, locked the door, and sat still in shock. I hoped no one on our street knew that Muslims live in the house. Ever since the Taliban seized my birthplace, Afghanistan and  Afghans have become the butt of slurs, jokes, and ridicule. But stereotyping and verbal attacks are not my fear anymore. The magnitude of this tragedy may provoke violence against Muslim and especially Afghan  communities in this country. Few listen to the warnings by the media that  Americans should not convict any group without proof.
<P>



<p>I think back to the Gulf War, when Americans unleashed their anger on  Muslims. Then in high school, I was a dumbfounded teenager when we were  called ''camel jockey'' and ''Maddas lover'' - Saddam Hussein's first name  spelled backwards. Now I am more scared, knowing how vicious the usually  tolerant American can become in times of crises.
<P>



<p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani deployed more police officers to Muslim  neighborhoods, which makes me feel safer. But for how long? As the story  unravels, Osama bin Laden is at the top of the suspect list, and  Americans' call to bomb his residence, Afghanistan, gets louder. I quietly  weep when I think of the fate of hapless Afghan civilians who will suffer  the consequences if the accusations against bin Laden are true.
<P>



<p>I wonder if Americans know that the rage they are feeling today is what  Palestinians and Muslims across the world feel every day against the  American government. Every time there has been an attack against Americans, the government focuses on retribution and prevention but pays  little attention to changing its policies such as indifference to the  loss of Palestinian lives.
<P>



<p>There is no justification for Tuesday's terrorist attacks, but increasing  security at airports and catching the culprits are short-term Band-Aids  that will probably not stop these disasters. Reconsidering American policies and creating a consistent and fair approach to deal with other  nations is a long-term solution.
<P>



<p>As a hybrid of Afghanistan and the United States, I am angry not with a  nationality or group but with fanaticism and the injustice of hegemony.
<P>



<p>I hope that the American people will be more tolerant than their government toward Muslims, inside and outside America.
<P>
