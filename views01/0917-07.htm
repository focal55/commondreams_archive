The recent terror attacks in New York and Washington, DC were barbaric.  My 
heart goes out to all the victims, their families and friends.  At the same 
time, I fear that the military response of the U.S. government will fan the 
flames of barbarism.

<p>History shows that wars bring not peace but more wars. The past, as William 
Faulkner said, is never past.

<p>The American colonies, which successfully revolted against the British 
Empire, cut their teeth waging wars of extermination against the First 
Americans.  They lost their land and lives at the hands of the colonists.  
These former Europeans dehumanized native peoples as savages who deserved 
such barbaric treatment.

<p>Later, the U.S. government facilitated more barbarism against the First 
Americans.  Case in point is the Gold Rush.  It spelled disaster for the 
Northern Sierra Miwok when European-Americans rushed in searching for gold.

<p>Also treated as sub-human in the U.S were the enslaved Africans.  Their 
stolen labor and lives were central to the national and global economy.  The 
institution of American slavery was barbarism.

<p>Chattel slavery officially ended with the Civil War, yet the U.S. 
government’s promise of “forty acres and a mule” for freed slaves never 
materialized.  Those not racially profiled into prison labor became 
America’s lowest-paid hourly workers.  Such super-exploitation continues 
today.

<p>In the 20th century, the past pattern of population eradication and 
extermination within the U.S. borders expanded.  Modern barbarism took the 
form of World War I, “the war to end all wars.”  Instead, this carnage paved 
the way for fascism and World War II.

<p>World War II brought new techniques of war.  Civilians were slaughtered in  
death camps and by atomic bombs.  Millions of people in the Soviet Union 
lost their lives saving the world from fascism.  Significantly, death and 
destruction during World War II did not happen in the U.S.

<p>What emerged from humanity’s most destructive war ever was a new global 
order.  The U.S. replaced Britain as the leading power.  Uncle Sam now ruled 
the roost.  Yet what followed was not peace but more wars, hot and cold, 
throughout the Third World.

<p>The U.S. government ended dozens of national liberation movements through 
violence.  Such independence movements were misrepresented to the American 
public as examples of Chinese and Soviet communist influence.

<p>One example of many U.S. military interventions was the CIA-led removal of 
Patrice Lumumba from his political leadership in Congo/Zaire.  His call for 
independent development was a threat to corporate America and its need for 
cadmium, copper, diamonds, gold, hydroelectric power and uranium at 
fire-sale prices.

<p>Around the same time, a confrontation between the governments of America and 
the former Soviet Union during the Cuban missile crisis nearly caused a 
nuclear exchange.  Life on Earth hung in the balance.  Luckily, cooler heads 
prevailed.

<p>With the fall of the former Soviet Union, humanity supposedly entered a new 
era of peace and prosperity.  The Evil Empire was no more, and the triumph 
of capitalism over communism was final.  All good things were now possible 
for the greatest good.

<p>Ominously, however, the permanent wartime economy of the U.S. remained.  
Militarism enforces capitalism.  The people of the Third World don’t 
willingly submit to theft and murder by the rich and powerful.

<p>After World War II, America’s dependence on oil rose.  Oil is the mother’s 
milk of world capitalism, now accounting for about 95 percent of the energy 
used in the global economy.  The U.S., with nearly 300 million people, 
consumes about 25 percent of the world's oil, located mainly in the Middle 
East.

<p>Today as the global economic slowdown spreads, conflicts within and among 
nations, decided through the market, are growing.  These conflicts—sometimes 
expressed religiously—flow generally from strife over resources and trade.  
This, in turn, increases militarism, racism and sexism.  The politically 
powerless—from Serbia to Sing Sing, Cambodia to Compton—suffer accordingly.

<p>Strikingly, the vast majority of people need new institutions based on 
cooperation instead of competition.  Current institutions create a few 
winners and many losers.  Competition breeds desperation.  Desperate people 
act desperately.

<p>By contrast, cooperation is the natural condition of human beings, I 
believe.  Civilization would have ended a long time ago if people hadn’t 
been able to cooperate with one another in ways big and small.  The removal 
of this thought from the public mind in the U.S. is  stunning.

<p>As I write these words, I mourn for those whose lives ended in Tuesday's 
barbaric attacks in the U.S.  They deserved to live.  Yet so did Iraqis 
dying under the U.S.-led U.N. economic sanctions and Colombians perishing 
from the U.S.-directed war of drug eradication.

<p>Given last Tuesday’s carnage in New York and Washington, DC, the Bush 
administration’s call for war is predictable.  But it must be rejected by 
those with a different view of patriotism.  U.S. patriots can wage peace.

<p>Security ends where violence begins in America and worldwide.  Indeed, 
that’s a lesson humanity and its institutions must heed sooner than later if 
there is to be a future worth living.
