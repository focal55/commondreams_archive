The Bush Administration's energy proposal
is the latest in a series of initiatives that give
"transparency" in government a whole new
meaning. Campaign contributors are cashing in on
their investments, and every week is "payback"
week.

         <p>It's taken quite a stretch to use electricity
shortages as an excuse for drilling the Artic
National Wildlife Refuge, but George W. Bush and
Dick Cheney are making a heroic effort. So what if
only 3 percent or our electricity comes from oil?
The more relevant number here is 78 percent: that's
how much of the oil and gas industry's record $32.6
million contribution went to Republicans in the last
election cycle.

         <p>The Administration's arguments about
energy security don't hold up much better. Drilling
the Wildlife Refuge full of oil wells would not have
much impact on oil or gasoline prices, since oil
prices are determined in a world market.

         <p>The supply impact would be minimal and no
different from oil obtained anywhere else in the
world; and OPEC could always cut back production
to compensate for it. Of course, if we were really
concerned about long-term energy security, the best
strategy would be to leave the oil in the ground, in
case imports are not so readily available some day.

         <p>But this is not energy planning -- if it were,
we'd see more than the token one-tenth of one
percent of our energy dollars allocated to
developing renewable energy sources such as solar
and wind. Or conservation: five of the nation's top
laboratories have estimated that we can reduce the
growth in electricity demand by 20 to 47 percent by
increasing energy efficiency.

         <p>These scientists didn't get any face time with
Dick Cheney when the secretive Energy
Development Task Force -- dubbed the "Alaska
jihad" by its leaders -- put together the
Administration's proposal. But Kenneth Lay,
chairman of Enron Corp. got a half hour with the
Vice President to lobby for what he wanted.

         <p>The proposal sees deregulation -- the cause
of California's soaring electricity prices -- as the
way of the future. And why not? Consumers got
fleeced for billions of dollars, and a good chunk of
it went to Enron -- an excellent return on their $1.7
million contribution to Republicans in the last
election, as well as their long-term investments in
Mr. Bush's political career.

         <p>There will be no price caps to protect
consumers from the effects of deregulation, even
though the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
has the power to do that, and even to force a
refunding of money already ripped off.

         <p>There will be no closing of the loophole that
allows SUV's and pick-up trucks to be exempt from
Federal mileage standards -- just ask White House
Chief of Staff Andrew Card, former chief lobbyist
for the auto industry.

         <p>The Administration's energy policy seems to
be based on the same strategy as its economic
policy. Faced with a real short-term problem, do
nothing to resolve it, but use it to sell long-term
changes that reward your friends. The Bush tax cut
will do little or nothing to counter the current
economic slowdown, instead rewriting the tax code
to give hundreds of billions of dollars to the richest
people in America over the next decade.

         <p>Then there was the bankruptcy bill: a timely
gift to credit card companies at the expense of
millions of people (median income: $22,000) who
are unable to make ends meet -- mostly due to loss
of a job, poor health, or divorce. Kick 'em while
they're down. The credit card giant MBNA was the
largest corporate contributor to the Bush campaign.

         <p>Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical companies
have been using their clout to block a universal
Medicare prescription drug benefit. And the Wall
Street firms that would rake in billions from
privatizing Social Security got one of the most
stacked presidential commissions in history --
unanimously pro-privatization -- to fix a problem
that doesn't even exist.

         <p>That's how our free market election system
works: you vote with your dollars. President Bush
has made it easier than ever to "follow the money,"
but the media has been mostly kind to him.
Alternating between the confused look of a student
who knows he is faking it, and that impish gleam,
he has charmed the press and rides high in the polls.

         <p>And he does deliver some good jokes. "You
can fool some of the people all of the time -- Mr.
Bush quipped at a Washington dinner -- "and those
are the ones you want to concentrate on."

         <p>Too bad he wasn't kidding.
