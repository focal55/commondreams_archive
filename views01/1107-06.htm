The 
        hijackings and mass murders of September 11 were horrible and momentous, 
        but the world did not suddenly change on that crystal-clear morning. Existing 
        cracks in the US-led world order widened and deepened, and lurking insecurities 
        strode forth from the shadows. The current spectacle of the world's richest 
        country bombing Afghanistan -- where the average life expectancy is 43 
        -- cannot resolve the crisis of global governance sharpened so painfully 
        on September 11, whether or not the US achieves its military objectives 
        of capturing or killing alleged mastermind Osama bin Laden and ridding 
        the country of the thuggish Taliban.</font>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the US and abroad, 
        opposition to the war, however nuanced, is kept outside the sphere of 
        legitimate politics by the Manichean rhetoric of the Bush administration 
        and the security forces of its client regimes. Most of all, the September 
        11 attacks highlight the inadequacy and danger of this approach to managing 
        the contradictions generated by the imbalance of global power.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>GIANT STEP BACKWARD</b></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At home, reactionary 
        agendas of all sorts received a shot in the arm. In Congress, only Barbara 
        Lee (D-CA) balked at granting the most hawkish administration in years 
        unlimited war and emergency powers. Defense Department boondoggles which 
        might have met their timely demise before September 11 have been resurrected: 
        faulty warplanes, like the crash-prone V-22 Osprey and the already outmoded 
        F-22 fighter, might learn to fly again. The Pentagon could get a $66 billion 
        increase in its budget over last year when all the boodle is tallied. 
        The right wing of the Justice Department easily secured expanded surveillance 
        and interrogation powers it has been seeking for years. Racial profiling 
        shed its hard-won opprobrium in public opinion, Congress allowed law enforcement 
        officials to detain immigrants indefinitely without charging them and 
        George W. Bush spotted loopholes in the 25-year ban on CIA assassinations. 
        The hijackers helped the mandarins of the national security state cross 
        several items off their wish list.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The economic stimulus 
        package passed by the House of Representatives in late October (and in 
        the Senate at press time) reveals the extent of corporate influence in 
        the Bush administration. With thousands of people newly unemployed -- 
        including many rendered jobless by the World Trade Center catastrophe 
        -- in the shell-shocked economy, conservative Republicans rammed through 
        a bill that distributes most of the stimulus in the form of retroactive 
        tax rebates for multinational corporations. Common Cause projects that 
        the top 14 corporate contributors of soft money to 2000 election campaigns 
        would get $6.3 billion in refunded taxes if the House bill became law. 
        (That's nearly $19 to corporations for every dollar the US is spending 
        on relief efforts for Afghan refugees.) Senate resistance may dilute the 
        worst provisions of the House package, but the final bill will certainly 
        be a giant step backward for social justice in the US.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OPPORTUNITY SQUANDERED</b></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The global outpouring 
        of sympathy for the deaths of over 5,000 civilians gave the US a unique 
        opportunity to mobilize genuine international support for what should 
        still be the overriding US objective: finding the planners and abettors 
        of the attacks and trying them through mechanisms of international law. 
        The US could have classified the attacks as crimes against humanity and 
        reduced the international cynicism that normally greets US invocations 
        of that phrase. Even now, international opinion might support a carefully 
        targeted US commando operation to capture planners and abettors hiding 
        in Afghanistan, if convincing evidence of their guilt were to be presented. 
        But from the moment that Bush declared the September 11 atrocities &quot;acts 
        of war&quot; against &quot;freedom and democracy,&quot; the administration 
        tacitly declared that US responses would not be based on procedural norms 
        of legal justice. In doing so, the White House squandered an opportunity 
        to build bridges. Instead, the Bush administration has generated a narrative 
        of war dividing the world into two irreconcilable forces: &quot;us&quot; 
        and &quot;them.&quot; &quot;Us&quot; means those who unequivocally support 
        the US-led &quot;war on terrorism.&quot; &quot;They&quot; are those who 
        question or oppose the war for any reason, including lack of sufficient 
        information to blindly sanction bombing in Afghanistan. The image of the 
        US as global bully, so readily exploited by bin Laden and his demagogic 
        ilk, has been perilously enhanced. As details of Afghan civilian deaths 
        from errant US missiles trickle into the press, the efforts of Donald 
        Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice to market the war on al-Jazeera appear mordantly 
        insensitive to cold realities.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On September 25, 
        the Bush administration scoffed again at international law when it announced 
        support for the so-called American Servicemembers Protection Act, a brainchild 
        of Jesse Helms designed to short-circuit the planned International Criminal 
        Court, to which President Bill Clinton grudgingly signed on immediately 
        before leaving office. Helms's bill authorizes the executive branch to 
        use &quot;all means necessary&quot; to remove US citizens or allies accused 
        of war crimes or crimes against humanity from the Court's custody. Meanwhile, 
        Bush's trade representative Robert Zoellick, seeking fast-track authority 
        for a new round of World Trade Organization negotiations before the November 
        9 ministerial meeting in Qatar, averred that US-style neoliberalism &quot;promotes 
        the values at the heart of this protracted struggle&quot; against terrorism. 
        Developing countries which might have resisted a new round in Doha will 
        now think twice, lest the US place them on the wrong side of the &quot;us 
        versus them&quot; divide.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>FLASHPOINT</b></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most commonplace 
        observation since the attacks, through the start of bombing and the anthrax 
        scare, is that &quot;everything has changed.&quot; Other commentators, 
        noting the &quot;us versus them&quot; rhetoric, and the sheepish tone 
        of most domestic dissent to the war and its attendant rollbacks of democracy, 
        observed that the post-September 11 geopolitical climate recalls the early 
        Cold War. Rushing to construct a viable coalition to &quot;defend democracy&quot; 
        from al-Qaeda, the US has shored up its alliances with notably anti-democratic 
        leaders -- Musharraf in Pakistan, Sharon in Israel, Mubarak in Egypt -- 
        and even found a new dictator to coddle in Uzbekistan. With the world's 
        attention focused on caves in the Hindu Kush, these leaders (as in Russia, 
        Turkey and elsewhere) may seize the anti-terrorist mantle to crush legitimate 
        political opposition. Authoritarian rule may be particularly strengthened 
        in the Arab world. In the US, commentators are largely unable to transcend 
        a narrow nationalist discourse in their prescriptions for a just response 
        to the September 11 events: the US must pursue planners and abettors of 
        the attacks not because killing civilians is a crime, but because the 
        US must defend itself from the outside world. When even Richard Falk, 
        long-time champion of international law, justifies opening Operation Enduring 
        Freedom in not so dissimilar terms in The Nation, the Cold War comparison 
        seems an accurate description indeed of the present moment. For many reasons, 
        however, both the sentiment that everything has changed and the Cold War 
        comparison lack analytical utility.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rather than ushering 
        in an entirely new era, the September 11 attacks and the war on terrorism 
        mark a flashpoint in the ongoing crisis of the unipolar world order. The 
        US presides (or pretends to) over a world racked by poverty, growing inequality, 
        sectarian strife and environmental degradation, but seems scarcely disturbed 
        by the contradictions. In the 1990s, US unilateralism showed itself in 
        the pursuit of unpopular policy goals like harsh sanctions on Iraq, generous 
        military aid to Israel and compulsory structural adjustment for indebted 
        economies, matched by the obstruction of more popular initiatives on everything 
        from the International Criminal Court to environmental protections to 
        arms control.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The current US retaliation 
        depends for domestic support on extrapolating the hijackers' presumed 
        antipathy beyond two of the most visible symbols of American corporate 
        and military power. Precisely this transformation occurred in the media 
        within hours: these were not attacks on the World Trade Center and the 
        Pentagon, but attacks on &quot;all of America.&quot; Those who died on 
        September 11 were certainly normal people just going to work, but it would 
        be naive to ignore what these buildings signify to the many people in 
        the world who live on the other side of the US superpower equation. Saddening 
        displays of resentful glee in the Middle East and not so subtle shrugs 
        of ambivalence across the developing world bespeak a widespread feeling 
        that the US is an overweening empire that finally tasted the violence 
        and despair endured elsewhere as a matter of course.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>REGISTERS OF ISLAM</b></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Media analysis has 
        been dominated by the dubious terms proposed in the early 1990s by Samuel 
        Huntington: &quot;the clash of civilizations.&quot; War debriefings, administration 
        spokespersons, editorials and talk shows return to the theme that the 
        roots of the conflict are to be found in Islam. In turn, imam after imam 
        has been coerced to step forward to denounce bin Laden and insist that 
        Islam is not a religion of violence. But crucial as it is to reject racist 
        representations of Islam, which contains a robust array of intellectual, 
        theological and cultural traditions, it should be important to avoid apologetics 
        that deny any connection between the perpetrators and Islam. As Khaled 
        Abou El Fadl argues in the forthcoming issue of Middle East Report, the 
        language of extreme violence and intolerance repudiates the indeterminacy 
        and generosity of the classical interpretive tradition. Moreover, he contends, 
        this repudiation finds echoes in contemporary Islamic discourses much 
        nearer the mainstream, including a state-sponsored discourse in Saudi 
        Arabia.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Additionally, it 
        is important to recognize the degree to which Islam has been a register 
        of political opposition, not only to the despotism and corruption of various 
        Arab regimes, but also to US and Israeli hegemony in the region. The question 
        usually asked -- &quot;What in Islam has led to these events?&quot; -- 
        needs to be replaced by another: &quot;What about the modern history of 
        the Middle East has led political opposition to take a decidedly religious 
        form?&quot; Part of the answer is to be found in the politics of state-building 
        and modernization in the region. &quot;Moderate&quot; secular states -- 
        such as Algeria, Israel, Egypt, Turkey or Iran under the Shah -- began 
        with the premise that Islam was a problem to be overcome or coopted. In 
        such countries, numerous laws confining, suppressing or monopolizing the 
        public practice of Islam helped to transform religion into the focal point 
        for political struggle. That Islamist activists under these regimes have 
        been jailed, exiled, tortured and executed for their beliefs has done 
        little to advance the cause of secularism.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>CRISIS MANAGEMENT</b></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another vital part 
        of the answer is to be found, not surprisingly, in US Cold War policy 
        in the region. During the 1970s and 1980s, the US was not embarrassed 
        by the Saudi regime's Wahhabism. To the contrary, policymakers quietly 
        promoted it as a counterbalance to the popularity of Arab socialism. With 
        a wink and a nod from the US, autocrats from Morocco to Pakistan, from 
        Egypt to Yemen, eagerly sought Saudi support in smashing the Arab and 
        Muslim left. Sadat's policy of unleashing Islamist activists on Nasserist 
        groups in the universities and Numeiri's anti-communist Islamist politics 
        were convenient in the fight against Soviet influences in the region. 
        Finally, of course, the largest CIA operation of the 1980s -- propping 
        up the military junta of Zia ul Haq in Pakistan and funding, with the 
        Saudis, holy warriors to fight a proxy war in Afghanistan -- relied on 
        the manufacture of Islamist insurgency in the region. The Taliban and 
        bin Laden both drew succor from this tangled US-Saudi-Pakistani nexus. 
        But religiously inflected anti-Western violence is not simply &quot;blowback&quot; 
        from US adventurism in the Middle East. Cold War imperatives converged 
        with the interests of regional players, particularly the Saudis, who gained 
        so much in regional clout via the export of Wahhabi doctrines. In Afghanistan, 
        both the Saudis and the Pakistani military sought to curb the influence 
        of revolutionary Iran, an objective that also coincided with US goals. 
        In the end, the hijackers who plowed airliners into the World Trade Center, 
        the Pentagon and rural Pennsylvania are the human detritus of the failed 
        strategies of the US, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and lesser regional players 
        to contain both leftist and Islamist threats to the status quo.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly, the responses 
        of these players to the hijackings augur ill for regional stability. To 
        the world's misfortune, the White House is now occupied by men and women 
        who believe that US unilateralism is a virtue as well as a necessity. 
        The patina of evangelical Christianity coating the administration's policy 
        pronouncements is revealing: Bush's use of the word &quot;crusade&quot; 
        to describe the war on terrorism was more than just a public relations 
        faux pas. If anything, the attacks bolstered the hard-line unilateralists 
        in the Bush administration, and deepened their willingness to turn a blind 
        eye to the excesses of allies who claim to be fighting terrorism. Administration 
        hawks talk loudly of widening the war to encompass Saddam Hussein's Iraq. 
        The Saudi princes accept Bush's assurances that media scrutiny of US reliance 
        on the Kingdom's oil will not diminish Washington's enthusiasm for the 
        US-Saudi relationship. Taking into account the simultaneous aid packages 
        to Israel and pledges of support to &quot;moderate&quot; Arab regimes, 
        US Middle East policy looks on track to maintain tightly and precariously 
        managed conflict in the region.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, the generals 
        in Islamabad will not cooperate with US-sponsored nation-building in Afghanistan 
        unless they handpick the nation-builders. Scant days after Operation Enduring 
        Freedom commenced, the phrase &quot;moderate Taliban&quot; had already 
        crept into official US prognostications about Afghanistan's political 
        future. Neither these curious apparitions nor the US-backed Northern Alliance 
        are likely to accommodate all the ethnic groups represented among Afghanistan's 
        four million refugees or ameliorate the now notorious persecution of Afghan 
        women. (The frisson of American activism dramatizing the plight of women 
        under Taliban rule must seem odd to Afghan mothers made refugees by US 
        bombing.) More to the point, continued US-Pakistani interference in Afghan 
        politics does not seem likely to contribute to long-term security in either 
        Afghanistan or Pakistan. Seen from the vantage point of containment strategies, 
        the war on terrorism so far appears to be little more than a panicked 
        exercise in crisis management.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As governments worldwide 
        place national security above all else, the glimmers of internationalism 
        espied in the 1990s are fading. Internationalist ventures -- both official 
        ones like the International Criminal Court and bottom-up surges like the 
        post-Seattle global justice movement -- face a newly ambient nationalism 
        and a rejuvenated right-wing power structure. Public discourse continually 
        asks why &quot;they&quot; hate &quot;us&quot; without stopping to ponder 
        the categories. That the Bush administration has chosen this path is doubly 
        damning: the September 11 disasters could have presented a rare chance 
        to steer global power dynamics onto a distinctly less ominous course.</font></p>
