The World Series provided a heck of a photo-op for George W. Bush 
when he threw out the first pitch one night, aiming at a large TV audience. 
For the most part, the game that followed was a pleasure to watch -- midway 
through a week that combined what's best and worst about major league 
baseball in an era of compulsive media spin.

         <p>Baseball may not quite be America's favorite sport anymore, but it 
still has plenty of emotional resonance. For that reason, politicians and 
corporations alike are eager to graft themselves onto the climactic games 
of the post-season.

         <p>The 2001 World Series attracted an abundance of the commercial 
hype that we've come to expect from pro sports, plus a gauntlet of 
patriotic imagery bordering on jingoism. The play-by-play included a steady 
flood of brand-name plugs -- "Budweiser, the official beer of Major League 
Baseball," the John Hancock "In Game Box Score," the "Nextel Call to the 
Bullpen" -- along with frequent overlays of Old Glory.

         <p>This time around, the final games of the baseball season took 
place in a wartime flag-waving context. The historic media moment was 
captured by a frequently seen Wranglers commercial, which aired halfway 
through the seventh inning on the night that President Bush got his 
photo-op at Yankee Stadium.

         <p>That jeans ad starts with the American flag on the screen and the 
well-known opening chords of Creedence Clearwater Revival's song "Fortunate 
Son." Moments later, the lyrics begin: "Some folks are born, made to wave 
the flag / Ooh, they're red, white and blue..."

         <p>But then -- suddenly -- the soundtrack of the song drops out of 
the commercial. No more words can be heard after "red, white and blue." The 
next lines are missing: "And when the band plays 'Hail to the Chief' / They 
point the cannon right at you."

         <p>There you have it, in miniature -- a convergence of corporate 
shilling and ultra-nationalism that can splice up a song precisely enough 
to turn the selection into the opposite of the song's meaning.

         <p>"Fortunate Son" is a raging denunciation of the kind of USA Number 
One militaristic fervor that has swept America, with privileged elites 
leading the cheers for war: "It ain't me, I ain't no senator's son ... It 
ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one..."

         <p>Despite the incessant commercialism and recent hyper-patriotism 
surrounding it, pro baseball retains a lot of genuine resiliency. It's the 
most pensive of team sports, and the close-up camera work of modern-day 
television is able to provide coverage that explores human dimensions well 
beyond just physical skill. The ball is actually in play for a grand total 
of only a few minutes per game -- according to one estimate, just five 
minutes from the first pitch to the last. That leaves plenty of time to 
ponder what just happened and mull over the next possibilities.

         <p>For many Americans, baseball is inextricably entangled with some 
of the fonder memories of childhood. And for people who grew up in the days 
of black-and-white television, the improvements are great. Back when ace 
pitchers Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette were dazzling World Series viewers 
in the late 1950s, watching baseball on TV involved peering at fuzzy 
figures that moved on a gray background. There was no instant replay then, 
and scant variety of camera angles.

         <p>Today, rendered on the TV screen, the game is somehow more 
personal as it unfolds. We routinely see artful camera shots of the faces 
of players on the diamond. As a sport that manages to be highly athletic 
and contemplative at the same time, baseball offers a measured pace and 
philosophical spaces that remain in sharp contrast to the frenetic energies 
of mass media. On the other hand, the televised games are damaged by the 
profusion of commercial plugs, logos and the like.

         <p>Hopefully, the essence of baseball will survive all the 
manipulation from corporate sponsors and symbol-hungry politicians. 
Especially in times of national crisis, we need to be alert. It's too easy 
this fall to passively consume television's melding of fervor for sports 
and war. The alternative is to think critically and fill in the blanks.

        <p> "Some folks are born, made to wave the flag / Ooh, they're red, 
white and blue / And when the band plays 'Hail to the Chief' / They point 
the cannon right at you."
