PRESIDENT BUSH began his remarks on energy in St. Paul last week by 
praising the "mighty Minnesota Twins."
<P>The Twins, for those who do not devote as much attention to the sports 
pages as our president, have compiled the second-best record in baseball while 
spending considerably less on their payroll than any other team. The New York 
Yankees, for example, pay each of their 25 players an average of $2.6 million 
more per year than the Twins.
<P>"Their cost per win is astounding," marveled Bush. "It serves as a good 
example of what frugality can do for the nation."
<P>The audience laughed. As well they should. The energy speech Bush went on 
to deliver was about as frugal as George Steinbrenner on a megalomaniacal 
spending jag.
<P>"America needs to generate more electricity," the president declared. "A 
high-tech economy is a high electricity-consumption economy."
<P>Bush went on to call for more oil, coal, natural gas, wind, solar, nuclear, 
biomass and geothermal power. In short, anything to keep the cell phones, 
laptops, microwaves, CD players, pagers, Walkmans, VCRs -- let alone 
automobiles and factories -- humming.
<P>The concept of simply doing less is not a part of the thinking. Even the 
oil executives in the Bush White House praise "energy efficiency" (the new 
euphemism for conservation). But when Bush talked about efficiency in St. Paul,
<P>he assured everybody that "conservation does not mean doing without."
<P>Americans have no interest in doing without, as U.S. Sen. Frank Murkowski, 
the Republican from Alaska who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, recently 
explained.
<P>"I'm a big guy, and I don't like to get into a small car because I'm not 
comfortable," Murkowski said. "Do you want government to dictate to you the 
type of an automobile you have to have?"
<P>Apparently not. And many Democrats agree. Democratic National Committee 
Chair Terry McAuliffe, according to the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, sped 
around Washington to denounce Bush's energy plan in a Cadillac Escalade, a 5,
800-pound SUV that gets about 12 miles to the gallon. (The DNC insisted the 
McAuliffe personally paid $5,000 to make sure the vehicle met California's 
tough emission standards, even though it was being driven on the East Coast.)
<P>There is nothing partisan about America's refusal to cut back. Asked last 
week whether people should consider getting out of their SUVs, House Minority 
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., shook his head, volunteering that he doesn't see 
tougher automobile emission standards "as the panacea the way others do."
<P>Even the environmental community, which has preached conservation for 
decades, seems to well understand, as one insider put it, that "pain is bad 
politics."
<P>The day Bush's plan was released, leaders of more than a dozen 
environmental organizations gathered at a swank Washington hotel to denounce 
its call for new oil drilling and the weakened environmental regulations. But 
asked pointedly about whether Americans ought to get out their gas-guzzling 
SUVs, not a single one frowned on America's consumption habits.
<P>Energy is part of what makes life worth living. It is a blessing to live in 
a country which can afford to consume a quarter of the globe's energy. From 
Disc-Mans to defibrillators, much of what separates people from monkeys is our 
ability to find the correct size batteries.
<P>But it may be misleading to say we are experiencing an energy crisis. The 
first chart in Bush's energy plan shows that there would be no shortage if 
people stopped demanding more and more each year. We would not feel as if we 
were in a crisis if we controlled our ever-growing appetite.
<P>Americans may marvel at frugality. But the truth is that more prefer 
rooting for the Yankees than the Twins. Especially the man with the Texas-size 
appetite in the White House.
