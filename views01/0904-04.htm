PARIS - The Israeli-Palestinian situation has gone beyond the point where a political solution can be envisaged, at least in the foreseeable future, perhaps in this generation. Too much has been wantonly destroyed in the years since the Oslo agreements.
<p>Both sides are now more or less blindly committed to unachievable goals.
<p>The Israelis are committed to permanent colonization and occupation of Palestinian territories seized in the 1967 war - or at least to as much land as, under pressure from their own settler and religious extremists, they choose to hold.
<p>The Palestinians have recourse only in the power of weakness. This means eternal resistance through suicidal acts of indiscriminate destruction. The violence is justified by a belief that if Israel cannot be defeated in the short run, in the long run it is condemned by history itself to the same fate as that other Western beachhead in the Arabic world, the medieval Crusaders' Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem.
<p>Current calls from outsiders for cease-fire are meaningless since a cease-fire, even if achieved, would merely suspend the dynamic of conflict already engaged and ratified by popular opinion on both sides.
<p>No current proposal does more than offer &quot;confidence-building&quot; measures, since any attempt to go beyond that, by trying to get commitments to a form of solution justifying confidence, would be rejected by Israel as preemption. Israel has shown interest only in partial and provisional agreements.
<p>The recently floated idea that NATO should intervene to separate the combatants would make NATO Israel's guarantor within the frontiers it now occupies, including territories conquered in the 1967 war - which is what the war is all about. NATO would become the Palestinians' newest jailer. An international force would be accepted by the Palestinians as protection against Israel and an internationalization of the conflict, which they think would be to their advantage. It would for that reason be rejected by Israel. The idea that the United States would agree to, or furnish troops for, either such intervention partakes of fantasy.
<p>Voices are heard, however, from an entirely different dimension of thought, that of morality. Iyad Sarraj, a Palestinian human rights activist, writes on a Web site sponsored by the Soros organization <i>(<a href="http://www.amin.org/" target="_new">www.amin.org</a>)</i> that the Palestinian Authority has done nothing to move from a &quot;tribal state&quot; to a citizens' state. Why do Palestinian children want arms? They have learned from the Israeli occupation that Israel is powerful because it possesses the arms that render a Palestinian child's father impotent. The children never stop demanding that their parents arm, using the simple argument: &quot;How can you protect me, Father, if you have no arms?&quot;
<p>Mr. Sarraj continues: &quot;It is time to recognize that true heroism consists in exemplary conduct, which resists being drawn into violence against Israeli civilians. That weakens our cause more than anything else. ... I would even say that we should collect all the weapons in circulation and declare that we want nothing more to do with them: that we simply claim our land and our liberty. ... &quot;It is necessary for the Palestinians to fight injustice solely with justice. More than ever, the world is ready to support us, just as it was able to bring about the disintegration of racism in South Africa. But this depends first of all on Palestinians.&quot;
<p>In New York this year, the philosopher Michael Walzer gave the Carnegie Council's 20th annual Hans Morgenthau Memorial Lecture on Ethics and Foreign Policy. His subject was &quot;Universalism and Jewish Values.&quot; It was a complex and subtle lecture, not to be summarized here. However, he did discuss the vision of peace that can be taken from the Bible: &quot;And they shall beat their swords into plowshares ... They shall never again know war.&quot;
<p>His observation on this famous passage is that, unlike its usual interpretation, it does not present a vision of peace among peoples who have escaped parochial identities and transcended their differences. They have only stopped fighting.
<p>It is the Jewish and Palestinian peoples who have to lay down their swords - just as Iyad Sarraj declares.
