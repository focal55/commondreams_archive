An Afghan journalist records on videotape Mike Spann, well-scrubbed CIA
agent-hero interrogating John Walker, wretched and grimy traitor; two
young Americans on opposite sides in a prison in Afghanistan – one
standing with a gun – the other on his knees bound and silent. One
brainwashed, perhaps, the other not, perhaps. One is now alive the other
is now dead. The camera, the agent and the traitor create an amazing
confluence that a timid writer wouldn’t dare try to suggest as real. And
yet the cascading recent events from an author unknown make it possible
to accept these two figures and this unlikely event as genuine history.

<p>Robert Fisk, brilliant journalist who is the advocate and voice of
reasoned compassion and pacifism, is reporting in Pakistan. He, along
with very few journalists, is the conscience for the West and the
guardian for the victims of a questionable military operation. His car
breaks down and the very people for whom he advocates descend on him
seeing him as simply a Westerner – a blue-eyed white imperialist
aggressor who somehow is responsible for the unbearable losses that
these refugees have suffered. It was a mad moment of racial profiling
against someone who most likely thinks of himself as simply a member of
the human race. And yet because of the divisions created by the violence
he condemns, he can no longer navigate the world’s rugged terrain with
the luxury of that self-image.

<p>For his own protection he now must defensively perceive himself as
white, American/British or Western. “White man” in the refugee camps in
Pakistan means cluster, carpet, daisy cutter bombs, death and loss of
family. Middle Eastern in America means suicide bombs, death and loss of
family. Black in Florida meant a Gore voter. The mail means anthrax.
Perhaps a motif is emerging. Racial profiling is like a virus or a
spore. It spreads and can conquer the entire organism – or maybe another
interpretation is possible. It’s up to the reader the author seems to be
saying.

<p>Were it not for a Muslim cleric intervening, these refugees would have
unwittingly lost one of the strongest voices for their plight. Robert
Fisk’s response to this attack, although not without genuine human fear
and anger, has been distilled to understanding when he learned that his
attackers were in fact refugees who lost so much. His own awareness of
the facts and his strength of commitment and compassion disqualified him
from indulging in the immediate and simple reaction of “kill them all.”
His response is now emblematic and earned – he can with a different sort
of authority say that understanding and steady justice is the only
answer to the insanity of violence. The whole event seems overwritten –
the number of Afghan refugees – one hundred – seems too arbitrary and
round – the fact his car breaks down is stretching it – the arrival of
the Muslim cleric seems like deus ex machina, and his response just too
noble and good. He is human after all. And yet this author goes for it
and stands by the creation of this Fisk character.

<p>Going back to earlier chapters, candidate Bush was jumped by a reporter
early on in his campaign. The reporter, wanting perhaps to challenge and
test the contender for the throne, asked him who the leaders of various
countries were. It was not a shining moment and the candidate’s face was
a contortion of violently conflicting impulses. But in light of present
reality the question this renegade reporter asked him proves itself to
be a wicked literary device. The reporter asked who the president of
Pakistan was. At the time he might as well have asked him to name the
moons of Jupiter as the candidate looked around wondering if this guy,
much less the question, was for real – or if Pakistan even had a
president. Now he knows the name of the president of Pakistan better
than he knows the name Rove, Hughes or Millie. But it was a cunning bit
of foreshadowing and the unknown author gets away with it.

<p>Florida, the state run by the candidate’s brother, is all too familiar
and obvious a chapter now, but at the time such a plot was unthinkable.
What were the odds that the election would come down to that state? What
did it all mean? We thought then that perhaps the author had hit us with
his best shot and he was not going to take anymore chances at straining
our credulity. We should have known that if this was how the narrative
started there was only one way for the author to go.

<p>On September eleventh, on the plane that penetrated the Pentagon was a
woman who wrote a book called “Hell To Pay” which by all accounts was an
attack on our then First Lady.  The author of that book, as it happens,
was married to the man who argued against the election 2000 recount
before a Supreme Court, who many believe, like John Walker, were
traitors. In fact this part of the narrative inspired another book
entitled, “None Dare Call It Treason.” Not without dangerous irony does
this author create events.

<p>Also on September eleventh a priest, giving last rites to a firefighter
who was killed by a body falling from the World Trade Center, removes
his helmet to say a prayer and he is hit by a piece of falling debris
and is killed. The density and power of that moment would take years to
unravel.

<p>This evolving narrative has the possibility of delivering chapters that
will be bolder, more daring, more surprising and unless we actively and
creatively interpret these blinding events for ourselves, they will also
be simply, starkly and unbearably senseless and inevitable.
