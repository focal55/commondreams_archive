I AM AT THE age where my family and friends all seem to be coping  with aging relatives. And I can tell you that something has gone terribly  wrong with both the health care system and the system of nursing care.
<P>
<P>People in their 80s and 90s, when their health starts to deteriorate,  tend to have multiple things wrong with them. From a doctors point of  view, they are very time consuming to treat. They often tend to be fearful  and forgetful.
<P>
<P>All of this means that either a family member, or a very conscientious  doctor, needs to be carefully coordinating their care, or disastrous  mishaps will occur. But middle aged sons and daughters are nearly all in  the workforce, without much time to spend with frail and aging parents.
<P>
<P>And despite the promise of managed care, they one thing doctors are not  paid to do is spend a lot of time with patients or on the phone.
<P>
<P>Indeed, managed care has become a parody of its original  aspirations. Back in the days when HMOs were nonprofit, prepaid group  health plans, the idea was that paying doctors salaries to treat a fixed  number of patients would reward prevention and remove any incentive  either to undertreat or to overtreat.
<P>
<P>In the 1990s, after most HMOs had become for-profit, shareholder  owned corporations, they tried to make money signing up Medicare  patients. The government encouraged HMOs to serve seniors, on the  theory that this would cut costs. HMOs targeted relatively healthy  oldsters, in the hope of making a bundle.
<P>
<P>But it mostly didn't work. For one thing, old people gradually  become older people. Even healthy ones eventually get sick. For another,  the Medicare payments to HMOs weren't adequate to the need. So most  elderly people, especially the sickest ones, went back to conventional  Medicare.
<P>
<P>The Medicare program, though reformed to discourage overly long  hospital stays, is still basically a fee-for-service program. That means it  rewards intensive medical interventions, such as surgery, but doesn't  reimburse enough money to compensate doctors for the careful case  management that older people require. The more that Congress cuts the  Medicare budget, the more money comes out of hands-on care.
<P>
<P>One member of my extended family has been shuttled from specialist  to specialist, while his case falls between the cracks because his  overworked primary care doctor fails to adequately coordinate the whole  enterprise. After many months, nobody knows what's wrong with him.
<P>
<P>Another, in her mid-80s, was barely spared unnecessary and  dangerous open heart surgery, only because her daughter had the wit  and the energy to ask impertinent questions and seek a second opinion.
<P>
<P>The mother has multiple conditions. The daughter is spending half her  time on the phone doing what her mother's primary care doctor should  be doing.
<P>
<P>The managed-care system is saving money by displacing the  burdens of caring back onto families. Those who don't have families available to accept such burdens risk becoming casualties of the medical  system. When it comes to people in their 80s and 90s, especially those  without close relatives on the case, the system can simply bury its  mistakes.
<P>
<P>The story is, if anything, worse when it comes to nursing care. Most  nursing home care is paid by Medicaid. The reimbursements are  inadequate, so nursing homes tend to recruit help from the very bottom  of the labor market.
<P>
<P>Assisted living is an attractive alternative to nursing care, but is  costs far more than most elderly people typically can afford usually $2,500 a month and up. And Medicaid won't pay any of its costs.
<P>
<P>Both parties are crowing about the huge and growing budget  surplus, as if it were a costless boon to the economy. But the fact is that  a big chunk of the surplus came out of cuts in the budget for Medicare  and Medicaid.
<P>
<P>Our society is demanding that everyone work, but ignoring the cost  to the enterprise of caregiving. We are becoming a richer economy, while  we impoverish those most dependent on the care of others.
<P>
<P>So the wondrous budget surplus is anything but costless. As  anyone who has lately helped an elderly friend or relative navigate  hospital care can tell you, the costs are coming at the expense of our own  parents.
<P>
<P>This is a political failure, because these are mostly public  dollars. But somehow, the voters aren't connecting the dots and  demanding better of our elected officials. If we fail to make this a public  issue, our families will suffer the consequences.
