EACH YEAR when I attend the "Power of Choice" luncheon in San 
Francisco, I end up thinking the same thing: If only we could get all the anti-
choice state and federal politicians in the country here for this.
<P>No, not to be intimidated by so many abortion rights supporters in one 
place -- this year's luncheon drew 1,100 women and men and raised $500,000 for 
the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
<P>Rather, I want the legislators to sit at the luncheon tables and just 
listen.
<P>To look women of all ages and ethnicities in the eye. To learn about our 
lives, our jobs, our families, our intelligence, our religious and spiritual 
practices, our principles.
<P>How easy would it then be to do what anti-choice politicians repeatedly do 
when the issue is unwanted pregnancy: sponsor and vote for laws that presume 
women are too stupid, immoral, uninformed or in denial to decide what should 
happen inside their own wombs?
<P>Could the so-called pro-life legislators still rob NARAL supporters and 
other pro-choice women of our humanity?
<P>Could they assume we have lost or never possessed an ability to reason? 
Ignore our fundamental decency? Behave as though we lack morals or any sense 
of responsibility?
<P>It is one thing to be dismissed and discounted by non-elected anti-abortion 
rights advocates. As private citizens in a democracy, they are entitled to 
their monolithic assumptions -- about the morality of millions of us pro-
choice strangers and about the superiority of their own religious beliefs.
<P>It is another thing entirely when the men and women who make laws for 
everyone do the discounting.
<P>"You think that what someone does with her pregnancy should be dealt with 
at the personal level, not the political," said Diane Parish, a financial 
adviser and young mother who attended her first Power of Choice luncheon last 
Friday at the St. Francis Hotel. "You ask, 'Why are we still having to fight 
this?' You think it's an issue that should go away. But it's not going away."
<P>Like all the attendees (who gave three standing ovations during the lunch), 
Parish said she was much moved by the speakers: former Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright, NARAL President Kate Michelman and novelist Richard North 
Patterson, who described the many truths he learned about late-term abortion 
and opposition to parental consent laws while researching his best-seller, 
"Protect and Defend."
<P>"He took on two hard issues and showed that there really is a strong moral 
foundation for both of them," said Parish.
<P>Meanwhile, Albright explained the fallacy and danger behind George W. 
Bush's withdrawal of funds for international family planning organizations, 
and Michelman "showed what it's like to be living this fight, the personal 
involvement; she truly never rests on this issue."
<P>But, when the meal was over, said Parish, she was inspired "almost as much 
by the crowd as by the speakers."
<P>"It was tremendously exciting just to be in a room with 1,100 people, most 
of them women," she said. "It energized me and aroused my sense of urgency."
<P>Maybe next year, a few anti-choice lawmakers will join Parish, me and the 
hundreds of other women. That is, if they have the appetite for breaking bread 
with reality.
