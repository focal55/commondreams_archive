The midair collision of a U.S. Navy EP-3 spy plane and a Communist
Chinese fighter--plus the subsequent emergency landing of the EP-3 at a
Chinese military base and the way the U.S.plane's crew has been treated
by the Chinese--prompts the obvious question: What would the U.S. do if
the situation was reversed? What if a supersecret Chinese plane
unexpectedly landed on Okinawa or Guam or Hawaii?
<p>Although Western nations treat captured peacetime military men
differently than Eastern nations do, you shouldn't be surprised to learn
that the U.S. would be doing much the same as the Chinese military is
doing: The first concern would be safety. What if a saboteur or a
terrorist rigged the plane with a nuclear device?
<p>The plane would immediately be searched from top to bottom looking for
explosives, chemical or biological weapons or other immediate hazards.
Yes, this might look like an aggressive move, but it's a necessary one.
<p>The crew would also be taken into custody, separated and secured so no
one could trigger a device or try to hurt anyone else.
<p>The second concern would be the safety and security of the crew
itself. What if someone on the flight crew wanted to defect? Each crew
member would be individually searched, photographed, examined, questioned
and given the opportunity to ask for asylum. An intelligence-trained
doctor would be the perfect person to bring in at this point because
military men often trust and confide in physicians and nurses in times of
stress or crisis.
<p>If no one on the crew appeared to want to defect--this assessment
could take a few days--then it would be a good idea to reunite a few of
them. Naturally, the room would be bugged. Two or more crewmen would
eventually start talking, and the information might be useful.
<p>Give them plenty of food and water, and they will talk even more as
they relax. Never put the older men in with the younger ones because the
older military men will quickly educate the younger troops in how to
behave when in enemy custody. Always put men of equal rank together--it
is more difficult to rebuild a chain of command than if an obviously
higher-ranking officer is present.
<p>The plane would get a thorough examination by trained intelligence
officers and engineers, even if it meant dismantling it. Yes, the plane
is some other nation's property, but it would be in our territory, not by
our invitation.
<p>I would expect that in the case of the EP-3, the crew had already
erased the classified information and destroyed the secret boxes, but
there are ways to extract information out of even the most thoroughly
smashed boxes--and of course you hope that the crew in their panic,
excitement or incapacitation didn't have time or forgot to destroy some
key piece of equipment or memory bank.
<p>Every book, manual, scrap of paper or piece of equipment on board the
plane would have intelligence value. Even the tiniest bit of information
would be a piece of a gigantic puzzle, and you would never know if the
tiny piece you're holding is the piece that makes the whole puzzle come
together.
<p>The EP-3 spy plane now in Chinese hands is several generations more
sophisticated than anything in that country, so we can expect that our
plane will be taken apart piece by piece and studied with great interest.
It is an intelligence bonanza for the Chinese.
<p>In China, the military's influence in matters of state is considerably
higher than in the West, so the fate of our EP-3 and its crew may not be
resolved for quite some time. The military can demand as much time as it
requires to collect information before succumbing to diplomatic pressure.
<p>In the West, the diplomats can exert far more influence on the
military, so the push would be on quickly for a peaceful resolution.
