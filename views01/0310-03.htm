    and South Korean President Kim Dae Jung disagreed publicly on how to deal with communist
    North Korea &#150; Bush advocated a harder line. But the two leaders have a little-known
    bond in common: the political largesse of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.
</font>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For
    more than three decades, Moon, the founder of the South Korea-based Unification Church,
    has spun a worldwide spider's web of influence, connecting to hundreds of powerful leaders
    through the silken threads of his mysterious money.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moon&#146;s
    beneficiaries include the Bush family and, according to U.S. intelligence reports, Kim Dae
    Jung.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though
    seldom discussed publicly, the Moon-Bush connection has been reported before &#150; and
    detailed in this publication. But Moon&#146;s financial links to Kim Dae Jung &#150; a
    longtime dissident who opposed the authoritarian governments that ruled South Korea during
    the Cold War &#150; have remained secret.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">U.S.
    intelligence stumbled onto the Moon-Kim connection while monitoring South Korean political
    developments in 1987.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By
    that time, Moon&#146;s Unification Church already had built close ties to the Reagan-Bush
    administration, especially through Moon's funding of conservative causes and his
    $100-million-a-year subsidy of the right-wing <i>Washington Times</i>, hailed by Ronald
    Reagan as his &#147;favorite&#148; newspaper.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back
    in South Korea, however, Moon's longtime coziness with his home nation's autocratic rulers
    was strained. Moon was on the outs with the ruling Democratic Justice Party (DJP), the
    U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency noted in a cable dated Sept. 10, 1987.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;The
    UC (Unification Church) &#133; has not been happy with the somewhat cold treatment it has
    received under the current DJP government,&#148; the DIA cable reported.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
    response to this chilliness, Moon secretly began financing several opposition figures, the
    DIA reported. One was a longtime Moon ally, Kim Jong Pil, not to be confused with North
    Korea's current leader Kim Jong Il.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By
    the late 1980s, Kim Jong Pil had a long record of association with Moon. A 1978 U.S.
    congressional investigation into the so-called &#147;Koreagate&#148; influence-buying
    scandal reported that Kim Jong Pil founded the South Korean CIA in the 1960s and assisted
    Moon's Unification Church in building its influence in Japan and the United States.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
    congressional investigation concluded that Kim Jong Pil and the South Korean CIA helped
    Moon expand his church into a well-financed international organization. They then used
    Moon's organization to buy influence inside the U.S. government, the congressional
    investigation found.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kim
    Jong Pil also had served as South Korean prime minister in the early 1970s. In 1987,
    however, Kim Jong Pil was out of power and considering a run for the South Korean
    presidency.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The
    DIA Reports</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According
    to the Defense Intelligence Agency, Kim Jong Pil was one of the candidates who benefited
    from Moon&#146;s estrangement from the ruling Democratic Justice Party.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;Kim
    Jong-Pil is reportedly receiving financial and organizational support for his KS (South
    Korean) presidential bid from the controversial Unification Church,&#148; the DIA reported
    in its Sept. 10, 1987, cable.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But
    Moon&#146;s organization did not stop with its old ally. The DIA discovered that Moon was
    hedging his bets by putting money into the hands of Kim Dae Jung and other leaders of the
    Reunification Democratic Party.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;Cult
    trying to win influence with the next KS government while defeating the current ruling
    party's candidate,&#148; read the title of another DIA report dated Sept. 22, 1987.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;The
    controversial Unification Church (UC) is actively funneling large amounts of political
    funds to opposition Reunification Democratic Party (RDP) advisor Kim Dae-Jung, &#133; RDP
    president Kim Young-Sam, &#133; and former KS prime minister Kim Jong-Pil for their
    campaigns for KS president, leaving out only the ruling party candidate, Democratic
    Justice Party (DJP) president Roh Tae-Woo,&#148; the DIA report said.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;The
    UC wants to see Roh defeated and is funneling large amounts of political funds to Roh's
    three opponents with the expectation that it will have influence with whomever of the
    three should end up as the next president.&#148; [I obtained these DIA reports under a
    Freedom of Information Act request.]</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eventually,
    the race boiled down to a contest between Roh Tae Woo, Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam. On
    Dec. 16, 1987, Roh won with 36 percent of the vote. Kim Young Sam got 28 percent and Kim
    Dae Jung received 27 percent. Kim Jong Pil garnered only 8 percent. [For details on the
    election, see <i>The Two Koreas</i> by Don Oberdorfer.]</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Discreet
    Relationships</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though
    losing that round, Moon&#146;s beneficiaries did better in the years that followed. Kim
    Jong Pil again became prime minister, a post he held from 1998 to early 1999. Kim Dae Jung
    became president in 1998 and also won the Nobel Peace Prize.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through
    the years, Kim Dae Jung did not advertise his ties to Moon. Kim's association with the
    theocrat who considers himself the new Messiah has remained discreet, with the two men
    generally avoiding contact in public.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One
    exception came on Feb. 1, 1999, when Moon and his wife &#150; known to their followers as
    the &#147;True Parents&#148; &#150; were holding a celebration at the Lotte Hotel in
    Seoul. To the surprise of Moon&#146;s followers, Kim Dae Jung arrived and enthusiastically
    joined the couple in their ceremony.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According
    to the <i>Unification News</i>, the church's internal newsletter, the Lotte Hotel event
    was &#147;the first time President Kim appeared in public with our True Parents.&#148;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though
    less secret, Moon&#146;s relationship with the Bush family also remains little known to
    most Americans. Moon's organization has paid the Bush family directly &#150; for speeches
    in the 1990s &#150; but the alliance appears to have grown primarily through Moon&#146;s
    extravagant financial support for <i>The Washington Times</i>, which has consistently
    backed the Bushes politically.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After
    its founding in 1982, <i>The Washington Times</i> staunchly supported some of the
    Reagan-Bush administration&#146;s most controversial policies, such as the contra war in
    Nicaragua.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When
    the contra operation was embarrassed by initial public disclosures of contra drug
    trafficking in 1985-86, <i>The Washington Times</i> led the counterattack, criticizing
    journalists and congressional investigators who uncovered the first evidence of the
    problem.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those
    attacks helped cement a conventional wisdom in the Washington political community that the
    contra-drug allegations were bogus, a belief that persisted until 1998 when the CIA's
    inspector general admitted that dozens of contra units were implicated in cocaine
    trafficking and that the Reagan-Bush administration had hidden much of the evidence. [See
    Robert Parry&#146;s <i>Lost History</i>.]</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The
    Washington Times</i> also led the charge against Iran-contra special prosecutor Lawrence
    Walsh in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The newspaper's rear-guard defense of its allies
    proved important when Walsh's investigation threatened to break through the long-running
    White House cover-up that was protecting Bush&#146;s assertion that he was &#147;out of
    the loop&#148; on the scandal. [For details on <i>The Washington Times'</i> role, see
    Walsh&#146;s book, <i>Firewall</i>.]</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During
    national political campaigns, Moon&#146;s <i>Washington Times</i> was especially
    influential, mounting harsh &#150; and often inaccurate &#150; attacks on the Bush
    family's adversaries.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
    1988, when George H.W. Bush was running for president, <i>The Washington Times</i>
    publicized false rumors about the mental health of Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis,
    an important first step in raising doubts about the Massachusetts governor.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President
    George H.W. Bush grew so appreciative of <i>The Washington Times</i> that in 1991, he
    invited its editor-in-chief, Wesley Pruden, to the White House for a private lunch. Bush
    explained that the purpose of the lunch was &#147;just to tell you how valuable the <i>Times</i>
    has become in Washington, where we read it everyday.&#148; [WT, May 17, 1992]</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In
    Bush&#146;s 1992 reelection campaign, <i>The Washington Times</i> was helping again,
    spreading new false rumors that Bill Clinton might have betrayed his country during a
    college trip to Moscow, possibly being recruited by the KGB as a spy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;<b>Lining Pocket</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After George H.W. Bush lost in 1992, <i>The Washington Times</i> shifted from
    defense to offense. The newspaper became a leading conservative
    weapon in mounting attacks on the Clinton administration.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During
    the Bush family&#146;s years out of power, Moon put money directly into their pockets,
    too. Moon-affiliated organizations paid for speeches by former President Bush in the
    United States, Asia and South America. Sometimes, Barbara Bush joined her husband in these
    appearances.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
    price tag for the speeches has been estimated at from hundreds of thousands of dollars to
    $10 million, a figure cited to me by a senior Unification Church official in the
    mid-1990s. The elder Bush has refused to divulge how much money he received from
    Moon-affiliated organizations.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During
    one 1996 appearance in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the senior Bush went beyond a mere speech
    to act as a kind of international lobbyist for the Moon organization.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At
    the time, Moon was planning to launch a new newspaper, <i>Tiempos del Mundo</i>, and his
    supporters were upset over critical coverage in South American newspapers. The South
    American press was pointing out Moon&#146;s close association with right-wing
    &#147;death-squad&#148; governments of the 1970s and the so-called &#147;Cocaine Coup&#148; regime in Bolivia in the early
    1980s.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moon's
    defenders were forced to issue public denials that Moon's mysterious source of wealth came
    from drug trafficking and other organized-crime activities.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These
    allegations were threatening the <i>Tiempos del Mundo</i> launch, Moon's followers feared.
    But Moon had a special weapon to prove his respectability: the endorsement of the 41<sup>st</sup>
    president of the United States.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush
    arrived on Nov. 22, 1996, and stayed with Argentine President Carlos Menem at his official
    residence. The next day, Bush gave the keynote address at the newspaper&#146;s inaugural
    dinner.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;Mr.
    Bush&#146;s presence as keynote speaker gave the event invaluable prestige,&#148; wrote
    the <i>Unification News</i>. &#147;Father [Moon] and Mother [Mrs. Moon] sat with several
    of the True Children [Moon&#146;s offspring] just a few feet from the podium.&#148;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush
    lavished praise on Moon and his journalistic enterprises. &#147;I want to salute Reverend
    Moon,&#148; Bush said. &#147;A lot of my friends in South America don&#146;t know about <i>The
    Washington Times</i>, but it is an independent voice. The editors of <i>The Washington
    Times</i> tell me that never once has the man with the vision interfered with the running
    of the paper, a paper that in my view brings sanity to Washington, D.C.&#148;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush's
    endorsement wasn't exactly accurate. A stream of editors and correspondents have left <i>The
    Washington Times</i>, complaining about the interference of Moon's operatives. But Moon's
    followers believed Bush's intervention stanched the flow of negative press stories and
    saved the day.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>'Satanic'
    America</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
    those eight years of the Bush family's hiatus from power, Moon also grew increasingly
    anti-American, often telling his followers that the United States was &#147;Satanic.&#148;
    He vowed to build a movement powerful enough to absorb America and eliminate what Moon saw
    as America's destructive tendencies toward individualism.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;Americans
    who continue to maintain their privacy and extreme individualism are foolish people,&#148;
    Moon told his followers during one speech on Aug. 4, 1996. He then said, &#147;Once you
    have this great power of love, which is big enough to swallow entire America, there may be
    some individuals who complain inside your stomach. However, they will be digested.&#148;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During
    the 2000 campaign, <i>The Washington Times</i> was back helping the Bush family achieve
    its political restoration. Day after day, the newspaper published articles undercutting
    Democrat Al Gore &#150; even questioning his sanity &#150; while boosting the candidacy of
    George W. Bush.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
    late 1999, <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Washington Post</i> created a controversy
    by misquoting Gore as claiming credit for starting the Love Canal toxic-waste cleanup. The
    two newspapers quoted Gore as saying &quot;I was the one that started it all&quot; when in
    fact he was referring to a similar Tennessee toxic-waste case and said, &quot;that was the
    one that started it all.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet,
    with the bogus quote touching off a wave of media ridicule about Gore's supposed lack of
    credibility, <i>The Washington Times</i> eagerly joined the pack and returned to its old
    game of questioning the sanity of its political enemies.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A <i>Washington
    Times</i> editorial termed Gore &#147;delusional&#148; and stated, &#147;The real question
    is how to react to Mr. Gore&#146;s increasingly bizarre utterings.&#148; The editorial
    went on to call Gore &#147;a politician who not only manufactures gross, obvious lies
    about himself and his achievements but appears to actually believe these
    confabulations.&#148; [WT, Dec. 7, 1999]</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even
    after <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Washington Post</i> corrected their misquote, <i>The
    Washington Times</i> continued to use the bogus quote.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On
    Dec. 31, 1999, Moon's newspaper published a column entitled &quot;Liar, Liar; Gore's Pants
    on Fire.&quot; The column repeated the false quote and concluded that &quot;when Al Gore
    lies, it's without any apparent reason.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
    media drumbeat about Gore&#146;s supposed lies &#150; often built on similar press
    exaggerations and outright errors &#150; became a key element of the 2000 campaign. Many
    Republican strategists viewed the widespread perception of Gore as untrustworthy as
    crucial in holding down Gore's vote and clearing George W. Bush's route to the White
    House.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now,
    with the Bush family back in charge, Moon&#146;s organization appears in line for some
    financial payback. George W. Bush&#146;s plan to funnel government money into religious
    charities is expected to be especially profitable for Moon's front groups that are
    organized as non-profit charities.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
    Rev. Pat Robertson, the conservative televangelist, is among those who have raised the
    alarm about how Bush&#146;s &quot;faith-based&quot; initiative could line Moon's pockets.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On
    the &quot;700 Club&quot; television program, Robertson warned that Moon&#146;s Unification
    Church could become one of the financial &#147;beneficiaries of the proposal to expand
    eligibility for government grants to religious charities.&#148; [<i>Washington Post</i>,
    Feb. 22, 2000]</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Besides
    the possibility of collecting U.S. taxpayers&#146; money, Moon also continues to benefit
    from a determined see-no-evil stance of the U.S. government toward Moon&#146;s
    political-religious-business organization.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Widespread
    evidence exists of money-laundering by Moon&#146;s operation
    &#150; including first-hand statements by church insiders including his former daughter-in-law. But this evidence simply disappears into
    a black hole of federal indifference.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moon&#146;s
    business dealings with communist North Korea, dating back to 1991 and the first Bush
    administration, also have prompted no official U.S. reaction.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based
    on what is known publicly, Moon would appear to be in violation of the long-standing U.S.
    trade embargo against North Korea. That embargo covered Moon because he is a legal U.S.
    resident &#150; possessing a &quot;green card&quot; &#150; and thus required to abide by
    U.S. sanction laws.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According
    to other DIA documentation that I obtained under FOIA, Moon delivered millions of dollars
    in secret payments to North Korea&#146;s top officials &#150;
    including current communist leader Kim Il Song.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those
    payments, in the early-to-mid 1990s, came at a time when the communist regime was
    desperate for hard currency to support its development of nuclear weapons and long-range
    missiles.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ironically,
    it is that arms buildup that George W. Bush now cites as a chief reason for postponing
    further negotiations with North Korea &#150; and for spending tens of billions of dollars
    to build a U.S. nuclear &quot;Star Wars&quot; shield.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During
    this past week&#146;s summit, South Korea&#146;s president Kim Dae Jung disagreed with
    Bush over the cessation of talks with North Korea. Bush attacked the North Koreans as
    untrustworthy.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet,
    behind the scenes -- though perhaps not fully apparent to either man -- was this odd
    connection linking the Bush family, Kim Dae Jung and the communist leaders of North Korea.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It
    was the secret bond of Rev. Sun Myung Moon&#146;s mysterious money.</font></p>
