What Bush Said:</b>

<p>How do I respond when I see that in some Islamic countries there is vitriolic 
hatred for America? I'll tell you how I respond: I'm amazed. I'm amazed that 
there's such misunderstanding of what our country is about that people would 
hate us. I am--like most Americans, I just can't believe it because I know 
how good we are. (News Conference, October 11, 2001) 

<p><b>What Bush Should Have Said:
</b>
<p>My fellow Americans:

<p>The war against the al Qaeda terrorists is proceeding. As I’ve said, it will 
be a long battle. Right now, we’re destroying the Taliban forces that harbor 
the terrorist network. Soon we will be on the ground, hunting for these guys. 
It may take us a long time to smoke them out of their caves and out in the 
open, but we will get them.

<p>We are squeezing the terrorists financially by freezing their funds and 
assets.  We are isolating countries that have supported them. Police  in 
various countries are tracking down and arresting  cell members. In short, 
the war is going well.

<p>But terrorism does not spring full-grown from the head of a beast. It grows 
out of popular discontent, and in this case allied with religious fanaticism. 
We can do little to alter how people affiliate religiously. But we can do 
something about helping to ameliorate the discontent.

<p>It’s difficult for me to say this -- I’ve learned a lot in the past month 
and not all of it is pretty  --  but I do believe that the United States has 
been partially responsible for  helping create the conditions that have led 
to a large part of the discontent in the Middle East.

<p>Our original mindset was derived from the old days of colonial power, when 
the British and French and others in the West simply carved up the old Arabic 
lands and Muslim empire, to serve their financial and power interests. We 
didn’t stop and think how the world was changing, and our policies reflected 
that ignorance and denial.

<p>We continued to support ruling oligarchies, who became corrupt and 
authoritarian.  We supported Israel blindly ,and refused to use our 
considerable leverage in helping to solve the riddle of Israeli/Palestinian 
peace. We stationed our troops in Saudia Arabia, hardly thinking about how 
many Muslims consider this a sacrilege. We continued to enforce sanctions 
against Iraq, sanctions that benefit only Saddam Hussein and the wealthy 
coterie around him, while leading to untold death and misery for his people. W
e did little to aid poor and powerless people in many of those countries, 
preferring instead to deal with their oppressive rulers.

<p>In short, my fellow Americans, by not paying attention to what was going on 
amidst the citizens of  the region, we played directly into the hands of the 
growing terrorist movement. Some of this was out of ignorance, some because 
oil and other corporate interests had too much influence on our policy, some 
was out of a sense of denial: America has always been drawn reluctantly into 
the complexities of politics abroad, and even when the terrorists struck our 
assets -- bombing embassies in Africa, blowing up our ship in Yemen or 
barracks in Saudia Arabia -- we  thought  that was “over there” and we could 
handle it at arm’s length. September 11 changed all that way of thinking.

<p>Now, you may say that by promising to re-examine our foreign and military 
policies, we are capitulating to the demands of the bin Ladens of this world. 
Not at all. We are going to change the policies that need to be changed 
because it is in the national self-interest of America, because doing so 
helps protect us and our allies in the region -- and, by the way, because 
it’s the right thing to do. Shining light on one’s shadow history is painful 
at first, but in the long run it leads to honest actions and pays 
extraordinary dividends to us all.

<p>My unshakeable mandate, as I see it, is to help protect and defend the 
interests of America and Americans. That is why  I am ordering today a full 
review of American national policy in the Middle East and South Asia, and 
will expect recommendations for change within 30 days.  

<p>We will reduce tensions in that area, we will work with our partners and 
allies to change how things are done; in short, we will, as best we can, 
reduce the  opportunities for terrorist fanatics to gain new converts to 
their deadly, inhumane cause. We may not be able to influence those in al 
Qaeda-- clearly, they are, in their political/religious frenzy, dedicated to 
mass-murder and mayhem in their desire to destroy the “infidel” West -- but, 
by changing our policies, we may  help alter the chemistry of the soil in 
which future terrorism would grow. That, along with wiping out the al Qaeda 
terror network, is  the best thing we can do to protect our country and help 
make for a better world. 

<p>Thank you, and God bless America.
