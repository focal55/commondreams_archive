For half a century, we've been watching rituals of retribution. 
Countless entertainment shows on TV have presented certain vengeance as 
dramatic justice. In time for the last commercial, the designated bad guys 
got what was coming to them.

<p>These days, news coverage -- or what passes for it -- tends to 
edge out fictional concoctions. The surfaces of pathos, anguish and 
suffering are readily available without scripts, actors or set designers. 
Around the country, local news programs air plenty of crime sensations with 
yellow police tape in the background. Cable channels strive to offer the 
latest shootings in progress. And trials can't miss: Inside a courtroom, 
everyone makes a perfect cameo appearance.

<p>A week before the scheduled execution of Timothy McVeigh, the 
major cable networks -- CNN, Fox and MSNBC -- could hardly tear themselves 
away from the spectacle of a 14-year-old boy as he testified about what 
happened when he shot a teacher, taking an adult's life and shattering his 
own. The camera work and sound quality were crystal clear.

<p>McVeigh's crime, we're told, was the deadliest act of terrorism 
ever on U.S. soil. Among the 168 people he killed were 19 young children. 
 From prison, he has insisted on describing the kids he murdered as 
"collateral damage." It's a phrase that disturbed some media consumers a 
decade ago, during the Gulf War, when it was the euphemism of choice for 
top Pentagon officials and many American reporters.

<p>In a recent statement to a Fox News Channel correspondent, McVeigh 
said: "Collateral damage? As an American news junkie, a military man, and a 
Gulf War veteran, where do they think I learned that?"

<p>Unrepentant and preferring to undergo capital punishment now 
rather than later, McVeigh has declined to appeal his death sentence, a 
move that would have delayed his execution for years. He expresses no 
remorse about setting off a bomb at the federal building in Oklahoma City. 
Explaining his motives to the authors of a new biography, McVeigh 
commented: "I did it for the larger good." With more diplomatic language, 
that's the sort of remark that U.S. officials frequently made during the 
Gulf War.

<p>If McVeigh were black or brown instead of white -- and if he had 
grown accustomed to the idea of inflicting lethal violence as a member of a 
gang instead of as a member of the U.S. Army -- it's a safe bet that news 
media would have flooded us with feature reports, analysis and commentaries 
about the inner-city culture of violence and pathology that produced him. 
But in McVeigh's case, we're made to understand that he was a bad apple in 
a wholesome barrel overseen by Uncle Sam. The good apples, the ones we can 
all be proud of, understood that killing is laudable only when authorized.

<p>And now, it has been authorized in Terre Haute. During the days 
before his execution in that Indiana city, T-shirts with his face on them 
have been selling briskly. A simple message is printed on those souvenir 
shirts: "Die, die, die."

<p>Long ago, Bertrand Russell observed: "The reformative effect of 
punishment is a belief that dies hard, chiefly, I think, because it is so 
satisfying to our sadistic impulses."

<p>The slaying of Tim McVeigh promises to be an unprecedented pageant 
of capital punishment. Advance stories predict that 2,000 journalists will 
descend on Terre Haute for the festivities.

<p>In Newsweek's words, the execution "will be shown on 
closed-circuit television to several hundred victims of the Oklahoma City 
bombing and their families -- the biggest crowd to watch an execution since 
the 1930s." In theory, the audience will be limited. But some of the 
viewers will surely be on national TV to describe what they saw. Bootlegged 
videos are likely to find their way to a wider audience.

<p>If "we," ostensibly represented by the state, are going to kill 
with premeditated executions, then we may as well see the grisly results. 
But why stop there?

<p>A lot of babies perish due to social conditions that could be 
prevented by a shift in government priorities. For the first time in a 
quarter-century, the latest annual figures tell us, infant mortality rates 
have not dropped in the United States -- remaining at 7.2 infants per 1,000 
births. Meanwhile, the Children's Defense Fund says, 10.8 million of the 
nation's children are lacking health insurance.

<p>Unfortunately, there's no media frenzy to cover what happens when 
the state, in effect, routinely kills many Americans simply by inaction -- 
not enforcing workplace-safety rules, or not reducing air pollution that 
menaces people chronically short of breath, or not providing health care 
for the uninsured.

<p>With the corporate-dominated state functioning as a serial killer 
every day, news outlets should shine a bright light on its innocent victims.
