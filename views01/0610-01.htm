WHEN President George W Bush makes his first official visit to  Europe this week, he will step across an immense and  perhaps growing cultural and political divide. His predecessor, Bill Clinton, who had traveled widely in  Europe and spent a year as a student at Oxford, would have known what to  expect. Mr Bush may get a surprise. 
<p>The man dubbed the 'Toxic Texan', because of his support for oil companies and opposition to the Kyoto Protocol on combating global warming, will visit the eco-capital of Europe, Sweden. The man who presided over dozens of executions as governor of Texas will visit a continent where abolition of the death penalty is a prerequisite for membership of the  European Union. Mr Bush, accustomed to a public that consumes genetically modified foods and hormone-treated beef with scarcely a second thought, will meet hostility bordering on hysteria in Europe, on both counts. His plans for a 'son of star wars' anti-missile shield will be received  coolly, both in official  quarters and in the streets. 
<p>He will be met not just by European heads of state but, it is expected, by tens of thousands of protesters. The authorities in Gothenburg, venue for his  summit with the EU, plan to provide accommodation for them in the city's schools. 
<p>There will also be a massive security presence, as Gothenburg becomes the latest station of the cross for anti-globalization demonstrators, after  Seattle, Prague and London. It is not just the  European public's mood that the new American president may find alien. For the first time a US leader will meet with EU counterparts who regard themselves as his equals on the world stage. 
<p>Moreover, most of them have considerably more experience in the diplomatic footlights than he does. For some time the EU has been gearing up to play a bigger world role, and the past months have seen major developments. Most striking is the work now well underway to create a European rapid reaction force -- a military capability 60,000 strong. This  should be ready in a couple of years to undertake peacekeeping and other  operations around the globe, without US involvement. 
<p>Mr Bush has  declared his support for the European initiative, but stays wary, influenced by those such as his under-secretary of state, John Bolton, who says the force is a 'dagger at Nato's heart', which will split the Atlantic alliance. The president may be swayed by  arguments that a stronger European  defense  commitment will actually strengthen the alliance rather than weaken it, but he will also argue strongly that Europe must back its grand ideas with hard cash. EU defense spending per capita is little more than half that of the US, and as recently as the Kosovo campaign it could not have acted without American intelligence and hi-tech weaponry. 
<p>
<p>Diplomatically, the EU is straying more into traditional  American spheres of influence. It is  playing an  increasing role in the Middle East,  capitalizing on its good relations with (and financial support for) the  Palestinians. A top-level European  delegation went to North Korea in May to fill the perceived vacuum caused by Washington's cold-shouldering of the communist regime. Former US  secretary of state,  Henry Kissinger, said he was  'astonished' by this EU sortie -- and said tensions in the transatlantic alliance were his 'greatest concern.'  
<p>A senior US diplomat in Brussels brushed aside the problem: 'You can't have the EU as a strong and effective partner,' he told me, 'and not expect it to do these things. The important thing is to make sure we understand each other.' 
<p>There is a growing catalogue of trade disputes to deal with. The notorious 'banana war', which led to the US  imposing sanctions against many EU products, has been resolved. But the Americans' insistence that Europe should import their hormone-treated beef, GM maize and aircraft  remain a cause of friction. And last week the European Commission gave a prickly reaction to impending US moves to protect its steel industry from  European imports. 
<p>But above all, the environment will dominate Mr Bush's talks. His team has been working overtime to put together an alternative strategy to the Kyoto deal supported by the Europeans. Diplomats stress that he is not saying 'we'll do nothing'. A 'very serious, high-level  review' is underway which will result in a Bush plan to save the environment. One official said it was significant that the  national security advisor, Condoleeza Rice, actually conceded last week that 'global warming' is taking place. But the Europeans, who are furious with the  administration's decision to abandon  Kyoto, will want more than that. 
<p> For both sides, the Bush tour  will be a learning experience. EU leaders will  assess the man they must deal with for the next four years. And Mr Bush was warned last week by Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state, of the  disagreements he can expect to find  beneath the united EU facade. 
<p>'Europeans disagree among  themselves, and vigorously,' she wrote in the New York Times. 'One would have to be a whirling dervish to see eye to eye with all of Europe all the time.'
