Forgive and forget.
<P>That's the American way -- a way that will be greatly tested in the weeks 
and months ahead.
<P>Revenge is the rage in America. At this time, the logic of an eye-for-an-
eye seems compelling. The guardians of American pride -- and the honor of the 
victims in New York and Washington -- want payback.
<P>Even my own 7-year-old daughter, whom I thought had no grasp of current 
events, blandly declared, in between bites of a burrito at the dinner table on 
Wednesday, that those behind the air attacks should be "caught and killed."
<P>But retaliation -- if Americans seek revenge for the sake of revenge -- is 
risky. It could drag the United States into an unending cycle of violence, 
where a new terrorist's reply follows each American sanction, prompting even 
grimmer forms of retaliation.
<P>Before setting ourselves on a vengeful course, we should measure the degree 
of retaliation carefully, mindful that revenge often is a trap laid by the 
terrorist.
<P>And revenge is something more. It is un-American.
<P>Yes, forgiveness, not revenge, is the main note in the tapestry of the 
American past. The tale of the Hatfields and McCoys, those infamous feuding 
neighbors, stands as a caution against the damage done to the quality of life 
when adversaries allow violence to flourish for its own sake.
<P>In stark contrast to many other nations, the United States has a long 
history of setting aside differences in order to promote the interests of the 
living. As a nation of immigrants, the capacity to avoid unending disputes is 
crucial, and the American method has been to mix forgiveness with a dose of 
amnesia.
<P>The Civil War -- the bloodiest conflict in history when it unfolded in the 
1860s -- is held up as the one great example of American failure at 
reconciliation. The war, of course, ended slavery, represented a bitter defeat 
for the South and inaugurated a dozen years of Northern occupation. Yet in 
less than a generation, Yankee and Rebel soldiers were holding reunions 
together, Southern blacks were re-enslaved by Jim Crow laws and the war came 
to be seen as redemptive: Out of this immense bloodshed grew a united nation.
<P>Or consider the U.S. attitude after World War II. Americans spared no 
weapon in the fight to vanquish Germany and Japan, even using atomic weapons 
against the latter. But once the war ended, Americans helped both these 
vanquished peoples rebuild, and today both countries are among America's 
staunchest allies and fiercest economic rivals.
<P>In the spirit of reconciliation, the great civil rights leader Rev. Martin 
Luther King Jr. called on African Americans in the 1960s not to respond with 
violence to the aggression of their white oppressors. He preached a message of 
forgiveness that ultimately won over enough whites to begin a process of 
racial healing that, while still unfinished, ended the nightmare of American 
apartheid.
<P>To be sure, forgiveness and selective forgetfulness are no panaceas. 
Americans must first levy a punishment on those who orchestrated and assisted 
in the murder of its fellow citizens, in order to set the stage for a more 
charitable response.
<P>But Americans and their leaders must realize that no punishment can fit 
this crime. No retaliation will bring back the hundreds of missing New York 
firefighters and the thousands more presumed dead from the four air crashes.
<P>Having been dealt this bad hand, pragmatic Americans ought to fall back on 
their history, and on their particular genius for setting aside differences in 
the service of a greater good.
<P>America is not invincible. It never was. And the open society of which 
America is a fine example has always had its enemies. There are no more 
enemies today, and probably good deal fewer, than there were a half century 
ago or even a quarter-century ago.
<P>Yes, punish the terrorists. But in so doing, remember that punishment ought 
to satisfy the needs of living and not merely honor the dead.
