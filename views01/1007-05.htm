If the London newspaper The Observer is correct, the U.S. 82nd Airborne 
Division and 101st Air Assault Division will join British commandos in a 
strike deep inside Taliban territory in Afghanistan within days. Since the 
present crisis began, the British press has been far ahead of its American 
counterparts in reporting military developments. The Guardian reported special 
forces teams inside Afghanistan six days before USA Today broke the story in 
the United States, explaining that Pakistani newspapers had already revealed 
it.
<P>British reporters clearly have an advantage in reporting from what was a 
part of the British Empire until just after World War II. But as USA Today's 
implicit apology shows, there's more to it than that. Amid the patriotic 
stampede, American journalists appear reluctant to seek information not handed 
to them by "Pentagon sources" or "high officials" in the Bush White House.
<P>Nothing in the British reports told Osama bin Laden and the Taliban 
anything they didn't already know. Only American citizens were left out of the 
loop. Unless you think democracies make better decisions when they're flying 
blind, that's a potentially dangerous development.
<P>No doubt the press must exercise restraint in a time of crisis. But John R. 
MacArthur's fine book about press censorship during the 1990 Persian Gulf War -
- "Second Front: Censorship and Propaganda in the Gulf War" -- vividly 
illustrates what can go wrong. It took the Pentagon years to admit that many 
of its expensive "wonder weapons" never worked as advertised. As Swift argued 
300 years ago, a propagandist's first victim is often himself. Surrounded by 
flatterers and yes-men, generals and presidents alike have trouble learning 
anything new in an echo chamber.
<P>So far the most blatant self-censorship, however, has involved not military 
secrets but political ones. A press consortium including the New York Times, 
Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and CNN has postponed indefinitely 
publishing the results of its long-awaited Florida election recount. Its 
analysis of some 200,000 disputed ballots from the presidential election was 
due out Sept. 17, but New York Times reporter Richard Berke explained that the 
"move might have stoked . . . partisan tensions" and "now seems utterly 
irrelevant." Translation: No point questioning George W. Bush's status at a 
time Americans want him to stand tall.
<P>If "irrelevant," of course, the report could hardly stoke partisan tensions.
<P>It's been clear for months that more Floridians intended to vote for Gore. 
Exactly how many would be useful to know. The decision probably had less to do 
with protecting Bush than insulating the media consortium itself from 
criticism. The paradox is that by postponing it, they've set themselves a trap.
<P>Whether Bush rises or sinks in public esteem, the timing of its eventual 
appearance can't help but be seen as politically motivated.
<P>Bush's most serious problem with the media, however, resides in his own 
White House press office. The same team that arrived in Washington spreading 
since-discredited tales about Clinton staffers trashing Air Force One and 
vandalizing the White House can't seem to quit fictionalizing the news.
<P>Stung by criticism of the president's initial Sept. 11 peregrination to 
Nebraska, press spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters of a telephone threat 
to Air Force One. Karl Rove repeated the narrative to New York Times columnist 
William Safire, who promptly imagined an enemy "mole" inside the White House 
and called for a spy hunt. Last week the Associated Press reported that the 
story was false: "Administration officials said they now doubt whether there 
was actually a call made threatening the president's plane, Air Force One." It 
was all a big misunderstanding, the press office alibied.
<P>Next Fleischer appeared to threaten a late night TV comic who had made a 
lame attempt at iconoclastic humor. "Politically Incorrect's" Bill Maher 
described previous American bomb and cruise missile attacks as "cowardly" -- 
easier said from a TV studio than a jet cockpit or the deck of a destroyer. 
"Americans . . . need to watch what they say, watch what they do," Fleischer 
warned, "and this is not a time for remarks like that; there never is."
<P>Here in the United States, he should be reminded, citizens have a 
constitutional right to make fools of themselves. When Fleischer's threat 
failed to appear in the White House transcript of his statement, the press 
office blamed a transcription error. Next, there were reports that White House 
aides had phoned NBC News to complain about a Tom Brokaw interview with Bill 
Clinton -- who had been urging Americans to unite behind President Bush.
<P>If the president's people want him to look big, it'd definitely help if 
they quit acting so small.
