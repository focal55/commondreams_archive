SECURE US TECHNOLOGY can't get a break lately. One of our submarines fillets a fishing trawler in the open ocean, killing Japanese citizens. The EP-3, the most sensitive weapon in our spy arsenal, gets submarined by a Chinese pilot and filleted on a resort island. 
<P>
<P>The Navy's weapon of the future, the rapid takeoff and landing V-22 Osprey aircraft, which seems to have a slight problem with the takeoff and landing part, killed 23 Marines last year (luckily, a Pentagon committee just green-lighted going forward with the $40 billion weapon, though they did recommend that the manufacturers fix the stuff that keeps making the planes crash). 
<P>
<P>More recently, one of our government's high-tech surveillance planes, manned by CIA contractors, identified a drug smuggling Cessna, which was then shot down by a Peruvian military jet. The technology worked perfectly, but  the  drug smugglers were actually American Baptist missionaries, and the people killed were one of the missionaries and her 7-month-old daughter.
<P>
<P>The troubling part of this latest incident extends beyond the senseless, tragic loss of life - and make no mistake, there is nothing more senseless and  tragic than a bullet hitting an infant, except maybe when that same bullet killed the infant's mother a millisecond earlier. This tragedy also raises a question for US officials: Why are we helping Peru with summary aerial executions?   
<P>
<P>The knee-jerk response will include a phrase about the "war on drugs,"  an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of efforts, some effective and some - well, people can still buy coke, smack, or crack at clubs, schools, and street corners from sea to shining sea. Hmm, since 20-plus years of attacking the supply and suppliers hasn't worked, maybe we should try to do something about the demand. Just a thought.
<P>
<P>Meanwhile, our government, specifically the US Congress in 1994, decided to aid the Peruvians in their attempts to stem the flow of blow by providing high-tech airborne surveillance to help identify possible drug runners, who typically fly at low levels in small private aircraft. Since this program went into existence, the Peruvians have shot down 30 suspected smuggling planes. 
<P>
<P>Or, in other words, we're helping a country repeatedly shoot down suspected criminals without the benefit of stuff like evidence, representation, or a fair trial. The sole criteria for criminal activity seem to be the kind of vehicle and its general location. Let's just call it aviational profiling.
<P>
<P>Word to the Peruvians: We've had a little experience with this type of thing in the United States, and it may not be a smart policy. Example: I know of two drug dealers in my neighborhood. One works for a large multinational pharmaceutical corporation; the other is a freelancer dealing in contraband. Both drive late model SUVs. Who's the criminal? (Consider the high price of prescription drugs before answering.)
<P>
<P>Peru says it follows stringent procedures before opening fire. The pilot and surviving Baptist missionaries say these policies weren't followed. The CIA contractors on the surveillance plane are saying the Peruvian pilots were trigger happy, too. This isn't the first time. Reports say rules were broken in 1994 and 1997. 
<P>
<P>Which brings us back to the role of the US Congress. Aside from supporting executions without due process, how aware were our lawmakers that the Peruvian pilots may have seen ''Top Gun'' a few too many times? 
<P>
<P>In 1994, soon after the surveillance flights began, Congress suspended them after violations were reported. But in 1995, Congress passed a law granting immunity to US personnel if innocent people were killed during these operations, and the surveillance flights were resumed.   
<P>
<P>OK, so what part of this doesn't make us all feel dirty? More to the point, why aren't we stopping this program immediately?   
<P>
