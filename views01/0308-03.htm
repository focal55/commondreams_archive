<i>"The Revolution will not be televised" </i>-- but it will be web-based. That,
at least, is the hope of four activists who joined forces last November to
create an unprecedented new web site, The Electronic Intifada
(<a href="http://www.electronicIntifada.net">http://www.electronicIntifada.net</a>). 

<p>Even before its official launch on February 28th, the site had been lauded
in the Dutch morning newspaper "De Volkskrant," and had received praise
from iconoclastic columnist Alexander Cockburn, who wrote in The Nation
that "Even the relatively better-informed mainstream accounts fail to
convey the brutality of [Israel's apartheid policies]. There are a number
of excellent news outlets for those who want unjaundiced reporting....The
Electronic Intifada...is trusted."

<p>The Electronic Intifada aims to enable a growing, worldwide network of
human rights and media activists to challenge myth, spin, and distortion
about Palestinians and Palestinian rights disseminated by Israel's official
spokespersons and allied pro-Israeli organizations in North America and
Europe. Embodying the principle, stated on the site's contact page, that
"the intifada was never about individual power, but about collective
power," the four activists, Scotsman Nigel Parry, Diaspora Palestinians Ali
Abunimah and Arjan El Fassed and I collaborated over the Internet on the
Electronic Intifada's development for five months before introducing the
site last week with the battle cry: "You have permission to think
critically!" The site's launch announcement, widely distributed to
thousands of email addresses throughout the world, generated over 200
subscribers to the Electronic Intifada's email alert service in just 48
hours.

<p>Other than searing but hasty images of violence, the most significant
dimensions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--historical, legal,
political, and economic--are rarely covered in-depth, if at all, by the
mainstream Western media. Ironically, the media has also neglected another,
key dimension of the conflict: the media itself. The advent of the Internet
has highlighted the media's direct and indirect roles in reinforcing
representations of and policies towards Palestinians, allowing enterprising
individuals throughout the world to log-on to sites reporting direct from
Palestine, thus allowing them to compare the nature and depth of indigenous
coverage to that of the major international news outlets. The Internet also
allows activists and media critics from all points on the globe to join
efforts to challenge media representations underpinning the dynamics of the
conflict. 

<p>In September 1996, Nigel Parry, then webmaster at Bir Zeit University in
the occupied West Bank, helped to launch the first-ever web site reporting
live from an active war zone, during the fighting that broke out over the
tunnel incident in Jerusalem. That experience taught him that "the main
reason that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has carried on as long as it
has is simply because the Israelis have learned very well the importance of
winning the war of words. Since the Internet became such a phenomenon, this
has become a key new arena in which to carry on this war of words, not
least [...] because it overturns the tables on the traditional power
structure of media." The Electronic Intifada allows Palestinians to narrate
their own experience, history, hopes and goals, direct and unmediated to an
international audience accustomed to apprehending Palestinian realities
only through Israeli media filters.

<p>The four founders of The Electronic Intifada had been crossing paths and
sharing ideas for several years--largely through the Internet. In Chicago,
Ali Abunimah, a Palestinian graduate student and the Vice President of the
Arab American Action Network, had made his mark on media monitoring in the
late 1990s by single-handedly challenging the mainstream US media's daily
depiction of events in Israel-Palestine through a series of email letters
that he made available to activists throughout the world on his own
website, "Ali Abunimah's Bitter Pill," at www.abunimah.org. Abunimah's
archive of protest letters is now linked to The Electronic Intifada site.

<p>Meanwhile, Arjan El Fassed, a Palestinian political scientist, media
activist, and human rights specialist living in the Netherlands had also
distinguished himself as an effective cyber-activist, spearheading boycott
campaigns against Burger King and Benneton for opening franchises in
Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories, and producing a prodigious
amount of Op-Eds and letters to editors of papers in Europe, the US, the UK
and Canada. El Fassed is also a co-founder of Al-Awda, the Palestine Right
of Return Coalition.

<p>Having lived and worked as a researcher, editor, journalist and translator
in Israel/Palestine and Lebanon between 1991 and 1997, I had returned to
the US and assumed the editorship of Middle East Report in early 1998, at
which time I befriended Parry, Abunimah and El Fassed through a Palestinian
email discussion list. We quickly became cyber-friends and colleagues,
conducting brainstorming sessions, critiquing each other's work, and
writing to each other regularly to express our dismay at the continuing
lack of critical media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the
persistence of US and Israeli efforts to achieve "peace" while bypassing
any question of justice and all instruments of international law.

<p>Our dismay quickly transformed into outrage upon the eruption of the
al-Aqsa Intifada in September 2000, sparked by Ariel Sharon's provocative
walk-about on the Haram Ash-Sharif. As the death tolls climbed and images
of Palestinian children falling in hails of Israeli bullets dominated
television news reports, we all found ourselves putting aside our own
personal and professional lives to respond to mounting requests from
journalists, other activists, scholars and policy analysts for information,
on-the-ground contacts, and international legal documents to challenge
biased and inaccurate Western media representations of the confrontations.

<p>Upon realizing that the Israeli Government had mounted its own carefully
orchestrated media campaign to spin news reports to its own advantage, we
realized the time had come to respond in a more coordinated and
comprehensive manner. Parry, particularly disturbed by Israeli attempts to
assign the blame for Palestinian children's deaths to their parents, not
the Israeli Army, suggested last October that we create a new web site that
would centralize information and resources while also providing concise and
factual rejoinders to Israeli myths and spin techniques. The site's
fact-sheets and media activism sections would offer clear directives
empowering activists to challenge media representations in an informed and
effective manner at the local, national, and international levels. Further
brainstorming led to a commitment that the site would be a much-needed
"cyber-clearinghouse" of links to relevant international legal documents,
human rights reports, UN resolutions, maps of settlement building,
verifiable statistics on deaths and injuries.

<p>Apparently, the Electronic Intifada has filled a need. A week after its
launch, the site has received a large number of messages expressing
gratitude and appreciation, such as the following posts: 

<p>"Keep up the excellent work! I know that may sound hollow, but I figure you
probably get enough hate mail that you deserve to have some good!"

<p>"Thank you so much for your website! It is a marvelous resource, and very
well put together."

<p>"I just wanted to write and say what an excellent site you created with
your colleagues. I especially liked the section on media activism and how
to deal with the media. Take care and continue the hard work."

<p>In addition to providing crucial resources for media and human rights
activists, the Electronic Intifada also hopes to provide valuable services
to journalists covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and related
issues, such as the Palestinian refugees' right of return, the US
Government's uncritical and massive military and financial support of
Israel despite its continuing pattern of grave human rights violations, and
the Palestinian Authority's deficiencies, as seen through Palestinian eyes.

<p>In the first email alert sent to subscribers, we emphasized that: "Our job
is to help journalists, editors and producers, by letting them know we are
not against them but instead wish to see them perform their jobs to the
best of their abilities. We can help them out by acting as sources for
information and by offering considered responses to their work. When they
get it wrong, we will be there to patiently explain how what they have
published or broadcast doesn't match up to what we know. When they get it
right, we will be there to thank them."

<p>What most journalists consistently "get wrong" is ignoring the key reason
that Palestinians have risen up: to protest the painful and unjust
realities of a 33-year old Israeli occupation of their country. In
establishing the Electronic Intifada, we hope the Internet will give voice
not only to concerned media activists, but more importantly, to
Palestinians so long deprived of the opportunity to narrate what it is like
to live under the world's last occupation regime, which subjects them to a
harsh, interlocking system of daily human rights violations. The injection
of new voices and perspectives into tired media depictions and stale
political debates may well provide a revolutionary catalyst for changing
the way the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is represented and conceptualized,
particularly in those countries whose policymaking greatly influences daily
life for Palestinians under occupation.
