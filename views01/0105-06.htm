<p>&nbsp;As golden anniversaries go, it's a somber occasion. In a forlorn 
expanse of desert scarcely an hour's drive northwest of Las Vegas, on Jan. 
27, 1951, the Nevada Test Site went into operation by exploding an atomic bomb.

         <p>During more than a decade, mushroom clouds often rose toward the 
sky. Winds routinely carried radioactive fallout to communities in Utah, 
Nevada and northern Arizona. Meanwhile, news media dutifully conveyed U.S. 
Atomic Energy Commission announcements to downwind residents: "There is no 
danger."

         <p>In the region, journalists followed the national media spin and 
threw in some extra bravado. "'Baby' A-Blast May Provide Facts on Defense 
Against Atomic Attack," said a headline in the Las Vegas Sun on March 13, 1955.

         <p>That week brought the unveiling of a taller detonation tower -- 
500 feet instead of the previous 300-foot height. The Las Vegas 
Review-Journal informed readers that the change would make them even more 
secure: "Use of taller towers from which atomic devices are detonated at 
the Nevada Test Site introduces an added angle of safety to residents 
living outside the confines of the Atomic Energy Commission's continental 
testing ground, nuclear scientists believe."

         <p>Eleven days later, when the "added angle of safety" did not 
prevent a hot storm of radioactive particles from blanketing the city, the 
Review-Journal reported that the day's events were benign. "Fallout on Las 
Vegas and vicinity following this morning's detonation was very low and 
without any effects on health," the newspaper explained.

         <p>Pundits of the day were eagerly patrolling ideological frontiers 
for the benefit of all Americans. The Los Angeles Examiner published a 
column by International News Service writer Jack Lotto under the headline 
"On Your Guard: Reds Launch 'Scare Drive' Against U.S. Atomic Tests." The 
article warned: "A big Communist 'fear' campaign to force Washington to 
stop all American atomic hydrogen bomb tests erupted this past week."

         <p>It was a popular theme among prominent commentators like 
syndicated columnist David Lawrence, whose wisdom appeared in the 
Washington Post and other leading newspapers. "The truth is," he wrote in 
spring 1955, "there isn't the slightest proof of any kind that the 
'fallout' as a result of tests in Nevada has ever affected any human being 
anywhere outside the testing ground itself."

         <p>By then, children and others living in downwind areas were 
beginning to develop leukemia. As time passed, people in affected areas 
suffered extraordinarily high rates of cancer and thyroid ills. Functioning 
in tandem, the news media and the federal government continued to deny that 
nuclear testing was a health hazard.

         <p>In August 1980, nearly three decades after the Nevada site opened 
for nuclear business, the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on 
Oversight and Investigations concluded: "All evidence suggesting that 
radiation was having harmful effects, be it on the sheep or the people, was 
not only disregarded but actually suppressed."

         <p>That assessment was no surprise to thousands of downwind residents 
like Jay Truman, who grew up in southwestern Utah under the shadow of the 
test site. After watching many friends die, he had no interest in 
pretending that the U.S. government did not kill his schoolmates.

         
<p>When I met Truman in 1980, he was already an expert on nuclear 
testing. Today, as director of the Downwinders organization 
(<a href="http://www.downwinders.org">www.downwinders.org</a>), he's still fighting the good fight.

         <p>From the Rockies to remote Russian sites, nuclear industries have 
taken an enormous toll. Victims include Native American uranium miners, 
nuclear-plant workers and far-flung residents, soldiers exposed to atomic 
bomb tests at close range, Pacific islanders, and people whose lives were 
forever changed during a few split seconds in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

         <p>"Nuclear testing made the Cold War possible," Truman said a few 
days ago. "Without it, humanity could never have developed and deployed the 
weapons that still stand ever-ready to wipe our species off this planet." 
Unable to admit the inevitable health effects of nuclear tests, "all 
governments of all testing nations learned how to -- and perfected being 
able to -- lie to their own citizens."

<p>Fifty years after the first mushroom cloud overshadowed the Nevada 
desert, military contractors and their allies are eager to spread the news 
about the latest technologies offering "an added angle of safety." In 2001, 
Star Wars is back on the media horizon. It's never too late to make a killing.

<p><i>Norman Solomon is a syndicated columnist. He co-authored (with Harvey 
Wasserman) the 1982 book "Killing Our Own: The Disaster of America's 
Experience With Atomic Radiation."
