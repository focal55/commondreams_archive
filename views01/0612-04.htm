<p>"The great sin by which we all are tempted is the wish to hurt others, and this sin must be avoided if we are to live and let live," wrote Karl Menninger, the distinguished psychiatrist, in his penetrating book "The Crime of Punishment."<BR>
<br>
	You can say that again, Karl.<BR>
<br>
"The law neglects all of us. The more fiercely, the more ruthlessly, the more inhumanely the <IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>offender is treated - however legally - the more certain we are to have more victims," those who are "going to get hurt next, so long as the vicious cycle of evil for evil and vengeance for vengeance perpetuates the revolving-door principle of penal justice," he wrote.<BR>
<br>
	The 1990s may go down as one of the meanest decades in U.S. history. Our military planners bombed Iraq back into the Third World and then condemned hundreds of thousands to death under sanctions that are still in place; hate radio led by Rush Limbaugh reached its poisonous peak; Timothy McVeigh killed 168 fellow Americans in one blast; and even studio audiences cheered as Jerry Springer Show guests duked it out on air.<BR>
<br>
	With all that violent energy coursing through the country, perhaps it shouldn't have been a surprise that there was a surge in youth delinquency and violence in the early 1990s - tragically symbolized by the school shootings in Jonesboro, Paducah and Columbine.<BR>
<br>
	But instead of providing brave moral leadership in an attempt to move away from the "vicious cycle of evil for evil," our political leaders played on citizens' fears and put forward all manner of harsh new laws, building new jails and sending more youth to adult criminal courts.<BR>
<br>
	Unfortunately, "many of the so-called 'reforms' enacted in recent years have ignored the real causes for delinquency and neglected the promising cures," writes Richard Mendel in the introduction to his latest study, "Less Cost, More Safety: Guiding Lights for Reform in Juvenile Justice."<BR>
<br>
	The study, released last week and published by the American Youth Policy Forum, a nonprofit professional development organization, notes how "scholars and practitioners have blazed a promising new trail toward progress in reining in America's adolescent crime problem."<BR>
<br>
	"Yet many of our nation's policymakers are instead marching full steam ahead in other directions - directions fraught with alarming costs and inevitable failure both for protecting the public and for maximizing success among troubled youth," Mendel writes.Mendel's study documents the effectiveness of eight out-of-the-ordinary juvenile justice initiatives across the nation, offering persuasive evidence that reducing adolescent crime is not some utopian "feel-good" goal, as right-wing radio and political demagogues would have us believe.<BR>
<br>
	The initiatives profiled in the study show not only that quality intervention programs exist, but how much more effective they are than transferring juveniles to adult courts or relying on other punitive-based philosophies.<BR>
<br>
In Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, they have an innovative home-based counseling program that has lowered the arrest rate of delinquent teenage participants by 70 percent.<BR>
<br>
	 The program, Wraparound Milwaukee, has reduced the number of youth in residential treatment from 360 to 135 per day and has thereby cut more than $11 million annually in treatment costs, according to the study.<BR>
<br>
	In Florida, there's this small corrections ranch down in the Everglades. There they use "intensive behavior management and ongoing follow-up - rather than locked cells or transfers to adult court" to divert potential criminal careers. Over the past four years, the "Last Chance Ranch" has empowered 85 percent of its participants to avoid re-arrest, compared to a 58 percent success rate in Florida's more conventional youth prisons.<BR>
<br>
	In Orange County, Calif., juvenile probation workers have come up with methods of identifying, at first arrest, youth who are most likely to become chronic offenders. And by enrolling "extreme-risk youth" in intensive treatment and family counseling, the county has lowered its future incarceration rates and cut the number of youth offenders with two or more arrests by 29 percent, the study found.<BR>
<br>
	"Contrary to popular perceptions, we really do know how to reduce the criminality of troubled adolescents," Mendel says. "In fact, we're already doing it in these eight sites... . Best of all, the successful methods are far more cost-effective than today's common practices... .<BR>
<br>
	"We must overcome public skepticism that anything can be done with troubled kids, and then start putting our knowledge of what works into practice," Mendel suggests.<BR>
<br>
	"These programs show that especially when it comes to youth, 'the lock-'em-up and throw-away-the-key' approach is both dangerous and wasteful," he cautions.<BR>
<br>
	We ought to see to it that each of our congressional reps and senators gets a copy of "Less Cost, More Safety." (To obtain a copy see <a href="http://www.aypf.org" target="new">www.aypf.org</a> or call the Youth Policy Forum at 202-775-9731).</p>
