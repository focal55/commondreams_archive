If ever I am in Tel Aviv on a Friday I always make my way to that old lefty hang-out, the Cafe Tamar on Shenkin Street. From mid-morning onwards, as you sit outside in the strong sun drinking the terrible coffee, you can watch the city shutting down for the weekend and the street party beginning. 
<P>By mid-afternoon the road is impassable. A heaving throng of Israeli teenagers roars up and down. Some are in uniform - soldiers or reservists on weekend passes who have come straight to Shenkin to meet up with friends before finding somewhere safe to stash their rifles.  
<P>Late in the afternoon, another scene develops by the jetty on the northern side of the old Dolphinarium. A hippie crowd, hundreds strong, comes with drums for a jam session until the sun goes down over the Mediterranean.  
<P>Then they disappear and the streets quieten for an hour or two. They go home to eat and get changed, then in the late evening they're out again, cruising along Ha Yarkon and the Tayelet in a cacophony of car horns.  
<P>As the world now knows, the Dolphinarium also houses a club, the Pascha, popular with young Russian immigrants. Last Friday was "ladies night" - girls got in free - so there were more girls than usual among the crowd of teenagers queueing to get in and more girls than boys among the 18 Israelis killed (the youngest aged 14) and 120 injured in the work of a suicide bomber.  
<P>The detonation could be heard across the city and doubtless it reached up into Islamic heaven where, smiling down at the carnage was Hussein Mohammed Tawil, responsible for another suicide bomb in Jerusalem in March. In a video statement he promised: "I will tear their bodies and their bones into pieces so they will taste death. To kill the Zionists, the occupiers, we will do this in honour of the martyrs, in honour of the prophet."  
<P>On the morning of the nightclub bombing, David Landau, a columnist for the Israeli paper Haaretz, posed this conundrum: "One would expect a country under terrorist attack to fortify its borders, seal every possible crack and vigilantly guard all official border crossings. But for this to happen, there have to be borders - the defensible kind that the army and the police can stand guard over."  
<P>Israel is the only country in the world where 200,000 of its citizens voluntarily choose to live among those they regard as their mortal enemies, at the same time demanding protection from their state. "The settlements," Landau continues, "are endangering the lives of the citizens of Israel: on account of the settlements, the army cannot provide adequate defence. They are endangering the country itself, because the army's powerlessness, caused by the lack of a defensible border, paves the way for terror that debilitates the society and threatens its future."  
<P>The settlers, indulged and coddled by every Israeli government, treating the Israeli Defence Forces like their own private militia, are a sect which has nothing whatsoever to do with the secular lifestyle of 70% of Israelis.  
<P>The teenagers at the Pascha nightclub died for two reasons: because last September Yasser Arafat released Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists from jail and went into strategic alliances with them; and because Israel cannot, because of the settlers, seal its borders and prevent those terrorists from reaching into Israel proper. What is preventing peace in the Middle East is two sides refusing to control their extremists.  
<P>Jews in the diaspora, many of whom have relatives in Israel, should stop excusing the occupation. If they don't care about the Palestinians, they should care about the lives of ordinary Israelis. They should be demanding that the settlers be cut loose. Sharon can choose to escalate this conflict into a regional war. Or he could evacuate every settler who does not choose to shoot it out unprotected by the IDF. He could then build an "iron wall" along the 1967 borders to keep the bombers out.  
<P>Behind it, Palestinians would undergo immense suffering, particularly in Gaza, but they would be forced into making an historic choice. Should they unite behind the rejectionists, the Islamic fundamentalists who tell them that no suffering is too great, no child martyr too many to sacrifice for the final plan - the liberation of the whole of mandate Palestine and the Palestinian flag flying not just over Jerusalem but Tel Aviv, Netanya, Haifa and Eilat?  
<P>Or should they listen to those other rejectionists, the largely western group of intellectuals for whom nothing less than a secular binational state will do. They have no strategy for this, no support inside Israel and no slogan other than "Why can't we all just love each other?" Israel, for them, can't exist because "Zionism is racism" - in other words Jews are the only people in the world to be denied self-determination.  
<P>The third choice for the Palestinians would be to understand that the settlers are gone, the 1967 borders back in place, and that the rejectionists will ensure their suffering is eternal. The Palestinian Authority has not been merciful to collaborators and it doesn't shrink from holding public executions. Arafat will need to exercise the same zero tolerance against Hamas and Is lamic Jihad. If he does, he can return to the negotiating table for a final settlement and the Palestinians can establish their state.  
<P>It is up to them to decide whether they endure another 50 years of unspeakable misery as they hold out for a perfect peace and perfect justice, or settle for what they have rejected three times, in 1937, 1947 and at Camp David last year, choosing armed struggle over partition and statehood.  
<P>For its part, Israel boasts of being the only democracy in the Middle East. It is up to Israelis to ask if they want their fate to be held in the hands of a minority who despise the very existence of the teenagers of Shenkin Street - that is until they are in uniform, cannon fodder for the settlers' messianic dreams of biblical conquest.  
<P><i>Linda Grant's novel When I Lived in Modern Times, set in mandate Tel Aviv, won the 2000 Orange prize for fiction </i>
