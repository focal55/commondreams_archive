TOLIMA, Colombia -- Secretary of State Colin Powell recently affirmed the Bush administration's support for Plan Colombia — the plan inherited from the Clinton White House that pledged $1.3 billion to fight drugs in Colombia. But this plan — based almost entirely on military strategies — could well lead to America's next proxy war in Latin America.
<P> In Putumayo, the province with about half of the coca crop, recent aerial spraying of herbicides has already caused social and environmental havoc. In Strasbourg, France, last week, the European Parliament, worried by the human rights consequences of America's support for this approach and for an army that maintains links to drug-financed paramilitaries, voted 474 to 1 to reject Plan Colombia. </P>
<P> But there are workable alternatives being developed by local governments in Colombia that are on the front lines of this drug war. In six southeastern Colombian provinces where some 80 percent of the Colombian drug crop is grown, new governors have proposed several promising initiatives.</P>
<P> The governors oppose Plan Colombia because they fear their provinces will be overwhelmed by its traumatic impact. They also say no one in the region was consulted when it was designed by officials in Bogotá and Washington. The governors want to use manual eradication of the coca crops rather than widespread fumigation. And, most important, they are identifying pragmatic ways to help peasant communities with livelihoods now tied to drug crops.</P>
<P> These regional leaders know military approaches have not worked. Parmenio Cuéllar, a former justice minister and the new governor of Nariño Province, said in a recent interview: "We all want this plague to be eradicated. But in 20 years, Colombia's anti-narcotics policies have not reduced, much less eliminated, drug production. We have to recognize that the problem of drugs in Colombia is tied to the poverty of the peasants."</P>
<P> Manual eradication with the voluntary labor of the peasant growers uproots crops peacefully, without environmental harm. Persuading these growers to eradicate their drug crops is the easy part because they are sick of drug-related violence and scared of the fumigation and mass displacement that follow.</P>
<P> But alternative eradication methods do not address the central economic problem that is driving coca production. Colombia's traditional rural economy is in crisis. Take coffee, for example. Since Colombia opened its agricultural markets in the early 1990's, the coffee harvest has been reduced almost by half. Ten years ago, agricultural imports to Colombia were 700,000 tons, and today they are 7 million tons. One million rural jobs have been lost during the past decade. A quarter of a million peasants have turned to coca production. Any long-term solution has to provide sustainable crops or employment.</P>
<P> Recently, two of the governors held exploratory talks with European diplomats in Bogotá to discuss the kinds of programs they intend to present to European governments in Brussels this spring, when Europe will decide how to spend $800 million over five years. There are a few infrastructure projects on their list: a highway linking Tolima, Huila and Nariño to the Pacific coast; improvements to the Pacific port of Tumaco. They have identified competitive products for export: rubber, African palm, cocoa, and wood. And they say milk production, tropical fruits and cotton could be linked to microenterprises in rural towns. One small town near the Narino-Ecuador border, for example, currently employs 1,000 people producing specialty foods for Japan.</P>
<P> As for the war, the governors have reason to believe that once peasant communities have some economic alternatives to coca production, the guerrillas in the region will not be able to oppose the citizens' collective will.</P>
<P> Last week, Plan Colombia's operations in Putumayo were temporarily suspended, in part because of local protests. The Bush administration now has an opportunity to evaluate this project's performance. There is still time to turn this ill-conceived plan around and get behind the development proposals of the local governors. With American support, their integrated vision of a drug-free, more peaceful Colombia is still possible.</P>
