It appears that even Republicans are having a hard time coming 
              up with arguments in favor of President Bush&#146;s tax cut plan, 
              which even the White House now admits will direct the overwhelming 
              majority of benefits to the wealthiest Americans.
<P>With the president having acknowledged that roughly a quarter of 
              the tax cut will go directly into the pockets of the richest 1 percent 
              of Americans &#151; and that well over 50 percent of the largesse 
              will be delivered to folks with incomes over $100,000 a year &#151; 
              the Bush plan looks like the most radical redistribution of income 
              America has seen since King George III was shaking down the colonials.</P>
<P>Up against that reality, Bush backers are understandably hard-pressed 
              to come up with rationales for their boy&#146;s tax strategy. This 
              is definitely a case where honesty &#151; "We gave Bush a lot of 
              money for his campaign, and now he is going to restructure tax policy 
              so that we pay less while working people shoulder more of the burden" 
              &#151; just doesn&#146;t cut it.</P>
<P>Luckily, Republican loyalists in Wisconsin and other states don&#146;t 
              have to think. As part of a coordinated campaign to create the fantasy 
              that Bush&#146;s Robin-Hood-in-Reverse gambit has popular appeal, 
              members of the Wisconsin Republican e-mail list have been deluged 
              with promptings to write representatives and local papers.</P>
<P>As one recipient of the party&#146;s urgent e-mails put it when 
              she forwarded the sample letters, "Word must have come down from 
              the Bush team that the tax plan is really in trouble. ... I&#146;ve 
              gotten a ton of e-mails asking folks to write letters to the editor 
              and to call their congressfolks pleading to pass this thing."</P>
<P>Just how desperate the Bushistas are to sell their scheme is obvious 
              from the "sample" letters to the editor the GOP is urging partisans 
              to print out, sign and send. Here are some favorites:</P>
<P></P>
<P><i>Dear Editor: I did a double take the other night when President 
              Bush spoke to the nation. Here was a man who finally understands 
              what&#146;s important. He wants to double funding on medical research 
              on cancer and other diseases. He wants to pay off more government 
              debt than any other country in history. He wants to make our schools 
              better and our streets safer. And he wants to let me keep more of 
              my money in the form of a tax cut. Only those who make a conscious 
              choice to live in the past could overlook what President Bush wants 
              to do for our future.</i></P>
<P><i>Signature</i></P>
<P></P>
<P><i>Dear Editor: The president was right on the other night when he 
              said he wanted to keep his word to seniors by locking away Social 
              Security and Medicare funds for Social Security and Medicare alone. 
              Here is a man that knows our generation created much of America&#146;s 
              greatness and he is delivering on his promise to keep Washington 
              from raiding seniors&#146; retirement and health care programs. 
              He has my support.</i></P>
<P><i>Signature</i></P>
<P></P>
<P><i>Dear Editor: The president&#146;s new budget looks a lot like my 
              personal budget. He funds what&#146;s important. He saves money 
              for unseen emergencies. He pays off as much debt as possible. He 
              takes care of seniors. And he gives reasonable tax relief. Looks 
              to me like he is making government decisions the way families make 
              family decisions.</i></P>
<P><i>Signature</i></P>
<P></P>
<P>Notice how all of these folksy dispatches attempt to steer attention 
              away from Bush&#146;s tax cut for the rich? Notice how they all 
              try to suggest that the Bush budget takes care of all of the nation&#146;s 
              needs? Notice the suggestion that Bush "is delivering on his promise 
              to keep Washington from raiding seniors&#146; retirement" &#151; 
              when, in fact, he wants to downsize Social Security so that more 
              retirement money can be risked on Wall Street?</P>
<P>This is classic "spin." The problem is that even the people on 
              the GOP e-mail list are giggling. As the person who forwarded these 
              sample letters to me put it: "It was really hard to control my laughter 
              when I read some of these."
