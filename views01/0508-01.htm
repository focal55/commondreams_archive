&quot;Relentlessly corporate.'' That's the best description I have heard to describe the Bush administration, 100-plus days into its rule. To say, as so many have, that Bush has governed far to the right of his campaign rhetoric is accurate. Yet it lacks precision.
<P>

   Relentlessly corporate: the phrase aptly describes who is in charge of this administration and, therefore, the nation. The Republican Party contains at least three factions: the Puritans, who seek to police morality; the Plutocrats, who unabashedly represent the interests of big business; and the Moderates, who try to strike a balance between the vote-rich middle class and the wealthy who fund the party. 
<P>

   Just who is in the driver's seat now? The moderates have gotten virtually nothing from the administration, but Bush has made a few significant bows to the Puritans, including the appointment of John Ashcroft to be attorney general. Yet it is clear that the Plutocrats, the corporate wing of the GOP, run the show. Welcome to America, Inc., presided over by a $36-million-a-year CEO also known as Vice President Dick Cheney.
<P>

   Through its appointments, by shredding environmental and worker-safety standards and dumping an international treaty to curb global warming, the administration has provided ample evidence that the government is being run by and for the corporate elite. Yet the best proof has yet to come. It will arrive in the form of the administration's energy policy, now being crafted in secret meetings of the National Energy Policy Development Group, chaired by Cheney.
<P>GOP's corporate wing is in the driver's seat.
<P>

   Dubbed the Fossil Fuel Club by critics, the members of the Bush-appointed board are indeed a ``Who's Who'' of oil men and other corporate insiders and politicians beholden to them. But their agenda is even larger than opening federal land to exploitation or easing environmental regulations to speed up oil, natural gas and coal production. Even nuclear power may be back after a long hiatus following the Three Mile Island scare and the Chernobyl disaster. 
<P>

   The damage wrought by rising pollution and a policy of increasing energy production at all costs will be borne by children with asthma, wildlife, future generations and other groups not counted among major donors to the political game. The administration is sure to camouflage and justify its huge payback to the corporate forces that propelled it into office by intoning a simple but powerful mantra: energy crisis. Remember gasoline lines? Remember blacked-out California? Unless we build 1,900 new power plants during the next 20 years the whole country will look like that. 
<P>

   While exploiting fears, the administration forgets to mention that, according to the government's own scientists, we can have the energy we need without polluting the beaches off Florida's Panhandle or destroying the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.
<P>

   According to new peer-reviewed studies by top scientists at several national laboratories, conservation alone can eliminate the need for at least 20 percent and perhaps as much as almost half of the new power plants the administration says we need. Contrary to what the administration claims, there is a greener, cleaner alternative that doesn't leave us all shivering or sweating in the dark. Many of the energy-saving methods have been shown to work and could be easily applied if only the administration had the political will to do it. 
<P>

   But energy conservation isn't popular with oil companies. So instead of promoting conservation, the administration has kept the people in the dark by failing to publicize the government's own conservation studies and has slashed the budget for research into developing more energy-efficient buildings, cars and other products. Relentlessly corporate? By all indications, after Bush releases his energy blueprint, a stronger term may be more apt: ruthlessly corporate.
