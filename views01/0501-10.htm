The revelation of atrocities in Vietnam by Senator Kerrey should entice Americans to pause and reflect on what former UN Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar called “one of the most barbarous wars in history.” 

<p>U.S. policy in Vietnam included massive search and destroy missions that razed villages and slaughtered livestock.  One hundred million pounds of chemicals were used in an attempt to defoliate land and locate the “enemy.”  This “chemical warfare” resulted in the destruction over 15 percent of the forest and agricultural land in South Vietnam.

<p>The CIA directed its own warfare including the infamous “Phoenix Program” in South Vietnam, through which a reported 20,000 “sympathizers” of the Viet Cong were assassinated.  

<p>The worst brutality was the massive bombing in history.  Before it was over, 8 million tons of bombs were dropped.  This was more than three times what the United States dropped in all of World War II.  The bombing produced over 25 million bomb craters, and included such indiscriminate weapons as napalm, phosphorous and fragmentation bombs, as well as high altitude saturation bombing by giant B-52s.

<p>The bombing campaign obliterated many towns and cities.  In South Vietnam the bombing of Quang Tri alone exceeded the equivalent TNT tonnage of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.

<p>The invasion of Cambodia in 1970, along with the extensive B-52 saturations raids, virtually ruined the country’s agriculture, as well as brutalizing the rural population.

<p>This U.S. Policy was heavily responsible for strengthening a weak guerrilla force led by Pol Pot, which eventually overthrew the U.S. backed Lon Nol government.

<p>The Pol Pot government was one of the most primitive and barbaric in human history.  Yet, when the crimes of this regime were revealed, the U.S. did nothing to stop it.  On the contrary, for years the U.S. insisted that the Pol Pot regime represent Cambodia in the United Nations.

<p>No one knows the exact figure on how many people were killed in the U.S./Vietnam War, but most estimates are that between 2-3 million people were killed.   By 1973, 11 million people had become homeless. 57,000 young Americans were sent to their deaths, and another 300,000 injured.

<p>While individual acts of brutality are reported and those responsible must come to terms, the bigger test is when our government acknowledges that U.S. Policy in Vietnam was a crime, and those most responsible were the presidents and generals who designed the policy, and members of congress who supported and authorized payment for it.

<p>After this national catharsis, we could move on to examine U.S. Policy of the 1980s, including the disgraceful military and financial support of the death squads and brutal military regimes in Central America.  

<p>Then we can move to Iraq in what was more a slaughter than a war, including the infamous highway of death.  It was here than American and British pilots slaughtered Iraqi soldiers trying to flee back to their country after the war was over.  One American pilot put it succinctly:  “It was like shooting fish in a barrel.”

<p>This was followed by harsh economic sanctions against Iraq that continue today.  According to UN figures, the sanctions are responsible for the death of over one million Iraqi civilians.   

<p>There are so many great things in this country and so much to share with the world.  However, the dark side is the bullying of other countries, the constant sanctimonious preaching to others without confronting our own deficiencies, and the militarization of U.S. Policy  The U.S. is also the world’s leading “merchant of death,” selling and giving weapons to over 160 countries.

<p>The up-to-date problem is President Bush’s intention to abrogate the 1972 ABM Treaty and proceed with an anti-missile system regardless of world opinion and the danger of igniting a new nuclear arms race. Worse yet, this is only the first step in this country’s intention to militarize space to protect “U.S. interests and investments” as clearly stated in the U.S. Space Command’s document Vision for 2020.   

<p>We have a very short time to stop the weaponization of space before the military/congressional/industrial-complex turn the final frontier into another desert they call peace.
