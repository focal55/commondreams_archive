Her parents escaped Vietnam in a rickety boat. Now a proud 
graduate of the University of California, she, unlike her parents, has only 
known peace and prosperity.
<P>September 11 ended that chapter of her life.
<P>In a letter to her friends and former professors, she writes, "My youth is 
over; my innocence has ended." Like so many Americans, she describes a 
traumatic wound, a certainty that she will never again enjoy a sense of 
security.
<P>"Why did this happen?"
<P>In the first days after the attacks, many people felt too shocked and 
overwhelmed to ask this question. Now, along with millions of other Americans, 
this young woman wants to understand the enemy who committed the most 
audacious terrorist acts in our nation's history.
<P>What are the origins of such intense hatred against our country? Can 
history help us comprehend terrorists who are willing to die as they kill 
innocent civilians?
<P>To ask such questions is not unpatriotic. Nor do historical explanations 
absolve those who have committed these heinous crimes. Whether or not history 
can help us heal, it can offer us the perspective and wisdom we need to fight 
this unprecedented threat.
<P>Arab and Islamic hatred of the West is hardly new. Some historians locate 
its origins during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries, when the Crusades 
effectively wrested the Holy Land from the Muslims.
<P>In the 20th century, antipathy toward the West only deepened. Each war 
resulted in consequences that intensified hatred toward the West.
<P>After World War I, for example, European colonial powers carved up the 
Ottoman Empire into arbitrary states and hand-picked leaders who owed their 
political power and wealth to the British and French. The result was a 
dramatic rise in secular Arab nationalism.
<P>The end of World War II, during which the Nazis had tried to annihilate the 
entire European Jewish population, helped establish the state of Israel -- 
right in the heart of a hostile Arab Middle East.
<P>The Cold War, for its part, helped ignite the growth of a new Islamic 
fundamentalist movement. As the United States and the Soviet Union divided the 
world into separate spheres of influence, Islamic dissidents increasingly 
viewed both superpowers as godless, soulless empires.
<P>American support of wealthy, corrupt royal families in the Middle East 
outraged many Arabs and Muslims who contrasted the poverty of their own people 
with the extreme wealth flaunted by their leaders. By the 1970s, a new Islamic 
fundamentalism began to challenge U.S.-backed Middle Eastern leaders who had 
protected American access to oil.
<P>The Iranian revolution catapulted Ayatollah Khomeini to international 
prominence and cast the United States as "the Great Satan." Soon afterward, an 
Egyptian writer, Abd al-Salem Faraj, wrote "The Neglected Duty,"a manifesto 
that called for a holy war to restore Muslim dignity.
<P>When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, 35,000 idealistic 
Islamic men from all over the world rushed to defend that Central Asian 
country. Many of these young men, supported and trained by the CIA, learned 
the art of warfare as they waged a jihad against Soviet troops.
<P>Unexpectedly, the war transformed a generation of fundamentalist idealists 
into a disciplined network of terrorists. "It was the Woodstock of the jihad 
generation,"says ex-CIA agent Milt Bearden. Unlike earlier Arab nationalists, 
these religious fundamentalists embraced a deeply reactionary, anti-modernist, 
view of the world. Among them was Osama bin Laden, the scion of a wealthy 
Saudi family.
<P>After they defeated the Soviet Union, these hardened fighters then turned 
their attention to the other perceived infidel, America. The 1991 Persian Gulf 
War fanned their growing hatred of the United States when the Saudi royal 
family allowed Americans to attack Iraq from Saudi soil. After the war, some 7,
000 U.S. soldiers remained in Saudi Arabia, which, in bin Laden's view, 
desecrated Islam's most sacred sites -- Mecca and Medina -- and justified a 
holy war against America.
<P>And then there is Israel. For half a century, the United States has 
steadfastly championed this tiny nation that emerged from the jaws of the Nazi 
Holocaust. But American support of Israel's occupation of Palestinian 
territory, as well as its expanding settlements, has intensified Arab and 
Islamic sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Nearly every night, Arabs and 
Muslims watch televised broadcasts of Israeli helicopters, missiles and 
bullets killing Palestinian civilians. These weapons, they protest, are 
purchased with the annual $3 billion aid provided by the United States.
<P>Which brings us to the painful present. For the last decade, bin Laden's 
network has waged a relentless war against the United States -- bombing our 
embassies and training thousands of terrorists in camps scattered throughout 
Afghanistan. U.S. bombing of Iraq, the Sudan and Afghanistan -- all Muslin 
populations -- has only justified their jihad against America.
<P>Terrorism cannot be tolerated or excused in any way. The United States must 
identify and eliminate the terrorist network behind the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Still, understanding the historical sources of Arab and Islamic resentment may 
help us address the poverty and human misery that fuel fanaticism and acts of 
desperation.
<P>But how do we fight terrorism without creating new terrorists?
<P>That, alas, is the question of the day.
