Since the fall of 1993, when Congress passed the North American 
              Free Trade Agreement, The Capital Times has stood in militant opposition 
              to the "free trade" policies of mainstream Democrats and Republicans. 
              We have objected, again and again, to trade deals that make the 
              expansion of corporate profits a higher governmental priority than 
              worker rights, environmental protection, safeguards for consumers 
              and the preservation of family farming.
<P>From a journalistic standpoint, it has been a lonely mission. U.S 
              Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, the leading congressional critic of current 
              trade policy, says she knows of only two daily newspapers that consistently 
              editorialize against NAFTA. Similarly, when Congress debated permanent 
              most-favored-nation trading status for China last year, all but 
              a few newspapers sided with the corporate lobbyists who drive the 
              "free trade" agenda.</P>
<P>Does it bother those of us who edit The Capital Times to stand 
              in opposition not merely to bad government policies but also to 
              bad media policies? Not at all. William T. Evjue founded this newspaper 
              for precisely that purpose.</P>
<P>Evjue started The Capital Times in 1917 to defend U.S. Sen. Robert 
              M. La Follette, who was under attack by major newspapers in Wisconsin 
              and nationally for opposing U.S. entry into World War I. La Follette 
              believed the United States was being pulled into that European war 
              by arms merchants seeking fortunes at the cost of young lives. La 
              Follette believed, as well, in Thomas Jefferson&#146;s abiding principle 
              for the United States: "Peace, commerce and honest friendship with 
              all nations &#151; entangling alliances with none."</P>
<P>The Capital Times, at its founding and to the present day, has 
              followed the same Jeffersonian impulse that La Follette did. That 
              impulse today informs our approach to the trade debates that will 
              be the central struggles of George W. Bush&#146;s presidency. On 
              Saturday, Bush will travel to Quebec City to promote the development 
              of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), under which the United 
              States would enter into the most entangling alliance in the nation&#146;s 
              history.</P>
<P>If the FTAA scheme succeeds, the United States would join other 
              western hemisphere nations in a pact that would allow an unelected, 
              unaccountable "trade resolution" panel to overrule the laws and 
              regulations of the United States and other countries if they are 
              judged to be barriers to free trade. Beyond the fact that such a 
              structure is fundamentally undemocratic, it is, as well, entirely 
              biased in favor of multinational corporations that operate on a 
              "trade uber alles" ("trade over all") ethic.</P>
<P>Global Trade Watch&#146;s Lori Wallach has referred to the FTAA 
              as "NAFTA on steroids." And that&#146;s a scary thought.</P>
<P>Since NAFTA went into effect in 1994, 23 complaints of systematic 
              violations of workers&#146; rights have been filed under the agreement&#146;s 
              structures for resolving such matters. According to Human Rights 
              Watch, "not one of the 23 complaints (has) so far resulted in sanctions 
              against an alleged labor rights violator."</P>
<P>A surprise? Hardly.</P>
<P>NAFTA was not structured to protect workers, farmers, consumers 
              or communities. And the FTAA will be even worse.</P>
<P>So The Capital Times will oppose the FTAA. Passionately.</P>
<P>That may put us out of sync with most of America&#146;s increasingly 
              monopolized and homogenized media. But that&#146;s nothing new. 
              In 1919, La Follette wrote to Evjue, "The enemies of democracy are 
              entrenched in power in every community. They speak through presidents 
              and cabinets. They rule in Congress. They are in the pulpits. They 
              control the press."</P>
<P>In opposing the latest attempt to involve America in an entangling 
              alliance designed to strangle the rights of workers, this newspaper 
              will stand on the side of those who object and protest. That will 
              place us outside the American media mainstream &#151; exactly where 
              Evjue would have wanted us.
