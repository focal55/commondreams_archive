In 1998, I was vacationing with my family in Ireland, when the tragic Omagh
bombings occurred. A car bomb exploded in a crowded market on a Saturday,
killing dozens of innocent shoppers. The following Saturday, memorial
services were held across the island, north and south and many people
expressed the same sentiment: Enough. After more than 25 years of sectarian
violence, this latest, most heinous act finally made people resolve to end
violence. And although some of the hard-core terrorists on both sides have
made several efforts to wreck the peace process since then, the vast
majority of Irish citizens, north and south, have refused any longer to have
any part of the violence they once participated in through active
collaboration or passive consent.

<p>Last night, after the nauseating acts of terrorism that turned innocent
citizens and their means of transportation into weapons of mass destruction
against thousands of other innocent citizens, I heard one of the chorus of
television talking heads, a militaristic intelligence "expert," ask the
question: "Have we had enough yet?" It was a rhetorical question, and he
presumed that if the answer was "yes," then all Americans were willing to
follow him to "kick ass" and "take out" nations which harbored terrorists.

<p>These commentators, our political "leaders," and other shapers of opinion
are blatantly seeking - and getting - advance public support for a vengeance
campaign of massive retaliation that will include "collateral damage," that
is, the taking of the lives of hundreds or thousands of other innocents
abroad. It is the oldest form of knee-jerk human response to violence: An
eye for an eye.

<p>But the question is: If we are willing to accept "collateral damage," what
makes us any different from the terrorists? The thoughtless, arrogant answer
for many Americans is that we would be justified because of the magnitude of
the crime committed against us. In fact, in the office I work in, one
colleague, discussing this point, stated simply: "Children will have to
die." And this is exactly the reasoning that led the terrorists on Tuesday
to turn hijacked planes and office towers into crematoria: In their minds,
their acts were justified because of the magnitude of the crimes that
America, or the American government, had committed against them and the
values or causes they hold dear.

<p>Americans - and the world - have the opportunity now, maybe the last
opportunity ever, to turn this tragedy into something of lasting value, to
make it a turning point in the human experience, in exactly the same way the
people of Ireland turned the Omagh bombing into a bloody final step up to
the plateau of peace rather than down into the unending cycle of violence
and revenge that had plagued their land for decades and robbed everyone of
some loved one.

<p>What the Irish did when they said "Enough!" was to stop tolerating violence,
stop sympathizing with or sheltering perpetrators of violence, and stop
abiding by the code of silence that allowed terrorists to operate. They
stopped coddling terrorists and stopped collaborating with terror.

<p>And if we really believe that what we witnessed on September 11 in New York
City and Washington, DC, was enough - and who could ever want to live to see
the day when worse acts would happen? - then all of humanity must be willing
to stop tolerating terrorists, to say that whatever cause or values or
religion or nation we hold dear, that it's not worth the price of more human
lives.

<p>Saying "Enough!" and not tolerating terrorists would have to mean that we
are prepared to speak out and stand together against all forms of terrorism.

<p>It's easy to condemn another nation's or another religion's terrorists,
especially when their acts are directed against one's own national or
religious or ethnic group. But what turned the tide in Ireland is that,
after Omagh, people stopped tolerating, hiding, and coddling the terrorists
within their own ranks.

<p>In the modern world, there are many forms of terrorism. It's not just
hijackers or car-bombers or kamikazes. It's governments that bomb rebel or
enemy towns and villages, enact sanctions that rob children of food and
medical supplies, starve citizens, abet drug traffickers, torture political
opponents, carry out capital punishment, develop biological weapons, drop
atomic bombs, and wage high-tech or low-tech wars.

<p>Saying "Enough!" to terrorism means no longer cooperating with any
violence - including the state-sanctioned terrorism of wars, repression and
reprisals. It means withholding consent and support for all governments,
including that of the United States, which carry out acts of terror against
human beings.

<p>The mistake that the American people are about to make is to let their
government carry out reprisals in their name that will kill innocent people
not connected to these terrorist attacks. It's a mistake not just because it
continues the ever-escalating cycle of violence, but because it legitimizes
this government once more, a government that invented, perfected and
exported many forms of modern terrorism - and all the other governments
which mimic or exacerbate this violence.

<p>Many thousands of Americans died yesterday. The way to prevent more deaths
is not to kill more people. The way to stop terrorists is not to condone
state-sanctioned terrorism. The only way out of this madness is to say - and
mean - "Enough!" - by refusing to participate, even by passive consent, in
the continuing cycle of violence; to object, to speak out against, all forms
of terror. We must pull out violence from our world by the roots, or no one
will be safe.

<p>Have we had enough?
