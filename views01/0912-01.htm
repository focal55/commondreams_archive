Did Osama bin-Laden outwit US intelligence agencies in a
deadly game of decoy or double bluff? CounterPunch has
learned from two sources that a) three weeks before the
attack of September 11 security at the World Trade Center
was abruptly heightened and that b) six weeks before the
attack a US army base in New Jersey was placed on top
security alert.

<p>As regards the heightened security at the Trade Center, we
are told that according to a businessman working in World
Trade Building number 7 (the 41-story structure that
collapsed after having been evacuated) "security was
heightened three weeks ago, including the introduction for
the first time of sniffer dogs and the physical search of
all trucks prior to their being waved into the entrance from
the street.

<p>The US army base in New Jersey is the Arsenal at Picatinny.
Our informant says that at the start of July the Arsenal was
placed at a very state of alert, with some staff locked in
their offices for a period.

<p>Set this information against the fact that Osama bin Laden,
now prime suspect, said in an interview three weeks ago with
Abdel-Bari Atwan, the editor of the London-based al-Quds
al-Arabi newspaper, that he planned "very, very big attacks
against American interests." On the night of September 11
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts told CNN that CIA
director George Tenet informed him before the attack that
the Agency had recently thwarted an attack by bin Laden's
organization.

<p>So, was there an attempted attack some time in August, or
was it merely a feint by the bin Laden units, to prompt an
alert, then a relaxation of US security procedures?

<p>US intelligence agencies, stung with charges that they are
responsible for a failure of catastrophic proportions, are
successfully pressing for bigger funding, with the
likelihood that the present $30 billion outlay will soar
upward.

<p>The September 11th onslaughts on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon are being likened to Pearl Harbor and the
comparison is just. From the point of view of the assailants
the attacks were near miracles of logistical calculation,
timing, courage in execution and devastation inflicted upon
the targets.

<p>The Pearl Harbor base containing America's naval might was
thought to be invulnerable, yet in half an hour 2000 were
dead, and the cream of the fleet destroyed. This week,
within an hour on the morning of September 11, security at
three different airports was successfully breached, the
crews of four large passenger jets efficiently overpowered,
the cockpits commandeered, navigation coordinates reset.

<p>In three of the four missions the assailants attained
successes probably far beyond the expectations of the
planners. As a feat of suicidal aviation the Pentagon
kamikaze assault was particularly audacious, with eyewitness
accounts describing the Boeing 767 skimming the Potomac
before driving right through the low lying Pentagon
perimeter, in a sector housing Planning and Logistics.

<p>The two Trade Center buildings were struck at what
structural engineers say were the points of maximum
vulnerability. The strength of the buildings derived
entirely from the steel perimeter frame, designed - so its
lead architect said only last week - to withstand the impact
of a Boeing 707. These buildings were struck full force on
the morning of September 11 by Boeings 767s, with fuel tanks
fully loaded for the long flights to the West Coast. Within
an hour of the impacts both buildings collapsed. By evening,
a third 46-story Trade Center building had also crumbled.

<p>Not in terms of destructive extent, but in terms of symbolic
obliteration the attack is virtually without historic
parallel, a trauma at least as great as the San Francisco
earthquake or the Chicago fire.

<p>Here is bin-Laden, probably the most notorious Islamic foe
of America on the planet, originally trained by the CIA,
planner of other successful attacks on US installations such
as the embassies in East Africa, carrying a $5 million FBI
bounty on his head proclaiming the imminence of another
assault, and US intelligence was impotent, even though the
attacks must have taken months, if not years to plan, and
even though CNN has reported that bin-Laden and his
coordinating group al-Qa'ida had been using an airstrip in
Afghanistan to train pilots to fly 767s.

<p>Back in the 1960s and 1970s, when hijacking was a
preoccupation, the possibility of air assaults on buildings
such as the Trade Center were a major concern of US security
and intelligence agencies. But since the 1980s and
particularly during the Clinton-Gore years the focus shifted
to more modish fears, such as bio-chemical assault and
nuclear weapons launched by so-called rogue states. This
latter threat had the allure of justifying the $60 billion
investment in Missile Defense aka Star Wars. The national
security budget is grotesquely tilted towards high tech,
costly items, and this is reflected in the procurement
policies of the intelligence agencies which have poured
money into satellites, spy planes and snooping technologies,
(which are so incompetent they even failed to detect India's
nuclear detonations in June of 1998), all at the expense of
human intelligence.

<p>One of the biggest proponents of the bio-chemical threat was
Al Gore's security advisor, Leon Fuerth, who wailed
plaintively amid the rubble of the Pentagon that "In effect
the country's at war but we don't have the coordinates of
the enemy."

<p>In the aftermath of the attack, calls for retribution
mounted rapidly, few with more venom that the oration in
Congress from the junior senator from New York, who was
positively blood curdling in contrast to Mayor Rudy
Giuliani's commendable performance as a leader and as a
public voice counseling against over-hasty identification of
the attackers.

<p>The phrases "faceless coward" and "faceless enemy" have been
bandied about. This phrase has a savage resonance to those
who recall its use in America's war in Vietnam. In 1965 CIA
officer George Carver wrote an infamous article in Foreign
Affairs titled "The Faceless Vietcong", which rationalized
the US campaign of assassination and torture of civilians in
South Vietnam that came to be known as the Phoenix Program.

<p>The lust for retaliation traditionally outstrips precision
in identifying the actual assailant. By early evening,
September 11, America's national security establishment was
calling for a removal of all impediments on the
assassination of foreign leaders. Led by President Bush,
they were endorsing the prospect of attacks not just on the
perpetrators but on those who might have harbored them. From
the nuclear priesthood is coming the demand that mini-nukes
be deployed on a preemptive basis against the enemies of
America.

<p>The targets abroad will be all the usual suspects: rogue
states, (most of which, like the Taleban or Saddam Hussein,
started off as creatures of US intelligence). The target at
home will be the Bill of Rights. Less than a week ago the
FBI raided Infocom, the Texas-based web host for Muslim
groups such as the Council on Islamic Relations, the Islamic
Society of North America, the Islamic Association for
Palestine, and the Holy Land Foundation.

<p>Declan McCullagh, political reporter for Wired, has
described how within hours of the blast FBI agents began
showing up at internet service providers demanding that they
place "Carnivore system" traces to track e-mail traffic on
their systems. In some cases the FBI offered to underwrite
the costs of installing "Carnivore". McCullagh quotes one
Microsoft engineer as saying that Microsoft "officials have
been receiving calls from the San Francisco FBI office since
mid-Tuesday morning and are cooperating with their expedited
request for information about a few specific accounts. Most
of the account names start with the word 'Allah' and contain
messages in Arabic."

<p>Palestinians have been denied visas, and those in this
country can, under the terms of the Counter-Terrorism Act of
the Clinton years, be held and expelled without due process.
The explosions were not an hour old before terror pundits
like Anthony Cordesman, Wesley Clark, Robert Gates and
Lawrence Eagleburger were saying that these attacks had been
possible "because America is a democracy", adding that now
some democratic perquisites might have to be abandoned. What
might this mean? Increased domestic snooping by US law
enforcement and intelligence agencies; ethnic profiling;
another drive for a national ID card system.

<p>The aftermath of the attacks did not offer a flattering
exhibition of America's leaders. For most of the day the
only Bush who looked composed and in control was Laura, who
happened to waiting to testify on Capitol Hill. Her husband
gave a timid and stilted initial reaction in Sarasota,
Florida, then disappeared for an hour before resurfacing
Barksdale airbase in Shreveport, Louisiana, where he gave
another flaccid address with every appearance of bring on
tranquilizers. He was then flown to a bunker in Nebraska,
before someone finally had the wit to suggest that the best
place for an American president at time of national
emergency is the Oval Office.

<p>Other members of the cabinet were equally elusive. Secretary
of State Colin Powell, who has managed to avoid almost every
site of crisis or debate was once again absent from the
scene, in Latin America. Defense Secretary Donald Runsfeld
remained invisible most of the day, even though it would
have taken him only a few short steps to get to the Pentagon
pressroom and make some encouraging remarks. When he did
finally appear the substance of his remarks and his demeanor
were even more banal and unprepossessing than those of his
commander in chief. At no point did Vice President Cheney
appear in public.

<p>Some presidential contenders make haste to present
themselves to the press.. John McCain curdled the air with
threats against America's foes, as did John Kerry, who
immediately blamed bin-Laden and who stuck the knife firmly
into CIA director George Tenet, citing Tenet as having told
him not long ago that the CIA had neutralized an impending
attack by bin-Laden. Orrin Hatch told CNN, "This looks like
the signature of Osama bin-Laden. We're going to find out
who did this and we're going after the bastards. Yes, this
is the same Hatch who was a senior Republican on the senate
intelligence committee when the CIA was arming bin-Laden and
the Afghan rebels. In 1998 Hatch told MSNBC that he would
support the fundamentalist Afghan rebels again even if he
knew that it would create another bin Laden. "It was worth
it", Hatch said.

<p>Absent national political leadership, the burden of rallying
the nation fell as usual upon the TV anchors, all of whom
seem to have resolved early on to lower the emotional
temper, though Tom Brokaw did lisp a declaration of War
against Terror. One of the more ironic sights was Dan Rather
talking about retaliation against bin Laden. It was of
course Rather, wrapped in a turban, who voyaged to the Hindu
Kush in the early 1980s to send back paeans to the
Mujahiddeen (trained and supplied by the CIA in its largest
ever operation), which ushered onto the world stage such
well trained cadres as those now deployed against America.

<p>The eyewitness reports of the collapse of the two Trade
Center buildings were not inspired, at least for those who
have heard the famous eyewitness radio reportage of the
crash of the Hindenberg zeppelin in Lakehurst, New Jersey in
1937 with the anguished cry of the reporter, "Oh the
humanity, the humanity". Radio and TV reporters these days
seem incapable of narrating an ongoing event with any sense
of vivid language or dramatic emotive power.

<p>The commentators were similarly incapable of explaining with
any depth the likely context of the attacks. It was possible
to watch the cream of the nation's political analysts and
commentating classes, hour after hour, without ever hearing
the word "Israel", unless in the context of a salutary
teacher in how to deal with Muslims. One could watch hour
after hour without hearing any intimation that these attacks
might be the consequence of the recent Israeli rampages in
the Occupied Territories that have included assassinations
of Palestinian leaders and the slaughter of Palestinian
civilians with the use of American aircraft; that these
attacks might also stem from the sanctions against Iraq that
have seen upward of a million children die; that these
attacks might in part be a response to US cruise missile
attacks on the Sudanese factories that had been loosely
fingered by US intelligence as connected to bin-Laden.

<p>In fact September 11 was the anniversary of George W. Bush's
speech to Congress in 1990, heralding war against Iraq. It
was also the anniversary of the Camp David accords, which
signalled the US buy-out of Egypt as any countervailing
force for Palestinian rights in the Middle East. One certain
beneficiary of the attacks is Israel. Polls had been showing
popular dislike here for Israel's recent tactics, which may
have been the motivation for Colin Powell's few bleats of
reproof to Israel. We will be hearing no such bleats in the
weeks to come. The attackers probably bet on that too, as a
way of making the US's support for Israeli intransigence
even more explicit, finishing off Arafat in the process.

<p>"Freedom," said George Bush in Sarasota in the first
sentence of his first reaction, "was attacked this morning
by a faceless coward." That properly represents the
stupidity and blindness of almost all of the mainstream
political commentary. By contrast, the commentary on
economic consequences was more informative, even though the
possibility of a deep plunge in the world economy was barely
dealt with. Yet before the attacks the situation was
extremely precarious, with the possibility of catastrophic
deflation as the 1990s bubble bursts, and the stresses of
world over-capacity and lack of purchasing power take an
ever-greater toll.

<p>Worst hit, and therefore most likely precipitate of a wider
crash, is the insurance industry, whose predicament is now
desperate, with an exposure that is, in the words of a
spokesman for Swiss Re, the world's second largest
reinsurer, "completely inestimable" . Likely outfall in the
short-term: hiked energy prices, a further drop in global
stock markets. George Bush will have no trouble in raiding
the famous lock-box, using Social Security Trust Funds to
give more money to the Defense Department. That about sums
it up. Three planes are successfully steered into three of
America's most conspicuous buildings and America's response
will be to put more money in missile defense as a way of
bolstering the economy.<p align="center">###</p>
