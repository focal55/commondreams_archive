It is Prince of Peace season and America is at war.  Peace on earth,
goodwill to men is the usual mantra and our nation is in the sixth or
seventh week of bombing Afghanistan.  In the Holy Land, more suicide
bombers and missiles.  Merry and Happy are the words on the greeting
cards and tens of thousands of letters have been cross-contaminated with
anthrax spores.  Joy is the word in the hymns--are we singing along?   
<p>We seem to be subjects in a mass experiment in cognitive dissonance.
Maybe this is the real meltdown, the Y2K disaster we were fearing.  	
<p>"This is a test, it is only a test," says the Emergency Broadcast
System recording.  "For the next sixty seconds, you will hear a tone
that will be used to alert you in case of an actual emergency. 
Remember, this is only a test."
<p>This morning Tom Ridge was on television explaining that his
announcement yesterday was to "remind America one more time that we are
at war."  
<p>Without these reminders we might forget.
<p>What did you do in the war, Mommy?  I bought an SUV.  Sport Utility
Vehicle sales are higher than pickup trucks for the first time.  Used
primarily to go to shopping malls, our favorite sport.  Also used to
carry families, though the Census Bureau says that for the first time
less than one-fourth of households are married with children. 
<p>"It is good to have the Marines here in Times Square," Charles Gibson
said on "Good Morning America" this morning, showing Marines in a "light
armored vehicle," which is a skinny tank.  He said it can go 65 miles an
hour.  He sounded delighted.  "Perfect for combat in the cities.  It
handles better than a Caddy," says one website. "The Army hopes to buy
2,131 of the vehicles."  For the man who has everything, an LAV-III
under the Christmas tree.  Better than last war's Hummer.  
<p>This conversion to a militarized lifestyle is happening all through our
society.  We are on alert.  We are in a state of emergency.  We are
increasingly under martial law.  Constitutional protections have been
suspended for some people in some situations, or for everyone.
<p>Patriotism is most ardent when a nation is at war.  Only Congress can
declare war, Congress has not declared war, but we are most definitely
at war.  Peace flags are controversial.  We should ask why.  Does peace
undermine war?  Or does war undermine peace?  It is not so simple, of
course.   	"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold
two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the
ability to function," is F. Scott Fitzgerald's line.
<p>Terrorism/democracy.  "An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole
world blind," is one of Gandhi's famous statements, in a variation on
what Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5).  U.S. government
policy apparently rejects both Jesus and Gandhi in favor of the
eye-for-an-eye equation.  We have "blind" justice and "blind rage." 
Albert Einstein said, "Peace cannot be achieved through violence, it can
only be attained through understanding."  But American policy makers
must believe they are smarter than Einstein. 
<p>James Park wrote, "Recent neuro-biological research has shown that you
cannot think clearly without engaging your emotions. Thinking and
feeling are inextricably intertwined, and many of the failings of our
political process arise from our reluctance to acknowledge the
implications of this fact. The question to be asked - about our public
and private lives - is how well we manage the interaction between the
two processes."
<p>Our hearts and minds are struggling, striving for an understanding of
the right thing to do, the right way to live.  Such striving is called
jihad, the greater jihad, in Arabic.  Christmas/war.  Ramadan/Hanukkah. 
It's cognitive dissonance for sure.  The countdown is on: almost three
months from September 11 and the fire of the World Trade Center
mausoleum is still burning.  Twenty shopping days until Christmas,
nineteen, eighteen....
