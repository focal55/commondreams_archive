NEW YORK -- We sat in a Greenwich Village coffee house, Bob Kerrey and I, and talked mostly of things having nothing to do with his military service. But there was one thing, this one bothersome thing, I wanted to say about the one thing he didn't want to talk about. It was about sadness.
<p> That was my word, my feeling -- and it was not, I quickly explained, limited just to how I felt about him and the accusation that he had ordered his unit in Vietnam to kill unarmed women and children. That was sad and it was tragic. I was one of those, you may recall, who said the accusation had to be investigated.</p>
    <p> Kerrey had already said he didn't want to talk about that -- and so, because we had agreed to meet before the Vietnam story broke, I didn't. But I did want to talk about the aftermath -- the newspaper and TV stories, my column and what people said to me in e-mails and telephone calls and remarks at cocktail parties: They didn't care. This was war and war, as surely I must know, is hell.</p>
    <p> This is what made me sad, I told Kerrey. It was these people who seemed to accept "the worst case scenario" -- I am quoting myself here -- and who thought there was nothing morally or legally wrong with it. In other words, war permitted the impermissible, not the <i>mistaken</i> killing of women and children, but the <i>purposeful</i> murder of unarmed people. That was the "worst case scenario" of which Kerrey has been accused, and it gets, by and large, a shrug.</p>
    <p> Anyone who knows me, who reads me, appreciates that I am obsessed by the Holocaust and its progeny -- Rwanda, Bosnia, Indonesia, Cambodia, etc. We have seen this sort of murder in so many different places that we can no longer comfort ourselves by saying, Oh, it's those Germans. Or -- if the subject turns to the Rape of Nanking -- it's those Japanese. Have you seen who is on trial for complicity in the 1994 Rwandan genocide that claimed at least 500,000 lives? Two nuns.</p>
    <p> By now we must recognize that it is all of us, Americans, too. Look at a snapshot taken at a lynching. See our grandfathers or their fathers take glee in torture, the smug smiles of pleasure at some man's slow and painful death. That's Uncle Sam holding the rope. That's Uncle Sam, too, dangling from it.</p>
    <p> It is not true that the Holocaust was the work of only the SS, or that it was carried out only in extermination camps. About 1.3 million Jews were shot where they lived, and some of that killing, a great deal of that killing, was done by "ordinary men." That is the title of Christopher Browning's classic Holocaust book about one reserve unit. It had no special training or indoctrination and was not composed of rabid Jew-haters. Nonetheless, day after day, the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 rounded up Jews, took them into the fields and shot them. In the end, this one unit -- 500 men -- murdered about 80,000 Jews. After the war, they went home and said nothing about it.</p>
    <p> This is them. This is us. We know that now. Yet when the accusations were made against Kerrey, we were told that this is what happens in war. Writing in the Los Angeles Times, Jack Valenti castigates anyone who asked for an investigation and who did not, in wartime, know the moment when "the dagger is at their belly." In war, he instructs, "all the normalities of a social compact are abandoned."</p>
    <p> Really? Do you mean, Jack, that there is no such thing as a war crime? Can you -- out of fear or just plain hatred -- kill women and children in cold blood? Does the designation of "enemy" mean no rules, no law, no morality applies? There are so many synonyms for enemy: Hutu, Tutsi, Muslim, Serb, Chechen, black, white, Jew, Protestant, Catholic. We can be terribly creative in this regard.</p>
    <p> So as we sat in that coffee shop, not talking about what much of America has been recently talking about, I told Bob Kerrey why I was sad. We have substituted one kind of naivete for another. Chivalry, dash and elan, glory and honor have been dismissed and replaced with a different sort of naivete: All killing in wartime is the same. We have lost our illusions. That is good. We have lost our humanity, too. That is bad.</p>
    <p> Kerrey listened. And this man who has, in fact, felt the dagger at his belly and borne a sadness that may only now be explicable, said he understood what I meant.</p>
    <p> "It makes me sad, too," he said.</p>
