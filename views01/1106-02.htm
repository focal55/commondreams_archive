In 1964, Kitty Genovese was murdered in New York City; for over half an hour 
she put up a desperate fight against her assailant, and 38 neighbors later 
reported hearing her ongoing screams for help. But no one helped - not one 
witness even so much as called the police. Neighbors later said that they 
had felt powerless and confused during the attack, and certain someone else 
would do something to stop it. So they had gone about their business 
instead, closing the windows to keep out the screams.

<p>Kind of the way many of us are coping with the war these days. The media 
bombard us with anthrax paranoia, patriotic military shots, and spokespeople 
who BS well but provide no coherent information. Cameras flash and pundits 
cheer as Bush attends a baseball game, bounces off Air Force One with his 
dog or delivers a canned speech, but intelligent discussions of the deeper 
implications of bombing Afghanistan are a mainstream news rarity. 
Unconscionable new domestic "collateral damage" developments float by each 
day - tax breaks for the rich, decimation of civil liberties, potential 
Arctic Refuge drilling, fast track trade agreements, what have you - but the 
sheer speed and enormity of the societal restructuring breed confusion and 
apathy. So we shut our windows and thoughts, absorbing the Emmys rather than 
the ugly reality of war.

<p>And then comes the US government's stepped-up assault to capture the hearts 
and minds of citizens at home and governments abroad. Much has already been 
made of the $3,500 per day contract given to the Rendon Group, a 
public-relations firm now charged with advising the US military on improving 
"public diplomacy" (i.e. propaganda) and countering opposition messages. The 
Pentagon's purchase of all rights to Ikonos satellite pictures of 
Afghanistan, pictures detailing massive civilian casualties, is another 
convenient way of keeping unpleasant realities away from the suggestible 
masses; the recent appointment of "The Queen of Madison Avenue" Charlotte 
Beers to Under-Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs is 
similarly unsettling. From a prominent Texan oil family, Beers went on to 
chair two major advertising companies and her current assignment is no less 
than rebranding the United States. According to Colin Powell, not only is 
Beers "fluent with this sort of thing, but she is from the advertising 
business. I wanted one of the world's greatest advertising experts, because 
what are we doing? We're selling. We're selling a product. That product we 
are selling is democracy. It's the free enterprise system, the American 
value system." If it's good enough for Coke and deodorants, it's good enough 
for the US government.

<p>So the terrorist training camp known as School of the Americas continues to 
operate Stateside, but has changed its name to The Western Hemisphere 
Institute for Security Cooperation to fool those pesky protesters and retain 
US public funding. Why stop indoctrinating terrorism when you can just 
rebrand? In spite of its lofty name, the International Coalition Against 
Terror is mainly composed of the countries manufacturing and stockpiling 
most of the world's weapons of mass destruction. Bush continues to sell his 
rollback of civil liberties as "preventing more atrocities in the hands of 
the evil ones." Not to be outdone, a Department of Health and Human Services 
spokesperson defended his agency's much maligned handling of the anthrax 
crisis with, "Something that's factual at this moment proves not to be 
factual in retrospect. That doesn't mean it wasn't factual at the time." Any 
further questions?

<p>One of Beers' first branding projects was working with the Ad Council 
(formerly known as the War Advertising Council) on a series of commercials 
to "distill the values and virtues of American democracy." One spot, called 
"I am an American," features speakers of various ethnic backgrounds and 
invokes E PLURIBUS UNUM (Out of many, one) to show that "our diversity makes 
America great."

<p>Let's propose another Ad Council spot: "I am aware." It will show ordinary 
citizens across the United States, indeed across the world, rising up to 
combat the societal rollback taking place in the name of supposedly fighting 
terrorism. It will invoke common sense in realizing that dropping bombs on a 
ravaged people and promoting mass starvation does not induce peace. It will 
show that diversity makes the whole world great, and that the actions of a 
single person from afar can sometimes mean the difference between life and 
death for another.

<p>Brand that.
