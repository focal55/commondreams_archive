As the long bull market passes through its death gyrations, there
are still opportunities for many Americans to come out ahead. This is
probably not the time to be looking for the next Microsoft, Intel or
Cisco. While it may prove profitable, most will not have the stomach for
selling short, betting on a continued downturn in the market. But there
is one Wall Street strategy that can still yield big gains: taxes.
<p>Before rushing for a gun, consider how gambling is treated in this
country. Gamblers who place their bets on horses at the race track will
be taxed anywhere from 6% to 12%. The same applies to people who bet in
Las Vegas, Atlantic City or any of the other gambling havens that have
sprung up over the past two decades. The tens of millions of people who
gamble on state lotteries can expect their tickets to be taxed at least
20% and in some cases as much as 40%.
<p>It is important to realize that these tax rates are not on the
winnings. The winners of the big jackpot in the state lottery will still
pay income tax on the prize. These tax rates are what the government
takes from people just for playing. For example, in the case of state
lotteries, 20% to 40% of the ticket money is pulled out of the pool
before the big winners get their hands on the pot. In short, most forms
of gambling in this country are heavily taxed.
<p>The one exception is gambling on the stock market. Day traders can buy
and sell stock by the hour--or the minute--without paying any tax on
their bets. This is hard to justify. Why should firefighters, waitresses
or cashiers pay a 30% tax if they bet on lottery tickets, while day
traders who speculate in Internet stocks place their bets tax-free? Since
the people who bet on Wall Street are likely to have much higher incomes
than those who bet on the lotteries and race tracks, this looks like just
one more case where the people on top get a break.
<p>Of course, most people who buy stock don't think of themselves as
gamblers or speculators. They view it as a way to save for the long
term--to pay for their kids' education or their own retirement. These
people would not have much to fear from a tax on stock market gambling. A
modest tax of one-quarter of 1% on the sale or purchase of a share of
stock--a quarter on a $100 purchase--would make very little difference to
someone who holds a stock for eight or 10 years.
<p>But this tax would make a big difference to the high rollers who are
buying and selling stock by the day or the hour. And there are many such
people; the average share of stock on the NASDAQ was held for less than
six months last year. These short-term traders would be required to pay a
tax on their bets, just like other gamblers.
<p>And the tax would raise a great deal of money. My estimates indicate
that a modest tax applied to stock trades, along with other forms of
financial speculation such as options, futures and currencies, could
easily raise $100 billion a year--enough to finance a Medicare
prescription drug benefit similar to that proposed by Vice President Al
Gore and to pay for the middle-class portion of President Bush's tax cut.
In short, the money that could be raised by taxing Wall Street gambling
could provide real gains for tens of millions of people.
<p>Of course, taxing Wall Street gambling will not be an easy sell in
Washington. The big losers would be the folks that run the brokerage
houses and banking industry. And we all know that these are big sources
of campaign contributions for politicians. But there are far more people
who stand to win by taxing Wall Street wagers. In a democracy, this has
to count for something.
