<blockquote>
<i>"Let us speak frankly.<br>
There is many a person whose soul has gone to sleep like a leg."</i><br>
­ from the short story "A Busy Man" by Vladimir Nabokov.</blockquote>
<p> Sleep -- and you can dream...
<P>

We, the American people, are so adept at singing lullabies to ourselves that it really is difficult for us to wake up. Our souls sleep well. Too well.
<P>

For example, what sorts of news stories capture our imagination?
<P>

Well, there's the story of Rep. Gary Condit (D-Calif.) and his missing intern, Chandra Levy. Perhaps it's the story of a dog thrown into oncoming traffic during a fit of road rage. Or maybe it's the boy who was attacked by a shark.
<P>

All of these stories are unfortunate tales, some of which can be dealt a certain amount of justice through our court system. But essentially, there is little we can do to stop these things from happening. These stories fascinate us, scare us, anger us Š but leave us as nothing more than spectators.
<P>

And so we are lulled into sleep...
<P>

But there are tragedies happening daily that we CAN do something about. Most often these tragedies are the result of policies, things that are fairly stable and can be changed. If only we could wake up ...if only ...
<P>

Every month, approximately 5,000 people die in Iraq as a direct result of United Nations sanctions that are largely still in place because of the United States' insistence. Necessities like chlorine and hospital supplies are banned because of their possible dual military use. This can be changed.
<P>

Every year, the U.S. pumps approximately $3 billion in foreign aid to Israel so it can bulk up its military and -- as we've seen recently -- put it to use killing Palestinians and destroying their homes. And when the Palestinians retaliate, it is they who are called the "terrorists." This can be changed.
<P>

The U.S. will spend more than $1 billion on "Plan Colombia," a plan that gives money to the Colombian government so it can fight its brutal drug war and in turn help fight ours. The only problem is, it isn't working. Drug supplies in this country have not been curbed. By far, the real victims of "Plan Colombia" are poor farmers, many of whom grow coca as a means of subsistence. They are caught in the crossfire between government and guerrilla forces (which, incidentally, the CIA helped supply weapons for inadvertently). They are exposed to various chemicals as the fumigation of Colombian farmland continues, and their land which is left looking like a desert, according to news reports. In a story by Marc Cooper in L.A. Weekly, one former Colombian anti-narcotics detective said: "Plan Colombia? Yeah, I know what that is. I know the Americans well. And I know what Plan Colombia really is. It's mostly about maintaining full budgets for the U.S. military. What else?"
<P>

This can be changed.
<P>

Tragedies like these, occurring on a massive scale at the behest of our very own government, can be put to an end if only we'd speak up, wake up.
<P>

The late, great comedian Bill Hicks, as part of his routine criticizing the government and the American populace, used to say, "Go back to bed, America. Your government is in control. Here's Love Connection. Watch this and get fat and stupid. By the way, keep drinking beer..."
<P>

It's a searing critique of what we've become -- mostly because it is so accurate.
<P>

It's so much easier to sleep. When we sleep, we can dream. Collectively, our malleable national memories are shaped into pleasant dreams instead of being seen as the real-life nightmares they were.
<P>

We can have a "Good War." We can be the victims of the Vietnam War instead of the millions of Vietnamese who paid the price of that war with their lives. We can remember our fight against the "communists" in Central and South America as a glorious fight for freedom instead of the violent, brutal travesty it was.
<P>

The possibilities are endless.
<P>

"Go back to bed America."
<P>

Really, are any of us willing to pay the moral price of waking up?
