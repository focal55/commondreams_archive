The power to depict history is entangled with the power to create 
it. George Orwell observed long ago: "Who controls the past controls the 
future; who controls the present controls the past." And so it is in 2001, 
as American media outlets draw conclusions about the presidencies of Ronald 
Reagan and Bill Clinton.

         <p>For conservative pundits, the two are open-and-shut cases of 
virtue and depravity; honor and its absence. The Gipper's recent 90th 
birthday brought an outpouring of tributes from top Republican 
image-crafters and media commentators, often one and the same. Reagan is 
now "lauded and embraced not only by the country but by its opinion 
leaders, its media, its historians and elites," Peggy Noonan rejoiced.

         <p>The Wall Street Journal's editorial page was an apt place for the 
gushing from Noonan, a former Reagan speech writer, still enraptured, still 
spinning, more pleased than ever with the mega-media adulation of her hero: 
"All week in the Reagan specials they celebrated, without saying the word, 
his character. But that's what his political victories were about.... He 
swam against the tide, moved forward, made progress, and got, ultimately, 
to shore."

         <p>Liberal pundits show little interest in disputing President 
Reagan's greatness. Evidently, it's easier for columnists and editorial 
writers to forget or forgive than it is for, say, the thousands of people 
in Nicaragua or Angola whose grief was scarcely reported in the U.S. press 
during the 1980s, while the Reagan administration funneled large amounts of 
money and weaponry to "freedom fighters" who massacred their loved ones.

         <p>Now, bygones are pretty much bygones along the Potomac. A tacit 
understanding prevails: If you can't say something nice about Ronald 
Reagan, better not to say anything at all.

         <p>The present-day media verdict on Bill Clinton's legacy is a whole 
other matter -- polarized and contentious. His longtime foes are eager to 
define his presidency as eight disastrous years (mitigated by a strong 
economy). Meanwhile, lots of liberals take a completely different stand.

         <p>While acknowledging negative effects of his personal flaws and 
ethical shadiness, numerous boosters have given Clinton's presidency high 
marks. "Clinton has been a very effective president," CNN's liberal Bill 
Press wrote in mid-January with typical homage. "He can leave office 
proudly, having led the United States into the 21st century."

         <p>Farther leftward, some have also jumped at the chance to sum up 
the Clinton record in glowing terms. "Clinton's historical reputation will 
more than surmount the petty complaints of contemporary critics and leave 
him remembered as one of the hardest working, most competent, fundamentally 
decent and smartest men to ever serve in the office," syndicated columnist 
Robert Scheer concluded. "He was an excellent president."

         <p>To share in such a sweeping judgment requires us to downgrade the 
importance of certain subjects -- and certain people. For instance: As he 
led the charge for the "war on drugs," President Clinton was instrumental 
in filling the nation's prisons with more and more Americans -- most of 
them poor and dark-skinned -- to the point that 2 million are now behind 
bars. Just how important is that reality? If a president did so much to 
bring it about, how excellent could he have been?

         <p>Six months ago, on the opening night of the Democratic National 
Convention in Los Angeles, bright colored signs flashed all through the 
amphitheater, operating as enormous cue-cards for the assembled loyal 
delegates -- "Thank you Bill" -- while they dutifully chanted for maximum 
media impact. Such orchestration is a task of political advance teams. 
Journalists, hopefully, have different sorts of work to do.

         <p>In spite of their better insights, year after year, many liberal 
pundits functioned as de facto apologists for Clintonism, with the implicit 
rationale that his right-wing enemies were much worse. In the process, the 
main priority often seemed to be shilling more than truth-telling. But 
journalists -- whether reporters, news analysts or commentators -- should 
serve different purposes than partisan spinmeisters.

         <p>Assessments of the Clinton presidency are not only relevant to the 
past. At Clinton's insistence, his big-money pal Terry McAuliffe is 
enthroned as the chair of the Democratic National Committee. The people in 
charge of the party seem determined to keep pace with the Republicans in 
saturating their endeavors with corporate loot. If the overall politics and 
policies of the Clinton presidency were A-OK, then there's a lot more where 
that came from.

Highly Deceptive Media."</i>
