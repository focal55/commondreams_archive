Six years ago it was a self-professed hobby for its founders; today Yahoo! is a global brand that personifies the new information economy and American technological leadership as much as Microsoft or Apple do. No other country could have done what the Americans have done with their information technology revolution; the mixture of innovation, technical daring and swashbuckling attitude to financial risk is something the rest of the world can only envy. Who has not tried Yahoo! as a search engine and internet portal? 
<P>But last week even the mighty Yahoo! joined the list of dotcom and IT companies either in the graveyard or fatally wounded - and raised fundamental questions about the durability and sustainability of the dotcom revolution. As its advertising revenues buckle and share price plunges, its chief executive was asked to leave - but who wants to take on a job that is almost condemned to fail? Yahoo!'s share price once stood at a mighty $220 - now it trades at less than a tenth that. What the American system delivers, it also takes away. Maybe Europeans should be just a little less credulous about the US - and prouder of their   own economic and social model. For Yahoo! is not one of the frothier products of the hi-tech boom, it is absolutely at its heart. It has built advertising revenues of some $1 billion a year, and it should be able to make a profit; it is rich in cash and if any IT company can survive the US economic downturn it should be Yahoo!. But its apparent durability has proved illusory. Yahoo! was made possible only by the boom in hi-tech shares; that is how it raised its cash and, because other dotcom companies advertised on its websites, what fuelled its revenue growth. But that same boom has left all the companies built around it with profound structural weaknesses.  
<P>For they are organisations whose organisational glue is greed. Yahoo!'s founders have become rich, and the attraction for those that came to work at Yahoo! was a chance to make similar fortunes; hence the way its senior managers chose to be paid not in orthodox salaries but in share options. But as the shares ail and the options are worthless, the reality is not the promise of wealth - but day-to-day poverty and gruelling hours in a failing business. They leave and can't be replaced.  
<P>Nor are the founders any more committed. They have made their fortunes, and sold their shares to others; and those others, as in a game of musical chairs, were hoping to pass on their shares at inflated prices to some greater fool. This has always been the case in stock markets whose casino proclivities are never far from the surface, but the dotcom revolution has made the issue starker than ever. The average length of time a Yahoo! shareholder holds Yahoo! shares is seven days. If any incoming chief executive is hoping for a committed shareholder base to support a painful restructuring, they can think again. The fate of Yahoo! is obvious; massive retrenchment, takeover sooner or later to release 'value' - and eventual emasculation.  
<P>This process, now increasing in severity, has been at work in the US for the past 30 years, undermining its technological leadership and slowing down its productivity growth. Only 10 years ago American bookshops were full of volumes detailing the decline in American industry and Sunday morning chat shows crammed with pundits offering their own pet solutions. It was in this mood of gloom that Clinton won the 1992 presidential election with the cry of 'It's the economy, stupid.'  
<P>The arrival of the new economy, a long stock market boom and a record of jobs growth that was much better than Europe's changed that perception - but we are about to discover that the old account was much nearer the truth than the recent wave of over the top enthusiasm. Don't get me wrong. I am writing this column, which I will email to  The Observer , on a Dell laptop using a Microsoft Word programme. I am more than aware of what I owe American technology. I also believe the consequences of the information and communication revolution will be transforming. What I don't accept is that the system that incubated the revolution is best able to exploit it - or that Europe should copy it in every respect.   
<P>For if you look beyond the IT sector and the investment banks which have built their global pre-eminence off the back of Wall Street, American technological and even market leadership is as thin as it was in the late 1980s - aerospace; drugs; cars; television and radio; petrochemicals; shipbuilding; machine tools; civil engineering; glass. The list goes on. All are business sectors where Americans can no longer claim technological leadership - and all because, just like Yahoo!, the stock market's appetite for short-term gains and accompanying short-term time horizons has undermined the capacity to innovate.  
<P>The US likes to blame subsidy for the reason that Airbus is going to build the next generation of wide-bodied superjumbos; the real explanation is that Wall Street would no more back Boeing in a $10bn development than pigs can fly.  
<P>But, you will be shaking your head, what about American productivity growth and their record in job generation? Will Hutton is losing his marbles. The US's new jobs have almost all been women's jobs; the sexual and social revolution has now fully worked through in the US so women's participation has risen dramatically to match men's - wrongly described as an economic success due to labour market flexibility. As the same sexual revolution hits Europe, so job generation will explode - just as it is has begun to do in France.  
<P>The superior productivity   growth is a chimera. Over the 1990s US productivity growth has just matched that in France and Germany; there was an acceleration in the late 1990s, but that, I think, will prove to more closely associated with the long boom reaching its peak than a structural development that other countries cannot reproduce. Indeed to the extent that it is due to IT, the Danes and Swedes have greater penetration of the internet. This is a pervasive technology available to every country, and whose transforming capacities will be ubiquitous.  
<P>Countries in the vanguard will be those - like the Nordic countries who already boast leadership in mobile phone technology - who have powerful education systems, strong welfare states that underwrite a risk-taking workforce, rigorous regulation to ensure best practice in their corporate sector and financial systems which do not place the stock market at the centre of business affairs so allowing patient, committed investment. This, rather than the usual farrago of measures in which we try to build a mini-America in Britain and Europe, is the route to the productivity revolution to which the Chancellor committed himself in the budget.  
<P>Even if it were possible to ape America, it would be the wrong thing to do. It is Europe that possesses the advantages to exploit the new economy; paradoxically not the country that invented it.  
<P>This reality will begin to transform the argument about the euro and the European Union. Europe, in short, will become fashionable again.
