            Israeli undercover agents stalked a Palestinian militant as he drove 

            towards his home in Hebron yesterday, and fired a dozen bullets into 

            his body at close range on a day when the West Bank hovered dangerously 

            close to all-out war. 

            <P>Local Palestinians said two or three members of Israeli special 

              forces, dressed as Arabs and driving a blue and white truck with 

              Palestinian license plates, idled by a road on a slope overlooking 

              the city, waiting for the car of Emad Abu Sneineh. 

            <P>When Abu Sneineh, a local commander in Yasser Arafat's Fatah militias, 

              pulled up, the Israelis opened fire, hitting him in the head, chest 

              and stomach before speeding off to an Israeli section of the town. 

            <P>They said there was no attempt to arrest Abu Sneineh, who was alone. 

            <P>The assassination was the latest in an Israeli campaign which has 

              killed 39 Palestinian activists and 17 innocent bystanders. 

            <P>The international community has condemned the assassinations. However, 

              Israel argues that the assassination of Palestinian activists - 

              which security officials call a "policy of pinpoint prevention" 

              - prevents the killing of Israelis by bomb-makers and gunmen. 

            <P>In recent days, Israel has also claimed that it has assassinated 

              Palestinians in the process of planning suicide attacks, including 

              the two most senior leaders of the Hamas in the West Bank, who were 

              killed by guided missiles in their office in Nablus. The Israeli 

              army said after that assassination that it had acted to "prevent 

              acts of murder and terrorism against Israeli civilians". However, 

              it offered no convincing proof. 

            <P>The killing came only hours after Israeli tanks retreated from 

              the gates of Bethlehem in a threatened invasion seen as the opening 

              of a full-scale war against the Palestinians. 

            <P>Yesterday, as soldiers and tanks hunkered down on the edges of 

              Bethlehem, Israeli officials insisted the invasion might yet go 

              ahead if gunmen again open fire on the Jewish settlement of Gilo, 

              poised between Jerusalem and the suburb of Beit Jala. 

            <P>"They have to stop firing, period," said Raanan Gissin, a spokesman 

              for Israel's hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon. "If they do 

              not we will immediately implement our original plan. If we see within 

              the next 24 hours, or more, that they resume sniper fire or shooting 

              at Gilo, we will respond in kind." 

            <P>Amid the epic tensions in the West Bank - two days after the invasion 

              of the northern city of Jenin - Abu Sneineh, aged 28 and a father 

              of five, was a relatively low-level operative. 

            <P>Palestinian and Israeli security sources say he led a cell of gunmen 

              who have regularly fired on the illegal Jewish settlement that occupies 

              the heart of Hebron. 

            <P>Yesterday, the city was braced for another night of gunfire after 

              hundreds of mourners, some shooting in the air, followed a stretcher 

              carrying Abu Sneineh's body to the cemetery. Shops downed shutters 

              as businesses declared a protest strike. 

            <P>In Bethlehem, meanwhile, Palestinian officials said Israeli forces 

              had occupied four Palestinian houses in an area under Israeli security 

              control, and imposed a curfew on three nearby villages. 

            <P>The specter of a re-occupation of Palestinian-ruled towns in the 

              West Bank has infuriated Palestinians, who accuse Israel of plotting 

              a full-scale war. They also say the assassinations make it impossible 

              to convince their followers to stop shooting at Gilo. 

            <P>"This has become very personal - not political," said Kamal Hmeid, 

              the Fatah leader in Bethlehem, including Beit Jala. "All the people 

              expect to be killed at any moment by helicopters or tanks. They 

              sit around thinking: 'If we are going to be killed in the end by 

              Israel, we want to kill as many Israelis as we can before we die.'" 

            <P>Abu Sneineh's assassination ratchets up a week of steeply escalating 

              tensions after a suicide bomber killed 15 Israelis inside a Jerusalem 

              pizzeria. In the days since then, Israel has steadily deployed greater 

              hardware against the Palestinians, and escalated its efforts to 

              destroy Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority. 

            <P>The measures have gone relatively unremarked because there were 

              virtually no Palestinian casualties. However, Reuven Pedatzur, a 

              lecturer at Tel Aviv University, and a security analyst for the 

              liberal Ha'aretz newspaper, said Israel and the Palestinians were 

              approaching a point of no return. 

            <P>"This is a rolling war," he said. "We are rolling towards an all-out 

              war against the Palestinians. What happened in the last few days 

              was that we were not making war against terrorist individuals any 

              more, but against the Palestinians." 

            <P>Israel's military operations against the Palestinians in the last 

              week include: the deployment of F-16 jets to drop two one-ton bombs 

              on a Palestinian police compound in a wealthy residential area of 

              Ramallah; the seizure of Orient House, the unofficial PLO headquarters 

              in Arab East Jerusalem; the invasion of Jenin, and the threatened 

              invasion of the Bethlehem area. 

            <P>Three Israeli cabinet ministers said yesterday that an invasion 

              of Bethlehem was no longer unthinkable. "One should not consider 

              things that were perceived to be immune to be immune any longer," 

              said the public security minister, Uzi Landau. 

            <P>Israeli security officials told Israel radio the operation had 

              merely been postponed for 24 hours. 

            <P>In part, such statements are bravado, intended to buffer Mr Sharon's 

              hardline reputation against accusations that he caved in to pressure 

              from the US and the European Union by ordering the tanks to halt 

              at the gates of the city. In Washington, officials condemned the 

              plan as "provocative". </p>
