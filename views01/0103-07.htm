        W. Bush’s choice of Donald Rumsfeld to be U.S. defense secretary could
        put an unintended spotlight on the role of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon – a
        Bush family benefactor – in funneling millions of dollars to communist
        North Korea in the 1990s as it was developing a missile and nuclear
        weapons program.</font>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1998, Rumsfeld headed a
        special commission, appointed by the Republican-controlled Congress,
        that warned that North Korea had made substantial progress during the
        decade in building missiles that could pose a potential nuclear threat
        to Japan and parts of the United States.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The extraordinary level of
        resources North Korea and Iran are now devoting to developing their own
        ballistic missile capabilities poses a substantial and immediate danger
        to the U.S., its vital interests and its allies,&quot; said the report
        by Rumsfeld's Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the
        United States.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;North Korea maintains an active WMD [weapons of mass destruction]
        program, including a nuclear weapon program. It is known that North
        Korea diverted material in the late 1980s for at least one or possibly
        two weapons,&quot; the report said.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rumsfeld’s alarming assessment
        of North Korea’s war-making capabilities now is being cited by
        Republicans as a justification for investing billions of taxpayer
        dollars in an anti-missile defense system favored by Bush and Rumsfeld.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, during the early-to-mid
        1990s, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency was monitoring a series of
        clandestine payments from Sun Myung Moon's organization to the North
        Korean communist leaders who were overseeing the country's military
        strategies.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to DIA documents
        obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, Moon’s payments to
        North Korean leaders included a $3 million “birthday present” to
        current communist leader Kim Jong Il and offshore payments amounting to
        “several tens of million dollars” to the previous communist
        dictator, Kim Il Sung.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The alleged payments – and broader
        Moon-North Korean business deals reported by the DIA – came at a time
        of a strict U.S. government ban on financial transactions between North
        Korea and any U.S. person or entity, to keep hard currency out of North
        Korea's hands.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Legal experts say that ban would
        have applied to Moon given his status as a permanent U.S. resident, even
        though he maintains South Korean citizenship.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Bush Speeches</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While negotiating those business
        deals with North Korea in the 1990s, Moon’s organization also hired
        former President George H.W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush to
        give speeches at Moon-sponsored events.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During one Moon-sponsored speech
        in Argentina in November 1996, former President Bush declared, “I want
        to salute Reverend Moon,” whom Bush praised as “the man with the
        vision.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The father of the incoming U.S.
        president has refused to divulge how much Moon’s organization paid for
        these speeches which were delivered in the United States, Asia and South
        America.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some press estimates have put
        the fees in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, though one former
        leader of Moon’s Unification Church told me that the organization had
        earmarked $10 million for the former president. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ex-President Bush’s pro-Moon
        speeches came at a time, too, when Moon – now 80 – was expressing
        intensely anti-American views. In the mid-1990s, Moon denounced the
        United States as “Satan’s harvest” and condemned American women as
        having descended from a “line of prostitutes.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a speech to his followers on
        Aug. 4, 1996, Moon vowed to liquidate American individuality, declaring
        that his movement would “swallow entire America.” Moon said
        Americans who insisted on “their privacy and extreme individualism …
        will be digested.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beyond these anti-Americanism
        diatribes, other questions have arisen about how Moon finances his
        religious-business-political empire. Evidence has existed back to the
        1970s indicating that Moon’s organization has engaged in
        money-laundering operations and has associated with right-wing
        organized-crime figures in Asia and Latin America.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of Moon's key early backers
        was Ryoichi Sasakawa, a leader of Japan's Yakuza organized crime family,
        according to the authoritative book, <i>Yakuza</i>, by David E. Kaplan
        &amp; Alec Dubro. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1998, Moon’s
        ex-daughter-in-law, Nansook Hong, added first-hand testimony about one
        of Moon's money-laundering methods when she described how cash was
        smuggled illegally through U.S. Customs. Moon “demonstrated contempt
        for U.S. law every time he accepted a paper bag full of untraceable,
        undeclared cash” carried into the United States from overseas, she
        wrote in her book, <i>In the Shadows of the Moons</i>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Checkered Past</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To many Americans, Moon is
        perhaps best known as a 1970s cult leader who allegedly brainwashed
        young recruits into joining his Unification Church and then paired up
        his followers in mass marriages where Moon would preside wearing lavish
        costumes and crowns.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Moon also understood the
        importance of political clout. In 1978, a congressional investigation
        identified Moon as a part of a covert influence-buying scheme aimed at
        American institutions and run by the South Korean Central Intelligence
        Agency, a charge that Moon denied.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1982, Moon was convicted of
        tax fraud and served an 18-month sentence in federal prison.
        Nevertheless, his political influence grew when he launched <i>The
        Washington Times,</i> also in 1982.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the years that followed, Moon
        developed a reputation for financing
        all-expense-paid international conferences for conservative politicians,
        prominent journalists and influential academics.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moon’s conservative newspaper
        grew in importance in Washington through the 1980s and early 1990s, as
        it staunchly supported Republican presidents Ronald Reagan and George
        H.W. Bush.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1991, President Bush
        expressed his gratitude to Moon’s newspaper by inviting its editor,
        Wesley Pruden, to a private White House lunch “just to tell you how
        valuable the <i>Times</i> has become in Washington, where we read it
        every day.” [<i>Washington Times,</i> May 17, 1992]</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Moving North</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At about the same time as that
        lunch, Moon was beginning another initiative – establishing a business
        foothold in North Korea. The DIA, the Pentagon agency responsible for
        monitoring possible military threats to the United States, started
        keeping tabs on these developments.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though historically an ardent
        anticommunist, Moon negotiated a sweeping business deal with Kim Il
        Sung, the longtime communist leader, the DIA documents said. The two men
        met face-to-face in North Korea from Nov. 30 to Dec. 8, 1991.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“These talks took place
        secretly, without the knowledge of the South Korean government,” the
        DIA wrote on Feb. 2, 1994. “In the original deal with Kim [Il Sung],
        Moon paid several tens of million dollars as a down-payment into an
        overseas account,” the DIA said in another cable dated Aug. 14, 1994.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The DIA said Moon's
        organization also delivered money to Kim Il Sung's son and successor,
        Kim Jong Il.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“In 1993, the
        Unification Church sold a piece of property located in Pennsylvania,”
        the DIA reported on Sept. 9, 1994. “The profit on the sale,
        approximately $3 million was sent through a bank in China to the Hong
        Kong branch of the KS [South Korean] company ‘Samsung Group.’ The
        money was later presented to Kim Jung Il [Kim Jong Il] as a birthday
        present.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After Kim Il Sung's
        death in 1994 and his succession by his son, Kim Jong Il, Moon
        dispatched his longtime aide, Bo Hi Pak, to ensure that the business
        deals were still on track with Kim Jong Il “and his coterie,” the
        DIA reported.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“If necessary,
        Moon authorized Pak to deposit a second payment for Kim Jong Il,” the
        DIA wrote.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As described by the DIA, Moon's
        deal with North Korea called for construction of a hotel complex in
        Pyongyang as well as a new Holy Land at the site of Moon’s birth in
        North Korea.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“There was an agreement regarding
        economic cooperation for the reconstruction of KN's [North Korea's]
        economy which included establishment of a joint venture to develop
        tourism at Kimkangsan, KN [North Korea]; investment in the Tumangang
        River Development; and investment to construct the light industry base
        at Wonsan, KN. It is believed that during their meeting Mun [Moon]
        donated 450 billion yen to KN,” one DIA report said.</font></p>
<p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In late 1991, the Japanese yen traded at
        about 130 yen to the U.S. dollar, meaning Moon's investment would have
        been about $3.5 billion, if the DIA information is correct.</font></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Pak's
        Response</b></font>
<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contacted
        in Seoul, South Korea, <span style="font-weight:normal" class="Name">Bo
        Hi Pak</span>, a former publisher of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
        Washington Times</i>, acknowledged that Moon met with North Korean
        officials and negotiated business deals with them in the early 1990s.</font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Bo Hi Pak denied
        that payments were made to individual North Korean leaders and called
        “absolutely untrue” the DIA's description of the $3 million land
        sale benefiting Kim Jong Il.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bo Hi
        Pak also said the North Korean business investments were structured
        through South Korean entities.</font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Rev. Moon is
        not doing this in his own name,” said Pak.</font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pak said he did
        go to North Korea in 1994, after Kim Il Sung’s death, but only to
        express “condolences” to Kim Jong Il on behalf of Moon and his wife.
        Pak denied that another purpose of the trip was to pass money to Kim
        Jong Il or to his associates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the phone interview, Bo Hi Pak also
        denied that Moon’s investments ever approached $3.5 billion. Pak did
        not give a total figure for the investments, but said the initial phase
        of an automobile factory was in the range of $3 million to $6 million.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The DIA depicted Moon's business plans in
        North Korea as much grander, however. The DIA valued the agreement for
        hotels in Pyongyang and the resort in Kumgang-san, alone, at $500
        million. The plans also called for creation of a kind of Vatican City
        covering Moon's birthplace.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“In consideration of Mun's [Moon's]
        economic cooperation, Kim [Il Sung] granted Mun a 99-year lease on a 9
        square kilometer parcel of land located in Chongchu, Pyonganpukto, KN.
        Chongchu is Mun's birthplace and the property will be used as a center
        for the Unification Church. It is being referred to as the Holy Land by
        Unification Church believers and Mun [h]as been granted
        extraterritoriality during the life of the lease.”</font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">North Korean
        officials clearly valued their relationship with Moon, granting him
        small but symbolic favors. Four months after Moon's 1991 meeting with
        Kim Il Sung, the communist dictator granted a rare interview to editors
        from Moon's <i>Washington Times.</i></font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In February
        2000, on Moon's 80th birthday, Kim Jong Il sent Moon a gift of rare wild
        ginseng, an aromatic root used medicinally, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Reuters</i>
        reported.</font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Legal Issues</b></font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of the
        long-term U.S. embargo against North Korea – eased only last year –
        Moon’s alleged payments to the communist leaders raise potential legal
        issues for Moon, a South Korean citizen who is a U.S. permanent resident
        alien.</font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>“Nobody
        in the United States was supposed to be providing funding to anybody in
        North Korea, period, under the Treasury (Department's) sanction
        regime,” said <span style="font-weight:normal" class="Name">Jonathan
        Winer</span>, former deputy assistant secretary of state handling
        international crime.</font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. embargo
        of North Korea dates back to the Korean War. With a few exceptions for
        humanitarian goods, the embargo barred trade and financial dealings
        between North Korea and “all U.S. citizens and permanent residents
        wherever they are located, … and all branches, subsidiaries and
        controlled affiliates of U.S. organizations throughout the world.”</font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moon became a
        permanent resident of the United States in 1973, according to Justice
        Department records. Bo Hi Pak said Moon has kept his “green card”
        status. Moon maintains a residence
        near Tarrytown, north of New York City, and controls dozens of
        affiliated U.S. companies.</font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Direct payments
        to foreign leaders in connection with business deals also could prompt
        questions about possible violations of the U.S. Corrupt Practices Act, a
        prohibition against overseas bribery.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Political Fallout</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, however, the potential
        political fallout might be a greater concern than any legal action,
        especially once George W. Bush assumes the presidency.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the past two years,
        Republicans have used Rumsfeld's report to club President Clinton and
        Vice President Gore for alleged softness toward a recalcitrant communist
        enemy.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1999, a House Republican task
        force followed up the work of Rumsfeld's commission and declared that
        North Korea and its missile program had emerged as a nuclear threat to
        Japan and possibly the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This threat has advanced
        considerably over the past five years, particularly with the enhancement
        of North Korea's missile capabilities,&quot; said the Republican task
        force. &quot;Unlike five years ago, North Korea can now strike the
        United States with a missile that could deliver high explosive,
        chemical, biological, or possibly nuclear weapons.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ironically, Moon's newspaper
        joined in laying the blame for North Korea's progress at the feet of the
        Clinton-Gore administration.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;To its list of missed
        opportunities, the Clinton-Gore administration can now add the
        abdication of responsibility for national security,&quot; a <i>Washington
        Times</i> editorial stated on Sept. 5, 2000.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not surprisingly the <i>Times</i>
        did not mention that its founder and financial backer, Sun Myung Moon,
        had lent a hand to North Korea by agreeing to multi-million-dollar
        business deals and allegedly putting millions of dollars in the personal
        accounts of the leaders masterminding the strategic weapons development.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Equally unsurprising, former
        President George H.W. Bush and his about-to-be-president son have never
        explained the family's financial involvement with Rev. Moon, a messianic
        leader who has vowed to build a movement powerful enough to eliminate
        all individuality and freedom in the United States.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those questions also aren't
        likely to come up at the confirmation hearings for Donald Rumsfeld, who
        believes that the United States must now pursue an expensive missile
        shield&nbsp; to counter the threat posed by North Korea.</font></p>

        investigative reporter, who broke many of the Iran-contra stories in the
        1980s for The Associated Press and Newsweek.</i></font></p>
