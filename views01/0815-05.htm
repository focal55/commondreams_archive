            <p> The good guys of yesteryear have become the bad guys in Macedonia. 

              Reports from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, 

              US state department and UN last week all point to the Albanian separatists 

              fighting here as perpetrators of ethnic cleansing directed at the 

              Macedonian population. 

            <P>This comes as no surprise to Balkan-watchers who have been following 

              the evolving tragedy in the country. During the 10 years of fighting 

              in what was once Yugoslavia, Macedonia managed to remain unscathed, 

              without help from the international community. After tense negotiations, 

              the Yugoslav army left peacefully, an admirable effort credited 

              mainly to the first Macedonian president, Kiro Gligorov. There was 

              tension - Gligorov himself survived an assassination attempt - but 

              no fighting. 

            <P>The government and the people were repeatedly applauded by the 

              international community for their efforts in creating and maintaining 

              a multi-ethnic society. Parties representing ethnic minorities sat 

              in parliament. Albanian parties were coalition partners in all governments. 

              Today six out of 17 government ministers are ethnic Albanians, the 

              parliamentary vice-president is Albanian and so are several ambassadors. 

              There are primary and secondary schools and colleges teaching in 

              Albanian; an Albanian university is about to open. There are Albanian 

              TV stations, theaters, newspapers. Why then the recent ethnic violence? 

            <P>Albanian militants claim that they are fighting for human rights. 

              This is a mantra which has proved to be a winning argument in the 

              past. However, this time it is a front for an armed redrawing of 

              the borders. The occupation of territory; abduction and murder of 

              civilians; threats to bomb the parliament building in Skopje; cutting 

              off water supplies to Prilep; and the ethnic cleansing perpetrated 

              on the majority Macedonians (a minority in the area of the conflict) 

              all raise the question: does one fight for language recognition 

              with mortar fire and snipers? 

            <P>The "ethnic cleansers", the NLA, are mainly old KLA soldiers who 

              fought in Kosovo alongside NATO. Most of their arms and fighters 

              come across the border from NATO.-administered Kosovo. The UN security 

              council last week requested that KFor and UNMIK (the UN's Interim 

              Administration Mission in Kosovo) patrol the porous border more 

              vigilantly. 

            <P>American, EU and NATO. diplomats have brokered a peace agreement, 

              which centers on a better guarantee of the Albanians' minority rights, 

              as a pre-requisite for disarmament. This misses the point: the radical 

              Albanians are fighting for territory. They are doing precisely what 

              many observers have been warning against for years - escalating 

              the violence until the average citizen is radicalized.

            <P>Even though diplomats insist they will not negotiate with the NLA, 

              the west is, de facto, legitimizing killing in the name of a language 

              dispute. Meanwhile, this fragile and impoverished country - the 

              same country which was the primary base for NATO's operation against 

              Milosevic's Yugoslavia, continues to perform that role for peacekeeping 

              in Kosovo (much at its own peril) and which took 350,000 Kosovan 

              refugees - is being ripped apart under the onslaught of gunmen armed 

              and trained by NATO.

            <P>Macedonia is collateral damage of NATO's involvement in the Balkans. 

              The US and its allies consider it too risky to try to disarm the 

              KLA (or NLA), even though this was an explicit responsibility of 

              their Kosovo mandate. Last year's disarmament of the KLA was largely 

              symbolic. Body bags are not sexy, so NATO. chose to let the militants 

              keep their weapons. 

            <P>NATO's Kosovo escapade did much more than arm and train the militants. 

              It escalated the conflict. The psychological effect of the entire 

              world siding with the Great Cause (as Albanian extremists see it) 

              has given a boost to their armed secessionist struggle. Ethnic cleansing 

              and occupying territories is an advanced step in redrawing borders. 

              The last 10 years in Yugoslavia have taught us what this leads to. 

            <P>The international community cannot stop the bloodshed by hypocritical 

              appeals to "both sides". NATO., EU and the US applied immense pressure 

              on democratic Macedonia not to defend itself. Now, the aggression 

              and insurrection have got out of hand. As a result of the "peace 

              process," Macedonia is on its way to federalization and disintegration. 

            <P>The NLA must abandon its armed aggression and insurrection before 

              there are more political talks. The US has a moral obligation to 

              stop them from turning Macedonia into another Afghanistan or Cambodia. 

              As we learned in Bosnia, leaving the ethnic-cleansers unchecked 

              causes more trouble down the line. 

            <P><i>Milcho Manchevski wrote and directed the award-winning film, 

              Before the Rain. His next film, Dust, will open at the Venice film 

              festival in September </i>
