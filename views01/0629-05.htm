DURHAM --  The International Court of Justice ruled this week that the United States violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by executing two German brothers.
<P>The convention requires that, if a foreign citizen is arrested, he be promptly notified of the right to contact consular officials from his home country.  Those officials are then entitled to arrange legal representation.  
<P>When Karl and Walter LaGrand were charged with murder in Arizona in 1982, prosecutors, who knew the two were German citizens, chose not to inform them of their consular rights.  By the time Germany found out about their arrest, a decade later, the brothers had already exhausted all legal avenues.
<P>After Karl was executed in February 1999, Germany requested that his brother's death be postponed.  The U.S. government, citing the separation of powers in the Constitution, deferred to the governor of Arizona, who in turn refused the German request.  Germany immediately sought an interim injunction from the International Court.  The governor ignored the injunction and, in March 1999, Walter too was killed.
<P>Ninety-six foreigners are on death rows in the United States today.  Almost none of them were informed of their consular rights.  Many have been badly represented by overworked, underpaid and sometimes grossly incompetent court-appointed lawyers.  
<P>Most of the foreigners on death row are from countries that are too weak to stand up to the United States.  In 1998, Paraguay withdrew a complaint to the International Court as a result of diplomatic and economic pressure.  
<P>Those protests that are issued fall on deaf ears.  When George W. Bush was governor of Texas he refused to grant clemency to a brain-damaged Canadian who had been denied consular rights, stating, with typical syntactical inaccuracy, "People can't just come into our state and cold-blood murder somebody.  That's unacceptable behavior, regardless of their nationality."
<P>As president, Bush has asserted that the death penalty and the criminal processes that lead to its application are entirely domestic matters.  He, and many Americans, seem oblivious to the contradiction between that assertion and the United States' longstanding efforts to promote human rights in other countries.  Since international human rights protect against governmental abuses, governments cannot determine for themselves if and when they apply.  Other countries have as much right to condemn the death penalty as the United States has to condemn China and Cuba for denying democratic elections.
<P>Wednesday's decision is one of a growing number of instances where international or foreign courts have censured the application of the death penalty in the United States.  In 1989, the European Court of Human Rights held that a German man could not be extradited to this country because the "death row phenomenon," a psychological condition caused by years of uncertain waiting, constituted inhuman treatment under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Earlier this year, the Supreme Court of Canada held that two Canadian men could not be extradited to the United States to face the death penalty because capital punishment was itself cruel and unusual.
<P> The impact of these decisions is already being felt.  Those involved in the criminal justice system now know that their practices do not stand up to foreign scrutiny.  Police officers and prosecutors are being urged to ask defendants whether they are citizens of another country.  Consular rights are, as a result, denied less often.  
<P>President Bush himself will also be affected.  Cooperation on trade and military matters could be stymied as European leaders up for re-election choose not to associate with a man widely seen as having blood on his hands.  The new president's capacity to exercise "moral leadership" will be compromised.  And a public backlash could lead to consumer boycotts overseas.  
<P>Like it or not, Americans may be about to pay a heavy price for their support of capital punishment.
