I didn't see the initial crash of the towers, but from the streets outside
my apartment here in Jersey City, I could look across the Hudson to the
smoke and char billowing in the air and stare in unbelief at the striking
absence of those landmarks so usually dominant in our vision.

<p>Many in my neighborhood took the PATH subway to the World Trade Center
station every day and many of them would never come back.  The sick irony of
the hate involved in the attack was underscored as a makeshift memorial -
one of a seeming infinity erected throughout the New York region - appeared
at our station, its list of names dominated by the Arabic dead from our
heavily Middle Eastern and South Asia neighborhood.

<p>How can progressives respond to September 11?

<p>With pain, with horror, with sympathy, with pride, with all the regrets of
what could have been.  But most importantly not with its usual defensive
stance of saying just "no", for out of the horror of that day are also the
possibilities of a new sense of humanity in the world that progressives
should embrace as the positive solution to prevent further tragedies.

<p>While we should worry and act proactively to defend civil liberties and
promote international justice as an alternative to military means of
security, it is worth emphasizing the positive sides that our society
revealed in these crisis days, some of them directly the result of the
political and cultural organizing progressives have been promoting for
years. I say all this not to paint a pure rosy picture, since we may have
some grim days ahead, but to emphasize the gains we have achieved by our
constant engagement with these issues over the years. There is so much good
we can appeal to in our fellow citizens, so we should not frame our response
totally in a "ten minutes to midnight" approach.

<p>Despite some horrible acts by individual Americans, the major media and
politicians have been dramatically less xenophobic than during past
terrorist acts in the US, with continual admonitions against turning hate
against fellow Americans, especially Arab and Islamic Americans. Despite the
justified anger at the death and destruction, there has been a heartening
lack of scapegoating and an understanding promoted of the diversity of what
Islam means and the humane components of the Palestinian struggle which
overwhelmingly reject this act of mass murder. This is a remarkable advance
on the xenophobia that absolutely dominated all discussion of terrorism and
the Middle East even a few years ago.

<p>In speaking of these events, we need to remember that in times of crisis
communication is not always about what is intended but what will be heard
and understood by listeners. When bodies lie barely cold in the rubble of
mass death, no explanation, no "perspective", on the causes of the event are
likely to be heard or should expected to be heard as anything other than an
excuse for the murder. That is a reality that has to be part of any
responsible left response to these tragic events.

<p>In that sense, anything said must be clearly put in the context of absolute
and unequivocal condemnation of these mass murders and of the criminality of
those involved.

<p>While the US has its own international crimes for which it should be held
accountable, they are irrelevant to these events, for there is no calculus
that allows the grievances of one set of innocents to be taken out on the
bodies of another set.

<p>This reality is why the Palestinian leadership condemned it so strongly
without any reference to US actions, an act of amazing compassion
considering this was done even as their people were being killed with
weapons and by allies of the US. As was reported by Reuters, the Palestinian
leadership stated that the attack contravened ''all human principles and
values regardless of the existing differences with the American
administration.'' Arafat himself told reporters, "We completely condemn this
serious operation. ... We were completely shocked. It's an unbelievable
disaster. It is touching our hearts. It is very difficult to explain my
feelings. God help them. God help them.''

<p>No one wants to hear about past mistakes right now that this tragedy has
occurred (since that just doubles the bitterness), but everyone wants to
hear about solutions to prevent a similar tragedy in the future. The Right
is coding their explanation and scapegoating in their proposed solution -
military response - implicitly (and in a few cases explicitly) blaming too
little military spending and too lax repression for the events of September
11.

<p>Conversely, instead of discussing past crimes by the US government, a better
approach is to stress solutions for the future - collective security through
global justice.  We can act in solidarity with the Palestinians and the
other victims of US violence by strongly emphasizing the evil of all
violence bred of hate, domination and exploitation. We will find far more
allies for a just world through building solidarity between the victims of
the World Trade Center and other global victims of violence than through any
finger-pointing or causal explanations.

<p>There has been a surprisingly large amount of acknowledgement of the
suffering of the Palestinians and other victims of US military actions in
these weeks, both in the media and in the public. The very enormity of this
act that may be encouraging war fever in some has through its enormity also
focusing many Americans on the world of misery they often ignored.

<p>Maybe that is a justification for the effectiveness of the act of the
terrorists, but it is the traditional religious explanation justifying all
evil - that when we confront evil in its raw singular hateful reality, we
may be inspired to find the good within in reaction. That is never
guaranteed, but when peoples' hearts are opened at such a moment, we may
find that an appeal for humanity and love may be far more effective than a
more traditional oppositional stance.

<p>People will hate only if they feel that is the only solution to the wound
that was opened in them.  If we can provide an alternative solution, of
solidarity between all victims of violence and hate, of ending misery so
hate cannot breed, of seeking a real end to war and violence through
democratic and global collective security, that is I think the truest way to
serve both the victims of this September 11 and the victims of US violence
as well.
