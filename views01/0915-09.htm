As the horrific events of Tuesday unfolded before our disbelieving eyes I heard a number of people comment, "It's like a movie."
<p>Hijackers, crashing planes, collapsing skyscrapers, mayhem in the streets, an attack on the Pentagon. So many movies have portrayed such terror and destruction.</p>
<p>The question now before us, before our nation, is will we continue to play out the all-too-familiar script?</p>
<p>Will we send our good guys to wreck havoc with the bad guys? Will we complete the story by dispatching what we hope will be the real life equivalents of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis? </p>
<p>I agree with those who have said that these terrible and tragic assaults will be a test of America. The question is, what kind of test will it be? Will be it be a test of American might and power? Or will it be a test of American morality and faith? </p>
<p>The temptation will be to release the terrible might of America in acts of violent and indiscriminate retribution. The now common use of the language of "war" seems to permit or even sanction this. But it seems to me quite possible, indeed likely, that this would be the precise hope of those that planned and perpetrated Tuesday's attacks: To unmask America as the font of violence that, in their view, it is. </p>
<p>If America strikes with similar terror and mayhem, will they not say "See?" </p>
<p>When struck as hard, as close and as brutally as we have been, it is very,very difficult not to seek to strike back. To strike back harder and in a way that we believe will prove final and definitive. </p>
<p>It is a very old story, one that movies have specialized in telling. The way to overcome violence is by greater violence. Violence is only wrong when it's the wrong people who are doing it. When it's the right people, then violence is all right, even good. </p>
<p>Such is the movie's myth.</p>
<p>Thus I am concerned about the sentence in the President's otherwise admirable statement on Tuesday night, the line in which he said, "There will be no distinction between terrorists and those who harbor them." I understand that those who give sanctuary to terrorists are supporting them. But starting down a road that makes no distinctions is a perilous turn. </p>
<p>The essence of a moral response will be the ability to make and hold distinctions, to be measured, not indiscriminate. </p>
<p>Moreover, violence cannot be redeemed by violence. The central claim of the Hollywood movie genre is precisely the opposite. But Hollywood has not invented this myth. It is as old as humanity itself. </p>
<p>The myth that good violence can overcome evil violence. That the only way to restore order is to beat down and destroy all that represents chaos in the world.</p>
<p>There is another story available to us besides the Hollywood story. It is the story of the cross. Of one who does not return blow for blow, violence for violence. It is the story of great, suffering love that is, in ways we cannot easily comprehend, the only answer to violence.</p>
<p>It is my hope and prayer, therefore, that our nation's response to the horrors of Tuesday, September 11, would continue to be measured and restrained, and indeed noble. We have seen nobility and suffering love in the valiant efforts of rescue and relief workers putting themselves at risk on behalf of the victims. We have beheld the outpouring of money, of blood, of prayers on behalf of the suffering and grieving. </p>
<p>In the longer term, nobility and morality shall be found in restraint rather than in simply unleashing American power and violence in retaliation or retribution. </p>
<p>It's not the movies. We do not live in a darkened theater, before a VCR, or in Hollywood. We live in our children's and our grandchildren's world. The days ahead will be difficult and dangerous. They will test us. </p>
<p>Let us pray that we meet the test not by responding to brutality with brutality, to violence with violence, but by continuing to rise to this terrible occasion with decency, with restraint, and with humanity. Therein lies victory.</p>
