            In exporting capitalism to nations as diverse as China and Poland, 
            Americans have argued that they also are exporting democratic ideals 
            such as the rule of law and respect for human rights. But what if 
            the United States itself sets a bad example?
<P>That's the question raised in a new study published by Human Rights 
              Watch and written by Cornell University professor Lance Compa. In 
              "Unfair Advantage," Compa finds that American corporations routinely 
              break federal labor law and violate the legal rights of their employees 
              -- and that the government does almost nothing to stop them.</P>
            <P>Since the 1930s, federal law has guaranteed Americans the right 
              to organize unions and to negotiate working conditions with their 
              employers. Polls show that most people still support the concept. 
              Yet Compa finds that thousands of workers are fired every year for 
              actions as simple as wearing a union lapel pin. Drawing on documents 
              from the National Labor Relations Board, Compa finds that the number 
              of workers discharged for union activity has risen from a few hundred 
              annually in the 1950s to more than 20,000 annually in the 1990s. 
              He interviewed a Florida nursing home worker who was fired during 
              a union campaign, won his case before the labor board, and after 
              five years of litigation won a grand total of $1,798 in back pay 
              and interest. He cites the employees of a Chicago castings company 
              who voted for a union in 1987, but after the company refused to 
              bargain for 12 years, simply disbanded the union in 1999. Perhaps 
              these failings should come as no surprise; the labor board's staff 
              was cut by one-third between 1980 and 1998.</P>
            <P>Compa was himself a union activist before joining the Cornell faculty, 
              and skeptics will dismiss his study as the special pleadings of 
              a special-interest group. Yet findings like his would be a scandal 
              in most developed nations. Collective action in the workplace is 
              one of the central tenets enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration 
              of Human Rights. And a bedrock principle of most free-trade treaties 
              is that signatory nations will at a minimum enforce their own laws.</P>
            <P>Unions have suffered many setbacks over the years, some of them 
              self-inflicted. But there are reasons why Congress granted workers 
              the right to organize in the first place. Unions give voice to public 
              concerns about job safety and workplace fairness, they narrow the 
              gap between rich and poor, and they bring pensions and health insurance 
              to people who wouldn't otherwise have them.</P>
            <P>Americans learn valuable lessons when borders fall and they enter 
              commerce with far-off cultures. Among them should be a simple one: 
              A nation that promotes the rule of law should at least enforce its 
              own.
