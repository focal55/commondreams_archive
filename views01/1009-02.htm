The spectrum of violence and nonviolence has been the focus of my spiritual and intellectual struggle since I was in the second grade.<p>
We were living in the Acorn Projects in West Oakland. Every week-day morning, my mother had to leave our 12th-floor apartment before my school day started so she could arrive on time to her job in Union City, where she was working as a special ed teacher.<p>
My father worked the graveyard shift sorting mail at the post office just down <IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>the street from the West Oakland BART station. This was before we moved to a working-class neighborhood in East Oakland, where my mother still lives.<p>
One day, as I was walking to school, I came across a brutal street fight that involved baseball bats and lots of blood. Only now does the tragic irony strike me that two black teens were fighting to kill each other across the street from my school - a school named after the greatest American apostle of nonviolence, Martin Luther King Jr.<p>
As traumatized as I was by that vicious fight, it didn't stop me from getting into brawls throughout my elementary and junior high years. And not all of those rumbles were in self-defense. Sometimes my big mouth and false pride convinced me to "squab."<p>
But by the time I got to Bishop O'Dowd High School, having not become a "thug," my belligerence subsided considerably, though violence lurked in the depths of my heart. And that's probably why I decided to take up boxing.<p>
The streets of Oakland and the various boxing gyms stained with my sweat and blood provided a sort of social laboratory for me. Along the way, I learned a little something about conflict, courage and fear.<p>
Before my first Golden Gloves fight, all of us pubescent pugilists had to weigh in and get our boxing licenses stamped by the attending physician after a brief medical exam. I remember the more experienced fighters seeming calm and even in a playful mood as the rest of us "green" fighters walked around trying to mask our fear by looking as intimidating as possible.<p>
I tried to summon courage by thinking about my father, who had boxed while serving in a tank battalion in Vietnam during the Tet offensive. It didn't work. My hands were trembling and I was on the verge of wetting my trunks as I climbed into the ring to fight some kid I had never laid eyes on before.<p>
The crowd of drunken boxing fans didn't come to see any sweet science. They came to see young boys beat the hell out of each other. They wanted to see people get knocked out. They wanted to see blood.<p>
Before the bell rang, my trainer Terry Crawley, a retired pro boxer, reminded me: "When in doubt, jab." Oh, I did some jabbing, and fortunately for me, being a southpaw who was taller and had a longer reach than most junior welterweights in the tournament, I managed to land more punches than I got hit with.<p>
When it was over, my white tank-top was covered with the blood of my opponent, whose vital fluids were streaming out of his left eye, both nostrils and mouth. My right eye was swollen pretty bad. Terry said it was just a "mouse," but it felt more like a rat to me.<p>
Then something strange happened. After the fight, up in the dressing room, the kid I fought started walking toward me and, without saying a word, we embraced one another in a genuine hug. I still can't adequately describe the emotional bond made between me and my opponent, but it was real.<p>
I noticed other fighters do the same. It was then that I realized that some of the guys who were looking the meanest and talking the most "smack" (trash) before fighting were the same ones who were the biggest cowards and took the worst whoopings.<p>
Now, having been on the receiving end of more than a few beat-downs myself, I came to understand the importance of humility when fighting a little-known opponent.<p>
So when I hear politicians and pundits talking all this John Wayne macho war talk and, in some cases, accusing anti-war activists of being "cowards" or "un-American," it makes me laugh, knowing that if they ventured out of their cozy jobs and cushy offices and spent some time in my old neighborhood, or maybe got in a boxing ring for a few rounds, they'd be singing a whole different tune.<p>
When in doubt, jab. Everything works off the jab. It's a very useful, precise, set-up punch.<p>
And throwing the jab seems to be Colin Powell's approach to this war on terrorism, despite some of his "courageous" colleagues calling for a flurry of military blows, leading with haymakers, sweeping hooks and looping upper-cuts.<p>
"Let's not assume there will be a large-scale war," Powell said last week, rightly advocating what sounds more like an international police action than an all-out war.<p>
I sure hope President Bush is listening to his corner man. But it's hard to know if he is, since we are not being allowed to watch the fight.<p>
