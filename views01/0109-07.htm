Although she's earned such colorful epithets as "James Watt in a
skirt," amusing labels can't fully capture why Gale Norton, newly
nominated as secretary of Interior, is unfit to be entrusted with our
national parks, monuments and other public treasures. As her record as a
lawyer espousing the rights of polluters and corporate interests shows,
Norton's only qualifications for the job of Interior secretary should be
disqualifications.
<p>Norton began her career litigating on behalf of cattlemen, miners and
oil companies at James Watt's Mountain States Legal Foundation. She
followed Watt to the Department of Interior, where she advocated policies
such as opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. In
the late 1980s, at the conservative Pacific Research Institute, she
helped plan litigation strategy to enhance individual property rights at
the expense of community interests. As Colorado's attorney general,
Norton implemented a "self-auditing" procedure that allows polluters to
evade environmental fines and promoted legislation that would have
enshrined an extreme view of the "takings" clause of the U.S.
Constitution.
<p>Norton's absolutist views on property rights and her hostility to
environmental protections place her far outside the mainstream of even
conservative legal scholarship on these issues. Specifically, Norton
promotes a radical interpretation, advanced by University of Chicago law
professor Richard A. Epstein, of the U.S. Constitution's "takings
clause," which bars government confiscation of private property without
compensation. Epstein has argued that the takings clause "invalidates
much of the 20th century legislation" by requiring compensation for any
government interference with property rights "no matter how small the
alteration and no matter how general its application."
<p>Norton has actually chided the Rehnquist Supreme Court for
interpreting the clause in a manner that "falls short of the role
discussed by Richard Epstein." Norton further advocates an affirmative
"right to build on one's property" and suggests, remarkably, that "we
might even go so far as to recognize a homesteading right to pollute or
make noise in an area."
<p>Adoption of Norton's agenda would mean one of two things: Either the
government would have to pay polluters not to pollute, and thus the Bush
administration would have to set up a corporate welfare program so large
that it would make a farm bureau lobbyist blush, or it would have to
repeal most of our health, safety and environmental laws. The second
alternative is the one Norton clearly prefers. She notes: "If the
government must pay compensation when its actions interfere with property
rights, then its regulatory actions must be limited." She views this
"chilling effect on regulation" to be "something positive."
<p>But long-standing court interpretations of the takings clause already
offer important protections for property rights, and this country has
also been governed by the competing notion that individual property
rights cannot run roughshod over neighbors' rights or the community
interest. That's why we have laws to minimize the effects of pollution on
residential areas, keep adult bookstores away from schools, and maintain
parks and wilderness areas for recreation. Norton's extreme property
rights agenda would undermine this careful balance.
<p>The Interior Department's primary mission is to manage nearly 500
million acres of the public domain, including our national parks,
monuments and wildlife refuges. These lands are beset by pollution,
eroded by a maintenance backlog and under encroachment from development.
They already are encumbered with stale, frivolous or otherwise defective
claims of property interests asserted by timber, oil and gas, mining and
grazing lobbyists.
<p>Interior also administers the Endangered Species Act and thus is
entrusted to protect our wildlife and plants. A critical component of the
act ensures that habitat modifications on private lands do not harm
protected species. Given Norton's extreme views on property rights,
landowners are sure to assert to the department that "Secretary Norton
believes what you are doing is unconstitutional."
<p>Finally, Interior is charged with holding polluters responsible when
they harm publicly held natural resources. It is difficult to imagine
Norton, with her antipathy to regulatory solutions and her advocacy of a
"right to pollute," warming to this responsibility.
<p>No choice for Interior secretary could have been more likely to divide
and less likely to unite than Gale Norton. By nominating her, Bush has
rewarded the corporate contributors who underwrote his White House run,
but he risks alienating the vast majority of Americans who support strong
environmental laws and protection of our public land.
<p>Indeed, the more you learn about Norton, the more the label "James
Watt in a skirt" seems unfair to Watt.
