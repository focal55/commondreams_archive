SANTA BARBARA <wbr>--<wbr> I don't know which American Indian killed FBI agents Jack Coler and
Ronald Williams in a notorious South Dakota shoot-out 25 years ago. Nor
do I know the identity of the federal lawman who shot and killed Joe
Stuntz, the American Indian Movement (AIM) member, whose body I
photographed afterward. But I was there on June 25, 1975, outside the
Jumping Bull ranch on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, when some of the
bullets were flying. A stray round hit my pickup, and my memory is still
fresh of crouching low behind the truck with my portable tape deck,
recording the exchange of gunfire for a National Public Radio broadcast.
<p>The government has never produced an eyewitness in the deaths of the
agents, and prosecutors admit they still don't know who actually killed
Coler and Williams. But AIM leader Leonard Peltier, one of the estimated
two dozen Indians present on the 40-acre reservation that day, has
admitted that he participated in the firefight. A U.S. appellate court
upheld his murder conviction as an aider and abettor, but the court
chastised the FBI for its use of "fabricated" evidence in securing
Peltier's extradition from Canada and for withholding from the jury an
exculpatory ballistics test conducted on a rifle attributed to Peltier.
<p>Amnesty International maintains that Peltier, who is 56 and has been
in jail for the last 25 years, did not get a fair trial. Now, in the
waning days of the Clinton administration, the organization is one of
several groups petitioning the president to commute Peltier's sentence.
<p>Two other AIM members were acquitted in the case, on grounds of
self-defense, despite testimony that they had fired in the direction of
the agents. The jury also heard evidence about COINTELPRO, the FBI's
counterinsurgency program used against AIM, and a representative of the
U.S. Civil Rights Commission testified to the "climate of fear" on the
reservation before the 1975 shootings. Other testimony challenged FBI
assertions of neutrality in the tribal civil war that followed AIM's
takeover of the historic reservation village of Wounded Knee two years
earlier. Two Indians were shot to death at Wounded Knee; a dozen Indians
and two lawmen also received gunshot injuries during the 10-week
takeover.
<p>There have long been allegations that the FBI chose sides in the
internecineconflict that took place from 1973-75 be tween AIM-led
traditionalists and a vigilante group of mostly mixed bloods who called
themselves the GOONs (Guardians of the Oglala Nation). But testimony
concerning FBI activities on the reservation before the 1975 killings was
excluded by the judge in the case of Peltier, who was tried separately
from the other two defendants.
<p>In fact, the climate of fear back then was all too real, and it
matched anything I have experienced reporting from war zones like El
Salvador and the Middle East. In those days, the reservation seemed like
the Wild West, and almost everyone was armed. I once was threatened with
guns in my face when I tried to film a GOON squad roadblock; another time
I was slammed up against a wall by GOONs, who tended to perceive the
entire press corps as AIM sympathizers. The brakes on my car were cut,
and, on one occasion, a high-powered rifle blew a hole in an automobile
in which I was riding. My experiences pale by comparison to the beatings,
fire-bombings and drive-by shootings were common during the period; at
least 25 murders of Indians still remain unsolved. Former South Dakota
state Sen. James Abourzek said that the near-lawless atmosphere on the
reservation approached "total anarchy."
<p>District U.S. Judge Fred Nichol, who tried many of the Wounded Knee
cases, once told me in a filmed interview that "The FBI and the GOON
squad worked pretty much together . . . because they were against AIM."
In a 1984 televised interview, which I conducted for PBS's "Frontline," a
leader of the GOON squad claimed that FBI agents provided his group with
intelligence on AIM and, in one instance, "armor piercing" bullets for
use against AIM members who, like the GOONs, were heavily armed at the
time.
<p>A few years ago, Gerald W. Heaney, chief judge of the U.S. Court of
Appeals that upheld Peltier's conviction, petitioned the White House to
commute Peltier's sentence. Heaney stated in a letter that the FBI shared
the blame for the two agents and one Indian killed in the South Dakota
shoot-out. He said that the government "overreacted" to the 1973
occupation at Wounded Knee. Instead of "carefully considering the
legitimate grievances of Native Americans," he said, "the response was
essentially a military one that culminated in a deadly firefight on June
26, 1975.
<p>Before he leaves office, President Bill Clinton can provide closure to
a difficult and divisive period in Indian history. As Heaney wrote in his
clemency plea, "At some time, the healing process must begin. We as a
nation must recognize their unique culture and their great contribution
to our nation."
