<B>To: The Foreign Policy Therapist  </B>   
<P><B> From: The United States of America</B>   
<P> Dear Foreign Policy Therapist, 
<P>I don't know what to do. I want to be safe. I want safety. But I have a terrible problem.  
<P>It all began several weeks ago, when I lost several thousand loved ones to a horrible terrorist crime. I feel an overwhelming need to apprehend and punish those who committed this unbearably cruel act, but they designed their crime in such a diabolical fashion that I cannot do so, because they arranged to be killed themselves while committing the crime, and they are now all dead.  
<P>I feel in my heart that none of these men, however, could   possibly have planned this crime themselves and that another man, who is living in a cave in Afghanistan, must surely have done so. At any rate I know that some people he knows knew some of the people who committed the crime and possibly gave them some money.  
<P>I feel an overwhelming need to kill this man in the cave, but the location of the cave is unknown to me, and so it's impossible to find him.  
<P>He's been allowed to stay in the cave, however, by the fanatical rulers of the country where the cave is, Afghanistan, so I feel an overwhelming need to kill those rulers.  
<P>As they've moved from place to place, though, I haven't found them, but I've succeeded in finding and killing many young soldiers who guarded them and   shepherds who lived near them.  
<P>None the less, I do not feel any of the expected "closure," and in fact I'm becoming increasingly depressed and am obsessed with nameless fears. Can you help me?  
<P> <B> To: The United States of America  </B>
<P><B> From: The Foreign Policy Therapist</B>   
<P>Dear United States,
<P>In psychological circles, we call your problem "denial." You cannot face your real problem, so you deny that it exists and create instead a different problem that you try to solve.  
<P>Meanwhile, the real problem, denied and ignored, becomes more and more serious. In your case, your real problem is simply the way that millions and millions of people around the world feel about you.  
<P>Who are these people? They share the world with you - one single world, which works as a unified mechanism. These people are the ones for whom the mechanism's current way of working - call it the status quo - offers a life of anguish and servitude. They're well aware that this status quo, which for them is a prison, is for you (or for the privileged among you), on the contrary, so close to a paradise that you will never allow their life to change.  
<P>These millions of people are in many cases uneducated - to you they seem unsophisticated - and yet they still somehow know that you have played an enormous role in keeping this status quo in place. And so they know you as the enemy.   
<P>They feel they have to fight you. Some of them hate you. And some will gladly die in order to hurt you - in order to stop you.  
<P>They know where the fruits of the planet, the oil and the spices, are going. And when your actions cause grief in some new corner of the world, they know about it. And when you kill people who are poor and desperate, no matter what explanation   you give for what you've done, their anger against you grows. You can't kill all these millions of people, but almost any one of them, in some way, some place or some degree, can cause damage to you.  
<P>But here's a strange fact about these people whom you consider unsophisticated: most of the situations in the world in which they perceive "injustice" are actually ones in which you yourself would see injustice if you yourself weren't deeply involved. Even though they may dress differently and live differently, their standards of justice seem oddly similar to yours.  
<P>Your problem, ultimately, can only be solved over decades, through a radical readjustment of the way you think and behave. If the denial persists, you are sure   to continue killing more poor and desperate people, causing the hatred against you to grow, until at a certain point there will be no hope for you. But it's not too late.  
<P>Yes, there are some among your current enemies who can no longer be reached by reason. Yes, there are some who are crazy. But most are not. Most people are not insane. If you do change, it is inevitable that over time people will know that you have changed, and their feeling about you will also change, and the safety you seek will become a possibility.
