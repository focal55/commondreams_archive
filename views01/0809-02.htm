It is a bit premature to be talking about the 2004 Democratic primaries, but 
here are 10 steps for prospective candidates. 

<p>1)<i> Utilize the liberal base. </i>The liberal side of the Democratic Party has 
always formed its base in primaries, even though it has been snubbed during 
the last three presidential-election cycles. Organize the rank and file away 
from the centrist position and build an alternative vision for the future. 
All the groups abandoned by the Democratic Party’s moneyed interests, like 
labor, environmentalists, and reformers, are waiting for someone to pick up 
their mantles and run. If, however, Democratic candidates are just going to 
blather on about how great nuclear power is (as Senator John Kerry from Mass. 
recently did), or how virtuous welfare reform is while low-skill, decent-wage 
work is shipped overseas, they shouldn’t bother running. 

<p>2) <i>Utilize the independents.</i> In 2004, there probably won’t be a pseudo-reform 
candidate like John McCain conning independents and liberal-minded Democrats 
to cross party lines and vote Republican. This gives candidates an advantage 
that was basically taken away from Bill Bradley last year. What a perfect 
opportunity not just to talk about a reform campaign, but to run one! Cast 
out the big-money demon from the temple of the political process and run a 
clean campaign. With a full field of candidates, it won’t be hard for a clean 
candidate to stand apart from the herd. Jerry Brown ran that way in 1992, and 
though he didn’t win, he was the only candidate left standing against Bill 
Clinton — proof that a clean campaign can be run, if the candidates have the 
guts and integrity to talk straight. 

<p>3) <i>Don’t lie, exaggerate, or plagiarize.</i> Voters despise these things more 
than anything, and it drives them away from participating. Candidates, if you 
think you might not get caught speaking a half-truth, copping someone else’s 
speeches, cheating on your spouse, or padding your résumé, think again. In 
today’s 24/7 electronic media, a reporter will find out. 

<p>4) <i>Don’t talk down to the voters like they are children</i>. Some of us have 
children. Some of us have fought or lost loved ones in wars just so you could 
run for the highest office in the land. In some cases, we really do know 
better than you do. So please, don’t lecture us. 

<p>5) <i>Have ideas.</i> Voters are sick of politicians who regurgitate results from 
polling data or whispers heard from political-consulting wizards. Don’t just 
babble on about what the talking heads on the Sunday-morning shows want to 
hear. Have your own ideas and think about how to convey them in a coherent 
and sensible fashion. The shock of not being talked down to might just snap 
mind-numbed voters out of their lack of interest in the Democrats. 

<p>6) <i>If you support the environment, prove it.</i> Sell your SUV. Sell your 
Occidental Petroleum stock. Sell (or clean up) your polluting zinc mine in 
Tennessee. Change the arsenic water standards on your way into office, not on 
the way out. And support a Kyoto treaty that makes countries like Brazil and 
China adhere to the same standards as our nation. Don’t just write a book 
that no one reads and tell us you support the environment, then show us by 
your actions that you really don’t give a damn. 

<p>7) <i>Stand for something.</i> And at this point, anything will be sufficient. The 
modern candidate is driving voters away with negativity and corruption. Don’t 
you realize that these are people’s lives you are messing with, and that what 
you do and say does matter? Also, please, know who and what you are about 
before you run for president. Don’t let us find out you are paying some 
consultant to teach you how to dress, or how to be manlier. 

<p>8) <i>Be dramatic in your choice of a running mate.</i> While Joe Lieberman was a 
novel choice as the first Orthodox Jew nominated to a major-party ticket, it 
was an insipid move to put two conservative Democrats together. There wasn’t 
any balance, and no one had the common sense to realize it. This is 
surprising, since the corporate, conservative wing of the Democratic Party is 
always so quick to realize when things are becoming "too liberal." Don’t make 
the same mistake twice. Think of it this way: while there is never a 
guarantee that a candidate will win, a truly dynamic choice will at least 
make your mark in history. 

<p>9) <i>If you lose, have some dignity.</i> This is not a student-council race. When 
the votes have been counted, recounted, and recounted again, don’t call your 
lawyers and tear the nation apart to preserve your own ego. Your actions 
could give control of the election to politically appointed lawyers. Concede 
with self-respect and honor. Then, go and do something worthwhile with the 
rest of your life, as Jimmy Carter did by devoting himself to building 
housing for the homeless following his loss in 1980. 

<p>10) <i>Most important, don’t cry, complain, whimper, or stamp your feet if 
voters abandon your candidacy to make a more idealistic choice.</i> The party you 
represent is a shell of what it once was. If it continues to stifle the will 
of the people, the voters will have no choice but to look elsewhere.

year. He is currently a newspaper reporter for Community Newspaper Co. in 
Boston and is working on a book about political consultants.
