AS POLITICAL satires go, it is a dark and brutal one that begins on a 
deceptively positive note:
<P>"It was a time of great excitement. The country was up in arms, the war was 
on, in every breast burned the holy fire of patriotism . . ."
<P>The place was the United States, the time, 1904-1905, and the author was 
Samuel Clemens, by then known around the world as "Mark Twain." In what has 
come to be known as "The War Prayer," Clemens draws his unsuspecting reader in 
with a rousing account of a nation passionately headed off to war.
<P>"Sunday morning came . . . the church was filled . . . With the volunteers 
sat their dear ones, proud, happy, and envied by the neighbors and friends who 
had no sons and brothers to send forth to the field of honor, there to win for 
the flag or failing, die the noblest of noble deaths."
<P>Led by a pastor, Clemens' imagined congregation prays to "an ever-merciful 
and benignant Father of us all" to watch, aid, comfort, bless and shield "our 
noble young soldiers" and make them "strong and confident, invincible in the 
bloody onset; help them to crush the foe, grant to them and to their flag and 
country imperishable honor and glory."
<P>Then, Clemens eviscerates his reader with what he later told a friend was 
"the whole truth." In the person of a messenger from God, "an aged stranger . . . his long body clothed in a robe that reached to his feet . . . his seamy 
face unnaturally pale, pale even to ghastliness," the total reality of the 
people's prayers for victory is revealed.
<P>It is a reality few of us ever face, let alone accept.
<P>"Listen!" the stranger commands. ". . . O Lord our God, help us to tear 
their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; help us to cover their 
smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the 
thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain;
<P>"Help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us 
to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us 
to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the 
wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the 
sun flames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with 
travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it;
<P>"For our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, 
protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with 
their tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet!"
<P>The messenger finishes by asking for all of this "in the spirit of love of 
Him Who is the Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend 
of all that are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. 
Amen."
<P>Driving the final nail of irony, Clemens closes the grim parable with the 
messenger demanding to know whether the congregation still desires its prayers 
to be answered. But no one speaks. The last sentence of the story explains:
<P>"It was believed afterward that the man was a lunatic, because there was no 
sense in what he said."
<P>Accustomed to criticism despite his literary success, Clemens insisted on 
keeping "The War Prayer" unpublished until after his death. As his first 
biographer, Albert Bigelow Paine, noted in 1912, Clemens confided his 
reasoning to a friend:
<P>"Only dead men can tell the truth in this world."
<P>In the century since it was written, "The War Prayer" has been invoked by 
pacifists during several conflicts in which the U.S. has engaged. Its last 
major renaissance was the Vietnam War.
<P>With the memory of that landscape and those people -- with the vision of 
millions of besieged Afghan women, children and men -- this seems as good a 
time as any for yet another reading.
