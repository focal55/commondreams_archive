We have a Christmas economy.  We have a military economy.  No wonder
it's hard for people around the world to figure America out.  Christmas
in the best of times has a split personality.  There is a religious
Christmas and a secular Xmas.  The material side tends to drown out the
spiritual.  This year the political is upstaging, and incorporating,
both of them.
<p>The national psyche is shell-shocked.  Even with the highest murder
rate among fellow nations and being the largest arms dealer in the
world, Americans are stunned by the blowback of September 11, actual
attacks on their home ground, on the scale of special effects in
movies.  Decorative lights are red, white, and blue, in memoriam to the
dead, in support of America's war on terrorists.
<p>Osama bin Laden and his band of men, mass murderers for their cause,
have thrown the season out of whack.  A few dozen men in one branch of
one religion killed thousands of people of many religions and
nationalities.  They want Americans, men and women of many faiths living
and working together--and therefore infidels in their scheme of
things--out of Saudi Arabia.  They want the world to follow their
script, their reading of scripture.  They will go to any lengths, to the
ends of the earth and back, to achieve their purpose.  We are reminded
that history is geography is destiny.  
<p>Compare the two main figures of the season.  Father Christmas or St.
Nicholas or Sinter Klaas or Santa Claus is an older man from the Arctic
Circle, part pagan, part Christian, who rides a horse or a sleigh pulled
by reindeer and carries big bags of presents.  Jesus is a Jew from
Bethlehem, a younger man who has few possessions.  
<p>Both of them are legendary philanthropists; they emanate love for
people, each in his own way.  In the case of Santa, love is shown by
bestowing gifts.  In the case of Jesus, love is its own reward, a
spiritual gift.  This creates a certain tension about life on the
worldly plane, between the claims of the Kingdom of God and human
nature.
<p>This year it's a schism, a crisis.  There is a revival of 
existentialism and of religious expression.  Not all Americans celebrate
Christmas.  There are more Americans who are not Christians than there
are African-Americans or Hispanics.  You could call them the country's
largest minority.  Those who are not adherents of Christianity are
caught up in the seasonal momentum, which continues from Thanksgiving
until trees shed their needles and are discarded.  The Christmas
experience, centered around Christmas Eve, may last for two months. 
Many stores do almost half their year's business geared to Christmas and
other businesses function exclusively for Christmas. 
<p>This year we are more aware than usual of the tens of millions of
American Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Baha'is, secular
humanists, and those who follow or don't follow other beliefs.  We are
more aware than usual that America is a pluralist society where more
than one-seventh of the population do not observe the birthday of
Jesus.  There is added reason to give different perspectives some room
to breathe amid the crowd of Christmas activities and symbols.  We want
to see a government for Afghanistan that reflects its multiethnic
population, women as much as men.  We want them to be as free as we are.
<p>Christmas assimilated Saturnalia and winter solstice observances to
honor the figure revered as the prince of peace.  Christians give gifts,
primarily to children, as a proxy for giving birthday gifts to baby
Jesus.  
<p>"The Christmas season" generally refers to marketing and sales
campaigns for people to buy more than they need as much as to a time of
prayer.  But the two become merged.  It is a religious and political act
to be a consumer.  Christmas carols play in stores and restaurants.  The
political prayer is an American ritual, in Congress, in the pledge of
allegiance to the flag, at public events.  This challenges both
democracy and spiritual practice, the Constitution and the Christian
Bible. 
<p>Most American children do not need any extra things.  They have
enough.  They have been indoctrinated to want more things but they don't
need them.  For the most part, they have more things than anyone else,
more than they know what to do with.  What children need is love,
support, guidance, nurturing, play, kindness, a good education, and,
when in doubt, more of the same.  They need physical security, food,
health, shelter, clothing, air and water and sunlight.      
<p>A patriotic Christmas becomes a fusion of church and state.  It toys
with the First Amendment.  It Christianizes America and politicizes
Christian religiosity.  It confuses the issues.  Jesus is usually
performed in movies by northern European Christians who will look more
like Santa Claus when they get old, not by what we think of as young
"Middle Eastern" or "Mediterranean" men.  As with the protean Santa
Claus, combined from many cultural traditions, Jesus takes on the local
trappings of believers.  This year, more than ever, the baby Jesus seems
to be swaddled in the American flag while Santa seems to be choking on
his laugh.
