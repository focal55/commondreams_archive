Have you ever heard of ``When Chefs Attack''? According to the latest TV ratings, this look inside ``America's Scariest Restaurants'' did fairly well on the third-tier UPN network, but not as well as ``Cheating Spouses Caught on Tape.'' I confess I haven't ever seen this expose on good food gone bad. The name alone conjures up a Mortal Kombat-style game in which one chef throws Ginsu knives and the other counters with a lethal spray of salmonella. Frankly, I bet that's more entertaining than the reality.<P>

   Reality, or at least ``reality TV,'' is the name of the game. Shows like the raunchy ``Temptation Island,'' the long-running ``Cops'' and the wildly popular ``Survivor,'' Part Deux, are blanketing the airwaves, kicking aside traditional sitcoms and series. Never mind that ``reality TV'' is never quite what it seems, the situations often set up, overedited and semi-scripted. We know it, too, and we don't care. We willingly buy into the illusion.<P>

   There used to be only one big hit in the reality TV genre. It was called the news, and almost everyone watched it. Today, only about half of Americans watch the network news, and the three major cable news channels -- CNN, MSNBC and Fox -- have been fighting over their modest but well-informed audiences. As a result, the past few months have been a season of bloodletting at both the cable and network news channels.<P>

   CNN, part of the AOL-Time Warner conglomerate, has taken one of the hardest hits. While its newer competitors are still gaining viewers, the 20-year-old network lost 8 percent of its viewing audience in the past year. CNN made the decision to cut 400 employees, including some veteran reporters. More significantly, they've changed how they're structuring the news, cutting the number of stories they do each day by a third, from 60 to 40, and pumping up the talk. (That led to some awkward moments, like one anchor joking she ``should have taken the buyout,'' and others sitting uncomfortably on couches, their legs visible for the first time in years as they emerged from the veil of their news desks.)<P>

   The networks aren't immune, either. ABC News is releasing 15 correspondents as their contracts expire and merging the daily and weekend news divisions. Last month, NBC announced plans to cut up to 10 percent of its staff, not sparing strong ratings winners like ``Dateline.'' Having worked for ABC and CNN and appeared on many of the other networks, I know that this business is a lot harder than it looks.<P>

   Just like ``reality TV,'' the news is a mix of verite and entertainment, and the folks who work in the biz are expected to work obscene hours, get all their facts straight, then just as they're dropping from exhaustion slather their face with makeup and smile (or frown seriously) on cue. You want reality? Show a correspondent in his/her office with five empty coffee cups, a pile of notes and hair sticking out in every direction.<P>

   Doing the hard work of television journalism is very different from what people think reporting should be like. Reporters often do the leg work by telephone, or sitting in endless committee meetings, or drinking endless cups of java during stakeouts. None of these are what you'd call glamorous. Correspondents and producers are constantly under edict to watch the budget, even when they can count on using some library b-roll.<P>

   The part where the reporter talks into the camera is called a ``stand up'' -- the journalist perfectly coiffed; if outdoors, hair blowing in the breeze; a line or two memorized in order to set the right tone for the rest of the piece. One good 90-second piece can easily take 20 or 50 or even more hours to prepare.<P>

   Television news is like that line about the duck: on the surface, it's all glide; underneath, furious paddling. And perhaps that's the problem: Recent efforts have been about the surface. Striving to produce an ever-friendlier news product, the networks and cable news outlets have turned away from the mission of offering a broad survey of national and international news.<P>

   If viewers want hard-core news, they'll have to ask for it. ``Reality TV'' has claimed the low ground; the news has claimed a superficial high ground; and information pays the price.
