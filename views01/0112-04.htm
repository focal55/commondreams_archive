            <p>Many of George Bush's supporters say that his recent nominations 
              of Colin Powell as Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice as National 
              Security Adviser and Rod Paige as Secretary of Education prove that 
              he is serious about racial diversity. Moreover, his nomination of 
              a Latino and two white women to his Cabinet suggests that compassionate 
              conservatism boasts enough room for all sorts of minorities. But 
              before we count the votes for Bush's celebrated--or is it calculated?--display 
              of racial leadership, let's at least acknowledge that we may have 
              run into some dimpled chads. 
            <p> Powell's nomination is a no-brainer, which, as it turns out, may 
              perfectly suit Bush's presidential profile. To take credit for nominating 
              a national hero to extend his stellar record of public service is 
              only a little better than taking credit for inventing the Internet. 
              Powell's halo effect may redound to Bush, but his choice of Powell 
              owes nothing to Bush's fundamental bearing as a racial statesman. 
              Powell and Bush are at significant odds on crucial issues. Powell's 
              vigorous support of affirmative action, his belief in a woman's 
              right to choose and his advocacy for besieged urban children put 
              him to the left of the Bush dogma. To be sure, Powell is no radical. 
              His moderate racial principles are largely acceptable to many blacks 
              because they're not bad for a guy who buys the Republican line, 
              some of its hooks and not many of its sinkers. Unlike Congressman 
              J.C. Watts, the black Republican from Oklahoma who'd just as soon 
              fish all day with his conservative colleagues than cut the race 
              bait. Indeed, Powell's beliefs run the same blush of racial centrism 
              that coursed through the Clinton Administration over the past eight 
              years. The difference is that such moderates, and a sprinkling of 
              liberals, had plenty of company in the Clinton Administration. In 
              a Bush Administration, Powell is, well, a hanging chad. </p>
            <p> Of course, Powell's beliefs will have little substantive impact 
              on his future boss's domestic policies, because he has been dispatched 
              to foreign fields where Bush surely needs the help. So what looks 
              like a plum for black folk may be a pit. True, no black person has 
              ever served as Secretary of State. But once we get past the obligatory 
              gratitude black folk are called on to display when conservative 
              whites finally do something halfway decent, the fact is that Powell 
              will have little influence on the public policies that may hamper 
              black progress under a Bush Administration. Powell has not been 
              nominated as Secretary of Health and Human Services, so his input 
              on welfare, for instance, is lost. Instead, if confirmed, Wisconsin 
              Governor Tommy Thompson will practice his widely praised variety 
              of welfare reform, a policy that on both the local and national 
              level has had a horrendous effect on millions of poor blacks. Neither 
              is Powell slated to be the Attorney General, where he may choose 
              the civil rights czar, who carves the policy groove on race in the 
              Justice Department. Instead, that honor may fall to John Ashcroft, 
              an ultraconservative whose opposition to black interests is destructive. 
              An omen of things to come was glimpsed starkly in Ashcroft's contemptuous 
              scuttling of the nomination of black Missouri Supreme Court Justice 
              Ronnie White for the federal bench. Not only is Powell's value to 
              Bush on race largely symbolic, that symbolism will more than likely 
              be used to cover policies that harm the overwhelming majority of 
              black Americans who were never persuaded by Powell to join the party 
              of Lincoln (Continentals). </p>
            <p> Rice and Paige may be lesser-known political quantities, but they 
              are nonetheless instructive of Bush's racial politics. Rice, the 
              former Stanford provost and assistant national security adviser 
              for President George H.W. Bush, is not as vocal a supporter of affirmative 
              action, preferring a lukewarm version of the policy that may comport 
              well with Bush's nebulous "affirmative access." At Stanford, Rice 
              was not nearly as aggressive as she might reasonably have been in 
              recruiting black faculty, failing to match the efforts of equally 
              conservative universities like Duke. And her record of advising 
              the senior Bush on national security matters indicates that she 
              was a blue-blood conservative in black face. </p>
            <p> As for Paige, his my-way-or-the-highway methods have yielded mixed 
              results for the predominantly black and Latino students in Houston, 
              where he has served six years as superintendent of schools. A proponent 
              of annual standardized tests, a measure heartily supported by Bush, 
              Paige has overseen rising test scores while all but abandoning students 
              who couldn't pass muster. Moreover, Paige supports the use of tax 
              money to fund private education, a policy favored by Bush and many 
              blacks but that could have deleterious effects on poor families. 
              The lure of vouchers is seductive, but it fails to address the fact 
              that there is hardly enough money available to make a real difference 
              to those students whose parents are financially beleaguered. </p>
            <p> With Rice's nomination, the point may be that a black can be just 
              as staunch in spouting conservative foreign policy as the next wonk. 
              With Paige, the point is that a black can promote the sort of educational 
              policies that help some black folk while potentially harming a larger 
              segment of the community. It is clear that such a state of affairs 
              does not constitute racial progress. The irony is that Powell, Paige 
              and Rice were chosen in part to prove an inclusiveness that is meaningless 
              if their very presence comes at the expense of representing the 
              interests of the majority of black folk, especially those poor and 
              working-class folk who are vulnerable and largely invisible. The 
              lesson the Republicans would have us learn is that not all blacks 
              think alike, that we are no ideological monolith in liberal captivity. 
              The real lesson may be that a black face does not translate into 
              a progressive political presence that aids the bulk of black folk. 
              Especially when that face must put a smile on repressive policies 
              that hurt not just most blacks but those Americans committed to 
              radical democracy. If that counts as racial progress, we need an 
              immediate recount.
