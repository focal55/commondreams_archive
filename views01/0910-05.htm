Elites were upbeat about America as the new year began.  A Feb. 17 joint 
statement issued by the Group of Seven (world’s wealthiest countries) read 
“economic fundamentals remain strong” in the U.S.  Then, America’s 
“Goldilocks’ economy” was growing, neither too hot (inflation), nor too cold 
(joblessness).  Currently, inflation is tame.  Meanwhile, the official 
jobless rate of 4.9 percent in Aug. was nearly a four-year high.  Recent 
academic and government reports have indicated that consumer confidence and 
spending are weakening as economic growth is slowing.  In the meantime, 
President Bush got his 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut passed, while Fed 
Chief Greenspan has lowered short-term interest rates by a total of three 
percentage points this year.  Both policies are bids to keep America’s 
“Goldilocks’ economy” pain-free from the Three Bears.

<p><a href="http://bellarmine.lmu.edu/%7EJDevine/" target="_new">Jim Devine</a>, an economics professor at Loyola Marymount University 
<http://bellarmine.lmu.edu/~JDevine>, provides more details about the ursine 
family.  First is Papa Bear, U.S. external indebtedness.  Second is Mama 
Bear, U.S. consumer indebtedness.  Third is Baby Bear, debt loads of 
non-financial corporations.  Much is at stake here.

<p>Take Papa Bear. America’s $450 billion trade deficit, the difference between 
what the U.S. imports and exports, is making the International Monetary Fund 
nervous.  An Aug. 14 report by the IMF noted that the “size of the U.S. 
external account did not appear sustainable in the longer term.”

<p>Unknown to many, the U.S. has increasingly relied on dollars from foreigners 
to finance the $450 billion export/import gap.  The continued flow of 
overseas money to fund America’s trade imbalance is vital—and faces an 
uncertain future.  “The era of massive foreign direct investment in the 
U.S.—a major source of dollar strength—may be drawing to a close,” Gene 
Koretz wrote in the Sept. 10 Business Week.  “Last year, net foreign direct 
investment covered 30% of America's current-account deficit.”

<p>Currently, the U.S. slowdown is forcing it to import less.  Which means 
other nations are exporting less to America.  Much world trade and the 
financing of it are done in dollars.  The slowing down of America’s 
import-buying is changing foreign lenders’ role as U.S. creditors.  Global 
changes in dollar circulation (and valuation) could present America with 
repayment problems for its trade deficit.

<p>On to Mama Bear, consumer debt.  It’s a term not readily associated with the 
U.S. economic boom of the 1990s.  Yet it should be.  Consumer spending 
(based increasingly on borrowing) accounts for two-thirds of the American 
economy, the world’s largest.

<p>“The linchpin keeping the U.S. economy narrowly in the black in the second 
quarter was the consumer,” Business Week online noted Aug. 31.  “The 
everyday Joes and Janes of America were” partly to thank by “digging further 
into debt.”

<p>The Federal Reserve said the U.S. balance on car loans, credit cards and 
similar personal loans was $1.58 trillion in April 2001, an all-time high.  
Consumer debt was about $800 million in April 1990.  The national economic 
expansion began in first-quarter 1991.

<p>The payments for the past decade of debt are overdue for some.  An Aug. 31 
Reuters and Los Angeles Times report said a growing number of Americans are 
falling deeper into credit card debt, which is spurring the growth of  
bankruptcies.  “The total number of new bankruptcy filings in the second 
quarter was 400,394, an increase of 24.5% over the same quarter in 2000 and 
up 9% from the first quarter of this year, the Administrative Office of the 
U.S. Courts said last week.”  Last spring’s figure is “a new quarterly 
record—putting 2001 on pace to eclipse the record 1998 filings of 1.4 
million, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute,” Business Week 
online reported Aug. 31.

<p>We come to Baby Bear, indebtedness of non-financial corporations.  For a 
closer look, we turn to economist Jane D'Arista of the Financial Markets 
Center, an independent, nonprofit institute based in Virginia.

<p>According to D'Arista: “Analytical measures based on market values reveal 
that the debt binge of the late 1990s has resulted in a significantly weaker 
position for the corporate sector.  Debt as a percentage of net worth rose 
from 51.5 percent at the end of 1998 to 56.3 at the end of 2000.”

<p>How did this happen?  American corporations have been using their cash to 
buy back corporate stock they own, D'Arista added, through the issuance of 
corporate debt. Her analysis, based on data from the Federal Reserve System, 
Flow of Funds Account of the United States, implies that corporations might 
delay new investment in equipment and factories if the current economic 
slump continues.

<p>Meanwhile, Bush is saying that consumers will spend the rebates from his tax 
cut and stimulate economic growth.  Yet a mid-Aug. study from the University 
of Michigan indicated that less than every fifth dollar from the president’s 
tax cut might be spent buying.  Instead, consumers may be partly using the 
remainder of the rebates to repay existing debt, the Aug. 31 London 
Economist noted.

<p>Repaying debt isn’t consumers’ only option, of course.  In July, the highest 
private savings rate in two years “strengthened fears of a sharp slowdown in 
consumer spending that has been the principal support for the U.S. economy 
this year,” according to the Aug. 30 Financial Times.

<p>Meanwhile, Greenspan is focused in part on how to better measure valuations 
of stocks and homes relative to consumers’ purchasing patterns.  Also in 
2001, he has cut interest rates about once every 33 days (on average) to 
spark economic growth.

<p>Crucially, where will consumers and corporations find the money to service 
their private debt and keep spending/investing if the slowdown continues?  
Will fiscal and monetary policies be able to fashion a fairy tale ending to 
America’s “Goldilocks’ economy”—or not?
