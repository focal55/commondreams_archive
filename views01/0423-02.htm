Wall Street may have lost its irrational exuberance about the Internet and
its miraculous properties, but I haven't. As a research tool, it's still too
good to be true. My cyberspace connection gives me access to a remarkable
range of publications from many spots on the globe. And while much of the news
content is similar to that found in the U.S., the difference in emphasis is
striking.
<P>
   One of the more salient differences concerns coverage of the Mideast,
particularly the treatment of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. By comparing
other countries' coverage of the turmoil to that of the U.S. media, it's hard
to avoid the conclusion that our media are skewed in Israel's favor.
<P>
Seldom do we read stories like the one published in Israel's Ha'aretz
newspaper that graphically detailed the routine brutality of Israeli soldiers
in occupied territories. Nor are we likely to read accounts of a growing
rebellion of reserve soldiers against Israeli military service in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip that appeared in both England's Daily Telegraph and the
Jerusalem Post.
<P>
   American publications rarely make serious efforts to get beyond the
formulaic coverage that portrays Israel as a beleaguered democracy valiantly
fighting off evil, anti-Semitic terrorists. There is another perspective of
the struggle that casts Palestinians as valiant anti-colonialists fighting a
legitimate struggle against illegal occupation of their land by imperialist
forces.
<P>
   This latter view calls into question the priorities of U.S. foreign policy,
however, and is seldom highlighted in American media. Publications from other,
particularly European, countries provide coverage that is more textured and
contextual--often portraying Palestinians as anti-colonialists.
<P>
   But since U.S. opinion is so critical to Israel's treatment of the
Palestinians, American media's one-dimensional coverage is coming under
increasing criticism. Our relentless pro-Israel slant serves to prolong the
conflict, critics say.
<P>
   Robert Fisk, one of Britain's most highly decorated foreign correspondents,
recently issued a call in the U.S. for more "courageous" media coverage of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Fisk is a Beirut-based writer for the London
Independent and has received the British International Journalist of the Year
award seven times. He has been reporting from a number of the globe's hot
spots for 30 years, but his primary focus has been on the Middle East. He
argues that journalists who fail to note the colonial character of Israel's
illegal occupation improperly frame the conflict and do a disservice to those
who depend on them for accurate information. By ignoring this context, Fisk
contends, journalists are giving sustenance to a system that virtually is
identical to the regime of apartheid South Africa. "There's not much
difference between the tactics of the Israeli army in the occupied territories
and that of the South African police," he wrote in the April 17 edition of the
Independent. "The apartheid regime had death squads, just as Israel has
today."
<P>
   Where, he asks, are the U.S. journalists who will point out these
parallels? Even if the South Africa-Israel analogy is false, there are enough
similarities between the two systems at least to provoke a serious media
discussion of Israel's exclusionist policies. How, for example, can Israel be
"democratic" when it refuses certain rights to its Arab citizens? But, Fisk
laments, "our gutlessness, our refusal to tell the truth, our fear of being
slandered as `anti-Semites' . . . means that we are aiding and abetting
terrible deeds in the Middle East."
<P>
   In their zeal to provide coverage compatible with U.S. policy, the American
media ignore Mideast realities. "No matter how many youths are shot dead by
the Israelis, no matter how many murders--by either side--and no matter how
bloody the reputation of the Israeli prime minister, we are reporting this
terrible conflict as if we supported the South African whites against the
blacks."
<P>
   Syndicated columnist Norman Solomon is one U.S. journalist who concurs with
Fisk's assessment. " . . .The Reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian cycle of
violence is badly skewed by an endless cycle of media bias." Solomon writes
that this bias is enforced through a "not-so-secret weapon" that is brandished
as a pre-emptive threat: the charge of anti-Semitism. "Any Americans who speak
out against Israel's extreme disregard for human rights are liable to be in
the line of fire."
<P>
   The prejudices condemned by Fisk and Solomon are more easily seen from
cyberspace, that remarkable realm where information can sometimes escape the
biased assumptions of its sponsors.
