Members of Congress are continuing to play hide-and-seek with their legislative 
records. Only two congressmen - Republican Reps. Christopher Shays of Connecticut 
and Frank Wolf of Virginia - have placed their voting records on the Internet 
in a searchable format easily accessible to citizens. Not a single U.S. senator 
has been willing to use the Internet in a manner that would give voters an open, 
accurate and quick way to track their votes.
<p> Thanks to taxpayers, computers equipped with Internet access are available 
in the offices of every one of the 535 members of the U.S. Senate and the House 
of Representatives. Posting voting records on their websites in a searchable citizen-friendly 
format would be a simple task.
<p> So, why the reluctance to implement something that would make it easy for 
voters to understand how their elected representatives were performing their official 
duties? 
<p> Flowery speeches about the public's right to know notwithstanding, most members 
of Congress are guided by the age-old political rule: "What the voters don't know 
can't hurt you on Election Day." If voters could pull up easy-to-read details 
on their computer screens about every vote a senator or a representative makes 
during a term, there might be some surprised voters and a lot of red-faced members 
of Congress in need of quick explanations.
<p> This past summer, two members of my staff - Noel Dingboom and Mark Wittink 
- worked with congressional interns in a survey of Senate and House offices to 
determine attitudes about the posting of voting records in a searchable format 
on the Internet. The answers were disappointing, with most members falling back 
on claims that votes were available on other Internet sites including those managed 
by various private organizations.
<p> Some of the explanations for the failure of members to post their own records 
seemed to translate into something akin to "the constituents are too dumb to understand" 
an unvarnished straightforward rendition of a congressional voting record.
<p> Reliance on private groups is tricky, at best. Most compile voting records 
in a manner to support their own policy positions. Others are selective about 
the issues and votes they list. And members of Congress have a long history of 
attempting to discredit as biased any group that publishes a voting record that 
makes their record look bad.
<p> It is true, as many offices cited, that the Library of Congress, through a 
service dubbed "Thomas," carries votes in conjunction with its Internet tracking 
of activity on the floor of the House and Senate. The process of extracting votes 
of individual members from "Thomas" is too cumbersome and time-consuming to be 
practical for most citizens. The same is true for the Congressional Record printed 
by the Government Printing Office.
<p> Unfortunately, sometimes Congress is able to rig the parliamentary procedures 
so that some items can slip through without a vote. One of these was a $4,900 
raise for all members that was allowed to go into effect earlier this month without 
a vote.
<p> It is little wonder that frequently fewer than 40 percent of the eligible 
voters turn out in biennial elections to select their senators and representatives. 
And millions of those who do arrive at the polls have only the most surface information 
about what their sitting senator or representative has been doing in Washington. 
Incumbents like to keep it that way.
<p> Information is the oxygen of democracy. It is also the basic ingredient that 
builds and maintains confidence and accountability in government. At a minimum, 
citizens have a right to know in detail the positions their representatives take 
on legislation. Congress should adopt a rule that would require that all members 
list their voting records on the Internet in an easily accessed, searchable format 
by member name, bill subject and title.
<p> This would be a giant step forward in efforts to ensure an informed electorate 
- and a more accountable Congress. Citizens should contact their senators and 
representatives and ask why this isn't being done. They can be reached through 
the Capitol switchboard - 202-224-3121 for senators; 202-225-3121 for representatives.
