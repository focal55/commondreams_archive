Every crisis and tragedy is an opportunity for
some, as any ambulance-chasing lawyer can tell you.
We expect the Pentagon to lard its already bloated
budget, and Attorney General John Ashcroft to chip
away at the Bill of Rights, all in the name of the War
Against Terrorism.

         <p>But "Trade Promotion Authority?" That seems
like quite a stretch. Yet the Bush administration is
preparing to whisk this through Congress on the same
pretext, even at the risk of provoking the first post-
September-11 partisan fight.

         <p>Trade Promotion Authority (formerly known
as "fast track") would give the Administration power
to negotiate new international commercial
agreements, with Congress having only a yes-or-no
vote on the final product. First in line is the
controversial 34-country "Free Trade Area of the
Americas" (FTAA).

         <p>"Will the Congress strongly support free trade
as a cornerstone of international leadership?" asks US
Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, the Bush
Administration's point man. Well, that depends on
what he means by "free trade." Skepticism among the
public abounds: in a recent poll by the University of
Maryland, 72 percent said that US officials who make
trade policy give too little consideration to the
concerns of working Americans.

         <p>They have good reason to be wary. What
Zoellick doesn't tell us is that the vast majority of
Americans have actually lost income as a result of our
increased opening to trade over the last 20 years,
and the ways in which this has been done.

         <p>Most economists are reluctant to admit this in
public, because free trade is something of a religion
among the profession. But it is a solid conclusion
from their own research.

         <p>Economists have estimated how much trade
has contributed to the upward redistribution of
income in the United States. They have also tried to
measure how much our national economy gains, in
terms of increased income, from removing tariffs and
other barriers to trade.

         <p>It turns out that for the vast majority of
Americans, trade's effect on redistribution -- from the
lower and middle-income groups to the wealthier --
outweighs the gains from cheaper imports. This is
true even if we use the more inflated estimates of the
gains from trade; and even if we use the lower
estimates by economists of how much trade has
increased inequality.

         <p>Virtually all economists agree that trade has
contributed to the widening gap between those who
have a college degree, and the three-quarters of the
US labor force that does not have one. The question
is, how much? If we take the lower estimates of how
much trade has increased inequality, then three-
quarters of the labor force has lost between 1.6 and
2.4 percent of their income over the past two decades,
as a result of trade opening.

         <p>If we take a higher estimate of the effect of
trade on income distribution, then three-fourths of the
American labor force has lost between 12.2 and 12.9
percent of their income.

         <p>And all of this ignores, as standard economic
models do, the economic losses due to the closing of
factories and long spells of unemployment that result
from trade.

         <p>The polls reflect these economic trends. It is a
striking case of the "less educated" having a much
more accurate view of economic reality than the
pundits and intellectuals who dominate the print and
broadcast media.  It does not take a Ph.D. in
economics to figure out that throwing the majority of
the US labor force into increasing competition with
people earning a few dollars per day will lower wages
for most workers here. Nor does one have to be
overly cynical to realize that this in fact has been one
of the main purposes of our international commercial
agreements.

         <p>So when Mr. Zoellick asks us to support "free
trade" in the interests of national security, he should
at least be honest about one thing: he is asking the
majority of Americans to make more economic
sacrifices, while others get richer.

         <p>Of course the label "free trade" is a
misrepresentation of these agreements. Both NAFTA
and the WTO have expanded the most costly form of
protectionism on Earth, in terms of both economic
costs and human life. That is the international
extension of patent protection for pharmaceuticals,
against generic competition. And  NAFTA gave
corporations a powerful new right to sue governments
directly, which they have already used to overturn
environmental regulations.

         <p>All of which explains why we need the full
participation of our elected Congressional
representatives in the formulation of international
commercial policy. And why Administration officials,
now wrapping themselves in the flag, are so eager to
restrict their involvement.

Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC,

Gains Make Us Rich? An Assessment of the Prospective
Gains from New Trade Agreements "(<a href="http://www.cepr.net" target="_new">www.cepr.net</a>).</i>
