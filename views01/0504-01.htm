Twenty-nine years. That’s how long Robert King Wilkerson was held in 
solitary confinement for a crime he did not commit.

<p>Wilkerson, 58, was freed Feb. 8.  He was one of the Angola Three, 
African-American men accused, convicted and imprisoned in Louisiana.

<p>The other two members of the Angola Three—Herman Wallace and Albert 
Woodfox—remain in solitary confinement at the Louisiana State Penitentiary 
at Angola, an 18,000-acre former plantation named for where the enslaved 
people had lived in Africa.

<p>In 1970, Wilkerson received a sentence of 35 years for armed robbery. He had 
refused the prosecution’s offer of 15 years and went to trial instead.

<p>“I was innocent,” Wilkerson said.  “But I have no beef with the jurors who 
convicted me thinking that they were doing a good thing.”

<p>Then, President Nixon was in the White House.  He was striving to 
politically secure the South by criminalizing white youth and nonwhite 
people generally, many of whom participated in Civil Rights and Vietnam War 
protests.

<p>In the meantime, the Black Panther Party attracted Wilkerson.  The Panthers 
spoke to his conditions and those of other poor and oppressed people living 
under a system that robs the many of their common humanity.

<p>Wilkerson fled custody.  He was captured and given another eight years of 
prison time, but with no regrets.

<p>“A slave has a right to escape,” he said.

<p>Subsequently held in the Orleans Parish Prison, Wilkerson and the other 
prisoners there endured severe overcrowding, inferior food and no medical 
care.  They rebelled against these brutal and brutalizing conditions.

<p>In Nov. 1971, the prison administration removed the leaders of the uprising, 
including Wilkerson.  He was subsequently classified into solitary 
confinement.

<p>In April 1972, Wilkerson entered the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. 
  For the next 29 years, he spent 23 hours a day in a tiny cell there.

<p>Which is where Wilkerson, during his prolonged confinement, studied the past 
and current conditions of subjugation lived by Africans in America.  The 
Panthers emphasized such self-education as a tool of liberation, he said.

<p>In 1973, Wilkerson was convicted of murdering another prisoner at Angola.  
The prosecution’s sole evidence was the testimony of two prisoners.

<p>Wilkerson and his co-defendant Grady Brewer were shackled with their mouths 
duct-taped shut during the trial.

<p>Moreover, no cross examination of the prosecution’s two main witnesses was 
allowed, and no forensic evidence linking Wilkerson to the murder was found 
at the crime scene, he added.  If the testimony of the prison guard on duty 
at the time of the murder would have been allowed, Wilkerson said that he 
would have been found innocent.

<p>But that was not to be.  Wilkerson was found guilty and given a life 
sentence without the possibility of parole.

<p>Significantly, Brewer confessed that he murdered the prison guard alone in a 
1975 retrial.  Yet Wilkerson was again given a life without parole sentence.

<p>Undaunted, Wilkerson kept filing legal petitions in appeals courts.  
Eventually, he was able to get an affidavit from both prisoners that they 
had given false testimony against him.

<p>In time, Wilkerson was granted an evidentiary hearing by the U.S. Court of 
Appeals following the retraction of the witnesses’ testimony.  Why did they 
lie?  They were coerced by the Angola authorities.

<p>The state wished to avoid an evidentiary hearing, and Wilkerson’s case was 
remanded back to a district court, where he was released after accepting a 
plea bargain.  His release from prison was given a big boost by prison 
activists, his family and friends and his legal team, including attorney 
Scott Fleming.

<p>One out but two in.

<p>Wallace and Woodfox are still languishing in solitary at Angola.  In 1972, 
they  were convicted of murdering a prison guard there.

<p>The prosecution’s case against the two of the Angola Three lacked any 
physical evidence connecting them to the crime, Wilkerson said.  As in his 
case, the trials of Wallace and Woodfox saw such exculpatory evidence 
suppressed.

<p>The three men believe that the prison authorities framed them for crimes for 
which they were innocent as a result of their forming the Angola chapter of 
the Black Panther Party.  The Panthers were targeted by the FBI’s COINTELPRO 
program that sought to neuter radical movements by any means necessary.

<p>“America does have political prisoners,” Wilkerson said.

<p>The men had organized to improve conditions at Angola by abolishing prisoner 
rape, bettering race relations and improving prisoners’ living standards 
generally.

<p>Last March, the ACLU filed a federal civil rights lawsuit on the Angola 
Three’s behalf, alleging that the men’s nearly 30 years of solitary 
confinement is in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s  Eighth Amendment 
that prohibits such cruel and unusual punishment.

<p>Oppression of prisoners is the rule at Angola, Wilkerson said.  Take for 
example the 80 percent of the prison population that works for a wage of 
four cents per hour.

<p>Angola the prison emerged from Angola the plantation after the Civil War.  
Theft of African Americans’ labor is the tie that binds both institutions.

<p>“Angola is a slave ship that doesn’t sink,” performance artist Keith Antar 
Mason said.

<p>But the prison did not sink Wilkerson’s spirit.  He is now traveling around 
America speaking with people about his decades-long struggle in solidarity 
with Wallace and Woodfork from solitary confinement.

<p>“I may be free of Angola but Angola will never be free of me,” Wilkerson 
said.
