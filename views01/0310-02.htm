ON OCT. 14, 1960, John F. Kennedy made a last stop in a grueling 18-hour campaign day at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  The exhausted candidate did not arrive until 2 a.m., but 10,000 students were still waiting to see him.
<P>
<P>Revived and moved by their enthusiasm, Kennedy asked the students if they were willing to devote themselves to serving their country overseas.  Their roar of approval persuaded Kennedy to propose on the spot a new volunteer program, a program that would fire the imaginations of generations of young Americans.
<P>
<P>Five months later, in March 1961, the new president signed an executive order creating the Peace Corps and giving life to his inaugural call: ''Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.''
<P>
<P>Americans from many walks of life, most of them young college graduates, answered his call by going to work in the African bush and slums and outlands of Latin America and Asia, joining citizens from their host countries in hundreds of projects to build roads, construct water and sewage systems, control disease, improve farming, and teach schoolchildren.
<P>
<P>By 1963, 7,000 Peace Corps volunteers were at work in 44 countries.  As a shining example of the young president's call to public service, the Peace Corps became one of the most popular achievements and lasting legacies of the Kennedy presidency.
<P>
<P>Its spirit has been captured in thousands of ways by thousands of volunteers but perhaps never more poignantly than in the comment of David Crozier, an early volunteer who wrote to his family just before being killed in a plane crash in Colombia: ''Should it come to it, I had rather give my life trying to help someone than to have to give my life looking down the barrel of a gun at them.''
<P>
<P>The Peace Corps is still with us today, and its example has stimulated many worthwhile initiatives for public and community service, including the VISTA program, AmeriCorps, and Teach for America.
<P>
<P>But two aspects of the Kennedy legacy - that the Peace Corps symbolizes  the patriotic call to public service and the challenge to Americans to engage with others in tackling the world's problems - are in danger of being downsized as a result of a longstanding drive in Washington to minimize the role of government in our society and limit the scope of our obligations around the world. 
<P>
<P>Of course, government can always be streamlined to ensure that it meets real needs.  But over the past quarter-century it has become commonplace for presidential candidates of both major parties to campaign against Washington in order to win the right to govern.
<P>
<P>These cynical political attacks on government have  taken a toll on the willingness of young Americans to consider careers in government and public service; they have steadily reduced the participation of Americans of all ages in voting and elections; and they have produced a climate of suspicion and cynicism around what Kennedy fondly called ''the art of politics.''
<P>
<P>Ever since Gordon Strachan, a young Nixon White House aide whose career was shattered by Watergate, advised idealistic young people in 1974 to ''stay away'' from Washington, the call to public service in our country has become almost inaudible.
<P>
<P>For the last two years I had the honor and challenge  of representing the United States to the people of Central Europe in the Czech Republic.  Struggling to overcome the oppression of half a century of fascism and communism, the Czechs today are rekindling the fires of their own prewar, early 20th-century democracy.  They look to us for models of how civil society should be created, how community service organizations should function, how people can participate in the hard work of building democratic institutions.
<P>
<P>Because they trust the United States more than the European neighbors who oppressed them, the Czechs accepted our invitation to join NATO and are now working shoulder-to-shoulder with us to keep the fragile peace in the Balkans.
<P>
<P>The Czechs and many others have come to associate American democracy with a strong civil society - the kind of society that launched the Peace Corps 40 years ago and inspired a generation of young Americans to respond to President Kennedy's patriotic call to serve their country by addressing the problems of the world.  
<P>
<P>To counter today's climate of cynicism about the value of participating in the ongoing struggle for democracy in our own country and abroad, it is time to renew that clarion call.
<P>
<P><i>John Shattuck, who has served as US ambassador to the Czech Republic and assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights, and labor, is chief executive officer of the John F. Kennedy Library and Foundation. </i>
