An 
hour after the attacks, I was sitting catatonic at my computer screen, trying 
to get some news, when my neighbor poked his head in my office.
<p>"Ever 
wonder," he asked, "why we're so hated? Fifty years ago we were so beloved. What 
happened?"</P>
<p>His question penetrates the simple facade 
built in recent days by the mass media: of America in a battle of Good vs. Evil; 
of the attacks portrayed only as the work of hate-filled religious zealots.</P>
<p>The 
men in the four doomed airliners were filled with hatred and a twisted interpretation 
of Islam. But this explanation alone is not sufficient. It does not account for 
the flammable mix of rage and despair that has been building up in the Middle 
East since the Gulf War's end.</P>
<p>Seven years ago, in Hebron 
in the West Bank, I attended a funeral for a Hamas follower, shot by Israeli soldiers 
after he lunged at them with acid. In the funeral tent, mourners handed out candy 
to celebrate the martyr's ascent to heaven. Afterward, in the street, young boys 
stopped their laughing and roughhousing long enough to tell me that they, too, 
hoped to grow up and die in such an honorable way.</P>
<p>My 
question then was like my neighbor's on Sept. 11: "Why?"</P>
<p><B>Decades 
of humiliation</B></P>
<p>As a journalist working regularly 
in the West Bank and Gaza, I repeatedly witnessed the humiliation and anger of 
a population living under decades of occupation: Israeli bulldozers knocking over 
families' ancient stone homes and uprooting their olive groves; military checkpoints, 
sometimes eight or 10 within 15 miles, turning 20-minute commutes into 3-hour 
odysseys; the sealing off of Jerusalem and the third-holiest shrine in Islam to 
Muslims across the West Bank; the confiscation of Jerusalem identification cards, 
and hence citizenship, from Palestinian students who'd been abroad for too long; 
the thirst of villagers facing severe water shortages while Israeli settlers across 
the fence grew green lawns and lounged by swimming pools; U.S. M-16s used to shoot 
at stone-throwing boys.</P>
<p>Again and again, Palestinians 
asked me: Why does the American superpower support this? Do ordinary Americans 
know about this? Do they care?</P>
<p><B>Death tolls</B></P>
<p>It 
was no surprise when West Bank streets later filled with men burning American 
flags and waving posters of Saddam Hussein, given our country's lead role in sanctions 
against Iraq. Children there were dying from dehydration and disease &#151; a 
half-million excess deaths, according to a 1999 UNICEF study, or 5,000 a month. 
This is almost the projected death toll of the World Trade Center blasts.</P>
<p>Again, 
the questions: Do Americans know about this suffering? Do they care?</P>
<p>At 
work in the Arab streets is the rage of the weak and ignored. Young men, out of 
work and nearly out of hope, look for someone to blame. In such an atmosphere 
of despair, absent any perception of justice or equal treatment, extremism grows. 
In its most perverse form, it helps turn commercial airliners into flaming missiles, 
causing unfathomable suffering.</P>
<p>It can be comforting 
to blame it all on the insane religious fervor of The Other. Much harder is to 
understand that our own failure to witness and address the suffering of others 
&#151; the children of Iraq, for example &#151; has helped create fertile recruiting 
ground for groups seeking vengeance with the blood of innocents.</P>
<p>Now 
the network theme music pounds out the drumbeat of war. Talk shows speak of "dusting 
off the nukes" and wiping out entire countries. Last week, the deputy secretary 
of defense spoke of a "sustained campaign" aimed at "ending states who sponsor 
terrorism." (U.S. officials later said he misspoke.)</P>
<p>But 
if the attacks on the United States lie just as much in rage and a sense of injustice 
as they do in religious fervor, will bombing a country senseless make us safer? 
Or will it help perpetuate more rage, more hatred, more despair &#151; and, quite 
possibly, more terror in the United States?</P>
