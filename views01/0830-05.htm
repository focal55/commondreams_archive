Sandra Jenkins woke up about 6 am on
      a muggy June morning outside Washington, DC in 1999 to find a
      note from on her husband on the night-table beside the bed. &quot;Spread
      my ashes at our house in Fadden.&quot; She called a friend and
      told her, &quot;I think Merv has done something to himself&quot;.
      The friend told Sandra that she had to go find him before the
      kids did.

      <P>&quot;I went downstairs&quot;.
       recalled Sandra to the Australian news program Four Corners,
      earlier this year. &quot;I was hoping to find him asleep on the
      sofa. Maybe he'd taken some sleeping pills. But he wasn't there.
      I opened the Venetian blinds and I saw him standing outside.
      I thought he was standing. But something wasn't right. I followed
      his body down and he washe was hanging.&quot;<p>The man at the end of the rope
      was Merv Jenkins, a top intelligence officer with the Australian
      security forces. He had killed himself on his birthday at his
      home on Spy Hill, in Arlington, Virginia.<p>His wife, Sandra, believes
      that Merv was driven to suicide by the CIA. The story, which
      has received no press attention in the US, involves the complex
      and bloody relationship between US and Australian intelligence
      agencies, the Indonesia military and East Timor.<p>Jenkins was one of Australia's
      top covert operatives. He had led the Australian special forces
      group, known as the 660 Signal Troop, which coordinated communications
      for numerous operations inside East Timor, when Australian forces
      were essentially working has hired guns for Suharto and the CIA.
      Later Jenkins became the commanding officer for Australia's electronic
      warfare department. <p>Then in 1996 Jenkins got what
      he thought was his dream job: top liaison between Australia's
      Defense Intelligence Organization and the CIA and Defense Intelligence
      Agency. In this position, Jenkins was supposed to pass on satellite
      imagery and intercepted communications from Indonesia to the
      Americans.<p>Jenkins arrived in Washington
      at a fraught moment. Despite the best efforts of the CIA and
      the Australian military, the Suharto regime was beginning to
      crumble and the independence movement inside East Timor was once
      again gaining momentum and being countered with increasingly
      vicious reprisals by Indonesian troops, acting on intelligence
      provided by US and Australian sources.<p>The CIA repeatedly carped that
      the intelligence coming from Australia on Indonesia matters,
      including East Timor, was &quot;insufficiently detailed&quot;
      and &quot;too anodyne&quot; in nature. The Agency threatened
      Jenkins that if things didn't improve they were going to cut
      the Aussies off from the intelligence gathered at Pine Gap, the
      satellite control complex outside Alice Springs, which eavesdrops
      on Iraq, Indonesia, Afghanistan, India and China.<p> &quot;Merv was angry because
      the CIA was upset that he wasn't passing over more information
      that they really required, and that they, the CIA, expected a
      lot more out of Australia. They expected a lot more information&quot;,
      Peter Czeti, a former intelligence officer at the Australian
      embassy in DC, told the Canberra Times,  &quot; We would be requested
      for intelligence material by our allies on numerous occasionsWe
      would make those requests and send them back to Australia and
      they would sit there. And I mean for months, years. And they
      were never fulfilled. And these were areas that we were experts
      in, so there's no reason why we couldn't have provided the material.
      It's just that it never happened.&quot;<p>In fact, there were plenty
      of reasons why the Australian intelligence agencies may have
      been reluctant to turn over detailed intelligence reports on
      the operations of the Aussie military in East Timor. During Clintontime,
      the Australians had largely become a surrogate for US operatives
      in the region, even as Clinton moved to distance the administration
      from the collapsing Suharto regime and the rampages of the Indonesian
      military. <p>For example, in May Captain
      Andrew Plunkett, an intelligence office for the 3rd Battalion
      of the Royal Australian Regiment, who served in East Timor said
      that the Australian intelligence agencies instructed his and
      other units to conceal evidence of war crimes by the Indonesia
      army and militias.<p>Plunkett, who now faces prosecution
      for violating government secrecy laws, charges that the Australian
      military ignored intelligence reports about the impending massacre
      of 50 people at a police station in the East Timor border town
      of Maliana in September, 1999. &quot;Australian intelligence
      sources had accurately reported on Indonesian plans to kill independence
      supporters in Maliana, but those reports were pushed up the chain
      of command, hosed down and politically wordsmithed by the Asia
      Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&quot;,
      Plunkett told the Australian TV show Dateline on May 9 of this
      year. &quot;None of this information was passed on to the UN
      troops on the ground.&quot;<p>When Indonesian militias attacked
      independence demonstrators in and around Maliana, the UN told
      the people to go to the local police station where they would
      be protected by Indonesian police. Instead, the police and Indonesian
      soldiers trapped several thousand people on the police grounds
      and allowed militiamen to hack at least 47 people to death with
      machetes. <p>Plunkett, who was assigned
      the task of examining mass graves, also said that Australian
      soldiers were instructed to undercount the death toll. The official
      death count at Maliana was 12. But Plunkett says that the Australians
      and the UN knew that many of the bodies had been put in mass
      graves or dumped in rivers or the ocean. Plunkett says that he
      examined more than 60 bodies himself in the Maliana area.<p>It was precisely this kind
      of information on the situation in East Timor prior to the independence
      referendum that the CIA was pressuring Merv Jenkins to pass along.
      In May of 1999, Jenkins came across an AUSTEO (Australian Eyes
      Only Document) cable from the Department of Foreign Affairs describing
      the activities of the Indonesian militias and troops in East
      Timor. Jenkins, under extreme pressure, slipped the information
      to his contacts in the CIA. He was soon reprimanded by his superiors.
      An email from his superiors at the Defense Intelligence Security
      Office warned: &quot;Issues are becoming extremely sensitive
      as there are foreign policy implications. It is imperative that
      extra care is taken with the passing of material to the US and
      Canada.&quot;<p>The CIA was equally upset.
      When the agents saw what Jenkins handed over, they realized that
      the Australians had been holding back key information on the
      movements of Indonesian troops in East Timor. They demanded more
      documents from Jenkins. He tried to comply, telling his superiors
      that &quot;the pressure from CIA has been intense and building&quot;.
      But Jenkins didn't know that he was being spied on by his own
      employees, two uniformed officers who were supposed to be couriers
      between his office and the CIA.<p>The two men began opening Jenkins'
      packets and soon discovered that he was sending AUSTEO documents
      on East Timor to the CIA. They informed the Australian Department
      of Foreign Affairs, the very same office that suppressed the
      intelligence reports from Maliana.  One of the men, Dennis Magennis,
      wrote a letter to the Department of Foreign Affairs denouncing
      Jenkins' ties to the CIA &quot;as barely one step removed from
      treachery&quot;. He said that he could not rule out the use of
      violence against Jenkins and warned that unless the Department
      stopped the liaisons &quot;external means must be found.&quot;
      <p>In any event, an investigation
      of Jenkins' ties to the CIA was soon launched and, at the end
      of May 1999, he was hauled in for an interrogation. He came out
      of the meeting shaken.<p>&quot;When I first saw him,
      he was clearly under enormous stress&quot;, said Noel Adams,
      a former Aussie intelligence officer and colleague of Jenkins.
      &quot;You could see it in his face. His eyes were red-rimmed.
      It shocked me. I was dismayed to see how he was.&quot;<p>After the session, Jenkins
      sent an email to his superiors in Canberra saying that he felt
      he had been abused. He said that he was &quot;angry and frustrated&quot;
      and wanted to discuss the matter with top agency officials when
      he returned to Australia in August. He never made it back. Two
      days after sending this note, he was dead, hanging from a rope
      in his garage. It was his 48th birthday.<p>&quot;There's a culture there
      that excludes people,&quot; said Jenkins' mother, Enid. &quot;People
      who are honest and have integrity. And being accountable for
      what they've done. And it's the old boy stuff again. You know?
      Here's the bottle of whiskey. Here's the gun. You know what to
      do.&quot;<p>CounterPunchers should not
      conclude from that the CIA was somehow wearing the white hat
      in this dark affair. The Agency wanted more information on the
      rampages of the Indonesian militias in East Timor, but not in
      order to stimulate preventative action, but as a quid pro for
      the electronic intercepts the US was furnishing Australia.
