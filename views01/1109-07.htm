It’s been nearly two months since the September 11 mass-slaughters, and the 
U.S. response more and more resembles that period when America was beginning 
its long slide into Vietnam.

<p>I grant you that it’s not an exact comparison  -- one obvious difference, 
because the 9-11 attack took place on our own soil, is that the U.S. public 
has a better idea why we’re there -- but there are enough similarities to 
make the skin crawl.

<p>* In Vietnam, the U.S. took over a war from another country (France), who 
could not defeat the Vietcong. In Afghanistan, the U.S., so to speak, is 
taking over from the Russians, who could not defeat the Afghanis.

<p>* In Vietnam, the U.S. had very little understanding and knowlege of 
Vietnamese culture and history -- and language. In Afghanistan, the U.S. has 
very little understanding of Afghani culture, history and language. 

<p>* In Vietnam, the U.S. was constantly fighting an inhospitable geography -- 
the jungles, the muck, the highlands, the monsoons. In Afghanistan, the U.S. 
is constantly fighting an inhospitable geography -- the high mountains, the 
snowy winters, the lack of infrastructure.

<p>* In Vietnam, the U.S. tried to win the hearts and minds of the native 
population, while it bombed their villages with napalm, Agent Orange, and 
cluster bombs. In Afghanistan, the U.S. is trying to win the hearts and minds 
of the native population with its yellow-packeted food drops, while it 
continues to mistakenly bomb their villages and hospitals and food 
warehouses, sometimes with cluster bombs.

<p>* In Vietnam, the U.S. depended on its high-tech weaponry in fighting 
guerrillas who for years, decades, centuries, had found a way to disappear 
into jungles, caves, tunnels, and then drive the invaders from its soil. In 
Afghanistan, the U.S  is relying heavily on its high-tech weaponry in 
fighting guerrillas who for years, decades, centuries have found a way to 
disappear into caves and tunnels, and then drive invaders (British, Soviets) 
from their soil.

<p>* In Vietnam, the U.S. (unsuccessfully) tried to prevent the truth of what was 
happening there from being reported by the American news media. In 
Afghanistan, the U.S. military doles out the news it wants to have reported.

<p>* In Vietnam, the U.S. in the early stages sent “advisors” and other small 
contingents of troops, and used the local army in its fight against the bad 
guys, prior to sending in hundreds of thousands of drafted soldiers. In 
Afghanistan, the U.S. wants the local opposition troops to do the major land 
fighting, but realizes it may have to send in hundreds of thousands of 
American troops (probably re-instituting the draft) to do the job.

<p>* In Vietnam, the U.S. escalated the war beyond the borders of the country it 
was fighting. In the current war, there is widespread speculation that the 
U.S. is ready to go 
beyond Afghanistan, with Iraq the next likely target. (You can imagine what 
that will do to the fragile coalition of Muslim states currently supporting 
or tolerating U.S. actions in Afghanistan.) 

<p>* In Vietnam, the U.S. was at a loss to figure out how to win the war. In 
Afghanistan, it seems apparent that the U.S., anxious to retaliate for 
September 11, rushed in and now is flailing about trying to figure out what 
to do, given that (surprise!) the Taliban are a clever, tenacious force of 
guerrillas fighters -- who also are well-skilled in public relations 
marketing.

<p>Now, of course, the two wars are not exactly parallel. This is a far 
different conflict, in a far different place, with no Cold War serving as 
background music. But the similarities are striking, especially the main one: 
the U.S. administration really doesn't know what it’s doing, or how to do it.</p>
