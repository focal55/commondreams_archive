Recent 
      statements and actions by top players within the Administration and its 
      shadow cabinet of unreconstructed Cold Warriors may just be trial balloons 
      to test the waters to see if anyone will object to a resumption of testing 
      and abbrogation of treaties subscribed to by the U.S. If these are only 
      trial balloons, they must be pierced now before they take flight, and the 
      Utah congressional delegation has a moral responsibility to wield the pins.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the last 
      week of June, the Bush team ordered nuclear weapons scientists to study 
      a range of options to &quot;reduce lead times&quot; to resume nuclear bomb 
      explosions at the Nevada Test Site. The weapons laboratories argue that 
      testing is needed to assure that the stockpile is reliable, and some fear 
      that the long lead times to prepare tests give political opponents opportunities 
      to prevent renewed testing. A February 1 report commissioned by Congress 
      bemoaned the deteriorating state of nuclear weapons testing and production 
      facilities, leading the Administration to consider a six-year, $2 billion 
      initiative to up-grade the weapons programs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Frank Gaffney, 
      a former defense official and prominent conservative analyst and advisor, 
      stated in May that &quot;we're going to have to resume on a limited basis 
      underground testing of our nuclear arms&quot;. In a March 12 letter to Secretary 
      of State Colin Powell, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse 
      Helms called on the Administration to repudiate the signed but unratified 
      Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The New York Times reported May 9th that 
      Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld seems more inclined to deploy missile 
      defenses and develop nuclear forces than negotiating with Russia or China. 
      &quot;Before taking office Mr. Rumsfeld argued that the U.S. should not 
      ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty because it might need to develop 
      new nuclear weapons,&quot; the Times reported. So far, President Bush has 
      refused to place the treaty before the Senate. &quot;'This is a paradigm 
      shift,' said a senior Pentagon official. 'We are probably not going to be 
      hampered by arms control agreements.'&quot; (NYT 5/9/01)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In April and 
      May, the U.S. accused the Chinese of preparing for a nuclear weapons test 
      (Washington Times 4/9/01, 5/11/01), and similar accusations have been leveled 
      at the Russians (NYT 3/4/01). In the meantime, the Bush Administration is 
      putting on the diplomatic pressure to dismantle the ABM Treaty to pave the 
      way for ballistic missile defense. Secretary Rumsfeld has stated that there 
      may be a dozen different components to BMD, including the stationing of 
      weapons in space. Not only would this constitute a unilateral abbrogation 
      of the Outer Space Treaty, it would likely involve a resumption of nuclear 
      testing to complete development of Nuclear Directed Energy Weapons (NDEW) 
      projects the national weapons labs have experimented with for two decades. 
      Other darlings of the weapons labs, new &quot;low yield&quot; warheads and 
      the earth penetrating &quot;bunker busting&quot; nuclear warhead, are in 
      favor with the hawks in ascendance within this Administration. These too 
      will require nuclear tests to perfect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taken together, 
      these developments lead to an inescapable suspicion - that the U.S. is preparing 
      to unilaterally jettison a less than perfect arms control regime fostered 
      by every President since Eisenhower that has kept Armaggedon at bay. These 
      policy maneuverings threaten a costly and dangerous new arms race and are 
      alarming to our allies as well as our adversaries. Most alarming to the 
      constituents of Utah's congressional delegation is the prospect of more 
      nuclear tests upwind, especially those who have suffered painful losses 
      and grievous wrongs from being unwitting &quot;active participants in the 
      nation's nuclear weapons program&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the 
      commendable efforts of Utah's congressmen to achieve a greater measure of 
      justice for the downwinders, uranium miners, atomic veterans, and defense 
      workers exposed to radiation in the name of national security, allowing 
      testing to begin again promises new generations of victims even as the those 
      sick and dying from the last round hold their government- issued IOU's. 
      We know now that 58% of the more than 900 underground nuclear tests conducted 
      over 33 years leaked radiation, many of those exposing citizens far from 
      the Nevada Test Site borders to harmful doses. Resuming the bomb blasts 
      after a nine year hiatus further increases the risk of Baneberry-like catastrophic 
      leaks, as it will take the bomb testers time to re-learn the techniques 
      for containing the blasts underground. More nuclear tests means more leaks, 
      more victims, and less security.</font></p>
<p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The people 
      will not tolerate being bombed again! No political spin, no tortured logic, 
      no fear mongering that the Russians or the Chinese or the North Koreans 
      will be here in the morning, no assurance that &quot;THERE IS NO DANGER&quot; 
      will suffice this time. The assurances we need are that our elected representatives 
      will do everything in their power to prevent a resumption of nuclear testing. 
      Utahns must demand this now!
