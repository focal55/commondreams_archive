<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><i>Some will rob you with a six-gun and some with a fountain pen.<br>
</i>-- Woody Guthrie, "Pretty Boy Floyd"
<p>This we know: Californians were robbed.
<p>Was it all done legally?
<p>Did we deserve it?
<p>This we are learning: We've agreed to pay the robbers for years to
come.
<p>It's the way of the free market system.
<p>This we forget: It's not necessarily the way of the free market
system.
<p>Just a century ago, the United States had a different notion of the
corporation in our civic life. A far healthier attitude, if you ask me.
<p>"The corporation is a creature of the state. It is presumed to be
incorporated for the benefit of the public," the U.S. Supreme Court
observed in 1906.
<p>May I repeat: The highest court in the land, not a century ago,
presumed public "benefit" from the chartering of corporations. Go deeper
in history. It's a principle rooted in our heritage as far back as that
first apple pie. The preamble of our Constitution promises a more perfect
union to "promote the general welfare."
<p>Too bad we forgot our purpose.
<p>I'm referring, of course, to those runaway public corporations that
are in the business of selling electrical power and natural gas across
state lines. These paper creations and their much-demonized CEOs, with
their cowboy hats and fountain pens, tossed around penny-ante campaign
contributions and beguiled us. Enhancing the profit motive for utility
service was somehow supposed to result in less profit and more power.
<p>Sorry, but it's that simple. And everyone knows how it's turned out.
<p>But can we blame these corporations, really?
<p>You can say that 700% price increases are greedy. You might accuse
those who achieved them of breaking the law in their zeal. But,
unfortunately, you can't say it's wrong for a corporation to strive for
the highest prices and biggest profits. And the fact that these goals
inflict suffering on millions of people is irrelevant. The fact that they
could drag down the nation's economic rebound is immaterial. If children
have to sit in darkened classrooms, oh well.
<p>But that, friends, is absurd. And if I might say so, un-American.
<p>Our founding fathers would be reaching for the barf bag in the seat
pocket in front of them, if not their flintlocks.
<p>Colonial Americans feared the unrestrained power of all institutions,
including the church, the crown and the corporation. In a thoughtful
history, the Washington Monthly's contributing editor, Jonathan Rowe,
observed:
<p>"The colonists were extremely suspicious of corporations, which were
seen as oppressive agents of the crown and potential usurpers of the
public will. At the time of the Constitutional Convention, only some 40
business corporations had been chartered in all the colonies. Most of
these were for bridges, toll roads and similar public works endeavors. So
it's not surprising the founding fathers omitted the corporation from the
scheme of checks and balances by which they hoped to keep institutional
power under restraint."
<p>I will shorthand the ensuing evolution: For a long while, corporate
charters were granted selectively for, as Rowe explained, "ventures that
seemed worthy of public promotion and support." Slowly, these
institutions grew in number and influence. The most avaricious sought
better terms. Individual states found it a handy source of revenue to
offer increasingly favorable deals for corporate charters. Incrementally,
states reduced the burden of public responsibility.
<p>Delaware finally took the lowest common denominator to zero.
Corporations flocked there the way that international shipping companies
seek the Liberian flag--a rubber stamp of convenience.
<p>Even high-minded industrialists were forced to play down and dirty.
The only responsibility that corporations assumed, in a legal sense, was
to themselves. Today, we call this the "fiduciary" responsibility to
shareholders, and it is worshiped as business gospel. A corporation that
has an opportunity to seek triple-digit profits but does not, perhaps to
try and keep the lights on in our schools, could be held in breech of
this responsibility.
<p>Might it be another way?
<p>Actually, yes. During the Gilded Age a century ago, when corporations
similarly grew tyrannical and lost sight of the idea of corporate
citizenship, no less patriots than Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft,
both Republican presidents, and Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, proposed that
interstate corporations be chartered in the name of us all at the federal
level, not by states, to balance public and commercial interests.
<p>Instead, the United States embarked on regulatory schemes. Lately, as
with California and energy production, regulation fell out of fashion.
The result has wholly upset the balance and left the nation defenseless
against the determined "responsibility" of corporations to turn money
into more money, no matter what.
<p>I don't blame corporations. I blame us. We bought the snake oil. We
did it because we thought it would save us money. We thought that by
turning energy corporations loose, they would bloody each other and we'd
come out with change in our pockets. We were greedy.
<p>How to restore the checks and balances? By tempering our own greed, we
can restrain the greed of others. Roosevelt was right. The federal
chartering of corporations in the public interest would be a step
forward. Corporate responsibility is no more an alien idea than citizen
responsibility. It is a founding American ideal. And now, it's a matter
of civic self defense.
<p>Some of the robber barons who wrote themselves $100-million stock
bonuses with their gilt fountain pens will squeal, of course. But I
personally know more than a few business executives who would be thrilled
to take their place and pursue citizenship over perniciousness. They
ought to have a chance to prosper in the name of the common good.
