Once again
the Bush Administration has warned the American public about the
possibility of terrorist attacks and has put law enforcement officials
around the country on “the highest alert.” This is the third time since
September 11 that the Administration has issued such a warning. <p>
As before,
the Administration has given out no information about where, how, or when
the terrorists might strike. Law enforcement officials complained during
the first two alerts that the warnings were too vague to allow them to
counter the threats. Of the current alert, all that Homeland Security
Director Tom Ridge has said is that “the sources are more credible and
... the decibel level is higher as they [the terrorists] talk about
potential attacks.”<p>
I bet I'm
not the only one who thinks that something's fishy. If government
agencies - or their informants -- are listening to terrorists hatching
plans, then they ought to have some hint as to their identities and
intentions. Why won't they tell, at least other law enforcement
agencies?<p>
The
Administration is obviously in a bind. If terrorists strike, it will be
blamed for a lack of preparedness. If the terrorists don't strike, as we
all fervently hope, Administration leaders will not necessarily be
credited as saviors. Maybe there was no threat. If this happens too many
times, people might perceive them as crying “wolf” too often, or as
promoting a crisis without any evidence. <p>
Credibility
is everything. Is this an authentic alert or simply a scare tactic to
advance the Administration’s agenda? I assume the scare is real because
it will likely deter travel and keep people out of malls and other public
places. That’s neither good for the economy nor good for the
Administration’s own long-term political fortunes. On the other hand,
Administration officials were quoted, December 4, as saying that Ridge
pushed for the alert not only because of “new information” but because
the “public, politicians, and police were getting complacent.” Ridge
himself said, “The further removed we get from September 11, I think the
natural tendency is to let down our guard.” The Administration has much
to gain from sustaining the crisis. It has an aggressive foreign policy
to pursue as well as a repressive law enforcement agenda. <p>
In foreign
policy, the Administration speaks with a forked tongue. “There may be
need to use military troops elsewhere .... we’re keeping all our options
on the table,” President Bush has said. Two competing strategies are
articulated: 1) cooperating with the United Nations in building an
international coalition against terrorism, or 2) going it alone,
unilaterally attacking any country that we, without any international
corroboration or support, define as terrorist. <p>
On the one
hand Secretary of State Colin Powell is building an international
coalition. So far he’s been successful. Most recently he was in Turkey, a
Muslim nation and NATO ally, offering assurances that the U.S. has no
<i>immediate</i> plans to attack Iraq, Turkey’s neighbor. The Turks are
slated to play an important role in wooing other Muslim countries away
from fundamentalist extremism, but they are very much opposed to an
American attack on Iraq. Though such an attack would undermine Powell’s
internationalist efforts, he was unable to offer Turkey absolute
assurance that a war against Iraq was not in the planning. <p>
Other
voices within the Bush Administration boldly advocate “taking it to
Saddam.” Deputy Secretary of State Paul Wolfowitz has been calling for a
war against Iraq ever since September 11, regardless of international
opinion or evidence of Saddam Hussein’s complicity in the terrorism.
Publicly challenging Powell’s internationalism, Bush refuses to silence
Wolfowitz and break with his hawkish allies. Former Reagan advisor
Richard Perle, who has influence within the Administration, has written
that “if there is no Phase 2” in Bush’s strategy, “there can be no
victory in the war against terrorism.” Phase 2, Perle continues, means
unilaterally attacking Iraq or, if not Iraq, “Syria or Iran or Sudan or
Yemen or Somalia or North Korea or Lebanon or the Palestinian Authority.”
This is quite an agenda, guaranteed to turn the entire Muslim world
against us, as well as most if not all of our Western allies.<p>
The
anti-Iraq lobby accuses Saddam Hussein of making biological weapons, but
law enforcement and scientific authorities insist that the anthrax in the
postal system comes from American sources. As to Iraq’s weapons
capability, Scott Ritter, the UN’s chief weapons inspector in Iraq who
quit to protest President Clinton’s lack of resolve on this issue, told
<i>Fox News</i> that while Saddam remains “a little bit of a threat”
diplomatically and politically, he represents no threat to the United
States “in terms of real national security.” <p>
Given what
we know against what we've been told by the war hawks in the
Administration, can we trust Bush to honestly justify extending the war
to Iraq or other foreign countries? Is the current “high alert”
indicative of an actual threat, or is it a means of rousing the American
people to support an extended war? I don't know, but the Vietnam War’s
famous “Credibility Gap” is looming on the horizon. <p>
The U.S.
escalation in Vietnam was based on attacks by North Vietnamese patrol
boats on American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin. It’s now known that
President Lyndon Johnson knew that the “Tonkin Incident” was a lie, that
the attacks never happened. Cal Thomas - perhaps the most conservative
columnist in America - recently reviewed the Tonkin Incident in his
syndicated column. He concluded that “George McGovern was right,” as were
the other politicians and activists who “opposed the war.”<p>
It’s
credibility, stupid! It was lack of credibility that brought down the
Johnson Administration and helped undermine popular support for the
Vietnam War. The war against terrorism is inherently easy to support. But
President Bush has to be honest with the American people. If the
Administration is perceived as using the war as a cover to pursue its
partisan and ideological agenda, a showdown at Credibility Gap is just
around the corner.
