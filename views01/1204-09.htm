Most citizens capitulated to the dubious outcome of a disputed election
because there was little else one could do and - for the sake of the
country - we were told to ask questions later. There was however an
interesting reintroduction to a deeper patriotism. We asked questions
about the roots of our country and we contrasted our answers to the
rhetoric and policies from Bush and comapany. Something wasn’t lining up
and what the rest of the world was seeing many Americans also began to
see. Only fear and terror could put aside those questions and put the
will of the people behind the besieged administration . Fear and terror
arrived.  All questioning ceases; George is  given dictatorial powers
and Americans are being tube fed a manic and pumped up sense of
confidence. We’re going to be fine – we’re going to be fine – we’re
going to be just fine. No question.

<p>The war on terrorism offers an absolute evil for the population to rally
against. It’s simple and unambiguous. Ambiguity is not something George
has the patience, historical perspective or attention span for and he
represents and promotes this feature in the American sensibility. He
says it’s a new kind of war against evil. But it appears to be the same
kind of war we've seen before against something much more complex. What
we're watching we have watched before. A powerful military bombs a
country that only has guerilla capabilities or an inferior militia. Many
civilians are killed; rage grows; terrorism becomes the only weapon of
reprisal. People will always organize to create chaos until there is no
reason to organize and until chaos is no longer useful or necessary. The
comparison has been made between the war on terrorism and the war on
poverty, the war on drugs and the war on cancer. It sounds macho and
forthright but these “wars” are fictions that by the heat of their own
declaration must ignore root causes and questions. The war on terrorism
has a particular reason for ignoring root causes since whatever
grievance a terrorist attack may be addressing instantly becomes off
limits since addressing the grievance will be perceived as submission
and  reward. Asking why a terrorist attack happens almost implicates the
person asking as an accomplice. Instead of being a dispassionate inquiry
in search of a solution, asking why becomes tantamount to harboring a
terrorist.

<p>Bush and Sharon believe violence is necessary  – they believe in an eye
for an eye. They believe military action will bring peace. It has been
said that if violence could bring peace, Israel should be the safest
place in the world. We are told that terrorists are being killed in
Afghanistan. There’s no way to know how true that is but it is safe to
assume that out of this “new kind of war” terrorists are being born. The
terrorists America needs to be concerned about may not be in Afghanistan
at all. The cunning and committed terrorist is the one we need to be
searching for. A fighter in Afghanistan is surely committed but he is
most likely not a terrorist and he is certainly not cunning. By
definition a terrorist uses surprise and secrecy. The
soldiers/operatives being killed in Afghanistan are openly fighting a
military. That is not the action of a terrorist whose most important
weapon is secrecy.

<p>Bush, although not a fan of terrorists, is a big fan of secrecy. If one
were suspicious, the accidental bombing of Al-jazeera in Kabul could be
interpreted as a measure by which secrecy was secured. More blatantly,
if secrecy can be blatant, the suppression of the Reagan papers, the
need for military tribunals, his drunk driving record, the sources for
his energy policies, the Bush bin-Laden connection, the Carlyle group
and now possibly American casualties, are all covered with a veil.
Several Pakistani papers are reporting sixty-five Marine deaths in
Afghanistan. The official word from the Pentagon is there has been only
one casualty. No word that will encourage the opposition or discourage
the “shoulder to shoulder” pro war sentiment will be uttered from the
Pentagon. Keeping the price of a military solution secret must be
considered necessary for success. No one should ask how many soldiers
have been killed. We are told they most likely will be killed – but ask
questions about that later.

<p>As veils are lifted in Afghanistan the veil in America gets tighter.
Even America's second lady, Lynne Cheney, is making the rounds
encouraging college “elitists” to cool the critical rhetoric and
acknowledge and declare that they are outside the mainstream; ie admit
your opinion doesn't matter - really. Prime Minister Sharon announced to
the Israeli media that he was impressed at how well behaved and noble
the Americans were in their capitulation to the war.  He offered this as
a great model for his people. According to Sharon, Americans are the
shining example of how to cooperate with a war and how not to be
critical. Everyone be quiet and let the Bush/Sharon principle of bombing
our way to peace have time to work. In a unified voice Bush/Sharon will
say, “There will be plenty of time to discuss all this when we have
peace. But until then, no questions please. Shoulder to shoulder please.
Once we do the thing that you’re trying to be critical of then we can
listen to your criticisms. But please – we know what we’re doing. We
know how to make peace. We’ve been at it for years and years and years –
and it will happen –  make no mistake – there will be peace - we’re all
dying for peace. No question about it - please.”
