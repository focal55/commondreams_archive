My dear brother George:
<P>May the peace of our Lord (and me) be upon you in this celebration season 
of my birth.
<P>You have been much in my heart of late. Partly this is because I know the 
crushing pressure you feel as leader of the richest and most powerful nation 
on Earth.
<P>Also, it is impossible not to think of you: Millions of people -- millions, 
George -- pray for you every day. People of all faiths and denominations. 
People in countries you have never visited.
<P>Even people who believe in no God offer up prayers of hope when they hear 
you speak or see you on television because you hold their fate in your hands.
<P>Since Sept. 11, dear brother, I have noticed that you have turned away from 
me. I do not hear you ask yourself or anyone else the question you once asked 
all the time: "What would Jesus do?"
<P>Remember, George? It was so familiar, it became an abbreviation: W.W.J.D.? 
When you ran for president, you told the world I was your favorite philosopher.
<P>I know why you turned away. To face me, and all that I demand of those who 
follow me, requires tenacious courage and, in politics, a kind of leadership 
that is rare.
<P>Some very sick, twisted and hate-filled men have inflicted great suffering 
upon you and your people. They have murdered in the name of The One Who 
Creates All, and they seem determined to go on murdering.
<P>You want not only to keep them from hurting you again, you and your 
nation's people want to hurt them back. And you are willing to rationalize all 
manner of destruction, waste and -- if necessary -- killing toward those ends.
<P>Dear brother, you are right to want to stop evil. The tricky part for 
humans has always been, what is the best way to stop it? My four-letter answer 
is written, over and over, in the Bible, but it has been ignored by potentates, peons and sometimes popes for 2,000 years.
<P>Why? Because it contradicts the human instinct for vengeance.
<P>Our Father said, "Vengeance is mine," George, not, "Vengeance belongs to 
those who have been wronged." Vengeance is never the answer to "What would 
Jesus do?" Especially vengeance that masquerades as "justice."
<P>This is why I came, remember? Why I grew from Baby Jesus to Christ who 
suffered humiliation, unspeakable physical pain and a heart that was broken 
more times than there are stars in the skies.
<P>As one who has accepted me as the light and the way, George, you have a 
great opportunity -- and a duty -- to show the world my way. The way of love.
<P>As you know, I never said it would be easy.
<P>Following me means forsaking the desire to hurt back, to rob your enemies 
of their humanness, even when their inhuman acts aim to rob you of yours. It 
means refusing to buy the Great Lie of evil -- that true peace and justice can 
be achieved through deliberate and systematic violence.
<P>It means enduring the insults of angry and frightened people who wrongly 
equate "love thine enemies" with "have no spine."
<P>To borrow from our holy brother Mahatma Gandhi, following me means donning 
the heavy cloak of peace and wearing it forever -- not just when it is 
convenient, or when you are watching someone else's war.
<P>"Blessed are the peacemakers," was not a throw-away line I mumbled to 
Matthew. In Proverbs, "Seek peace and pursue it" listed no exemptions for 
world leaders.
<P>Dear brother, as you celebrate my birth and reflect upon my life, I beg you, reverse the course. Pursue peace with the fervor, and resources, with which 
you now pursue our damaged and insane brother Osama bin Laden and the infested 
souls who follow his malicious path. They may be beyond reason and love, but 
millions more are not.
<P>For God's sake, George, for the sake of your nation's future, face me again 
and ask what I would do.</p>
