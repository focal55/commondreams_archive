In the days immediately after 11 September, millions of Britons struggled with their first responses to the awfulness of what had happened in New York and Washington. The Observer argued then that the only fitting response was to identify and apprehend the suspects. <P>We cautioned of the temptation, in the aftermath of the coldblooded killing of 6,000 people, for America to plunge into a war against an unidentified enemy, killing thousands of innocent Muslims in the meantime. And we expressed the fear that any 'war against terrorism' might be widened into an indiscriminate attack upon any country identified as a rogue state by the Western alliance. <P>For some weeks, we derived relief from the fact that our caution appeared to have been shared. America, backed by Tony Blair, sought to build an international consensus for military action. Its supporters were assured that military action, when it started, would be aimed at those individuals who had been properly identified as perpetrators of the 11 September outrages. And they were then promised that such action would be targeted, precise and, above all, appropriate to the task of seizing Osama bin Laden and his accomplices.  <P>This weekend, our confidence in that strategy lies seriously shaken. The last week has seen a collapse of certainty about the objectives being pursued by the military alliance against terrorism and the efficiency of the operation designed to secure them. It is not enough for politicians to blame public listlessness, or the prevarications of the media, which have largely supported them, or a distaste for battle once the sound of gunfire starts. The politicians have brought a crisis of confidence upon themselves.  
<P>It is three weeks since we were told that Taliban forces were 'eviscerated'. It turned out to be demonstrably - and utterly - untrue. Such an error might have been the sort of misunderstanding which arises in the fog of war. However, the hapless contradictions over whether Osama bin Laden could be seized, which we heard from US defense secretary Rumsfeld last Thursday, or the apparent ignorance about cluster bombs we heard from our own Clare Short, are unforgivable.  
<P>These people have been immersed in the detail of this conflict from its instigation and they should have appreciated the damage to international public confidence that such casual blunders engender. They also engender a fear that their evasiveness might not even spring from a lack of application to detail. It gives the growing - and possibly unshakable - impression that confusion may be exactly what is going on in the minds of our leaders.  
<P>Set this against the backdrop of what is actually happening in Afghanistan. As winter approaches, another group of Red Cross food distribution centers is inadvertently bombed in a country where four million people face starvation. A tragic mistake perhaps, but one which joins a catalogue of other errors and the depressing realization that thousands of civilians are going to die while widespread bombing continues.  
<P>Meanwhile, George Bush's administration claims that it genuinely believes in the restraint it has championed while building an international alliance. Mr Bush himself has still not done enough to reassure those outside his hawkish inner circle that 'war' will not be extended to other countries, including Iraq. He has also now said that those responsible for the current anthrax scares in America have rendered themselves liable to the same response as Osama bin Laden.  <P>This is irrational and falls well outside any agreed international consensus. Three Americans have died, 13 people are unwell and thousands have been inconvenienced by anthrax scares - some hoaxes - but that does not equate yet for one moment to the crimes perpetrated on 11 September. The connection of the two reinforces the growing fear that the Bush administration might not have as focused, and specific, and calm a determination to address the crisis in Afghanistan as it claims.  <P>The Government also appears to have been behind a briefing last week about old intelligence suggesting that bin Laden might have access to nuclear weaponry. Downplaying the information once it entered the public domain made it seem once again that 'gesturism' is taking precedence over common sense.  
<P>It all too easily gives the impression of the Government doggedly at war regardless of strategy, beset by confusion and lacking in purpose. The ridiculous denunciation of Paul Marsden, the dissenting New Labour MP, and his furious portrayal as an 'appeaser', not only aggrandizes an entirely insignificant backbencher. It mirrors the unedifying American tendency to belittle the concerned with the taunt: 'You're either for us or against us.' Both betray an embarrassing lack of confidence in the democratic discourse we seek to promote to the wider world.  
<P>What we require now - above all - from the leaders of the Western alliance against terrorism is an honesty that we have not thus far seen. We need honesty about the constraints under which military forces are now operating. We need frankness about the adequacy of their intelligence about the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden in a country larger than France (it is neither unreasonable nor unpatriotic to be mindful that intelligence services, including the CIA and MI6, failed to predict or prevent the September 11 atrocities in the first place). We need a hitherto unseen recognition that the American perception and prosecution of war as if it is only between two states is simply not adequate among the fragmented, unpredictable, almost medieval collection of alliances which exists in Afghanistan.  <P>Of course, any military action is beset with difficulty, unpredictability and the need for determination and courage. The killing of Abdul Haq on Friday confirms that the Taliban are not defeated yet, or even severely incapacitated. The death of a man able to build alliances which might sustain a new Afghan government could be a disaster for the war effort, or it could concentrate the minds of those in Afghanistan who oppose the Taliban as to their ruthlessness. That is unpredictable, too.  
<P>But for now, we are continuing to bomb a country which has already been reduced to rubble twice in our lifetimes. We cannot escape the truth that this bombing is being carried out in our names and yet is beginning to appear to Afghans to be indiscriminate and vindictive. It has the capacity to destroy the prospect of a future Afghan government sympathetic to the stable and peaceful regional settlement which the West envisages. It also has the potential to turn millions of Muslims from skeptics about the West and its objectives into determined - and possibly violent - opponents. And it can do all this without necessarily securing the prime objective of disabling bin Laden.  
<P>Tony Blair's welcome statement to the British people yesterday was an acknowledgment that the battle for domestic 'hearts and minds' is crucial. It is a battle that Winston Churchill, with whom some Americans have compared our current Prime Minister, prosecuted ruthlessly during the Second World War. Mr Blair is absolutely right to remember that any military action needs a popular mandate. It is a mandate that cannot be taken for granted and it demonstrates his deft sensitivity for the popular mood that he has appreciated this.  
<P>Nevertheless, bombing of Afghanistan should not now continue without a complete and frank public appraisal and explanation from both Washington and London of what it is meant to be achieving and how those objectives are to be secured. That does not mean military action should stop. It does not mean even that military action should necessarily be brief. But alliance ground forces should be used, if necessary, and in sufficient numbers to secure the valuable - and admittedly dangerous - capture of Bin Laden and his lieutenants. That might be risky for those involved, but it would not continue to imperil thousands of entirely innocent lives.  <P>Not only do we now need frankness from our leaders about the dangers of this enterprise. We need them to convince us that they have a firm, agreed and coherent strategy for continuing to prosecute the odyssey upon which they have embarked. That must include a detailed appreciation of how they believe stable government can be re-established in Afghanistan after military action is over.  <P>We have supported the Government thus far in the harrowing weeks since 11 September, but if it does not take one cautious step back now to reassess its military strategy, it risks a collapse of confidence in its position in the near future. We do not want to see that. However, the killing of innocent people is wrong, whether engineered by terrorist hijackers or inaccurate cluster bombs.  
<P>The Observer takes exactly the same view now that we took six anxious weeks ago. It is justice, not war, that we seek as we still try to make sense of the awfulness of what happened at the World Trade Center and in Washington. It is justice for the victims of those heartrending tragedies, not war on the people of Afghanistan, that our governments must deliver.</p>
