What is independent media?  You’re reading one example of it now.  Many 
other examples were present at the Press Freedom event in San Francisco, 
sponsored by Project Censored in late April at San Francisco State 
University.

<p>For the past 25 years, Project Censored, based at Sonoma State in 
California, has selected the top undercovered news stories in the U.S. 
mainstream media.  In other words, the mainstream ran the stories once and 
dropped them, or the stories were ignored altogether.  Either way, the 
public has been kept in the dark about important news.

<p>Consider my friend Ray Cushing.  His story about the federal government’s 
coverup of research that showed how smoking marijuana reduced tumors was 
selected by Project Censored as the 22nd most censored story of 2000.

<p>Well, what partly makes for independence in the independent media is freedom 
from big advertisers.  Ads from corporate America take up two-thirds of 
mainstream newspapers.  (Think of all the trees that were cut down for 
Wal-Mart ads.)

<p>But that’s just one cost of business for the mainstream media that sell 
their audiences to other businesses.  In turn, the businesses pay the 
mainstream media outlets to advertise their products.  This process brings 
returns on investments to mainstream media owners.

<p>For mainstream media to criticize advertisers such as the auto industry 
would be to bite the hand that feeds it.  Under capitalism, corporations 
don’t willingly cut their own throats.

<p>Which leaves independent media free to cover news and views the mainstream 
media dismisses or downplays.  One example is reports on political prisoners 
Linda Evans (recently freed) and Marilyn Buck.  Other examples include the 
lethal effects of U.S. foreign policy on the people of Colombia, East Timor, 
El Salvador, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Puerto Rico and Serbia, a partial 
list to be sure. Mainstream coverage of the Middle East leads many Americans 
to think that Palestine is occupying Israel, when the opposite is true.  
Keeping the American people unaware of their government’s deadly foreign 
policy is a major achievement of the U.S. mainstream.

<p>Activism and analysis around the struggles of the poor, the nonwhite, young 
and women in America has a home in independent media.  This is urgent 
because the American work force is increasingly made up of women and people 
of color.  Their experience living and working in a racist and sexist 
society should be at the center—not the margins—of independent media’s voice 
for social change.  The current campaigns against racial profiling and 
prison building featured in independent media are positive steps in that 
direction.  There is room for improvement.

<p>Without question, independent media has many challenges.  One is that it’s 
not quite awash in money, battling hostile corporate mergers and 
acquisitions.  On one hand, there is no pressure from Ford and General 
Motors to weaken independent media’s contents.  On the other, the 
independence from corporate ads means that the money to produce and 
distribute independent media must come from the general public.  But the 
bottom line is that independent media is able to put news and views out that 
the mainstream can’t for business reasons, and more.

<p>In Manufacturing Consent, Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky use case studies to 
detail how the mainstream media passes through and is shaped by five 
filters.  According to Herman and Chomsky, there are five filters in the 
mainstream: sourcing, ownership, advertising, flak and anti-communist 
ideology.  These filters make up their “propaganda model,” a framework for 
analyzing and understanding mainstream media’s performance.

<p>Here’s more on one of Herman and Chomsky’s mainstream filters. Official 
sources.  They are political representatives and business leaders with power 
and wealth.  California Governor Gray Davis. President George W. Bush.  Bill 
Gates.  Mainstream news relies on them.

<p>By contrast, independent media relies on unofficial sources.  They don’t 
have  power and wealth, just news and information about life as it’s lived 
by those with little or no access to the mainstream.  Energy expert Daniel 
M. Berman.  Prison writer Mumia Abu-Jamal.  Author and professor Martha E. 
Gimenez.

<p>People who create independent media understand that “who tells the story” 
counts, in the words of performance artist Keith Antar Mason at this year’s 
Project Censored Award Ceremony.

<p>People are born curious about the world around them.  Despite the shadow 
cast on them by the “corporate run and propaganda-run society” that Chomsky 
analyzes so well, people’s natural desire to learn and speak for themselves 
remains alive.  The American people don’t choose to be propagandized.  
Independent media is a case in point.

<p>At the recent Press Freedom event, I talked with a man from Vallejo, 
California about starting an independent paper there.  Some 400,000 people 
live in Vallejo, he said, and they need independent news and views.  He’s 
right.

<p>I also met a woman from Detroit who co-produces a show called “Flush Rush” 
on the radio and Internet <www.ieaamericaradio.com>, thanks to funding by 
the United Auto Workers.  Other independent media people on hand were the 
producers of Eat The State!, a community paper based in Seattle, “a forum 
for anti-authoritarian political opinion, research, and humor” 
.

<p>There are, of course, many struggles in the independent media movement.  
Here’s one featured at the Press Freedom event.

<p>The Democratic Media Legal Project (DMLP) is challenging corporate control 
of the media by the Big Six: AOL Time Warner, Disney-ABC, GE-NBC, 
Viacom-CBS-Westinghouse, Bertelsman and Murdoch’s News Corp-Fox.  Henry 
Kroll heads up the San Francisco-based DMLP .  He told me 
that the goal of the DMLP is to open a legal fight with a popular movement 
similar to the legal battle against racial segregation in alliance with the 
Civil Rights movement.

<p>We weaken alone or strengthen together.  You, the supporters of independent 
media, are us.  And we are you.  Onward.
