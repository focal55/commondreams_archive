It is not easy to be good. It usually requires time, money, effort, patience, kindness or other qualities in sporadic supply. So here is a chance to be good at absolutely no cost to yourself in time or money - easy virtue just one quick phone call away. 
<P>Greenpeace has joined up with npower to launch Juice, a new, green electricity supply that for the first time costs exactly the same as ordinary electricity supplies. Juice is building new wind power. Not only is the price for the first time competitive, but the more subscribers sign up, the more new wind power stations will be built by npower. (Other green suppliers use existing old hydro-electric stations, with no promise to build more.) The first new 30-turbine wind power station is planned for a site off the north Wales coast, providing electricity for the first 50,000 subscribers. It will be four miles off-shore, inaudible and virtually invisible. Until it is built, subscribers will get green supplies from existing renewable sources. Once more than 50,000 sign up, another site will be developed, and so on. Phone 0800 316 2610 or click to <A HREF="http://www.npower.com/juice" TARGET="_new">www.npower.com/juice</A> for instant connection - and instant moral satisfaction, with no cost and no sweat. (They do the change-over from your present supplier.)  
<P>This is the first time Greenpeace has endorsed a commercial enterprise - answering critics who accuse them of perpetual negativity. There is something refreshingly counter-intuitive about   green campaigners lobbying for an energy supplier (they are not being paid or taking any profits). Interestingly, npower - a big commercial player - is marketing Juice as "clean" energy as they think the word "green" has faintly suspect connotations with non-ideological customers. So far the market for green power is pathetically small - just 18,000 subscribers. But now there is absolutely no excuse why anyone who has ever had a green thought should not convert to Juice today. Spread the word - ask what power family, friends, colleagues and neighbors use.  
<P>The government has been slow and mean on promoting green energy. While German and Danish wind turbine industries soar ahead with government start-up grants, there is a real danger Britain will lose out on this major new industry. Greenpeace wants to see demand for Juice force the government's hand. With an official target of producing 10% of energy from renewable sources by 2010, so far the government has reached only 2.8%, paying out just &#163;250m over three years to subsidize all renewables. At least &#163;100m a year is needed for wind alone, to lay down cables linking distant wind sites to the national grid. Much more is needed to get solar energy off the ground, to create a big enough market to bring down the cost of solar panels - another gigantic future industry other governments are stealing from under our noses.  
<P>One problem for wind power has been strong resistance to giving planning permission for wind farms - even far offshore But Greenpeace backing for npower is designed to defuse local protests. Recently planning permission was about to be granted on one offshore site when a rare hen harrier was spotted and the scheme dropped for "environmental" reasons. Greenpeace points out that the hen harrier is as much at risk from global warming as the rest of us without renewable energy supplies. By signing up in great numbers, subscribers will demonstrate public support for wind power.  
<P>Inertia is the only enemy here. How easy it is to harp on about the government's failings and iniquities without considering what each of us could do. There tends to be a sinking of the heart at the thought of "doing good". Will it mean long meetings in dusty parish halls? Does it mean giving up scarce time in this increasingly over-worked country? Abandoning the car? Converting to tofu? Certain Guardian diehards like to write in and boast how they manage on tuppence ha'penny a week, grow their own organics, bicycle everywhere, bring up four children on real nappies, bake their own bread and never owned   a television. Alas, such virtue puts off ordinary people from considering the small but easy good they could do without inordinate lifestyle changes. But volunteering is better still (Community Service Volunteers <A HREF="http://www.csv.org.uk" TARGET="_new">www.csv.org.uk).</A> If tax for the high paid feels too low, consider paying a tax-free tithe to charities of your choice (Charities Aid Foundation). But why do so few people opt for effortless virtue near at hand?  
<P>Most supermarkets stock some of 70 Fair Trade brands of coffee, tea, chocolate, bananas, sugar, honey or orange juice: the Co-op, Waitrose and Sainsbury's stock the most. The Fair Trade kite mark guarantees poor farmers are not exploited by global corporations and farm workers are not oppressed by near slave conditions. Excellent Fair Trade products now cost the same as other quality goods; 68% of people profess to support Fair Trade principles, so why is only 1% of the coffee purchased Fair Trade? True, most supermarkets tuck it away, but it is not much trouble to bend down to a lower shelf for good high roast, or eschew the Nescaf&eacute; instant for Caf&eacute;direct. Only the poorest have any excuse for not choosing Fair Trade now.  
<P>Why do green Ecover washing and washing-up products still command less than 1% of the market? Plant-based instead of petrochemical-based, they do far less harm to the environment and cost the same as mid-market deter gents, while working just as well. It is quite easy not to buy a rug without the RugMark kite, guaranteeing it has not been made by children or other exploited workers. It is easy not buy peat bags from garden centers, or garden furniture without the Forest Stewardship Council mark, ensuring it is made from renewable forests. It would save &#163;50-&#163;100 a year in electricity to turn off the television and video instead of leaving them on stand-by. Recycled paper is just fine and cheaper than Andrex. How easy to put a brick in the lavatory cistern to save water.  
<P>With only a little more bother, in one phone call  you can move your bank account out of the big five monsters into the Co-op bank. (They will shift all direct debits.) The Co-op offers sensible ethical investment (no to animal testing for cosmetics, yes to animal testing for medicines) and its profits are recycled into better rates. In surveys it has the most contented staff and customers who can use the internet, Link machines or any post office to pay money in or out. So why does it have just 3% of the banking market?  
<P>All these things are dead easy - just a simple shopping choice. So why not? Many more people profess to care than can be bothered to make even these minimal changes. Next time anyone grumbles about what the government has or hasn't done on the green and ethical front, just ask what small things this citizen has done first.
