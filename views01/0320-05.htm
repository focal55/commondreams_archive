Many Americans have seen the digital dream of global 
communications vividly expressed on TV commercials for Cisco Systems. Eager 
to promote its theme of "empowering the Internet generation," the giant 
high-tech firm paid for a lot of lovely ads with adorable children from 
different countries asking: "Are you ready?"

<p>By now, we understand that our response is supposed to be -- must 
be -- affirmative. But our best answer may be a question: "Ready for what?"

<p>History tells cautionary tales. After the first rudimentary 
telegraph went into operation 207 years ago in Europe, media analyst Armand 
Mattelart says, "long-distance communication technology was promoted as a 
guarantee of the revival of democracy." During the next several decades, a 
powerful concept took hold -- "the ideology of redemption through networks."

<p>In his book "Networking the World, 1794-2000," Mattelart points to 
assumptions that have spanned continents and centuries. "Each technological 
generation provided a new opportunity to propagate the grand narratives of 
general concord and social reconciliation under the aegis of Western 
civilization." Whether the instruments of unprecedented change were 
railroads, undersea cables or electric patents, promoters spoke of wondrous 
horizons. But the gaps were huge between "promises for a better world due 
to technology" and "the reality of struggles for control of communication 
devices." Elites routinely won those struggles.

<p>In our own time, technology has often appeared to offer the means 
for global solutions. "At the end of the 1970s, the nation-state was being 
attacked on two fronts: it was accused of being too large to solve small 
problems of human existence and too small to solve big ones.... As a way 
out of this dual impasse, information and communication networks had become 
the panacea."

<p>But hucksterism kept tightening its grip: "Advertising, which 
initially seemed little more than a modernized sales technique, gradually 
became the vector of the commercialization of the entire mode of 
communication and, as such, a key feature of the public sphere," Mattelart 
writes. These days, it's a facile corporate feat to conflate democratic 
decision-making with global shopping. "The advertising industry strives to 
construct vast transnational communities of consumers who all share the 
same 'socio-styles,' forms of consumption, and cultural practices."

<p>Today, we hear the latest versions of what Mattelart calls 
"messianic discourses about the democratic virtues of technology." Serving 
as smoke screens for inordinate privilege and consolidated power, such 
rhetorical exercises commonly tout "globalization" -- corporate 
globalization -- as an obvious common-sense way of stimulating prosperity 
and encouraging democracy. "The idea has taken root in free trade rhetoric 
that the spread of products of the entertainment industry automatically 
leads to civil and political freedom, as if the status of the consumer were 
equivalent to that of the citizen."

<p>Mattelart notes "the rapidity with which Asian and Latin American 
countries have adapted to digital technology and the advantage they have 
taken of it." But there's a grim flip side. "We cannot deny, however, that 
these new sources of modernity coexist -- as the second side of the coin -- 
with a galloping process of impoverishment and exclusion of large sections 
of the population."

<p>Translated from French and published in the United States last 
year, Mattelart's book challenges the prevalent, cloying hype about 
Internet globalism. The Paris-based scholar is on target: "Only a 
mediacentric view of society can delude people into believing that a 
planetary perspective can be reduced to being exposed to foreign brands and 
trans-boundary information, programs and servers. Connection with the world 
is also, and above all, a matter of experience."

<p>But authentic experience is far from the synthetic variety 
supplied by most global media, flowing through certain ruts that we're 
encouraged to mistake for life itself. "Systems for structuring meaning 
through digitization of knowledge underlie a specific geocultural model," 
Mattelart observes. "The risk is that it may impose as a criterion of 
universality a particular mode of thinking and feeling..." At the same 
time, in effect, New Mediaspeak often equates the universal with the 
marketable.

<p>Yet communication from the grassroots, connecting people 
internationally as they strive for free expression and social justice, 
remains a much sought-after goal. Some excellent work is moving in that 
direction. For instance, an innovative website that recently marked its 
first anniversary -- <a href="http://www.MediaChannel.org">www.MediaChannel.org</a> -- is a steady fount of news, 
reports, resources and opinion, "featuring content from over 600 
media-issues groups worldwide." Founded a few months earlier, the globally 
oriented Independent Media Center -- <a href="http://www.indymedia.org">www.indymedia.org</a> -- is a wide-ranging 
entryway to progressive media activism on several continents.

<p>Such creative endeavors are in stark contrast to the products of 
multimedia conglomerates. It's shrewd to spew out humanistic platitudes 
while pursuing rapacious quests for global market share. "Soon, all our 
ideas will be free of borders," a Cisco Systems commercial declares. "Are 
you ready?"
