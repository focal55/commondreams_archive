It's that time of the year again, when 3000 members of the global elite
gather for five days at the remote Swiss Alpine resort of Davos, to
schmooze, make deals, and try to put a human face on globalization for the
press.

<p>Funded by more than 1000 of the world's largest corporations, this year's
meeting of CEO's, political leaders, and academics is aware that not
everyone agrees with their basic premises. Among the items for discussion:
"Addressing the Globalization Backlash."

<p>An honest discussion of this topic might begin by asking why globalization
has failed to deliver the goods-- or services. Among economists, it is well
known that the last two decades of rapidly expanding international trade and
investment have coincided with a sharp slowdown in economic growth. From
1960-1980, the average country had real income growth, per person, of 83
percent.  In the last two decades (1980-2000), this growth was only 33
percent.

<p>In other words, despite all the hand wringing at Davos about "the poor
being left behind in the global economy," it is not just the poor who have
lost out. It is the vast majority of people, in the vast majority of
countries-- including the United States, where the median wage (adjusted for
inflation) is about the same today as it was 27 years ago.

<p>Of course most of the poorer countries have been hit harder. In Africa,
real income per person actually fell by 15 percent over the last two decades
(1980-2000), after increasing by 34 percent in the previous twenty years.
And Latin America saw its growth slow from a 75 percent gain in the first
period to only 7 percent in the second.

<p>It is not difficult to see how globalization might have contributed to this
result. In the previous era, national governments exercised more control
over their economic policies. This enabled them, in many cases, to pursue
economic development strategies that increased the productivity of their own
labor force: through investment in industry, education, or necessary
infrastructure such as power and electricity. Over time, this increasing
productivity laid the basis for higher living standards for the entire
population.

<p>The most rapidly growing economies of the last half-century-- countries
like South Korea or China-- had extensive state planning, industrial
policies, and public investment. They did not succeed in raising living
standards by simply opening their domestic markets to foreign trade and
investment-- as low to middle-income countries are now coerced into doing by
the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade
Organization.
<p>The IMF and the World Bank have been especially damaging in this era of
globalization, since they have developed a cartel for credit in much of the
world. This enables them to impose very destructive economic policies in
dozens of countries.

<p>We need look no further than California to see how reckless de-regulation
in areas of vital infrastructure-- in this case electricity-- can damage an
economy. Multiply this by 50, imagine tens of billions of dollars being
drained out of California to a foreign country, and you get an idea of the
kind of economic harm that the IMF and the Bank can inflict on borrowing
countries.

<p>The leaders at Davos would have us believe that the loss of national
economic sovereignty is an inevitable result of the "global economy," and
represents historical progress. But this is not true.

<p>The whole concept of the "global economy" is actually a gross exaggeration.
More than 80 percent of the world's goods and services are produced for
national or local markets. In the United States, the number is 87 percent,
and our government is not constrained by global markets in deciding its
major economic policies. It has, however, used international commercial
agreements such as NAFTA and the WTO to drive down wages here.

<p>It is not global markets themselves, but global institutions such as the
IMF, World Bank, WTO and the corporations represented at Davos that have--
quite deliberately-- curtailed national economic sovereignty in the era of
globalization. We should not be surprised that the result has been poorer
economic performance, since these institutions are not accountable to any
electorate. This is especially true for lower income and transitional
economies that have been most subjected, in this era, to the dictates of
foreign decision-makers.

<p>Meanwhile, ten thousand of globalization's opponents, representing
non-governmental organizations from throughout the world, are meeting at the
World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil to discuss alternatives to the
Davos agenda. If there is a future for global economic co-operation, this is
where we will find it.
