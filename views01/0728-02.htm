Summer vacation season is in full swing and across the land families
are packing up and hitting the highways along their beepers, fax
machines, mobile phones and laptops. Although across the Atlantic whole
countries shut down when their workers head for the beaches or the
mountains, Americans can't to be out of touch with the office as work
increasingly intrudes on personal and family life.


<p>Whether by choice, design or herd instinct, Americans are far behind
the rest of the world in annual vacation days. Italy leads the world
with 42 days a year. France has 37, Germany 35, Brazil 34, Britain 28,
Canada 26, and South Korea and Japan 25. The U.S. comes in at a paltry
13, according to the World Tourism Organization. But vacation days only
tell part of the story.


<p>Commute hours aside, Americans, particularly those with college degrees
who earn high incomes, are working longer hours. The government Current
Population Study (CPS) reveals that the proportion of Americans who
work more than 50 hours per week increased since 1970 and the annual
hours worked by all employees increased 142 hours since 1973. The
National Survey of the Changing Workforce finds that in 1997, Americans
worked 3.5 hours a week more than they did 20 years ago. Meanwhile
other leading industrial countries are cutting their workweek: People
in European countries typically work 32- to 36-hours a week.


<p>That we are working longer and harder comes as no surprise, but what
we're doing to ourselves? Ten-hour workdays were routine ten years.
Today increasing numbers of people work 12- to 14-hour days, some six
days a week. Add to this commute hours that increased drastically in
the past ten years. Higher paid workers in Silicon Valley may feel it's
worthwhile, especially for the executives of the Valley's largest 150
companies who took in an average of almost $60 million last year.


<p>These higher paid workers follow the "high commitment" work model,
which corporations find a godsend. Such employees place "excellence" in
work at the center of their lives. Meetings begin before 8 AM and last
until after 5 PM. Travel and education demands require them to be away
from home. Punishing schedules to meet deadlines become routine. They
skip lunch, take work home and skip vacations-the Oxford Health Plans
Inc. study found one fourth of all employees don't take all of their
vacation time. Managers encourage and pressure employees by modeling
"high commitment" behavior: They frequently come in early, stay late,
work weekends and skip vacations.


<p>Workers at the other end of the spectrum work just as hard, but with
fewer vacations and less pay. A study by the Harvard School of Public
Health found that working Americans lack vacation time and sick leave.
They can't even take time off when family members need care. Some 63
percent of the working poor lacked paid vacations during part of the
previous 7 years and 28 percent of the working poor have never had paid
vacations. On the pay front, the working poor are even worse off: While
the income of the wealthiest 1 percent grew 157 percent from 1979 to
1997, the lowest-earning 20 percent of Americans saw their income drop
from $10,900 to $10,800.


<p>Experts claim that Americans have to work harder and forego vacations
because we are transitioning from a manufacturing to a service economy
that requires attention 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Additionally, a
booming economy and low unemployment force people to work longer and
harder. Global competition, which brought major upheavals in how U.S.
companies operate, places new demands on our workforce.


<p>Despite these arguments, other countries are going through the same
economic changes and still take time off. What happened to the vacation
in America?


<p>Cindy Aron, author of <italic><i>Working at Play: A History of Vacations
in the U.S.</i>, </italic>claims that Americans have always valued
discipline, sobriety and industry and have a love-hate relationship
with vacations. The hate goes back to our puritanical disdain of
idleness and leisure. Not only do we take few days off, but we are also
driven to accomplish something during our vacations: We must learn,
improve ourselves or accomplish a goal. And we must stay in touch with
work, even when we are away. Capitalism could be another reason:
Americans don't enjoy vacations as a right but as a privilege granted
by their employers.


<p>While people in the rest of the world shake their head in wonder at the
paltry amount of time we take-off from work, many of us will soon be
loading the family into the car and heading to our favorite vacation
spot for a few days. Maybe it's a good thing that the slowing economy
is demanding that we take time off. It could be good for us.
