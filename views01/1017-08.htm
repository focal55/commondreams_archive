Before September 11, South Asia's problems were legion: over a billion
people, most of them desperately poor; a history of war and violent
conflicts; rising religious militancy; hard-line Hindu nationalists in
power in India, the army in charge in Pakistan;  newly tested nuclear
weapons and a get-tough mood. Now, it is also the frontline of the US
war against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. South Asia may not be able
to take the strain. The US needs to ensure it does nothing to worsen the
many crises in South Asia and that it thinks long-term, not short term,
about its policies in the region.  

<p>The greatest concern is Pakistan. General Pervez Musharraf justified the
October 1999 coup that brought him to power by citing the prevailing
sense that Pakistan's economy, government, and society were on the verge
of collapse. The fall has been swift; about one in three Pakistanis now
live below the poverty line, double what it was a decade ago. There have
been eight governments in this time. All of them have become wary of
setting-off the widespread public resentment and anger at the
hopelessness of everyday life. They have struggled to not provide
political opportunities to the radical Islamist groups that have emerged
and feed off the misery. Too often, they chose to make concessions to
radical Islam. The military is in the same fix.     

<p>The US bombing campaign against Afghanistan in response to the terrible
attacks of September 11 has opened wide the door for Islamist groups,
with their history of anti-Americanism and strong ties to the Taliban.
They have taken to the streets challenging Musharraf and his decision to
support the U.S. The longer the U.S. bombs Afghanistan, the more
civilians get killed, the greater the humanitarian and refugee crisis,
and the more organized and angry the Islamists' challenge. Musharraf and
the army may hold the line, but the Islamists will come out politically
strengthened. Musharraf may win this battle but lose the war.    

<p>The US should heed the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and suspend its
bombing campaign to allow relief supplies to reach the more than seven
million Afghans in direst need. Calling in the UN Secretary-General and
newest Nobel Peace Prize winner, Kofi Annan, showing him the evidence
and asking him to mediate with the Taliban for a hand-over of Osama bin
Laden for trial would acknowledge the vital role of the UN. Both would
strengthen the hand of Pakistan's government against the militants. 

<p>Pakistan is also trapped by its conflict with India. Reflecting the
intensity and depth of this battle, India and Pakistan have each sought
to take advantage of the situation after September 11. India immediately
offered political and military support to the United States in its
conflict with the Taliban and urged it to include Pakistani-supported
Islamic militants fighting in Kashmir as targets of the US assault on
terrorism. Pakistan, under enormous pressure from the US, eventually
decided to turn a liability into an asset and sought to cash in on its
location and its leverage over the Taliban. 

<p>Seeing Pakistan win the US over to its side, and with the militants
continuing their attacks in Kashmir, India is now trying another more
dangerous gambit. It has threatened to follow the US example and attack
militant training camps and bases in Pakistan. In an ominous
development, India has ended a 10-month long effective cease-fire and
started shelling Pakistani forces across the border that divides
Kashmir. 

<p>The US must press Pakistan to end its support for the militants,
restrain India from actions that may trigger a South Asian war, and get
serious in working with the international community to resolve the more
than fifty year old Kashmir dispute.  For this effort to be taken
seriously, the US must show by word and deed that unilateral military
action is not the order of the day.             

<p>A longer term danger is that of nuclear weapons in South Asia. The May
1998 nuclear tests by India and Pakistan put the world on watch. The US
and the international community used sanctions to pressure both
countries to exercise restraint, and to signal a refusal to accept new
nuclear weapons states. But, in its search for support in the region,
the Bush administration has let go the already waning US hopes to
reverse the nuclearization of South Asia. The US is lifting all its
sanctions against India, most if not (yet) all sanctions against
Pakistan, and economic and military assistance is being offered to both. 

<p>India and Pakistan may return with renewed vigour to their conventional
and nuclear arms race. India seeks US arms to add to its $4 billion arms
deal with Russia and $2 billion deal with Israel. Pakistan's limited
funds have stalled its military purchases. With the army in charge, any
resources freed by a blanket lifting of sanctions may go to catching up
with India. With political and economic pressures eased, both sides may
speed deployment of their nuclear warheads. South Asia may escape the
frying pan of terrorism only to fall into the nuclear fire.    

<p>Also long term is democracy. General Musharraf's new status as ally in
the war against Afghanistan and the man most likely to hold Pakistan
together may lead to the lifting of the US sanctions levied after his
coup. But, concern about Pakistan's stability should not translate into
abandoning democracy and Musharraf should not be allowed or encouraged
to stay in power. The two previous Pakistani generals who seized power
each kept it for the better part of a decade.  Civil society withered
both times. 

<p>Musharraf should hold to his promise of elections and restoring
democracy by next October. Elections may be just what it takes to
mobilise the majority of Pakistanis in the battle against radical Islam.
Whenever they have been allowed to choose who should govern them in the
past, Pakistanis have decisively rejected Islamic political parties.
They would do so again now. The small crowds on the streets supporting
the Islamist groups are testament to that. Ten years without democracy
may change their minds.
