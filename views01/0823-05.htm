As an African-American law student, I was disturbed, though not surprised, 
by a story in the New York Times showing that the best law firms are not 
granting partnership to many minorities.

<p>While some of the nation's elite law schools recruit as many as 20 percent 
of their students from minority groups, the nation's top law firms choose to 
maintain an old boys' club. Data collected from the 12 highest-grossing 
firms show that in recent years minority attorneys accounted for only 5 
percent of new partners. And the statistics at some firms are even more 
discouraging.

<p>Since 1997, none of the 33 new partners at Sullivan & Cromwell have been 
members of minority groups, the Times reported.

<p>At Weil, Gotshal & Manges, only 3.3 percent of new partners in recent years 
are lawyers of color.
At Shearman & Sterling, only 2.6 percent of new partners are lawyers of 
color, with one new partner of color out of 17 this year and none in the 
previous two years.

<p>Some lawyers blame these dismal statistics on the lack of mentors for 
lawyers of color.

<p>Without close relationships with senior attorneys, the best work "is given 
to those people whom the partner likes most," said Angel G. Gomez, the new 
president of the Hispanic National Bar Association. "Who's that going to be? 
That's going to be the individual who went to their alma mater, the 
individual who comes from their hometown." Gomez resigned as the only 
Hispanic partner of a Chicago law firm to help start a new law practice.

<p>Others note that it takes up to eight years for a lawyer to become partner 
in many firms. Many junior attorneys of color, seeing the glass ceiling and 
no opportunity for advancement, choose not to bang their heads against it.

<p>Theodore V. Wells Jr., co-chairman of litigation at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, 
Wharton & Garrison in New York, said he finds the statistics depressing. "It 
has taken us almost 15 years to get to the point where most large firms now 
have one African-American partner," he said.

<p>Meanwhile, to make matters worse, the number of students of color graduating 
from law school has decreased after 15 years of steady growth, according to 
the American Bar Association. Last year, 7,391 students of color received 
law degrees, 19.4 percent of all graduates, as compared to a 1998 high of 
7,751, or 19.6 percent. And the number of minority summer interns fell 10 
percent this year, according to the National Association for Law Placement. 
Summer internships are an important tool used by firms to recruit new 
lawyers.

<p>This summer, some of my classmates expressed their frustration working at 
corporate law firms. Some classmates spoke of racial insensitivity on the 
part of white attorneys who seemingly have little experience dealing with 
people of color in a professional setting. Others learned of the many 
African-American attorneys who could not cope with a hostile racial 
environment and dwindling career prospects in their firm and left for the 
nonprofit sector.

<p>But there is a glimmer of hope. Last year, 13 percent of associates at law 
firms were people of color, up from 8 percent in 1993, according to the New 
York Times. Bar associations in New York City and Columbus, Ohio, are 
responding to the problem by taking measures to increase the number of 
lawyers of color. Law firms in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami and San 
Francisco have done a much better job of maintaining diversity in their 
ranks through aggressive recruiting efforts.

<p>Nevertheless, the recent survey should serve as an embarrassment to the 
legal profession. Diversity is the future of America, and the nation's law 
firms should follow suit.
