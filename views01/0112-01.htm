Hey, kids, what time is it? It's inauguration time!

         <p>By accident of history, the guy in the starring role bears a 
passing resemblance to Howdy Doody. What's more, his V.P. partner could 
evoke memories of Phineas T. Bluster.

         <p>But the incoming president is no dummy -- and pundits who cast 
aspersions on his intelligence are missing the point. Even a puppet needs 
some smarts! And to a great extent, you can judge a marionette by the 
company he keeps.

         <p>This one has some very wily pals. They ooze with money, flex their 
corporate muscles, and exude certainty about how to call the shots for the 
nation's grandest institutions. Yet they've been scrambling to overcome 
some unusual barriers to authoritative control over the executive branch.

         <p>Now, it turns out that George W. Bush lost the nationwide popular 
vote by an even wider margin than had been reported. The final certified 
results: Al Gore received 539,947 more votes than Bush did.

         <p>The degree to which Bush can succeed at flaunting himself as the 
people's choice will largely depend on the dynamics of media coverage and 
the behavior of Democrats on Capitol Hill. Right now, for the most part, 
those Democrats seem inclined to let bygones be bygones -- signaling to 
journalists that they may as well do the same.

         <p>But shrugging off recent electoral history requires downplaying 
the series of key events that ended with five members of the U.S. Supreme 
Court handing the presidency to Bush. One of the questions blowing in the 
wind: Does it matter that many thousands of African-American voters did not 
get their ballots counted in Florida?

         <p>Not much -- according to all 50 Democrats in the Senate. If even 
one senator had joined with members of the Congressional Black Caucus and 
others in the House who challenged Florida's 25 electoral votes, the issue 
would have been legally forced into the open for debate. But when push came 
to shove at the end of the first week of January, not a single such senator 
could be found.

         <p>By opting for convenient amnesia over obstinate memory, every 
person in the Senate avoided the risk of widespread media derision. After 
all, the conventional wisdom is that the national political spotlight has 
moved on. It's time to hail the next chief, the triumphant runner-up.

         <p>Because of the sustained uproar and bitterness that punctuated so 
much of what's usually a placid time in American presidential politics -- 
the stretch between Election Day and Inauguration Day -- the ceremonies in 
Washington on Jan. 20 probably take on added importance. Orchestration is 
the name of the media game: Each new administration works closely with many 
journalists to generate plenty of momentous salutes and hosannas.

         <p>Typically, at the start of a new presidency, the leaders of the 
major party that failed to win the White House feel that it's necessary to 
make an obsequious show of burying the hatchet. Hyperboles are common as 
politicians say things like "he is president of all the people" and "all 
Americans support our new president and wish him well."

         <p>We can now expect a deluge of such laughable assertions -- not 
only from leading lights of the Republican and Democratic parties but also 
from a remarkable number of journalists who feel compelled to echo that 
kind of prattle.

         <p>"Journalism," a modern cliche tells us, "is the first draft of 
history." But for most politicians, it's the draft that clearly matters 
most. Wielding power is about the here and now. What Americans read, hear 
and watch every day shapes the media terrain through which a president 
walks. Historians wait their turn.

         <p>Presidents are fond of equating their power with benevolent 
leadership. When news outlets buy into that equation, they lavish adulation 
on a president simply -- in effect -- for being president. In the process, 
they substitute mythology for journalism.

         <p>Despite the upbeat inaugural stories, underlying realities are apt 
to be quite grim. "There is no necessary connection between the desire to 
lead and the ability to lead, and even less to the ability to lead 
somewhere that will be to the advantage of the led," the American writer 
Bergen Evans observed a half-century ago. He added: "Leadership is more 
likely to be assumed by the aggressive than by the able, and those who 
scramble to the top are more often motivated by their own inner torments 
than by any demand for their guidance."

Highly Deceptive Media."</i>
