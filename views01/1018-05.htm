GEORGE W. BUSH posed for photographs the other day with a group of schoolchildren in Washington, D.C.
<p> Each child proudly held up a single dollar bill, which the president had asked them to donate to a fund for the suffering children of Afghanistan.
<p> "One way to fight evil is to fight it with kindness, and love and compassion," the president told them, "and what an amazing contrast it is for our children to help children in need in Afghanistan."
<p> The children looked happy. The president sounded pleased. And only five days after Bush announced the creation of America's Fund for Afghan Children, the White House had received 90,000 letters from the children of America.
<p> It's a nice idea, a lesson in being good citizens in the world. Our country's at war, and here's a way to involve American children in the humanitarian effort the United States is also conducting in Afghanistan. So why did I get a queasy feeling when I watched this on television and when I first heard the president call for a children's fund last week? 
<p> He announced it at the end of a speech about our military campaign in Afghanistan, and he said the fund, to be administered by the American Red Cross, would be used to provide food and medical help to Afghan children.
<p> When I talked to spokespeople for the American Red Cross the next day, however, they didn't know any more about the fund than we'd heard on television the night before. For details, I'd have to talk to the White House, they said. But an inquiry at the White House produced few details about how the program will work.
<p> I got the impression that the fund was a last-minute addition to the president's speech, as in "won't this add a nice touch, because it will show that, even though we're in the process of bombing another country, Americans are decent people."
<p> I get nervous when public officials trot out the children. What president whose country is involved in a dicey war, what mayor whose approval rating is down doesn't look good when flanked by a group of earnest and trusting kids?
<p> The children's fund is pure public relations. Yes, it could make children feel they're contributing to the war effort, help allay their fears and bolster their confidence in their government. I just hate to see children used this way.
<p> It reminds me of how my generation was co-opted by the rhetoric of the Cold War. All those civil-defense drills, where kids learned to crouch under their desks in the event of a nuclear attack, would have been useless in a real war. They were primarily a way of rallying us and our parents behind the idea that the Soviet Union was evil and was out to get us.
<p> My sixth-grade teacher filled our heads with terrible thoughts about the Communists. And the high school oratorical contest that I won when I was 15 had as its theme "communism and its threat to the free world."
<p> We embraced the war against communism. Only decades later did we learn that the evil empire was a third-world country that could barely feed its own citizens, much less take over the world; that hundreds of decent Americans had been ruined because they'd had some real or imagined connection to the Communist Party; and that one result of America's war on communism was our support of despotic regimes around the world.
<p> We believed what adults told us, unaware that the Cold War was in part a fiction that served the ambitions of presidents, senators and generals.
<p> The war we're fighting now, against terrorism, is legitimate. Dangerous people who hate the United States are trying to kill us. We have no choice but to root them out, destroy them where they are and enlist the help of the rest of the world in this struggle.
<p>
 It's just that I've learned to mistrust what the government says are its goals - in Vietnam, Grenada and Iraq, for example. And I can't help wondering what these children will learn about this war, years from now, long after we've taken their dollars.
