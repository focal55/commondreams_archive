To sign-on to the statement, please send an e-mail mentioning organization and country to: <a href="mailto:ceo@xs4all.nl">ceo@xs4all.nl</a> To be part of the list of sign-ons from the start of the Bonn summit, we need your response before Monday July 16th. Later responses are also very welcome, as we will release an updated list in the second week of the conference. </i>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current attempts to entice 
            the US government to recommit to the Kyoto Protocol are likely to 
            further accelerate the corruption of the Treaty. To save the Kyoto 
            Protocol, talks should urgently shift focus from the current market 
            mania, to discussing effective and fair solutions to climate change, 
            beginning with domestic reductions of greenhouse gas emissions by 
            the industrialized countries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At last November's UN climate 
            summit in The Hague (COP-6), Northern governments and corporations 
            were only inches away from being allowed to 'fulfill' their reduction 
            commitments through various inventive but seriously flawed market-based 
            ('flexible') instruments. This included creating global emissions 
            markets, encouraging a scientifically dubious trade in 'carbon sinks' 
            (carbon absorption via trees, wood products and soil) for emissions, 
            and the promotion of nuclear energy. These escape clauses would have 
            allowed the industrialized countries to significantly increase their 
            emissions (instead of reducing them by the average 5.2% as agreed 
            upon in Kyoto).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The debate since COP-6 
            has revolved around the US government's open rejection of the Kyoto 
            Protocol. Other governments are so eager to placate the US in order 
            to get them back on board that they appear ready to compromise the 
            Protocol's environmental, social and moral integrity. Therefore, there 
            is a real risk that the UN climate summit in Bonn (COP 6, part 2) 
            will result in an entirely corrupted treaty that would unleash a global 
            market in fraudulent emissions credits and do nothing to help stabilize 
            the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many corporate ventures 
            that might become eligible for emissions credits - nuclear power plants, 
            so-called 'clean coal' plants as well as industrial agriculture and 
            large-scale tree plantations (including genetically engineered varieties) 
            - have extremely serious negative social and environmental impacts. 
            Investments in 'carbon sinks' (such as large-scale tree plantations) 
            in the South would result in land being used at the expense of local 
            people, accelerate deforestation, deplete water resources and increase 
            poverty. Entitling the North to buy cheap emission credits from the 
            South, through projects of an often exploitative nature, constitutes 
            'carbon colonialism'. Industrialized countries and their corporations 
            will harvest the `low-hanging fruit&acute; (the cheapest credits), 
            saddling Southern countries with only expensive options for any future 
            reduction commitments they might be required to make.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Carbon credits are envisioned 
            to be sold through a global emissions market, a concept that suffers 
            from fundamental flaws. Firstly, allowing immediate trade in emissions 
            permits (carbon credits) in effect means granting unequal private 
            property rights to the atmosphere. This system of property rights 
            would consolidate the historic overuse by Northern industry at the 
            expense of the South (80% of all CO2 emitted since 1850 has come from 
            the North). A market without clearly defined property rights can never 
            function and the unfair property rights that underlie the currently 
            proposed emissions markets will eventually be rejected by those losing 

            out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, the proposed 
            emissions markets lack a workable accounting system, another essential 
            element of a functioning market. A market which assumes that emissions 
            cuts are climatically equivalent to planting trees, constructing new 
            'clean coal' plants or engaging in other pseudo-solutions, is deeply 
            flawed. Global carbon stocks and flows cannot be quantified in the 
            way such a market requires. Unverifiable emissions credits would flood 
            the market, turning the trading system into a farce. The net effect 
            would be to subsidize greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbate the 
            climate crisis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fact that the property 
            rights issue is unresolved and deeply contentious and that the proposed 
            accounting system is fraudulent, should be sufficient reason to call 
            off the launch of global trade in emissions credits. Attempting to 
            regulate (for instance with 'caps' or trying to close 'loopholes') 
            a market with such fundamental flaws is bound to fail. If unleashed 
            now, the multibillion-dollar global emissions markets would develop 
            their own disastrous dynamic. Given the bias towards corporate interests 
            by neoliberal governments and international institutions, once these 
            markets have been allowed to operate and expand, it will be virtually 
            impossible to close off the lucrative trade in fraudulent emissions 
            credits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The North has a moral obligation 
            to make the deepest cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, instead of using 
            the South as a carbon dump. In particular, transnational corporations 
            and international financial institutions must be held accountable 
            for their central role in fueling the climate crisis. Reducing fossil 
            fuel use, which ultimately means keeping fossil fuels in the ground, 
            is the only effective way to avoid escalating climate change.</font></p>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We demand that industrialized
