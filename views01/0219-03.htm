            For Native Americans and environmentalists, the appointment of Gale 
            Norton as interior secretary raises serious concerns.
<P>

   As chief steward of more than 500 million acres of public land, including all national parks, national monuments, wildlife refuges, the Bureau of Land Management, the Office of Surface Mining and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, she has enormous power over these treasures. She is also in charge of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which means she will affect the lives of 540 tribes and millions of Native Americans.
            <P> Her record leaves a lot to be desired. While much of her record 
              against environmental regulation was aired during the confirmation 
              process, not some much of her record regarding Native Americans 
              has been covered in the mainstream press.
            <P>

   She has displayed antipathy toward indigenous people.<P>

   Norton cut her teeth under the mentorship of President Ronald Reagan's first interior secretary, James Watt, known for his anti-environmental positions and hostility toward Indian tribes. Norton's first law job was at Watt's Mountain States Legal Foundation in 1979, and she served a stint at the Department of the Interior under Watt.<P>

   Suzan Shown Harjo, president of the Morning Star Institute in Washington, notes that Watt and his Mountain States Legal Foundation are ``devoted to the abolition of Indian treaties and sovereign tribal rights.''<P>

   ``Mountain States was founded in very large part to counter gains made by Indians in the courts, in Congress and in the Nixon and Ford administrations,'' Harjo wrote in a recent article in Indian Country Today.<P>

   Norton submitted an amicus brief in 1998 arguing that Alaska Native lands aren't subject to tribal self-governance as part of federal ``Indian country.'' As attorney general, Norton sided with states over tribes in gaming issues, while allowing the proliferation of several dozen non-Indian casinos in her home state.<P>

   Norton also submitted an amicus brief in 1992 supporting the ability of counties to tax private lands within Indian reservations. She submitted a brief in 1998 supporting a state's right to allow taxation of any alienable lands (land capable of being transferred to a new owner) held by a tribe and not just those lands that were held as taxable by express intent of Congress.<P>

   Norton also proposed the abolishing of hunting and fishing rights of some tribes. For example, in 1995 in court she advocated the repealing of the Crow Tribe's hunting and fishing rights in the Big Horn National Forest in Wyoming. She argued that these rights became null and void when Wyoming attained statehood.
            <P> For good reason, tribal nations and environmentalists fear that 
              the Norton appointment is the equivalent of putting timber-wolf 
              preservation in the hands of ranchers. <SNML_TAGLINE>
