NOT LONG ago a woman called to give me hell for a column criticizing the 
excesses of a free-market economy. "Maybe you should take a vacation," she 
began, "or go back to writing sports." Whatever the choice, any change would 
be welcome because "I am sick to death of you wagging your finger and telling 
us what bad, bad people we are. You are so unhappy."
<P>Since the woman didn't leave her name or number, I couldn't call her back 
to tell her that her assumption was only half-right. Personally, it has been 
decades since I've been as strife-free or sleeping as peacefully as I am of 
late. But as a citizen of this city, country and world, I stand guilty as 
charged: I am unhappy.
<P>My melancholy is the byproduct of living in a society that preaches a great 
game of individual worth and Christian or "family" values but which -- 
evidence abounds -- practices a far different philosophy. When we turn down 
the sound on the TV show that is "The United States 2001," and simply describe 
the action, what do we see? Basically a nation of 270 million people who -- 
whether they like it or not -- adhere to a predominant ethos.
<P>No, not "In God We Trust."
<P>More like, "There's no such thing as enough."
<P>Or, as Susan Sontag put it this month during a City Arts and Lectures 
appearance at Zellerbach Theater in Berkeley:
<P>"There is this amazing hegemony of business values, of the values of making 
money, of the commercial civilization." The result? Ours is now "a society 
which is entirely devoted to and sanctifying of the making of money."
<P>Americans have long put down other nations' aristocracies or ruling 
bloodlines. Why is the amassing of money, and the conspicuous consumption that 
tends to accompany it, a nobler standard? Why is a six-or-seven-figure salary 
a better gauge of a person's intrinsic worth than who his great-great-great 
granddaddy was or what large chunk of real estate the family once called home?
<P>Don't tell me that, here, it's all about "hard work."
<P>I can start on the first page of my address book and find a dozen people 
who work 50 times harder than Dick Cheney or Paul O'Neill ever thought of 
working -- and I wouldn't even get to the M's. But none of those folks began 
this year with financial assets of about $60 million, as did Treasury 
Secretary Paul O'Neill. Nor did any of them rake in $21.8 million during the 
last decade, as did the vice president-select (or kick in a puny $209,832 to 
charity in the same period).
<P>Then again, none of the people I know managed to snare over five years $3.8 
billion in federal contracts and taxpayer-backed loans as Cheney did for his 
pre-White House employer, Halliburton oil.
<P>No, it is not about hard work. It is now, more than ever in our history, 
about what the market will bear. And let me tell you, the market will bear an 
infinite number of atrocities and injustices, an immeasurable amount of 
degradation and deprivation.
<P>Because the market has no moral center, it can bear 1 out of 5 U.S. 
children living in poverty, about the same number growing up malnourished, and 
more than 15 percent having no health coverage.
<P>It can bear national and state lawmakers counting beans on the backs of 4-
year-olds in need of programs such as Project Head Start. It can bear those 
same lawmakers responding to the national health crisis that is drug addiction 
by building more prisons than we can staff then lowering the age limit for 
prison guards as well as the age at which we can prosecute children as adults.
<P>The market also can bear the pernicious, contradictory tension in which 
millions of U.S. women must operate. Told that quality, nurturing parenthood 
is the only acceptable standard, women also know their labor outside the home 
is crucial to keeping the economy "healthy." So is their unpaid labor when 
they get home and start nurturing.
<P>And let us not even go off-shore to see what the market will bear there. 
Suffice to say, it will bear millions of Africans dying of AIDS for want of 
affordable medicines, and men, women and children in other developing nations 
working in conditions that often make the term "sweatshop" a warm and fuzzy 
euphemism.
<P>I remember reading somewhere that what saves capitalism from ultimately 
running out of control and cannibalizing its consumer core is the collective 
understanding that profits must be used for more than reinvestment, growth and 
expansion; a substantial proportion must be committed to the health and 
perpetuation of the community as a whole.
<P>Today, that is one thing the market seems unable to bear. Doesn't that make 
you unhappy?
