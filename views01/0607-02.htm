Back before the dot-com bubble burst, it was
common for otherwise educated people to be
intoxicated with the spirits of a "new economy,"
where the old constraints -- including laws of gravity
-- no longer applied. The vaporization of a few trillion
dollars in the NASDAQ helped to shake a lot of
people out of their stupor.

<p>Now it seems that another defining feature of
the alleged new economy -- "the productivity
revolution" -- may have been as much a mirage as the
wealth of Priceline.com or E-toys at their peak stock
valuation. This week the Labor Department
announced that productivity declined by 1.2 percent
in the first quarter, its sharpest drop in more than
seven years.

<p>Since most people aren't exactly sure what
productivity is or why it is so important, some
explanation: productivity is most commonly
measured as output (of goods or services, for
example) per unit of labor. In English, this means that
if we can produce twice as many shoes with the same
amount of labor time, we have doubled productivity.

<p>Increasing productivity is the main reason,
other than advances in public health and medicine,
that most peoples' standard of living today is higher
than that of their grandparents (notice I didn't say
parents -- back to that in a moment).

<p>For reasons still largely unexplained by
economists, productivity in the US economy grew
much more slowly after 1973 than it did during the
first half of the post-World-War II era. But from
1995-2000, it grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, as
compared to an average of 1.4 percent in the previous
two decades.

<p>To believers in the "new economy," this was
the payoff finally arriving from the large investments
that had been made in new technologies, including
computers, software, and the Internet. Most
importantly to investors, this upsurge in productivity -
- and the seemingly enormous potential of the new
technologies to add to this trend -- formed the basis
for the "irrational exuberance" of the stock market. If
the productivity of the high-tech sector was going to
fuel the (much faster) growth of the future, then the
future profits of all these future Microsofts justified
their fantastic stock prices.

<p>Of course, most investors never bothered to
check this new-found faith against some basic
arithmetic.  The latter would have showed them that
even under "new-economy" assumptions about
productivity, the average stock was (and still is)
enormously overpriced.

<p>But the difference between 2.8 versus 1.4
percent productivity growth is still big; it is the
difference between a nation doubling its income per
worker over 25 rather than 50 years. So the question
is: do we have a new economy, based on new forms
of technology and organization, that will generate
higher productivity growth?

<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
was among those who seemed to accept that we do. In
the last few months, he has noted the continued
growth of productivity during the current slowdown
as evidence for this theory. But the latest numbers tell
a very different story: declining productivity and mass
layoffs are the classic accompaniments of an old-style
economic slowdown.

<p>How, then, to explain the longest
uninterrupted economic expansion in American
history, in the 1990s? There were two new things
about the economy, although neither was
unprecedented. The most obvious was the biggest
speculative stock market bubble since the 1920s,
which fueled the consumption of upper income
households.

<p>The second, and more important change was
the Fed's interest rate policy. Prior to 1996, the Fed
believed that unemployment could not fall below 6
percent without igniting a spiral of inflation. The Fed
would therefore raise interest rates, in order to slow
the economy and increase unemployment, when
unemployment fell below six percent. The Fed's
decision to abandon this theory allowed the
unemployment rate to fall to below 4 percent -- a
level unseen since the 1960s -- and the expansion to
continue beyond the point at which the Fed would
normally have pulled the plug.

<p>But what's really new and different about
today's economy is actually getting kind of old. Over
the past 27 years, the majority of the US labor force
has failed to share in the gains from economic
growth. In other words, the median real wage today is
about the same as it was 27 years ago, despite the fact
that our economy now generates about $34,000 more
income for every person in the labor force.

<p>This would surely be a scandal if the media
were to focus on it, and most people would see our
most urgent economic priority as restoring the
conditions under which a rising tide can lift all boats.
Then we could celebrate the dawn of a "new
economy."
