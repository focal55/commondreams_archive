It was a remarkable comment that passed without notice. After 
interviewing the new White House chief of staff, a network anchor bade him 
farewell. "All right, Andy Card," said CNN's Judy Woodruff, "we look 
forward to working with you, to covering your administration."

         <p>If major news outlets were committed to independent journalism, 
Woodruff's statement on national television Jan.19 would have caused quite 
a media stir -- as a sign of undue coziness with power brokers in 
Washington. But it was far from conspicuous.

         <p>Woodruff's remark was matter-of-fact. Warm collaboration is 
routine. Many reporters work closely with each new crew of top government 
officials.

        <p> Leading journalists and spinners in high places are accustomed to 
mutual reliance. That's good for professional advancement. But the public's 
right to know is another matter.

         <p>"The first fact of American journalism is its overwhelming 
dependence on sources, mostly official, usually powerful," Walter Karp 
pointed out in Harper's Magazine a dozen years ago. Since then, the problem 
has grown even more acute. A multitude of journalists advance their careers 
by (in Woodruff's words) "working with" movers and shakers in government.

        <p>Reporters with outsized reputations for investigative vigor -- Bob 
Woodward, for example -- may be the most compromised. Behind the scenes, 
the tacitly understood tradeoffs amount to quid pro quos. Officials 
dispense leaks to reporters with track records of proven willingness to 
stay within bounds.

         <p>"It is a bitter irony of source journalism," Karp observed, "that 
the most esteemed journalists are precisely the most servile. For it is by 
making themselves useful to the powerful that they gain access to the 
'best' sources."

         <p>While some fine journalism, assertive and carefully researched, 
gets into print and onto airwaves every day, the islands of such reporting 
are drowned in oceans of glorified leaks and institutional handouts. But 
democracy is only served when journalists keep searching for information 
that officials hide.

         <p>On the surface, concerns about scant separation of press and state 
might seem to be misplaced. After all, don't we see network correspondents 
firing tough questions at politicians? Isn't the press filled with 
criticism of policymakers?

         <p>Well, kind of. We're encouraged to confuse partisan wrangles with 
ample debate, or -- in the case of certain TV shows -- high decibels with 
wide diversity. To a great extent, mainstream media outlets provide big 
megaphones for those who already have plenty of clout. That suits wealthy 
owners and large advertisers. But what about democratic discourse?

         <p>In general, news coverage of political issues is about as varied 
as the array of views propounded by the hierarchies of the Democratic and 
Republican parties. When there's bipartisan agreement on particular topics 
-- such as the wisdom of keeping 2 million Americans behind bars or the 
value of corporate globalization -- the media space for debate tends to be 
very limited. Consensus among major-party leaders has a way of 
circumscribing the mass-media arena.

         <p>With huge conglomerates more enmeshed in media ownership and 
advertising than ever, news operations are under heightened pressure to 
promote corporate outlooks, dovetailing with rightward trends in 
governance. It's true that business has always dominated government 
policymaking. But in recent times, mitigating interests -- often known in 
mediaspeak as "special interests" -- have been increasingly expunged from 
serious consideration.

         <p>"What is new about the situation today is that a seemingly 
irreversible mutation in the American system has occurred," syndicated 
columnist William Pfaff wrote in mid-January. "At some point, quantitative 
change does become qualitative change. The point when that change took 
place was probably 1976, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that money spent 
in support of a political candidate is a form of constitutionally protected 
free speech. Moneyed interests now finance not only the winners of national 
elections but also most of the losers."

        <p> Pfaff's column appears most prominently in the International 
Herald Tribune. Based in Paris, he has a clear-eyed view of big money's 
leverage over U.S. politics: "This is part of the enlarging domination of 
American life by business corporations and their values, which are those of 
material aggrandizement, a phenomenon accompanied and promoted by the 
circuses and gladiatorial contests provided by the most important U.S. 
industry of all, entertainment, which now showcases elections and even wars 
as entertainments."

         <p>We need wide-ranging news media. And that's unlikely as long as 
most "journalism" resembles stenography for the powerful -- and very few 
eyebrows get raised when a network anchor tells a key official of an 
incoming administration that "we look forward to working with you."

Highly Deceptive Media."</i>
