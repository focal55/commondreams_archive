Some African-American leaders are urging the Bush administration to declare
the HIV/AIDS epidemic a national state of emergency and provide federal funds
for more effective treatment and prevention programs. But the state of denial
is the primary reason the epidemic has wreaked havoc within the black
community; the virus has replaced murder as the leading killer of black men
and women ages 25 to 44.
<P>
   These black leaders, organized by the National Black Leadership Commission
on AIDS, made their appeal in the wake of a June 1 report by the Atlanta-based
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report details exploding rates
of infection within the black community, especially among black gay men.
Released on the 20th anniversary of the discovery of the disease, the report
found that HIV is spreading among gay men in general but that the infection
rate among blacks was nearly fivetimes as high as the rate of Hispanics and
whites combined.
<P>

The report estimated that more than 30 percent of black men between the
ages of 23 and 29 "who have sex with men" are HIV positive. The survey,
conducted between 1998-2000, found that almost 15 percent of these men were
newly infected with the disease. The infection rates among blacks are "similar
to those we saw in the beginning of the epidemic during some of the peak
years," said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the CDC's center for HIV, sexually
transmitted diseases and tuberculosis prevention. According to the center,
more than half of the 40,000 new infections last year were among
African-Americans. And black women are four times more likely to carry the
virus than their white counterparts.
<P>
   More than half of AIDS cases among black men now occur among those who have
sex with other men, up from 31 percent in 1989, when IV drug use was the
primary mode of transmission. Fewer than 10 percent of the AIDS cases among
black men result from heterosexual sex, compared with 38 percent among women.
<P>
   While black leaders should stress the need to eliminate racial disparities
in the funding of treatment and prevention programs, they must be equally
vigorous in attacking the denial that fertilizes the growth of the deadly
virus. This denial emerges from a number of complex elements, including
poverty, ignorance, distrust and fear.
<P>
   But perhaps the core of the denial is the African-American community's
conception of masculinity. The legacy of oppression and a history of cultural
stereotypes have placed a particular emphasis on notions of masculinity for
black men. Because of that, many African-Americans consider the words
homosexuality and "blackness" mutually exclusive.
<P>
   Feminist cultural critic bell hooks (she chooses not to capitalize the b or
h) argues that this conflict between gayness and black machismo encourages
homophobia within the black community and goes back to the Black Power
movement, which identified homosexuality as something weak and compliant and
inspired by Europeans. The hard-core masculinity of hip-hop culture has
reinforced those notions. What's more, African-American men historically have
been denied access to the social establishment--and often have gained entrance
based on physical demonstrations of strength or virility. Thus, machismo has
always been a strong component of black masculinity. Thus, many black men who
have sex with other men don't consider themselves gay.
<P>
   "The concept of being gay is seen as the antithesis of manhood," explains
Cornelius Baker, former head of the National Association of People with AIDS.
<P>
   Many analysts believe this denial is one of the primary reasons for the
increase in infection rates among gay men and black women. Experts in the
field have dubbed this tendency the Down Low syndrome when men have sex with
other men but deny they are gay or even bisexual. (This syndrome makes their
girlfriends or wives more vulnerable to infection. Black women are two-thirds
of all women with AIDS.)
<P>
   Experts are not sure of the numbers of black men afflicted with the DL
syndrome, but there have been hints in government surveys. One CDC survey
found that of 8,780 HIV-positive men who have sex with men, 24 percent of the
black men identified themselves as heterosexual, compared with 6 percent of
whites.
<P>
   Ironies abound in this fight against HIV/AIDS. Many Americans think of
HIV/AIDS as a disease unleashed as divine retribution for the "sinful"
behavior associated with its transmission. But those who see HIV/AIDS as God's
punishment also see more sexual candor than before the age of AIDS.
<P>
   So instead of acting as God's vengeful messenger, the virus has been the
catalyst to open society to sexual messages previously considered taboo. The
African-American concept of macho masculinity was born of the need to project
black men as protectors and defenders. Instead, it is serving as bridge for a
virus of destruction. That is a tragic irony born in the state of denial.
