            A few decades ago, Marshall McLuhan observed that "all media exist 

to invest our lives with artificial perceptions and arbitrary values." But 

for today's model consumer, such comments are apt to be unhelpful.



         <p>Distinctions between news, entertainment, advertising and 

propaganda have blurred to the vanishing point. Yet mental acuity can only 

lead to endless conflicts between the dominant media world and the personal 

quest for meaning.



         <p>If you want to stop worrying and love the media, a change in 

approach might be all that's needed. For starters, here are a few 

suggestions for watching television and listening to the radio:



         <p>*  Cultivate a short memory.



         <p>Yesterday's earthshaking news is tomorrow's media debris. Accept 

that an issue is truly important only when, and if, media outlets are 

saying it is.



         <p>*  Don't resent flagrant manipulation.



         <p>Sure, the TV commercials you see over and over again can be 

irritating, even infuriating. But if you're willing to hold "the 

marketplace" in sufficiently high regard, you can learn to denigrate your 

own life and genuine perceptions enough to sharply reduce any annoying 

cognitive dissonance.



         <p>*  Get accustomed to brevity in news coverage.



         <p>The average sound bite is much shorter than the average 

commercial. Of course. You won't mind as long as you recognize the wisdom 

of the marketplace. A few well-chosen words can shed light on the 

intricacies of global warming or tax policies. It takes longer to 

adequately convey that the people at McDonald's love to see you smile.



         <p>*  Be grateful for the news provided by "public broadcasting."



         <p>Don't fret about heavy reliance on official sources and policy 

analysts from big corporate-funded think tanks. Feel appreciative that 

programs from PBS and National Public Radio respect your intelligence with 

lengthy coverage.



         <p>*  Ignore the commercials on noncommercial broadcasts.



         <p>Remember that they're not really commercials, just "enhanced 

underwriter credits." It might bother you that every broadcast of the 

"NewsHour With Jim Lehrer" starts with a lush spot for the global 

agribusiness titan Archer Daniels Midland, but push any concern out of your 

mind. Assume it's only a coincidence that you don't see the most 

influential news program on television doing any sustained investigative 

reporting about manipulation of the world's food supply by huge corporations.



         <p>*  If the language of a news report sounds slanted, don't linger 

over the implications.



         <p>When the announcer on a newscast matter-of-factly describes the 

Palestinian group Hamas as "extremist" but would never apply the same 

adjective to the Israeli government -- even though both are killing 

children and other civilians on a regular basis -- the spin is nothing out 

of the ordinary. So, just trust the judgment of newsroom professionals.



         <p>*  Do not wonder too much about what's missing and why.



         <p>While NPR's daily "Fresh Air" program devotes a lot of time to 

interviewing authors, it rarely touches on the transformation of book 

publishing and book selling into an overwhelmingly corporatized industry -- 

with profound cultural and political effects. Be glad that the show gets 

big underwriting bucks from mammoth book firms to polish their images and 

plug specific titles. Perish the thought that the cash flow might tacitly 

function as hush money.



        <p>*  Take a media outlet's word for it.



         <p>If you're watching Fox News and hear the refrain that its coverage 

is "fair and balanced as always," assume that's a plausible contention 

rather than an outlandish lie.



         <p>*  Don't let media conflicts of interest disrupt your credulity.



         <p>Last year, political commercials on television added up to revenue 

of $1 billion. When TV news shows cover campaign finance reform, don't 

recall that the owners of stations and networks make a bundle from the way 

things are.



         <p>*  Forget that the nation's broadcast frequencies have been 

expropriated by companies supplying little but garbage.



         <p>"We the public give the broadcasters exclusive use of airwaves 

that would fetch hundreds of billions of dollars if they were auctioned at 

market rates," says Paul Taylor, director of the Alliance for Better 

Campaigns. "We license them to broadcasters for free. All we ask in return 

is that they serve the public interest. But come election time, they turn 

around and profiteer on the campaign, fueling a political money chase that 

helps drive candidates into the arms of special interests."



         <p>Above all, don't keep in mind that corporate media giants are 

special interests. And remember to have a good time as a satisfied media 

consumer.

Highly Deceptive Media."</i>
