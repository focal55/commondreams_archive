For some people, war is terror, disaster and death. For others, 
it's a PR problem.

<p>At the Rendon Group, a public-relations firm with offices in 
Boston and Washington, pleasant news arrived the other day with a $397,000 
contract to help the Pentagon look good while bombing Afghanistan. The 
four-month deal includes an option to renew through most of 2002.

<p>This is a job for savvy PR pros who know how to sound humanistic. 
"At the Rendon Group, we believe in people," says the company's mission 
statement, which expresses "our admiration and respect for cultural 
diversity" and proclaims a commitment to "helping people win in the global 
marketplace."

<p>A media officer at the Pentagon explained why Rendon got the 
contract. "We needed a firm that could provide strategic counsel 
immediately," Lt. Col. Kenneth McClellan said. "We were interested in 
someone that we knew could come in quickly and help us orient to the 
challenge of communicating to a wide range of groups around the world."

<p>As a PR outfit, Rendon has moved in some powerful economic 
circles, with clients including official trade agencies of the United 
States, Bulgaria, Russia and Uzbekistan. In Washington, the firm helped 
organize a series of conferences on "post-privatization management in the 
global telecommunications, electric power, oil and gas, banking and 
finance, and transportation sectors." Some of the clientele has been more 
liberal or touchy-feely: Handgun Control Inc. and the American Massage 
Therapy Association.

<p>Rendon proudly notes that it provided "community and media 
relations counsel to the Monsanto Chemical Company in its effort to clean 
up several contaminated sites." Overseas, Rendon helped the Kuwait 
Petroleum Corporation to cope with labor strife and bad press when closing 
a refinery in Naples, Italy.

<p>Some clients have been more shadowy. Rendon worked for the 
government of Kuwait in the early 1990s. And the firm made a lot of money 
by contracting with the CIA to do media work for the Iraqi National 
Congress, an organization seeking the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.

<p>Now, the Rendon Group is facing what is perhaps its most 
challenging project yet -- spinning for a war in Afghanistan. With its 
sights set on media content in 79 countries, Rendon will use standard tools 
of the PR trade, such as focus groups, websites and rigorous analysis of 
news coverage.

<p>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that "we need to do a 
better job to make sure that people are not confused as to what this is 
about." It's typical of warmakers to claim that the biggest problems lie 
with others' faulty perceptions rather than their own deadly orders. But no 
amount of PR wizardry can change the cold facts: when a bomb hits a home 
for the elderly or a hospital or a residential neighborhood, or when a 
bombing campaign sets in motion a cataclysm of mass starvation.

<p>If some people are "confused" about this war, it may be because 
they remember the rationale for it: Killing thousands of civilians is 
unconscionable.

<p>Though you wouldn't know much about it from watching TV news or 
skimming the front pages, large numbers of Afghans -- many of them children 
and elderly -- are facing the likelihood of starvation because the bombing 
has forced recurrent halts to the movement of food-aid trucks from Pakistan 
into Afghanistan. Concern is growing among humanitarian aid workers that 
about 100,000 people are now in imminent peril. By winter, the number could 
be in the millions.

<p>Meanwhile, on television, we see footage of air-dropped meals that 
amount to no more than 1 percent of what's needed to prevent people from 
starving. That's called good PR.

<p>At this point, the playbook for the Pentagon's media game is a 
familiar one. Consider the words of Eugene Secunda, a professor of 
marketing and former senior vice president of the J. Walter Thompson firm. 
"Operation Desert Storm allowed only one view of the battle: the one 
authorized by the military," he observed in 1991. "Like travelers led from 
their buses by tour guides, the TV crews were given an opportunity to 
videotape the 'panoramic vista' before them, and then were whisked to the 
next officially authorized destination."

<p>Writing a decade ago, Secunda foreshadowed the kind of coverage 
we're now seeing. "In the aftermath of the war with Iraq, strategic 
planners, preparing for future wars, are unquestionably examining the 
lessons gleaned from this triumphant experience. One of the most important 
lessons learned is the necessity of mobilizing strong public support, 
through the projection of a powerful and tightly controlled PR program, 
with particular effort directed toward the realization of positive news 
coverage."

<p>As bombs routinely fall on Afghanistan, that's the kind of 
coverage that dominates television screens in the United States. For now, 
anyway, the Pentagon is winning its PR war at home.
