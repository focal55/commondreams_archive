What hath Jim Jeffords wrought?
<P>The decision of the mild-mannered Vermont senator to switch his designation from Republican to Independent has not merely shuffled partisan control of the Senate - the significance of which is only coming to be fully understood this week. It has also provoked startlingly frank talk from Republicans who retain their membership cards in what was the party of Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt but has become the party of George W. Bush, Trent Lott and Tom DeLay.
<P>Deposed Senate Majority Leader Lott, R-Miss., is still ranting about the character flaws he has now discovered in his old barbershop quartet buddy Jeffords. But that doesn't seem to be preventing Republicans of a more moderate bent from saying that it isn't Jeffords but rather the GOP's rabid leadership that is flawed.
<P>Freshman Rhode Island Sen. Lincoln Chafee, a Republican at least as moderate as his close friend Jeffords, will go no further than to say he'll stay in the party <EM>for now.</EM> Arizona Sen. John McCain is only slightly more enthusiastic about remaining Republican. McCain is the talk of Washington after his weekend meeting with incoming Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., which some McCain comrades previewed as a discussion about the Arizona maverick joining Jeffords in an Independent caucus of two.
<P>The talk of a McCain switch was overblown. It isn't happening - yet. But the Arizonan is hardly toeing the party line. He has broken with the Bush administration and Senate Republican leaders on the Bush tax plan, gun control, patients' bill of rights legislation and his pet issue - campaign finance reform. And he has talked - a lot - about his discomfort with an already right-wing Republican Party's recent lurches off the conservative cliff.
<P>McCain's critique of the GOP's hard right - "It is well past time for the Republican Party to grow up" - has actually taken heat off Daschle and the newly empowered Democrats. Conservatives have always hated moderate Republicans more than Democrats - just toss a "Rockefeller Republican" to the party's attack dogs and watch the feeding frenzy begin. So bashing McCain has become priority No. 1, to such an extent that the right's daily crib sheet - The Washington Times newspaper - is berating the man who beat George W. Bush in several 2000 GOP primaries as "a world-class publicity hound" who is "acting childishly."
<P>That may satisfy the GOP's inside-the-Beltway - or, at least, inside-the-West-Wing - establishment, which has always hated McCain for being more interesting than Bush and Lott. But outside Washington, McCain's moves have provoked an unexpected response.
<P>In his home state, for instance, some powerful Republicans are saying their senator is right to point the finger of blame for Jeffords' departure at the party's Taliban wing.
<P>"McCain has realized, I think, that the vast majority of Republicans do not feel the party's ultra-conservative leadership is philosophically in touch with them. We have prided ourselves over the years (for) being the party of the big tent but have allowed ideological bullies to stand in the doorway of the big tent," complained Arizonan Randall Gnant.
<P>Who is this Gnant joker? Some renegade Republican? A moderate maverick on the fringe of the Arizona GOP? Not quite. Gnant, a native of Milwaukee and a 1967 University of Wisconsin graduate, is the Arizona state Senate president. And he was elected in that evenly split body by a coalition of moderate Republicans and Democrats over the leader of a right-wing Republican caucus known as "The Miserables." For the crime of working with Democrats, Gnant has faced the threat of recall from right-wingers in his Scottsdale district.
<P>So Gnant knows of what he speaks when he says his party is being done severe damage by "ideological bullies" who "push the pure, far-right moral agenda on abortion, archaic laws against sodomy and homosexuality - any of the religious right issues."
<P>While national Republicans have claimed McCain is out of touch with Arizona Republicans when he says the GOP has gone off the deep end on a host of issues, Gnant doesn't think that's the case. Arizonans revered former Sen. Barry Goldwater even more when the "in-your-heart-you-know-he's-right" Republican lashed out at his own party for abandoning its live-and-let-live roots to push harsh anti-abortion and anti-gay legislation.
<P>"Sooner or later, the Republican Party is going to understand that many of the people who have tuned out or registered Independent would like to be Republicans because on most issues they feel comfortable (with the GOP) but are scared away or (ticked) off by the far right," says Gnant.</p>
