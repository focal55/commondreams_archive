The University of Texas' commitment to free speech on campus -- which has 
been a curiously lethargic commitment given the centrality of such freedom 
to higher education -- has gotten curiouser lately.

<p>Sadly, I think this little story from the largest university in the United 
States tells us a lot about the state of American campuses. On the heels of 
the use of force by university police to stop a professor speaking with a 
bullhorn at a pro-choice rally, the police on my campus now seem to have 
unilaterally criminalized mere possession of a bullhorn (even if it doesn't 
have batteries in it) by threatening to arrest me.

<p>The story began on Tuesday when more than 200 pro-choice demonstrators 
rallied in front of a 20-foot anti-abortion display with huge pictures of 
bloody fetuses, which has dominated the plaza in front of Gregory Gym all 
week. While some people thought the display should come down, many of us 
defended the speech rights of the anti-abortion group and wanted to counter 
it with the classic "more speech" response.

<p>When protesters began to speak with a bullhorn, they were told by UT 
officials that amplified sound would not be allowed in that area. After 
English Prof. Mia Carter defied the rule and spoke to the crowd, police 
rushed her, roughly pushing down students who were trying to protect her, 
ripping the bullhorn out of her hands, and injuring her.

<p>Wednesday the protesters were back. When I approached the rally area with a 
bullhorn, police immediately informed me of the ban on amplified sound and 
told me to take the bullhorn out of the rally area or leave it with police 
until the rally was over. I asked what would happen if I held onto the 
bullhorn, which at that moment didn't even have batteries in it. Police 
said I would be arrested and charged with criminal trespassing.

<p>I then asked the police to cite the university regulation or criminal 
statute that allowed them to demand that I surrender the bullhorn. They 
were, as lawyers say, unresponsive.

<p>I tried to explain to the officers that threats of arrest usually come with 
explanation of the law one is accused of violating. Again, I asked, what 
law criminalizes carrying a bullhorn (and a battery-less one at that)? More 
unresponsiveness.

<p>After repeating the question several times, the officers finally told me 
that the order came from the president's office and that it was time for me 
to choose whether to stay or go.

<p>As the crowd chanted "free speech now," I left the area, with police 
dutifully following me to make sure I didn't dash back to the rally area 
with my unauthorized amplification system to commit an unauthorized speech act.

<p>Back at the rally, people talked about the importance of expanding 
free-speech rights on campus. One student described having pamphlets 
illegally confiscated on campus during Parents' Weekend this fall, and 
another recounted the administration's public lies to denigrate and derail 
students' plans to protest Henry Kissinger's lecture last year.

<p>On Thursday, pro-choice and free-speech supporters returned for the final 
day of rallies at the anti-abortion installation. Instead of bullhorns, 
this time we came with cheerleader-style cardboard megaphones to 
un-electronically amplify our voices. Apparently the police decided this 
violated no law, policy, or dictate from the president's office; no one was 
assaulted or threatened with arrest for this low-tech approach.

<p>On that final day, students questioned why a huge display funded by an 
off-campus group (albeit with a student front group formed to legitimize 
the display under university rules) was given so much space. Several 
students crossed over the metal barricades of the anti-abortion group to 
assert students' objection to the special treatment given to the display. 
The anti-abortion group leaders demanded that police arrest the students 
for trespassing, but this time university officials wisely backed off.

<p>The university's rules give administrators the right to deny students 
permission to hold demonstrations or use amplified sound "if the space 
requested is unavailable, inadequate, or inappropriate to accommodate the 
proposed use at the time requested." While everyone acknowledges that some 
limits on amplified sound are necessary to make sure classes function 
without disruption, many on campus think the rules -- and the 
administration's application of them -- are arbitrary and unnecessarily 
restrictive. Indeed, given the geography of the Gregory Gym area, it's 
difficult to imagine how a bullhorn could disrupt classes in the 
surrounding buildings any more than in the university's designated "rally 
areas" when amplification is allowed.

<p>The best sign that a university is doing its job is a campus that is alive 
with speech. The U.S. Supreme Court has said that a real democracy requires 
speech that is "uninhibited, robust, and wide-open." So does a real 
university.

<p>No matter how much it might scare administrators who are conscious of the 
opinions of wealthy donors and conservative legislators, a loud campus is 
an intellectually healthy campus.
