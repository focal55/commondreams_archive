The Washington press corps are sore. The White House is not playing nice 
anymore. Senior communications staffers are taking swipes at talk-show hosts 
and news reporters and warning Americans to watch their p's and q's. 
Administration high-ups are refusing to talk to their critics, spreading 
untruths to the press. Worse, the Bush team is telling the world that 
they're going to lie to the public. What's a reporter to do?
<p>
"The White House has developed a particularly tense, mutually distrustful 
relationship with members of the news media," <A HREF="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2001/09/27/spin/index.html" target="_new">reported Salon today.</A>
<p>
Last week NBC Nightly News host Tom Brokaw got his knuckles rapped for 
interviewing former President Bill Clinton. Salon reports that the Bush team 
called up to complain that the Sept. 18 interview would detract from 
Bush's war. (They needn't have worried. Clinton only said he supported GW and 
urged others to do the same.) 
<p>
This week, press secretary Ari Fleischer snapped at "Politically Incorrect" 
host Bill Maher. Maher had disputed the President's characterization of the 
Sept. 11 hijackers as "cowards" and suggested what was cowardly was to launch 
cruise missiles on targets from 2,000 miles away. Fleischer denounced comic gadfly 
Maher, warning news organizations and, more ominously, all Americans, that 
they "need to watch what they say, watch what they do, and this is not a time 
for remarks like that; there never is."
<p>
And then there was that Air Force One incident, in which Fleischer and Bush Senior 
Advisor Karl Rove tried their best to explain why Bush spent most of Sept. 
11 flying away from the danger in D.C. The two insisted that the President's 
airplane was a target of terrorists. By September 13, reporters were raising 
questions, because no law enforcement, military or Secret Service personnel 
would confirm the Air Force One threat allegation. This Tuesday, CBS News 
finally reported that the story was inaccurate -- the result of a 
"misunderstanding" by intelligence, the Bush staff said. An AP account said that 
"administration officials say they now doubt whether there was actually a 
call made threatening the President's plane." 
<p>
"Why the lies?" Asked a seemingly shocked Andrew Sullivan on Wednesday, referring 
to the Air Force One to-and-fro. "Were these people spinning at a time of 
grave national crisis? And I thought the Clinton era was over." 
<p>
A better question would be, Why the surprise?
<p>
The Bush team make no apologies for lying. In his address to the nation, Bush 
promised "covert operations, secret even in success." One military official 
told the Washington Post Monday that because "this is the most 
information-intensive war you can imagine ...We're going to lie about things."
<p>
If reporters had been more distrustful last November, we might not be dealing 
with this President at all. There wasn't a war underway a year ago, when the 
Bush campaign elbowed to power on a lie-fest. Let's not even talk about 
Florida. Review the debate tapes. Today's White House resident misrepresented 
his record on hate crimes and health insurance. He lied about his tax plan 
and his plans for the 
environment. It has never been proven that he didn't lie about his national 
service record. 
<p>
The Bush team aren't unusual. Politicians are in the business of persuasion 
-- call it spin, call it wool-pulling. It's what they tend to do to attain 
their goals (goals they believe in, after all) especially when they can get 
away with it, which for a few decades at least, they mostly have. 
<p>
D.C.'s most powerful reporters have got into the habit of enjoying a cozy 
closeness with their sources. Marrying them, even, on occasion.  Now, reports 
Salon's Jake Tapper,  "many members of the media," are decrying the White 
House staff's "unnecessarily adversarial attitude." The Bush team are blowing 
their cover. Not only lying, but telling the public they're going to lie. 
<p>
What's a reporter to do? S/he may have to report. You know, go digging, 
instead of the usual: he said/she said stenography. It's likely to do nothing 
else but put Americans in more danger, but the Bush war could accomplish 
something useful if it revives the adversarial relationship between 
politicians and the press.
