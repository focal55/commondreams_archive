IT IS ironic that my most treasured
        Christmas moments have come in a largely Muslim country. <p>It
        is December 1998 and after an intense and illegal bombing
        campaign at the very beginning of Ramadan, we have spent
        a week with children in Baghdad learning to sing &#147;We
        Shall Overcome&#148; in Arabic. The sweet voices of those
        children sustain me to this day. </p>
        <p>It is December 1999, and in a particularly run-down
        area of Basra, a little boy pulls a milk crate by a
        frayed rope. Inside the crate, bundled in a muddied,
        ragged blanket, an obviously malnourished baby gazes
        calmly at me, undisturbed by the flies that surround him.
        This is a nativity under siege. That child's innocent,
        suffering gaze, drives me to this day. </p>
        <p>Each Sunday in the Christian season of Advent, church
        goers anticipate arrival of the innocent one, born into
        impossible poverty, who will bring forth justice for the
        poor, liberty for captives, sight for the blind. &#147;O
        come, O come, Emmanuel&#148; is sung in churches
        worldwide. I hear the tune now and feel haunted. </p>
        <p>A modern-day Herod, deadly, vengeful and reckless,
        pursues the children of Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of
        innocent people have already been slaughtered in 11 long
        years of the most devastating siege in modern history.
        Instead of confronting the failures of this policy, the
        US seems to be gearing up to compound them with the
        greatest failure of all: war. </p>
        <p>In hospitals, schools, mosques, churches and homes,
        people here ask us why the American people want to punish
        them even more. For 11 years they've been told that
        sanctions were a more &#147;peaceful&#148; alternative to
        open warfare. Now they're being told that war is the
        solution to the suffering caused by sanctions. It would
        seem that the message from the US to the Iraqi people is
        in a twisted way at least consistent; and that is to
        please remember that they're being killed with the very
        best of intentions. </p>
        <p>But the truth is that war is not peace. We must not
        allow ourselves to be governed by a cruel and merciless
        world order that relies on siege and warfare to
        accomplish goals that violate human rights and
        international law. Around the world, people of conscience
        must begin to non-violently resist and challenge the
        movement towards intensified warfare with actions
        commensurate to the crimes being committed and
        threatened. </p>
        <p>The barriers to peace may seem overwhelming, yet hope
        springs forth from the most surprising of places. Hope
        lives in the forgiveness shown by Umm Hassan, a young
        Iraqi mother I met last year. Moments after her child
        died for lack of an antibiotic, she murmured: &#147;I
        pray this will never happen to a mother in your
        country.&#148; Hope lives in Amber Amudson, a young
        American mother whose husband, Craig, was killed in the
        attack on the Pentagon on Sept. 11. Amber helped lead a
        walk for peace from Washington DC to New York City
        earlier this month, and she wrote to President Bush:
        &#147;If you choose to respond to this incomprehensible
        brutality by perpetuating violence against other innocent
        human beings, you may not do so in the name of justice
        for my husband.... find the courage to respond to this
        incomprehensible tragedy by breaking the cycle of
        violence.&#148; </p>
        <p>It is Christmas 2001, and we are in Basra again,
        visiting the families we came to love when we lived with
        them two summers ago. Then, we tried to understand the
        effect of sanctions by learning what it was like to live
        without electricity for 14 hours per day in 49-degree
        heat, to share meals made from meagre rations, and to be
        cut off from communication with the rest of the world.
        Today, we're cherishing the hope of peace and pledging to
        defy the call to war. </p>
        <p>Four days ago, we visited Mar Yusuf Church in Mosul,
        which was hit by a US bomb in 1991, killing four guests
        at the church and severely burning one of the priests.
        The damage has long since been repaired, and inside
        stands the most beautiful of Christmas trees. </p>
        <p>Riad Hamza dresses up as Father Christmas every year
        to pass presents out to the children. He made the tree
        for them as well &#151; fashioning the ornaments from
        cigarette and matchboxes wrapped in brightly coloured
        paper and ribbons. He made the tree branches from
        shredded rice bags dyed a deep green. &#147;Here in
        Iraq,&#148; Riad told me, &#147;we make something from
        nothing &#151; especially the peace.&#148; And isn't that
        the most precious gift of all? </p>
