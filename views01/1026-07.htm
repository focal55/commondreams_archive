The first principle of humanitarian relief is that it be impartial, that 
aid be given on the basis of need without any consideration of political 
agendas.

<p>The United States government, the same government that aroused 
international execration by using Red Cross markings on planes used to 
smuggle arms to the contras in Nicaragua, has once again made a mockery of 
that principle with its conduct in Afghanistan.

<p>Its conduct to this point was bad enough  causing the suspension of aid 
programs for weeks because of threats of bombing; constructing a 
"humanitarian" reason to bomb (air drops are required to feed people, the 
planes will be endangered, so we must bomb to suppress air defenses); 
causing renewed suspension because of the bombing; and the piece de 
resistance, adding insult to injury by dropping 35000 meals a day to 
replace programs that had fed millions. That last has been repeatedly 
criticized by aid organizations as associating humanitarian operations with 
military assault, thus making aid work far more difficult and dangerous  as 
a spokesperson for Doctors Without Borders put it, "We do not want to be 
perceived as a part of the U.S. military campaign."

<p>At a Pentagon news briefing on Wednesday, however, this politicization was 
taken to new heights with the invocation of unnamed "sources" claiming that 
"there are reports that the Taliban might poison the food and try to blame 
the United States," according to Rear Adm. John Stufflebeem, deputy 
director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He went on to warn 
Afghans receiving aid, "If it comes from Taliban control, they must be 
careful."

<p>It scarcely needs mentioning that poisoning one's own populace is 
senseless, and that there is no reason to suppose the Taliban is planning 
anything of the sort. In fact, it was reported yesterday that officials 
from the World Food Program expressed "surprise" at the allegations, with 
one saying "If they're talking about the food we deliver, there's not been 
a single instance that we know of in which the Taliban have tampered with 
it. Stolen, yes, but not tampered."

<p>When contacted, Sam Barratt of Oxfam International, currently working out 
of Peshawar, Pakistan, characterized the Pentagon statement as "deeply 
unhelpful," adding, "This claim further goes to undermine the position of 
aid agencies in the country."

<p>It's well known that our government frequently uses "disinformation" in 
wartime. And we find out long afterward. We know now that the story about 
Iraqi soldiers throwing Kuwaiti babies out of incubators was a fabrication 
created by a Washington PR firm and that the "nurse" testifying about it 
was the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States, who wasn't 
even in the country at the time. We found that out, but not before an 
Amnesty International report about it was circulated to all the media and 
to all of Congress, playing a major role in building support for the Gulf War.

<p>In order to combat disinformation effectively, however, we will have to 
learn how to recognize it before the war is over, while it's still relevant 
to current affairs. And, in fact, we've already seen open evidence of its 
use in this crisis. Government officials were forced to admit that reports 
that the terrorists targeted Air Force One were untrue (presumably they 
were circulated to further anger the American public).

<p>If we do manage to have the courage of our intellectual convictions, the 
question still remains, "What is our government trying to do?"

<p>A clue may be found in previous statements by Deputy Secretary of State 
Richard Armitage, who expressed concern early on that humanitarian 
operations be conducted ''in a manner that does not allow this food to fall 
into the hands of the Taliban." Since the Taliban, as the men with guns, 
will always be fed while there is any food in the country, this seems like 
a hint that the United States would consider interfering with the supply of 
humanitarian aid in Taliban-controlled areas, in order to erode public 
support for the Taliban. Further hints come today, with the second bombing 
of a Red Cross warehouse complex in Kabul. It was entirely plausible that 
the first strike was accidental, but the second does make one wonder. 
Obviously, there is no way to know, but some vigilance is definitely in order.

<p>Such tactics are not at all foreign to the U.S. government. Making the 
Chilean economy and later the Nicaraguan "scream" was an essential, 
deliberate part of destabilizing the Allende and Sandinista governments.

<p>UN agencies have warned that 7.5 million people are dependent on aid for 
their survival through the coming winter. UNICEF has estimated that 100,000 
children may die. The U.S. government has continued its protracted bombing 
campaign in the face of numerous concerted from private aid agencies and 
from the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right of Access to Food for a bombing 
halt so that supplies can be trucked in. Simultaneously, the noncombatant 
toll of the bombings continues to grow  a bus in Kandahar, a hospital in 
He*rat, numerous private homes, and more.

<p>Notwithstanding its invocation of humanitarian concerns, the U.S. 
government has shown a criminal indifference to human life. It has 
sabotaged one of the few truly noble, truly heroic efforts in the modern 
world  humanitarian aid. It has also severely tainted public discourse, to 
the point where it is difficult to know what is true and what is not.

<p>Among Afghans and other peoples for whom water is scarce, poisoning a well 
is the deepest crime, more powerfully symbolic even than taking a human 
life. The reason is that it takes something vital, something necessary to 
preserving life, and perverts it into a force of destruction.

<p>That is what our government has now done.
