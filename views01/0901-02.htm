A couple of years ago Los Angeles guitarist Ry Cooder made a documentary 
film in Havana called "The Buena Vista Social Club." It was nominated for an 
Academy Award and was seen by millions of Americans. Some have said it has 
done more to improve relations between US and Cuba than 42 years of rhetoric 
by the politicians on both sides of the Florida Straits. An August 18 report 
in the Santa Monica Daily Breeze indicates that Cooder has now been fined 
$25,000 by the US Treasury Department for spending money in Cuba without its 
permission. 

<p>I say fight it, Ry. Although our Federal courts have not yet declared it, the 
1981 Reagan Cuba travel restrictions became unconstitutional about 11 years 
ago when the Cold War ended. They have remained on the books because 
Presidents Bush I, Clinton and Bush II lacked the political will to terminate 
them and our State Department has been using them to try to frighten 
Americans out of going to Cuba. In order for a court to declare them 
unconstitutional, our Justice Department would have to take someone to court 
to enforce them, which it has not done because its lawyers know it is very 
unlikely any judge would uphold them. 

<p>According to an August 5 New York Times article by Frank Bruni, for the few 
Cuba travelers who receive enforcement letters (about .1% of the total), the 
theoretical fine for unlicensed spending is $250,000, the fine on paper but 
not practice is $55,000, the typical fine is $7,500, however Treasury accepts 
down to $700 in "voluntary settlement." Those who contest fines are entitled 
to an in-house hearing before a Treasury administrative judge, whose ruling 
would then be subject to a due process review in Federal Court where the 
constitutional issue could be raised. However, Treasury apparently has no 
such administrative judges. According to an August 18 NY Transfer article by 
John Hillson, while Treasury has taken in almost $2,000,000 in settlements 
from the 379 Cuba travelers who were stupid or frightened enough to pay 
voluntarily, it has never conducted an in-house administrative hearing, much 
less taken someone to court. 

<p>In July the House voted 240-186 to stop funding enforcement, and the Senate 
will probably do likewise in September. Despite this, supposedly on Bush's 
orders Treasury this summer has been stepping up enforcement by sending 
agents to airports in Toronto, Nassau and Cancun to try to spot Americans 
getting off flights from Cuba, where they are harassed, frightened and 
subsequently sent letters threatening large fines. Some reporters have 
speculated it's some kind of political payoff to the Cuban American National 
Foundation. In Ry Cooder's case, perhaps it's punishment for creating good 
will between Americans and Cubans. 

<p>In any event, many fined Cuba travelers are beginning to contest, and a large 
backlog of cases has been building up. Treasury is now claiming it's going to 
try to use EPA judges to conduct the hearings. At an August 17 press 
conference, Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), chairman of the subcommittee which 
funds Treasury, reprimanded it for its recent "heavy handed" and "unseemly 
crankup" of enforcement when Congress is about to repeal the "misguided Cuba 
travel prohibition". He also stated he was going to try to prohibit Treasury 
from using environmental judges to hear Cuba travel violations and concluded: 
"The law preventing US citizens from traveling to Cuba  has not been 
aggressively enforced and is, on its face, an unjustifiable restraint on the 
freedom of travel..." 

<p>The restrictions have often been used by customs officials to harass (but not 
prosecute) people our government considers politically incorrect, such as 
students and union representatives attending conferences in Cuba. 
Unconstitutional regulations and laws are illegal and void and should 
immediately be terminated or repealed. If questionably constitutional, they 
should be taken to court for determination as soon as possible. They should 
not be kept on the books for years in order to harass selectively, or to 
frighten and bilk the unwary when our government (but not the traveler) knows 
there will be no prosecution. 

<p>Last January our President took an oath to uphold our Constitution. He has 
plenty of good legal advice. If he truly represents us, Cuba travelers like 
Ry Cooder should be able to rely on his good faith in this respect.
