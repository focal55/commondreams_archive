ON SEPT. 11 and the days afterward, I was glued to the television, slowly becoming frustrated from the lack of representation of people of color in the news coverage of the attack. 
<p> Of course, when I say "people of color," I am not including the many photographs of the suspects who under usual circumstances would fit the definition. The reports did such an extraordinary job of showing and criminalizing every person who looked Arab that it was difficult to include them.
<p> So when I say I was looking for people of color on television, I mean that I was looking for the "us" who were not terrorists. I mean the "us" we never see in the media anyway - the brown people, the working and the underclass, the undocumented workers, to name a few.
<p> Instead all I got were white males: historians, politicians, movie producers, analyzing the situation, telling us what to think and do. The photographs that flashed on the screen of our new heroes, the police and firefighters, were mostly of white men; the stories about the dead were mostly about white families; and the more I watched the television, the more invisible I began to feel.
<p> I wondered: As a Dominican American, despite the fact I was born here and have lived here all my life, if the Dominican Republic ever became a threat to the United States, would I be in danger as a suspect as well?
<p> Then on Nov. 12 I was again in front of the television screen. American Airlines Flight 587, destination the Dominican Republic, crashed a few minutes after it took off from Kennedy Airport. I wanted to know, was it an act of terrorism? And, if so, why would Dominicans be under attack?
<p> Again, I watched the television. This time, I was looking for familiar faces. I had taken that flight countless times. I retraced every memory I had of it: from my holding the hand of my grandmother, who gets nervous when the airplane lifts off and rejoices when it lands, to my mother complaining that once again we had packed way too many presents to give to the family and because we went over the minimum weight on our luggage we had to carry extra baggage by hand.
<p> I thought about the reasons why we take the trip. How hard so many people I know work to save up to visit families they have left behind, to see children they have not seen in years, to reconnect with wives and husbands who are waiting for a visa. I imagined every passenger's dream while I flipped through the television channels shortly after the crash.
<p> According to the media, after the authorities were satisfied that the crash did not look like a terrorist attack and television programing went back to normal, what the American people cared most about were the people in Belle Harbor and how the flight destined for the Dominican Republic had crashed into their homes.
<p> Not to mention the heroic firefighters going through the plane wreckage in a community that had already lost so many people in the World Trade Center attack, firemen and office workers both.
<p> "How much can one community take?" one reporter said in reference to Belle Harbor. I agreed with her. However, as much as I tried to feel compassion for the families of Belle Harbor, all I could think about were the passengers on Flight 587 and how the community of Washington Heights was going to be affected.
<p> Washington Heights, where I live, was home of many of the passengers. Like Belle Harbor, it had also lost so many lives. Today, it's difficult to go into a local bodega without eavesdropping on a story of someone who died on that flight. 
<p> So I ask this question: When do we begin to care about a tragedy in a community, and when we care how do we choose what communities to care about? I ask this because on Nov. 12 I was hit much harder on an emotional level than on Sept. 11. And in both instances, I didn't directly know anyone who had died.
<p> After Sept. 11, I was afraid for my mother, who works in Rockefeller Center, and I feared that maybe this attack was the beginning of the end of the world. But something about the Flight 587 crash broke me down, especially when I finally got hold of the list of passengers and saw that, except for most of the crew, they were from the community. As I grieved, it was difficult to watch how the media relegated this event into a sidebar and, yes, I understand that the Northern Alliance was pushing the Taliban out of Kabul and that houses were on fire in Belle Harbor. But let's be real: Don't the crash and all its casualties deserve a little more coverage? 
<p> I wonder, how long will anyone who is not invested in some way care about Flight 587? Does the amount of compassion we feel for the families affected with any tragedy have to do with how much the media machine cares to cover?
<p>
 My mother thinks that the only reason the vigils in Washington Heights made the news is because Gov. George Pataki made the trip to the neighborhood. "Do you think anyone cares about us?" she said. And as we talk about the community and how much time was given in the media to the firefighters and their pain and work, she reminded me that our community lost 35 Dominicans in the World Trade Center. And they were also just doing their jobs. And now we lose more than 200 lives. "How much can this community bear?" she asks. And we continue asking these questions and wait to see if one day we will be able to flip on the channels and feel less invisible.
