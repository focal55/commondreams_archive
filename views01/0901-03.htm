News that North Carolina's Jesse Helms will retire from the Senate when his
term is up in 2003 received polite coverage in mainstream media. USA Today
(8/22/01) described Helms' views as "unabashed and outspoken conservatism."
To the Washington Post (8/22/01), Helms is one of the Senate's "most ardent
champions of conservative causes...a man of bold colors and few pastels."
Curiously using the past tense, the Los Angeles Times observed, "he
personified the unvarnished, uncompromising, attack-dog brand of
conservatism." (8/22/01)

<p>Most of the coverage alluded to Helms' unrepentant racism and homophobia--
though few called it that. Some outlets presented his bigotry as merely
accusations from political foes: "His opponents have accused him of using
race to win elections." (CBS Evening News, 8/21/01)  Overall, most outlets
painted Helms as a conservative whose career has merely been punctuated by
controversial episodes, not as a demagogue whose career has been defined by
the politics of hate and reaction.

<p>One exception was Washington Post columnist David Broder, whose August 29
column, headlined "Jesse Helms, White Racist," offered a glimpse into the
public record that many other reporters were side-stepping. 

<p>Broder offered a few examples of Helms' bigotry. There are many. 

<p>As an aide to the 1950 Senate campaign of North Carolina Republican
candidate Willis Smith, Helms reportedly helped create attack ads against
Smith's opponent, including one which read: "White people, wake up before it
is too late. Do you want Negroes working beside you, your wife and your
daughters, in your mills and factories? Frank Graham favors mingling of the
races." Another ad featured photographs Helms himself had doctored to
illustrate the allegation that Graham's wife had danced with a black man.
(The News and Observer 8/26/01; The New Republic, 6/19/95; The Observer,
5/5/96; "Hard Right: The Rise of Jesse Helms," by Ernest B. Furgurson,
Norton, 1986) 

<p>Ancient history? No. Helms remains unapologetic to this day.  Forty years
after the Smith campaign, Helms would win election against black opponent
Harvey Gantt with another ad playing to racist white fear-- the so-called
"white hands" ad, in which a white man's hands crumple a rejected job
application while a voiceover intones, "You needed that job...but they had
to give it to a minority." 

<p>In columns, commentaries and pronouncements from the Senate floor, Helms
sowed hatred and called names: The University of North Carolina was "the
University of Negroes and Communists." (Capital Times, 11/22/94) Black civil
rights activists were "Communists and sex perverts." (Copley News Service,
8/23/01) 

<p>Of civil rights protests Helms wrote, "The Negro cannot count forever on the
kind of restraint that's thus far left him free to clog the streets, disrupt
traffic, and interfere with other men's rights." (WRAL-TV commentary, 1963)
He also wrote, "Crime rates and irresponsibility among Negroes are a fact of
life which must be faced." (New York Times, 2/8/81)

<p>Over the years Helms has declared homosexuality "degenerate," and
homosexuals "weak, morally sick wretches." (Newsweek, 12/5/94) In a tirade
highlighting his routine opposition to AIDS research funding, Helms lashed
out at the Kennedy-Hatch AIDS bill in 1988: "There is not one single case of
AIDS in this country that cannot be traced in origin to sodomy." (States
News Service, 5/17/88)

<p>Helms remonstrated ten female members of the House of Representatives to
"act like ladies" when they interrupted a Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing to demand support of a U.N. treaty against gender discrimination,
and subsequently had them removed from the hearing by Capitol police. (St.
Louis Post-Dispatch, 10/28/99)

<p>And the man ABC News now describes as a "conservative icon" (8/22/01) in
1993 sang "Dixie" in an elevator to Carol Moseley-Braun, the first
African-American woman elected to the Senate, bragging, "I'm going to make
her cry. I'm going to sing Dixie until she cries." (Chicago Sun-Times,
8/5/93)

<p>More recently, when a caller to CNN's Larry King Live show praised guest
Jesse Helms for "everything you've done to help keep down the niggers,"
Helms' response was to salute the camera and say, "Well, thank you, I
think." (Wilmington Star-News, 9/16/95)

<p>Finally, Helms' strong if sometimes shadowy support for violent,
anti-democratic forces abroad, from South Africa to El Salvador, might have
given media outlets further pause in describing him as a mere conservative;
few probed his ties to groups that would more accurately be described as
fascist. One exception was an editorial in the Boston Globe (8/23/01):
"Helms' role in supporting foreign thugs such as Roberto D'Aubuisson, the
cashiered Salvadoran major who ran death squads responsible for savage
political murders, did lasting harm to America's good name. In South Africa,
Argentina, Mozambique, Honduras, and Nicaragua, Helms cooperated with
racists and fascists who have nothing in common with the ideals of American
democracy." 

<p>With 17 months remaining in his Senate term there will be many more
"send-offs" dedicated to Jesse Helms. It remains to be seen whether he will
continue to get kid glove treatment from the press, or if journalists will
choose to tell the unvarnished truth about Helms' career.
