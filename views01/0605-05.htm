In the Middle East, the news has gone from bad to worse. If the senseless suicide bombings by Palestinian militants in Israel and the indefensible abuses of human rights by the Israeli military on the West Bank and Gaza Strip were not enough, now Faisal Husseini is dead.
<P>Most Americans knew little of Husseini. Yet in Jerusalem, he was an epic - and supremely necessary - figure. The grandson of one of the last Palestinian mayors of Jerusalem, and the son of Abed al-Kadar, who lead the Arab revolt against British control of what was then called Palestine, Husseini was born into a family that understood perhaps better than any other the right of Arabs to claim a place in what may be the most conflicted city on the planet.
<P>For the better part of four decades, Husseini staked that claim, boldly challenging Israeli authorities as an open supporter of the Palestine Liberation Organization - which he and members of his family helped to form - and a grass-roots political player with all the savvy and determination of a Chicago ward leader.
<P>I met Husseini in 1989, during the first Palestinian Intifada, in which he played a critical leadership role. It was not hard to find him. He operated out of Orient House, a former hotel on a busy thoroughfare in predominantly Palestinian East Jerusalem. It was there that we met frequently over the years to talk, usually hopefully, about the prospects for peace <EM>and </EM>justice in a city where both those goals often seemed out of reach.
<P>The son of the commander of one of the strongest Palestinian militias in the struggle for control of the city in 1948, Husseini spent his childhood in Cairo. There he befriended a young Yasser Arafat and underwent officer training in the Palestine Liberation Army. After the Six-Day War of 1967, however, Husseini laid down his gun and moved to family property in East Jerusalem - which then, as now, was under Israeli control.
<P>He said he wanted to assert an organized Palestinian presence in the city. More precisely, he wanted to remind the Israelis that, despite intense pressure from Israeli rightists for their expulsion, Palestinian Christians and Muslims were not leaving a city that for them was every bit as holy as it was for Jews. He turned the Orient House into the Institute for Arab Studies, and began to agitate against Israeli seizures of Arab property on the edges of East Jerusalem.
<P>It was not easy work. Because of his PLO ties and involvement with street protests, neighborhood organizing and the Intifada, Husseini was frequently arrested and his freedom of movement was at times severely restricted by the Israeli government. Yet he persevered - learning Hebrew and cultivating progressive Jewish allies, including, at times, former Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek. Husseini believed that Jews, Christians and Muslims could live in peace in the city, yet that peace would never be achieved, he said, without justice - which would begin, he said, with Israel's acceptance of an Arab right of return, restoration of seized properties to rightful owners, and self-governance for East Jerusalem.
<P>When the Middle East peace process was being forged in the early 1990s, it was Husseini who organized the West Bank delegation to the 1991 Madrid conference. Because he lived in East Jerusalem, Israeli negotiators objected to Husseini's inclusion in the leadership of the Palestinian Authority. He did end up participating in the authority's Cabinet, however, as PLO representative for Jerusalem. But, just as he clashed with Israeli authorities, Husseini argued with his old friend Arafat - sometimes bitterly.
<P>In recent months, however, as the second Intifada stirred, Husseini was very much in the thick of it. He was a frequent presence at street protests in East Jerusalem, playing the complex role of agitator and moderating influence. It was a tightrope walk, yet one Husseini had mastered.
<P>That explains why, when he died unexpectedly of a heart attack last week, the streets of East Jerusalem were thick with mourning Palestinians and progressive Jews. Wise advocates on both sides of that city's deep divisions well recognized that the biblical injunction - "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem" - would be more difficult to realize in his absence.</p>
