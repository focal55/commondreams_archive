ST. PAUL &#151; U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone had just finished rousing 
              a crowd of 2,000 trade unionists, farmers, environmentalists and 
              students with a fiery condemnation of George W. Bush&#146;s free 
              trade policies, and now he had a problem. He couldn&#146;t get down 
              the steps of the Minnesota State Capitol here to join the march 
              protesting Bush&#146;s Free Trade Area of the Americas scheme.
<P>Wellstone is just too popular with his constituents. He couldn&#146;t 
              move in the face of a steady stream of men in Teamsters jackets, 
              farm wives holding newborns, green-haired college kids and Catholic 
              priests approaching to offer variations on the words of a steelworker 
              who told Wellstone, "I am so damn proud to be able to say you&#146;re 
              my senator."</P>
<P>Most of them also asked a question: "How come Bush hates you so 
              much?"</P>
<P>Let there be no doubt as to the identity of George W. Bush&#146;s 
              least favorite Democratic U.S. senator. It&#146;s Wellstone, the 
              rabble-rousing Progressive who represents not just Minnesota but 
              what remains of the fighting populist spirit of the Upper Midwest.</P>
<P>Elected in 1990 following a grass-roots campaign in which he toured 
              the state on a beat-up school bus, Wellstone was the No. 1 target 
              in 1996 for Republicans who thought the senator had doomed himself 
              with a lonely vote against punitive "welfare reform" legislation. 
              He won re-election with ease that year, proving to both the Republicans 
              and to their whimpering Democratic allies that bashing the poor 
              might not be nearly so smart a political move as Dick Morris thought.</P>
<P>As Wellstone prepares to seek a third term next year, it would 
              be reasonable to assume that he might finally be in for some smooth 
              political sailing. But reasonableness doesn&#146;t figure into the 
              calculations of the Bush White House, where the president himself, 
              Vice President Dick Cheney and political commissar Karl Rove practice 
              the politics of vengeance.</P>
<P>The Bushies despise Wellstone, who unlike most Senate Democrats 
              has been fighting spirited battles against the new administration&#146;s 
              policies on everything from the environment to the tax cuts for 
              the rich to military aid for the "Plan Colombia" drug war boondoggle. 
              Other Democratic senators who face re-election contests in 2002 
              are, according to polls, more vulnerable than Wellstone. But the 
              Bush camp has been focusing highest-level attention on "Plan Wellstone" 
              &#151; its project to silence progressive opposition.</P>
<P>Last Tuesday as Minnesota House Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty was 
              just hours away from announcing his intention to mount a Republican 
              challenge to Wellstone, he got an urgent call from Rove asking him 
              to step aside for Bush&#146;s preferred candidate, St. Paul Mayor 
              Norm Coleman.</P>
<P>Then, on Wednesday morning, with just 90 minutes to go before his 
              planned announcement, Pawlenty was driving his kids home from a 
              dental appointment. The car phone rang, and Pawlenty found himself 
              talking to Cheney. The vice president told Pawlenty that Bush did 
              not want Coleman &#151; a party-switching former Democrat who chaired 
              the losing Bush presidential campaign in Minnesota &#151; to face 
              a difficult primary contest from a credible Republican.</P>
<P>Pawlenty finally "agreed" to step aside.</P>
<P>Minnesota is not the only state where the Bush camp is seeking 
              to pick senators. But the level of involvement in the Wellstone 
              race is remarkable. Coleman dropped a planned gubernatorial bid 
              after two White House pressure sessions with Bush. And now that 
              Coleman is leaning toward a Senate race, Bush, Cheney and Rove are 
              pulling out all the stops to make sure they are in charge of the 
              anti-Wellstone effort.</P>
<P>Even Pawlenty, as he was proclaiming himself a "team player," admitted 
              that "it makes you wonder about the process and the integrity of 
              the process."</P>
<P>What does Wellstone say? "I think the way to oppose George W. Bush 
              is to stand up to him, to speak out when his policies are wrong, 
              to put holds on bad legislation he&#146;s promoting. Obviously, 
              that&#146;s not the sort of opposition Bush and Cheney approve of. 
              The nice thing is that, even if they can dictate the Republican 
              nominee, the people of Minnesota still get to choose their senator."
