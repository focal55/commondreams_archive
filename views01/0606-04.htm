<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She's into redefining paradigms. Picketing the World Bank office 
              in New Delhi, educating tribal groups and farmers in rural India, 
              lecturing multinationals, are her preferred weapons. That’s Vandana 
              Shiva, the celebrated eco-feminist, for you. Author of eleven books, 
              winner of the prestigious Right Livelihood Award—or the “alternative 
              Nobel”—and guest speaker at numerous universities on issues such 
              as eco-feminism, agricultural ecology, biotechnology, intellectual 
              property rights and globalisation (she claims all of them fit neatly 
              under the umbrella of environmental justice) is no stranger to awards.</font>
<p class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Which 
              is probably why she takes the latest accolade—Asiaweek magazine 
              has recently ranked Ms Shiva as the fifth most powerful communicator 
              in Asia—in her stride.</font></p>
<p class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              “I have known for a long time that global corporations who are making 
              everyone run scared just now—from the World Trade Organisation, 
              to our premier and finance minister—run scared themselves when I 
              sit across the table and debate with them,” she says with a broad 
              smile. Yet, she refuses to take herself too seriously. “Now how 
              much that translates into any other form of power, I have no idea”, 
              she guffaws. But, after a pregnant pause, she adds that her success 
              as a communicator is a result of her deep convictions: “I don’t 
              say, write or act upon anything unless I am deeply convinced myself”.</font></p>
<p class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              Interestingly, this “powerful communicator” is often accused of 
              distorting facts. Jairam Ramesh, member of the Congress party says, 
              “She’s so scholarly and articulate, so of course she’s a good communicator. 
              But unfortunately, with her, any resemblance to facts is totally 
              coincidental. She’s been proven wrong many, many times. In fact, 
              her misinformed convictions make her dangerous”.</font></p>
<p class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              A senior member of the Bharatiya Janata Party concurs. The gentleman, 
              who had occasion to participate in a debate with her, was left ruing 
              the encounter as a complete waste of time. “Her facts were just 
              wrong. I spent most of my time correcting them instead of debating 
              with her”.</font></p>
<p class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              Fellow NGO activist Pradeep S Mehta of the Centre for International 
              Trade, Economics and Environment (CITEE), also wonders about her 
              communication abilities. “Although she can communicate well, she’s 
              been able to get through to only those who remain in tight compartments. 
              She’ll not be able to convert those who are in the know. Moreover, 
              she doesn’t like to enter into a debate on a serious platform”.</font></p>
<p class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              A respected intellectual property expert, part of the Indian government’s 
              team on IPR issues, is also a bit sceptical. “We had to dismiss 
              two petitions which she filed against the Indian government, alleging 
              bio-piracy by international companies, because her own statements 
              were found to be inconsistent”.</font></p>
<p class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
              Critics question her credibility. Mr Mehta feels she’s too much 

              of a jetsetter and accuses her of hypocrisy. “She talks about sustainable 
              agriculture, yet uses chemicals on her farm.” So does the BJP functionary. 
              “If she’s so anti-MNCs why does she go off to (the World Economic 
              Forum at) Davos, that ultimate rich club of the MNCs”?</font></p>
<p class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              Others doubt her motives. “She’s a lobbyist out to scuttle the economic 
              progress of India. Where does she get her funding from?”, asks one.</font></p>
<p class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              Ask Ms Shiva about the violent feeling she inspires (her website 
              was recently hacked and linked to a pornographic site), and she 
              returns matter of factly: “You have to treat both (love and hate) 
              with equal detachment. It’s the price you pay for the work you choose 
              to do.”</font></p>
<p class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              Press on and she points out that her international work and subsequent 
              recognition are a logical progression of her work at home. “From 
              1982-1985 I concentrated on local issues because by that time I’d 
              already travelled the world and been an international expert. But 
              during that time I realised that every one of the projects I was 
              working on had been financed by the World Bank. So in 1984-85 I 
              started to study World Bank financing. Then, when in 1985, I was 
              asked to spearhead the Save the Rain Forest campaign, (“I’d done 
              all the studies on rain forests”), that was the start of linking 
              back internationally”.</font></p>
<p class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
              Ask her why liberal, forward-looking Indians remain sceptical of 
              her activism and she tells you that it stems from an Indian trait: 
              pulling down someone who’s successful.”The West has a civilisational 
              crisis. They’ve recognised that they need to find an alternative. 
              That’s why my writings have struck a chord with them”.</font></p>
<p class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              Her various critics notwithstanding, Ms Shiva does have a substantial 
              following, within and without India. Which is probably why Asiaweek 
              believes an increasing number of governments, multilateral institutions 
              and global corporations are listening to her words of wisdom. But 
              Rome wasn’t built in a day and Ms Shiva, the paradigm warrior, was 
              effectively born 19 years ago, in 1982.</font></p>
<p class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              After finishing her PhD in Foundations of Quantum Theory in 1979, 
              she dabbled in science and taught science policy for a while. Then, 
              in 1982, she did a study on mining in the Doon valley for the ministry 
              of environment, a study which resulted in the first ever Supreme 
              Court judgment stopping economic activity on grounds of environmental 
              destruction. “That study made me realise that there was an entry-vacuum 
              of an independent research system and so, the same year, I set up 
              the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Natural Resource 
              Policy”. </font></p>
<p class="bodycopy"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1982-1985 
              found Ms Shiva working on local issues: forest conservation in the 
              Himalayas, water issues, mining in the Doon valley, campaigns against 
              dams etc. By 1985, she had started to focus on agro-ecology. At 
              the same time, two of her books Violence of the Green Revolution 
              (which arose from her study on Conflict over Resources for the United 
              Nations University) and Staying Alive, became huge hits abroad, 
              perhaps as a result of her initial fame (remember ‘Save the Rain 
              Forests’?).</font></p>
<p class="bodycopy">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
By 1987 she had graduated to debunking globalisation and strongly 
              opposing intellectual property rights which she felt were tools 
              used by MNCs to perpetuate their monopolies. This latter was nicely 
              timed, with the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations 
              (1986-1993) under way and, by 1995 when the World Trade Organisation 
              came into existence, she was firmly perched on the anti-globalisation 
              bandwagon. Her latest addition, to an already lengthy list of causes, 
              is agricultural biotechnology. “Genetic modification of crops is 
              manipulation of life,” she declares with evident distaste.
