            IF THE SENATE Judiciary Committee straightens its backbone rather 
            than slap the back of attorney general nominee John Ashcroft, we may 
            get to see why his hallucinations about Bull Run will make him a bull 
            in the china closet of civil rights. 
            <P> 
            <P>Any serious line of questioning should start like this:
            <P> 
            <P>Senator Ashcroft, you praised Southern Partisan magazine for ''defending 
              patriots like Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and Jefferson Davis. 
              Traditionalists must do more. I've got to do more. We've all got 
              to stand up and speak in this respect, or else we'll be taught that 
              these people were giving their lives, subscribing their sacred fortunes 
              and their honor to some perverted agenda.'' Let's explore what you 
              meant by that.
            <P> 
            <P>Senator, why are you, in the year 2001, praising Davis, the president 
              of the Confederacy, who personally italicized the portions of the 
              Constitution that preserved slavery? Why do you laud a man who said 
              white superiority over African-Americans was ''stamped from the 
              beginning, marked in decree and prophecy''?
            <P> 
            <P>Why do you love a man whose vice president, Alexander Stephens, 
              said the ''cornerstone'' of the Confederacy ''rests upon the great 
              truth that the Negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, 
              subordination, to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition''?
            <P> 
            <P>Why do you complain about Davis being maligned by historians when 
              Davis tried to rewrite history? He said on the floor of the US Senate 
              in 1860 that ''Negroes formed but a small part of people of the 
              southern states.''
            <P> 
            <P>For the record, in 1860 black people were 55 percent of the population 
              in Davis's home state of Mississippi, 58 percent of South Carolina, 
              and between a third to a half of the people of most of the rest 
              of the slave states. Now, senator, I am reading this sentence again, 
              where you say we've all got to stand up or else we'll be taught 
              that Davis, Lee, and Jackson were subscribing their ''sacred fortunes'' 
              to some ''perverted'' agenda. That sounds a lot like what Davis 
              said in his first Confederate inaugural address when he said the 
              North ''would pervert that most sacred of all trusts.''
            <P> 
            <P>Senator, since we know that that sacred trust was slavery, what 
              is it that you are trying to say? Does that mean you will not investigate 
              charges of black voter fraud in Florida?
            <P> 
            <P>Senator, let's move on to Lee. You say today's history books ''make 
              no mention of Lee's military genius!'' Why is that so important 
              to you when the same Lee called Mexicans ''idle worthless and vicious''? 
              Why do you praise a man who said as he exterminated Indians: ''The 
              whole race is extremely uninteresting ... they are not worth it.'' 
              Where can we find Lee's genius in saying that killing Indians was 
              ''the only corrective they understand and the only way in which 
              they can be taught to keep within their own limits''?
            <P> 
            <P>Why is Lee so good when he justified the ripping of black people 
              out of Africa to enslave them by saying, ''The blacks are immeasurably 
              better off here than in Africa, morally, socially, and physically. 
              The painful discipline they are undergoing is necessary for their 
              instruction as a race''?
            <P> 
            <P>Why does Lee need to be revered when his troops, like other Confederate 
              divisions, hated free black people so much that they sometimes massacred 
              defeated black Union soldiers even though they had thrown down their 
              arms in surrender?
            <P> 
            <P>Senator, may I read you a passage from the new book, ''The Making 
              of Robert E. Lee,'' by Michael Fellman? A Confederate major wrote 
              in 1864 after one battle, ''such slaughter I have not witnessed 
              upon any battlefield anywhere. Their men were principally Negroes 
              and we shot them down until we got near enough and then run them 
              through with the bayonet ... We was not very particular whether 
              we captured or killed them, the only thing we did not like to be 
              pestered burying the heathens.''
            <P> 
            <P>Senator, why do you praise Lee when, after the Civil War, he actively 
              resisted Reconstruction? Lee said white people are ''inflexibly 
              opposed to any system of laws that would place the political power 
              of the country in the hands of the Negro race.'' He said black people 
              lacked the ''intelligence ... necessary to make them safe repositories 
              of political power.''
            <P> 
            <P>Senator, thank you, but in light of your reverence for such men, 
              we'll be asking President-elect Bush to appoint a less antebellum 
              attorney general. As you leave, stop by the front desk. The clerk 
              will arrange for you to participate in a Civil War reenactment in 
              the slave state of your choice. Please send us a photo of your experience. 
              We would love to see who you dressed up as. We're betting against 
              Frederick Douglass.
