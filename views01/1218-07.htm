If you want to know how strange it's getting in America, talk to Barry Reingold.

<P>Reingold is a 60-year-old retired phone-company worker from the Bay Area who's
old enough to withdraw from his IRA without penalty.

<P>His parents are Jewish. But Reingold prefers to be known as your basic, average
American.

<P>Reingold works out every day at a gym in San Francisco, and has done so for the
last six years.

<P>Since Sept. 11, he's been exercising not only his muscles but also his right to
free speech. Reingold recalls conversations he's had with people in the weight
room about the war.

<P>"It gets pretty heated," he told me over the phone last week. "People say what
dogs those terrorists are. But I've said, 'Look at what a dog George Bush is.'"

<P>That's not exactly a popular position to take these days.

<P>"Look at all the hundreds of thousands of workers being laid off in the United
States," Reingold continued. "This war is not just about getting terrorists. It's
also about money and corporate oil profits."

<P>Ahem. This is the kind of talk that gets people's heartbeats racing even without
a Stairmaster. 

<P>"People question my loyalty," Reingold continued. "They say, 'You don't support
America.' And I say, 'Sure I do. I work here. I was born here. I pay taxes. I
just have a problem with the ruling class.'"

<P>Reingold's not sure, but he's next to positive that his First Amendment workout
got him a visitation from the FBI.

<P>The FBI, you will recall, has begun knocking on the doors of an estimated 85
people in the Bay Area who are among 5,000 in the nation singled out as
"potential witnesses." They are men ages 18-33 who possess visas and passports
from Arab and Muslim countries where there are known Al Qaeda operatives.

<P>As it turns out, the list of 5,000 is a much smaller subset of an even larger
group of people being interviewed. From Sept. 11 to November alone, the FBI
received more than 435,000 tips.

<P>And, as Reingold found out, you don't have to be Arab or Muslim to get nominated
for a house call.

<P>"I have a speaker downstairs in my apartment building to let people in," Reingold
said. "One afternoon, someone buzzes. And I said, 'Who's there?' And they say,
'The FBI.' And I'm thinking, 'Why is the FBI here?'"

<P>He buzzed them into the building and met them in the hallway. There were two
young men, one white, one black, apparently in their 20s. Reingold asked them for
ID, and the two flashed him their badges.

<P>"And so I asked them what this was all about," Reingold recalled. "And they asked
me if I was a member of the gym [in San Francisco]. And I said yes.

<P>"And then they said someone in the gym had reported that I had been talking about
terrorism and Sept. 11, oil profits, capitalism and Afghanistan," Reingold said.
"And I said, 'Oh, really.'"

<P>Reingold didn't think about calling a lawyer. "At the time, I was sort of shaken
up," he admitted to me. "If I were in my right mind, I probably would have met
them outside the building, where I could have witnesses for all to see this. Or
at least have pencil and paper to take the agents' names and notes."

<P>But he didn't.

<P>"And then the FBI guy said, 'You know you have the right to freedom of speech,'"
Reingold recalled. "And I said, 'Yes, I know I do, don't I? And that's the end of
the conversation. I don't wish to talk to you any further.'"

<P>What did they say to that?

<P>"That they had to write a report," said Reingold. "And I said, 'I'm sorry.' And
they said, 'But we really have to write a report.' At that point I just closed
the door, and that was it."

<P>The agents didn't force the issue, nor were they coercive. But Reingold was
bothered and upset. Here he was, just a regular guy expressing his opinion. You
know, one of those freedoms we are supposedly defending in the war.

<P>Reingold confronted the gym about his privacy having been violated, but the gym
manager at the 24 Hour Fitness Center on Folsom Street in San Francisco never
officially responded. When I called the club, manager Chris Robinson responded to
inquiries with a chilly, "No comment."

<P>The only thing Reingold has done to date is file an affadavit
with an attorney to commemorate the FBI visitation. It wasn't until then that he
understood the true nature of what had happened to him.

<P>"It's like we're becoming a police state," Reingold said.

<P>Reingold firmly believes that had he been Arab or Muslim, it would have been much
worse for him. He's certain he would have been taken in for more vigorous
questioning, maybe even jailed. Then, he said, he'd have to decide which was
worse, fascism or racism.

<P>Reingold isn't sure what recourse he has now, if any. But at the very least, his
story should serve as a cautionary tale for those concerned about what's
happening on the domestic front in this war on terror.

<P>Lucas Gutentag of the National ACLU's Immigrant Rights Project believes most
people aren't concerned about what's going on with internal security in this
nation because they're under the impression that the FBI is targeting and
profiling mainly noncitizens.

<P>"It camouflages the full effects of the [Justice Department's] policies because
[citizens] don't feel directly affected, " Gutentag said. "But the principles the
government is relying on result in the same kind of practices against everyone."

<P>If you don't think it can happen to you in America, just ask Barry Reingold, an
average American with a strong opinion.
