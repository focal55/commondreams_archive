DOES ANYBODY else have the feeling that we're at war? I mean the United States, along with its client states, foremost among them, us?
<P></P>
It's always been a dependable strategy. When the economy gets ropy, start a war; it takes the folks' minds off lousy pay, lousy prospects, lousy credit, and there not being any dough left under the mattress.
<P></P>
If anybody else has the feeling that some very foul-tempered ghosts are storming around, knocking over the furniture and making the dog howl, then they probably have the same question I do. Who exactly are we at war with?
<P></P>
The way George W. Bush is running things, the answer appears to be - and it is enough to make your lungs break out in a rash - nobody knows. And George doesn't care. It doesn't matter to him. The thing is, he wants a war and he's damn-well going to have one, even if there's nobody on the other side.
<P></P>
This isn't so much a geopolitical strategy, or a return to those warm, sunsplashed days of the Cold War, or to the 1930s, or pre-1914, or even the 1800s. This is medieval. Crusaders massing, swords unsheathed, and with the cross of Jesus going on before.
<P></P>
George takes it all in jovial stride. Back when these new Middle Ages were dawning, Ronald Reagan was in the White House, and he seemed - it was a little bit nervous-making - somewhat out of touch. He had delegated authority for everything but eating; delegated it to some really scary people.
<P></P>
George W., a similar, (apparently) amiable, ``disengaged'' bonehead, is doing the same thing, and the enemies of peace who are his principal operatives are having a picnic, only with grizzlies instead of teddy bears. If you go into the woods today, you'd better not go unarmed.
<P></P>
The other day, Bush made a joke about his skills with the language, and about having once said this: ``When I was coming up'' - that's Texan for ``growing up'' - ``it was a dangerous world and we knew exactly who the they were. It was us versus them. And it was clear who the them was. Today, we're not so sure who the they are, but we know they're there.''
<P></P>
What's dangerous for us, though, is that when he originally said that, he meant it. However the hell it parses, he was serious. And he is poking America's big stick into every hornets' nest he can find: North Korea, Russia, China. Divide and conquer? Not George's gang. Get 'em to circle their wagons and show 'em who's boss.
<P></P>
Two of the most hawkish people in the galaxy, Colin Powell, his secretary of state, and Condoleeza Rice, his national security adviser, are being elbowed aside because they're not hawkish enough for Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, and Dick Cheney, the vice-president and honorary chief executive officer of the new military-industrial complex, which, as complexes go, will make the old one seem like an adolescent neurosis.
<P></P>
Any of you who remember Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove will recall George C. Scott's character, Buck Turgidson, the sex-crazed general who was forever invoking God's name and calling for silence in the war room so he could lead - ``Listen up, now'' - those assembled in prayer. What a splendid joke! Except, of course, the joke lives and is running the show in Washington today; Kubrick wasn't simply prescient, he was a prophet. For those of you who are too young, and if my memory serves, the movie was subtitled How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb.
<P></P>
The U.S. wasn't the only, or even a particularly considerable, power when the halls of Montezuma and the shores of Tripoli found themselves up to their yingyangs in marines. Now there's aircraft-carrier diplomacy and Star Wars anti-missile-missile-rattling - give back our spy plane, China, or else. Memo to CNN: ``You furnish the pictures, I will furnish the war.'' It's as American as apple pie and sending exploding cigars to Fidel.
<P></P>
If it seems to have the diplomatic delicacy of a hand grenade down the front of the opposition's trousers - whoever the opposition is, but George knows it's there - it was explained by a Washington observer who said of the Bushies, ``These guys are linear thinkers.''
<P></P>
If you're not exactly clear what linear thinking means, here's how it has worked from the very start: See Og. Og have mastodon haunch. Hit Og over head with rock. Now me have mastodon haunch.
