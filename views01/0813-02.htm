Fresh out of graduate school 25 years ago I was offered a job as a
summer intern by Erwin Knoll, the editor of <I>The Progressive</I>
magazine. Erwin could be cantankerous and opinionated, a quality that
often surfaced in his regular PBS appearances during the last years
of his life. Nonetheless, he was a brilliant and articulate observer
of our political economy. Conversations about corporate morality
within our offices were at least as illuminating as any graduate
school seminar.
<P>Erwin liked to recount a long-standing debate with a friend and
former colleague, Morton Mintz of the <I>Washington Post</I>. Mintz,
now retired, was one of the most skilled and respected investigative
journalists of his generation. He was one of the first to expose
predatory pricing and deceptive advertising practices in the drug
industry. Erwin respected Mintz's work, but he frequently chided him
for implying that corporate malfeasance is an aberration. Didn't he
recognize that abuse of the larger social good, even to the point of
outright disobedience of the law, was intrinsic to
corporate-dominated marketplaces?</P>

<P>These conversations were reignited for me when another of Erwin's
former sparring partners, Bill Moyers, presented a documentary on the
chemical industry last spring. "Trade Secrets" was based on an
immense trove of corporate files obtained in a wrongful death suit
involving a former chemical plant worker. The documents demonstrate
that major chemical manufacturers, though apparent competitors,
closed ranks in the late 1950s to suppress evidence of vinyl
chloride's toxicity. The industry freely shared internal evidence on
the health risks of vinyl chloride, but it was deceitful in the
information provided to its workers, the physicians who treated them,
and the government. Preserving and expanding the market for vinyl
chloride trumped all other considerations.</P>

<P>In its response to Moyers, the industry maintains that such
documentaries are one sided. They fail to acknowledge the many
contributions that vinyl chloride makes to our lives. But this
industry response misses the point. Workers, consumers, and
regulators were entitled to a full accounting of the risks of vinyl
chloride so that steps could be taken to limit risks and delineate
appropriate uses for the product.</P>

<P>Nor is Moyers merely covering the bad old days. After 276 people
filed lawsuits claiming that Dursban, Dow's indoor insecticide,
poisoned them, the company still withheld internal documents that
demonstrated its toxicity. When the truth finally came out in 1996,
the company was fined a mere $740,000 by the Federal government for
withholding information. Outrageous conduct proved to be a sound
business decision.</P>

<P>Not surprisingly, the chemical industry ranks right below the
tobacco industry in levels of public distrust. Unfortunately,
however, shameful practices are far more widespread than is widely
reported or generally acknowledged. If chemical firms produce toxic
soup, many other corporate cohorts are more than willing to dispense
and dispose of the soup -- at our expense. Up until PCB's were banned
in the mid-'70s, General Electric dumped more than a million pounds
of the substance into the Hudson River. The company now declares it
wishes to be a good corporate citizen and limit any future discharge.
Nonetheless, it doggedly fights any effort to make it pay for the
Hudson River cleanup. As Russell Mokhiber reports, "GE has pulled out
all the stops to block the dredging plan ... Among other hardball
tactics, the company deployed NBC President and GE Vice Chair Robert
Wright to lobby New York City Council members against a bill
endorsing the dredging project."</P>

<P>Historically, many of the risks that new chemicals pose have been
discovered through the active sleuthing of concerned workers and
neighborhood associations. But all across the board, corporations
work to limit the access, information, and power on which such
challenges may be based. Kate Bronfenbrenner of Cornell University, a
widely respected student of labor-management relations, finds that
more than 60% of employers confronting a union organizing drive use
five or more antiunion tactics, both legal and illegal. One in 10
worker advocates of unionization are illegally fired, and plant
closing or relocation is threatened in more than 50% of organizing
attempts.</P>

<P>At the very least, many of our largest and most influential
corporations treat their competitors, employees, and consumers in
ways that parents would chastise in their children. Unfortunately,
the pressures on and opportunities for corporations to act in
deleterious ways are if anything only growing. Stock markets and the
fund managers who dominate them are ever more obsessed with
short-term profits. Unions and other grass roots bodies have ever
less access to corporate affairs. Isolated and insulated from critics
save only those who seek even higher profits, even more corporation
executives today could follow an Eisenhower era CEO who assured
industry critics that "what's good for GM is good for the country."
Their crimes are often less a reflection of individual character than
of the social matrix in which the modern corporation operates.</P>
