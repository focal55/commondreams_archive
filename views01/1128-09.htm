There is an eerie quiet across the land.&nbsp; The chance of a second
major terrorist attack is somewhere between “very likely” and “100%
guaranteed,” according to the people we pay with our tax dollars to know
such things.&nbsp; I feel like I am on a huge bus heading straight toward
a cliff.&nbsp; We could suggest that the driver steer in a different
direction.&nbsp; But no one wants to talk about it.
<p>
Perhaps this is a school bus, where the kids sit quietly because they
don’t want to make the driver mad.&nbsp; Back in early October, news
leaked out that intelligence officials told Congress another attack was
100% certain, if we attacked Afghanistan.&nbsp; The driver -- the
president -- got very mad, indeed.&nbsp; He threatened to limit
Congressional briefings drastically (and then backed off).&nbsp; But Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer had already warned:&nbsp; “People have to watch
what they say.”&nbsp;&nbsp; The news media got the message.&nbsp; Some
things are better left unmentioned - even impending disaster.
<p>
Or perhaps we believe that changing direction won’t help anyway.&nbsp;
The president has tried to convince us that nothing we do can influence
the terrorists.&nbsp; Sometimes he describes them as Nazis, bent on
conquering us because they hate our freedoms.&nbsp; Sometimes he paints
them as inhuman demons, bent on evil for evil’s sake.&nbsp; In either
case, there is no way to deter them from their appointed villainy; we are
on a bus with no steering wheel.&nbsp; Most Americans seem to believe
that.
<p>
But let’s suppose Osama bin Laden speaks for the criminals.&nbsp; (If he
doesn’t, current U.S. policy is pointless.)&nbsp;&nbsp; He does not try
to tell us how we should live here at home.&nbsp; He does define specific
new policy directions he wants us to take in his part of the world:&nbsp;
get U.S. troops out of Saudi Arabia; end bombing and sanctions in Iraq;
stop supporting Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.&nbsp; These
may or may not be wise policies for us.&nbsp; But they are not wholly
unthinkable.&nbsp; And they might give us a chance of veering away from
the cliff.&nbsp; Aren’t they worth talking about?&nbsp; 
<p>
Some say this would be appeasement.&nbsp; Do we want to send others the
message that terrorism pays?&nbsp; But put the question another
way:&nbsp; Do we want to send the message that, on rare occasions when
our government's policies drive people to suicidal desperation and
homicidal rage, we will at least discuss those policies?&nbsp; When our
policies put thousands of American lives at risk, don’t we want to weigh
the wisdom of those policies against the potential loss of life?&nbsp;
Why not send that message?&nbsp; Is it unreasonable?&nbsp; 
<p>
There is surely no guarantee that a change in U.S. policies would avert
the next attack.&nbsp; But it might.&nbsp; If staying the present course
means a certainty of another attack (as Congress was told), then the math
is simple:&nbsp; changing policies makes us relatively safer than
continuing the present policies.
<p>
Of course safety may not be the highest value.&nbsp; Our present policies
in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Israel may be so important that they are worth
the loss of thousands more American lives.&nbsp; But that is a decision
for all of us passengers on the bus to make.&nbsp; This is a democracy,
where the driver is suppose to heed the majority will.&nbsp; If we leave
all decisions up to the driver, we give up the democratic freedom we are
supposedly defending.&nbsp; And it looks like the driver is hell-bent to
take us over the cliff.&nbsp; 
<p>
So principle and self-preservation both lead to the same
conclusion.&nbsp; It is time to break the silence and start a national
debate, before it is too late.&nbsp; The alternative is to wait until the
next thousands die.&nbsp; That would be terrible, not only for the
victims and their loved ones, but for the whole nation.&nbsp; After the
next attack, some will insist that the new deaths make the old policies
more sacred and inviolable; to change them would mean that all the
victims died in vain.&nbsp; Others will be equally convinced that we must
change policies as the only way of avoiding further catastrophe.&nbsp;
The more deaths, the more polarized we will become.&nbsp; Anyone old
enough to remember the Vietnam war knows that.&nbsp; 
<p>
We can insist that the driver turn the wheel in a new direction.&nbsp;
Perhaps we should insist.&nbsp; Perhaps not.&nbsp; But surely now, while
we can still talk to each other, is the time to start talking about
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
