The coming of the Bush administration has changed lots of things in
Washington, as it will across the country, but few Americans have been
more affected by President George W. Bush's court-decreed victory than
civic-activist-turned-presidential-candidate Ralph Nader. Once a pillar
of the progressive community, a fixture at congressional hearings, Nader
now finds that many of his longtime allies are shunning him in the wake
of his Green Party campaign, which was one prominent factor in Al Gore's
defeat. Nader spoke with The Times from his office in Washington.
<center>
* * *
</center>
Question: How do you assess the Bush presidency after its first few
months?
<p>Answer: The administration has not really jelled. They have yet to
make many of their appointments. Others are yet to be confirmed by the
Senate. What has happened, so far, is not surprising, except that the
appointments have reflected some diversity. What [former President Bill]
Clinton did with his last-minute environmental standards was pretty
provocative. He could have issued these standards a long time ago. The
ergonomics standards were ready in 1995. He did it at the end of his
administration to burnish his historic image a bit, but also to lay a
trap for Bush, and Bush fell into it. Now Bush is backing off on some
things--the lead standards, salmonella. It shows a recognition on his
part that a major party can't be overtly anti-environmental.
<p>Q: But he hasn't backed off on changing the standard for arsenic in
drinking water, or drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
<p>A: Arctic drilling is going nowhere. The Democrats, in a rare display
of willpower, will oppose it, largely because [Massachusetts Sen.] John
Kerry, who's running for president, is threatening to filibuster. And
when it starts to come out that oil from Alaska is actually being shipped
to Japan, that will undermine the credibility of the administration's
claims that this will help solve the energy shortages here. But the
Democrats have been quite namby-pamby in opposing Bush overall. They
voted unanimously to confirm Spencer Abraham as secretary of Energy. They
couldn't get more than 25 votes against Interior Secretary Gail Norton.
They could have stopped John Ashcroft's confirmation as attorney general,
but they didn't. When the Democrats were in the White House, they didn't
fight; now that they're in the congressional minority, they don't fight.
And it's the corporations that set the parameters.
<p>Q: How do you think labor should respond to the new administration?
It's hard to see any upside for unions at the moment.
<p>A: Maybe they'll put some of their huge reserves into organizing. Is
the AFL-CIO pushing the limits of its power? Of course not. Where are the
5,000 new organizers that the unions could afford to hire? Where are the
giant demonstrations they could mount? Check the size of the UAW's
financial reserves. Under Clinton, union leaders had invitations to fly
on Air Force One. They don't have that now, so they could choose to
become more muscular. This is not an administration that's as mean as it
could be. Bush is not that kind of character. He's kind of lazy and
doesn't like too much conflict. He's receiving weekly briefings on global
warming from both sides, which is upsetting [syndicated columnist] Bob
Novak. There are some business interests that believe global warming is
real, and the White House is having good scientists come in and say,
"It's real."
<p>Q: But the most fundamental policy of the new administration is its
tax cut proposal, which does shift everything rightward.
<p>A: The Bush tax cuts could certainly set us up for a decade of
destabilization, as [President Ronald] Reagan's did. But why are the
Democrats saying it was a victory in the Senate when they held it down to
$1.2 trillion? The problem, maestro, is with the Democrats, with labor,
with the citizens groups: They didn't make big enough of a case for
public works, spelling out what the cut took away from public transit,
from safe drinking water, from schools.
<p>Q: A lot of those Democrats and unionists and environmentalists blame
you for Bush being in the White House. If you hadn't run, they say, Bush
wouldn't be president.
<p>A: I say they should take a trip to Tennessee, to Arkansas, to South
Florida. They need to be reminded of the "what-ifs" that were under their
control. Gore could have had Clinton go to Arkansas; he would have
carried Arkansas if he'd unleashed Clinton there. And Tennessee is his
home state. The only presidential candidate in the 20th century not to
carry his home state before Gore was George McGovern, who, unlike Gore,
lost just about everywhere. And in Florida, Democrat-controlled counties
didn't recount their votes in time. But they really should be mad at
George W., because he took 13 times the Democratic votes in Florida that
I did. Look, we're engaged in a long-term political reform effort. You
don't embark on that kind of thing if you're concerned about the other
parties' two candidates. For the past 20 years, the Democrats have been
telling progressives that they've got nowhere else to go, that the
Republicans are worse. I don't accept that.
<p>Q: What if you had run in the Democratic primaries? You would have
debated Gore and Bill Bradley. You would have been able to address the
Democratic Convention in prime time.
<p>A: It would have been a will-of-the-wisp, amnesiac experience. The
only thing they pay attention to is how many votes you take from them in
November.
<p>Q: Except for the Republicans under an exceptional set of
circumstances, third parties in America haven't evolved into major
parties. What's the trajectory you foresee for the Greens?
<p>A: Locally, the Greens have a lot of opportunities to win. They've had
substantial victories in Madison and Milwaukee. It's good to start
locally. Then they can move up to the state level. You're talking about a
long-range dynamic of the party working its way upward. And the political
situation could always change: There could be a recession or an
environmental catastrophe that could afford a greater opportunity if the
Greens are ready. In the near future, they will move into certain
congressional districts where there's no realistic Democratic challenger.
We have to keep the progressive agenda alive. The Democrats will get the
message, but they'll have to lose a few seats first. Besides, what will
the trajectory of American politics be if the Greens don't succeed? By
the year 2020, someone like [Republican House Whip] Tom DeLay will seem
centrist in the Democratic Party. The movement is all rightward. Some
Democratic progressives in Congress--Cynthia McKinney [D-Ga.], Jesse
Jackson Jr. [D-Ill.]--and senators like Russ Feingold and Paul Wellstone
understand this. They've been privately praiseworthy--Jackson,
publicly--of what we did.
<p>Q: You've spoken before about Greens having to run against Democrats,
even progressives like Wellstone.
<p>A: I doubt Greens will be running against these kinds of Democrats.
They're more likely to run against conservative Democrats, or someone who
just gives lip service to liberal causes. We may have helped cost the
Democrats a couple of House seats, but Maria Cantwell [D-Wash.] wouldn't
be in the Senate without Green support. And we really went after Sen.
Spencer Abraham in Michigan, who lost to a Democrat, Debbie Stabenow.
<p>Q: But the Democrats narrowly lost the Ann Arbor House seat Stabenow
left to run for the Senate. And a Green candidate got more votes than the
margin of difference.
<p>A: Can you imagine the Democrats losing in a place like Ann Arbor? How
do you wake up a party that still persists in running conservative
candidates? Their eternal answer is, "We're better than the Republicans."
That's not going to do the trick.
<p>Q: A number of longtime and ardent backers of you and your causes--the
trial lawyers, in particular--seem to have cooled their ardor for you in
the wake of the election. They've withdrawn financial support.
<p>A: They have. Some of them have. They cling to the lesser evil, though
the Democrats' defense of tort law wasn't all that vigorous. The
Democrats take the trial lawyers' money, but they haven't really mounted
a defense of jury trials, which were a central tenet of the founders'
opposition to King George. I tried to get Gore to respond to Bush's
attacks on the tort system, but he didn't do anything. And this is what
the trial lawyers are clinging to. Why?
<p>Q: Besides the trial lawyers, do you have political problems now in
California? The state is undergoing this energy crisis, and you've
largely stayed away.
<p>A: I've actually been saying a lot on the energy crisis. We've tried
to push the California congressional delegation to be more militant
toward the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [which approves wholesale
electric rates].
<p>Q: How do you assess Gov. Gray Davis' performance? Should he have
invoked eminent domain over the power plants or the grid?
<p>A: Davis should have bought them out and expanded public power
generally. Electricity is too important to be a private commodity
manipulated by greedy companies. You know, we went through this fight
decades ago; that's why over 2,200 municipalities in the U.S. own their
own electric companies. That's why today, in Los Angeles and Sacramento,
the power companies are not worrying about stock options or their
investments in Indonesia. They're just focusing on delivering electricity
affordably and reliably. The Legislature gave the energy companies all
that they wanted in '96; they deregulated them and picked up their
stranded costs. Now they want another bailout? Davis should have bought
them out, not bailed them out. He should have acted as soon as the prices
spiked in San Diego last summer. The only good thing is that energy
conservation is becoming more of a focal point for public policy. Davis
could move California more toward renewable sources like wind and
co-generation. It could be a very good thing, but he's not that kind of
leader.
