The way Jane Ariel sees it, "I couldn't be a Jew and not get involved 
with Women in Black."
<P>That might strike many people as a deeply ironic statement, given the fact 
that Women in Black was founded in Jerusalem in 1988 to protest the Israeli 
occupation of Palestinian territories.
<P>"I hate the Palestinian suicide bombers, but I am not surprised at them," 
said Ariel, a Berkeley family therapist who holds both U.S. and Israeli 
citizenship. "I look at Israel and say, 'You are my country. I love you, but 
you are doing something that is unconscionable.' "
<P>Ariel is one of three dual citizens among the 13-woman, predominately 
Jewish organizing core of Bay Area Women in Black. As chapters have spread 
throughout the Middle East, Europe and the United States -- there are now more 
than 170 -- the organization's message has grown, too. It now includes a 
commitment to "active, nonviolent protest against all forms of personal and 
state violence and terrorism, including militarism, anti-Semitism, racism and 
religious oppression."
<P>Like many of their sister chapters, Bay Area Women in Black took a page 
from the book of South African and Latin American women who walked the streets 
or assembled in plazas to grieve their apartheid dead or the "disappeared." 
They wear the color of mourning and march, wordlessly, to a funereal drumbeat.
<P>In a world filled with angry shouts for vengeance, Women in Black stand 
silent and solemn. In a social climate devoid of dialogue, they are determined 
to listen. When no one seems willing to wear the mantle of "victimizer" as 
well as the mantle of "victim", they insist: "We all bear guilt."
<P>Common ground -- and pain -- is their sacred territory. As one of the signs 
they carried in a recent march through downtown San Francisco stated: "Mothers 
are grieving in New York and Afghanistan. Mothers are grieving in Israel and 
Palestine."
<P>Said Ronnie Gilbert, one of the Bay Area core group: "I am not a joiner. I 
am really not an organization person. But when I heard about Women in Black I 
thought, 'Vigil, quiet, silent, women? Yes!! That is something I want to be 
attached to.' "
<P>A singer and now-music teacher, Gilbert performed with the best-selling 
folk group, The Weavers, in the early 1950s. But, as she explained in a recent 
essay that is circulating on the Web, an FBI investigation turned the hit 
group into pariahs. A month after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade 
Center and Pentagon, Gilbert learned that she was back on the FBI suspects 
list, this time for being part of Women in Black.
<P>"The FBI is threatening my group with a grand jury investigation," she 
wrote. "Of what? That we publicly call the Israeli military's occupation of 
the mandated Palestine lands illegal? So does the World Court and the United 
Nations."
<P>Last week, after a Bay Area Women in Black meeting, Gilbert said her 
cohorts had talked long and hard about the recent and horrendous escalation of 
violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip:
<P>"Susan Freundlich said it best: 'How many lives need to be lost before we 
admit that this kind of thing doesn't work? The oppression of a people, forced 
violence, bullying and reprisals do not bring security. They bring the 
opposite.' "
<P>Freundlich is vice president of community development for the Women's 
Foundation in San Francisco. She was drawn, in part, to Women in Black because 
she wants other Jews and Palestinians to know that "not all Americans, not all 
Jews, support what Israeli leaders want to do."
<P>Since September 11, her group's message of nonviolent conflict resolution 
has become even more important, she said:
<P>"While the the United States is lecturing the world about democracy and 
justice, we are openly supporting a government that is committing gross human 
rights violations that are the opposite of democracy and justice."
<P>For Penny Rosenwasser, Women in Black is the natural extension of the 
Hebrew idea of tikkun olam, which means "the repair or healing of the world."
<P>Currently writing a graduate dissertation on "internalized anti-Semitism", 
Rosenwasser first traveled to Israel and the Middle East during the first 
intifada in 1989.
<P>"I wanted to go see for myself," she said.
<P>In the ensuing 12 years, she has stayed for months among Palestinians and 
Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Her most recent visit was in July.
<P>"I was in a refugee camp near the Egyptian border and saw a football field-
size area of destruction. Eighteen Palestinian homes had been destroyed by the 
Israeli army," she said. "I knew they'd used U.S. weapons. All I could say, 
over and over again, was, 'I'm so sorry.' For the Palestinians and the 
Israelis, there is a war of annihilation going on. "
<P>Like all the Women in Black, Susan Freundlich emphasizes that Palestinians 
are hardly blameless in that war.
<P>"We understand that mistakes have been made on all sides," she said. "But 
we want to hold out for the humanity of both sides. One group doesn't need to 
be demonized by the other, one doesn't have to be sacrificed."
<P>At 5 p.m., on Dec. 16, Bay Area Women in Black will hold a community candle-
lighting ceremony for Hanukkah at Chochmat Halev, 2215 Prince St., Berkeley.
