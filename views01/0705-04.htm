A few summers ago, baseball's All-Star Game inspired me to compile 
a roster of the nation's foremost media players. Now it's that time of year 
again; I've reviewed my lineup of media stars -- and guess what? Except for 
the designated hitter, they're all still at the top of their games!

         <p>So, here is America's beloved Media All-Star Team of 2001:

         <p>STARTING PITCHER: Cokie Roberts<br>
         Tossing a classic mix of curveballs and changeups, Roberts can 
baffle anyone with more than a superficial knowledge of American history. 
Her delivery, like her wisdom, is utterly conventional.

         <p>RELIEVER: Christopher Matthews<br>
         The spinning pitchman of "Hardball" on cable television, Matthews 
currently makes frequent use of the spitter when the wind is at his back. 
Formerly a nominal lefty, he is now proudly ambidextrous.

        <p> CLOSER: George Will<br>
         This hurler has cultivated an elaborate windup. Yet he can also 
throw a mean fastball from a stretch position. Will specializes in wide 
curves that nick the right edge of the plate. Catchers dread handling his 
arch knuckler -- and sometimes get embarrassed when Will argues that even 
his wild pitches are strikes. If riled, he resorts to the beanball.

         <p>LEADOFF BATTER: Jim Lehrer<br>
         His lackadaisical "NewsHour" style belies the fact that Lehrer is 
adept at the well-placed bunt and beats many throws from across the 
diamond. Boosted by multi-year endorsement contracts from the agribusiness 
giant Archer Daniels Midland, he's an excellent corporate-team player.

         <p>CLEANUP BATTER: Dan Rather<br>
         Off at the crack of a bat, Rather can stretch a cliche into a 
stand-up triple. He often hits line drives up the middle.

         <p>DESIGNATED HITTER: Patrick Buchanan<br>
         Known as a "Ty Cobb wannabe" for his flashing spikes and surly 
manner, this slugger always swings for the fences. Crouched far to the 
right side of the plate, Buchanan doesn't seem to mind that he rarely 
connects. Dugout mates say he complains that batting was much more 
enjoyable before the days of Roy Campanella. (Although Buchanan has been 
benched a lot lately, he remains a media all-star because many key players 
go back a long way with him.)

         <p>CENTER FIELDER: Barbara Walters<br>
         This consummate pro has decades of experience playing shallow 
center field. While she defends her turf in the sunny outfield, observers 
have become heavy-lidded to the point of somnolence.

        <p> LEFT FIELDER: Michael Kinsley<br>
         Affable and almost erudite, Kinsley has the unfortunate habit of 
roaming the middle of the outfield for most of each game, thus leaving vast 
expanses vacant. Some people swear that he has never come near the 
left-field line, even to snag a simple pop-up.

         <p>RIGHT FIELDER: Rush Limbaugh<br>
         Limbaugh, who likes to hug the right-field line, boasts of many 
putouts in foul territory. However, he is rued by umpires, who find him 
abusive and prone to hallucinations.

        <p> SHORTSTOP: David Gergen<br>
         At bat, Gergen is a deft switch hitter. Wearing a mitt, he's a 
fast man in the pivot -- able to pull off a double play with dazzling 
agility that makes all his maneuvering look easy. Fans marvel that he 
always seems to land on his feet.

         <p>CATCHER: Mike Wallace<br>
         This seasoned receiver knows how to call the signals without 
antagonizing the front office.

         <p>PINCH HITTER: Katie Couric<br>
         Nice and savvy enough to be safe when it counts, Couric makes 
every "Today" look professional, even when sliding around without purpose.

         <p>MANAGER: Bill Gates<br>
         If winning is the bottom line and sharing can be understood as 
market share, then Gates is a great guy to run the team.

         <p>BAT BOY: John Journalist

         <p>BAT GIRL: Jane Journalist

         <p>TEAM MASCOT: Merrill Lynch

         <p>TEAM OWNER: Rupert Murdoch<br>
         He has a reputation as a foxy mogul with plenty of acumen. But 
some players grumble that Murdoch's team is weakened by his refusal to 
allow southpaws on the mound.

         <p>STADIUM: Disney-AOLTimeWarner-NewsCorp-GeneralElectric-Viacom Park<br>
         The media All-Stars wouldn't think of playing the game anywhere else.

syndicated column focuses on media and politics.</i>
