As shocking as this must be to New Yorkers, in Toronto, the city where I live, lampposts and mailboxes are plastered with posters advertising a plan by antipoverty activists to "shut down" the business district on October 16. Some of the posters (those put up before September 11) even have a picture of skyscrapers outlined in red -- the perimeters of the designated direct-action zone. Many have argued that O16 should be canceled, as other protests and demonstrations have been, in deference to the mood of mourning -- and out of fear of stepped-up police violence.
<p>
But the 
shutdown is going ahead. In the end, the events of September 11 don't 
change the fact that the nights are getting colder and the recession 
is looming. They don't change the fact that in a city that used to be 
described as "safe" and, well, "maybe a little boring," many will die 
on the streets this winter, as they did last winter, and the one 
before that, unless more beds are found immediately.
</p>
<p>
And 
yet there is no disputing that the event, its militant tone and its 
choice of target will provoke terrible memories and associations. 
Many political campaigns face a similar, and sudden, shift. 
Post-September 11, tactics that rely on attacking -- even 
peacefully -- powerful symbols of capitalism find themselves in an 
utterly transformed semiotic landscape. After all, the attacks were 
acts of very real and horrifying terror, but they were also acts of 
symbolic warfare, and instantly understood as such. As Tom Brokaw and 
so many others put it, the towers were not just any buildings, they 
were "symbols of American capitalism."
</p>
<p>
As someone whose life 
is thoroughly entwined with what some people call "the 
antiglobalization movement," others call "anticapitalism" (and I tend 
to just sloppily call "the movement"), I find it difficult to avoid 
discussions about symbolism these days. About all the anticorporate 
signs and signifiers -- the culture-jammed logos, the guerrilla-warfare 
stylings, the choices of brand name and political targets -- that make 
up the movement's dominant metaphors.
</p>
<p>
Many political 
opponents of anticorporate activism are using the symbolism of the 
World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks to argue that young 
activists, playing at guerrilla war, have now been caught out by a 
real war. The obituaries are already appearing in newspapers around 
the world: "Anti-Globalization Is So Yesterday," reads a typical 
headline. It is, according to the<i> Boston Globe</i>, "in tatters." 
Is it true? Our activism has been declared dead before. Indeed, it is 
declared dead with ritualistic regularity before and after every mass 
demonstration: our strategies apparently discredited, our coalitions 
divided, our arguments misguided. And yet those demonstrations have 
kept growing larger, from 50,000 in Seattle to 300,000, by some 
estimates, in Genoa.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, it would be foolish 
to pretend that nothing has changed since September 11. This struck 
me recently, looking at a slide show I had been pulling together 
before the attacks. It is about how anticorporate imagery is 
increasingly being absorbed by corporate marketing. One slide shows a 
group of activists spray-painting the window of a Gap outlet during 
the anti-WTO protests in Seattle. The next shows The Gap's recent 
window displays featuring its own prefab graffiti -- words like 
"Independence" sprayed in black. And the next is a frame from Sony 
PlayStation's "State of Emergency" game featuring cool-haired 
anarchists throwing rocks at evil riot cops protecting the fictitious 
American Trade Organization. When I first looked at these images 
beside each other, I was amazed by the speed of corporate 
co-optation. Now all I can see is how these snapshots from the 
corporate versus anticorporate image wars have been instantly 
overshadowed, blown away by September 11 like so many toy cars and 
action figures on a disaster movie set.
</p>
<p>
Despite the altered 
landscape -- or because of it -- it bears remembering why this movement 
chose to wage symbolic struggles in the first place. The Ontario 
Coalition Against Poverty's decision to "shut down" the business 
district came from a set of very specific and still relevant 
circumstances. Like so many others trying to get issues of economic 
inequality on the political agenda, the people the group represents 
felt that they had been discarded, left outside the paradigm, 
disappeared and reconstituted as a panhandling or squeegee problem 
requiring tough new legislation. They realized that what they had to 
confront was just not a local political enemy or even a particular 
trade law but an economic system -- the broken promise of deregulated, 
trickle-down capitalism. Thus the modern activist challenge: How do 
you organize against an ideology so vast, it has no edges; so 
everywhere, it seems nowhere? Where is the site of resistance for 
those with no workplaces to shut down, whose communities are 
constantly being uprooted? What do we hold on to when so much that is 
powerful is virtual -- currency trades, stock prices, intellectual 
property and arcane trade agreements?
</p>
<p>
The short answer, at 
least before September 11, was that you grab anything you can get 
your hands on: the brand image of a famous multinational, a stock 
exchange, a meeting of world leaders, a single trade agreement or, in 
the case of the Toronto group, the banks and corporate headquarters 
that are the engines that power this agenda. Anything that, even 
fleetingly, makes the intangible actual, the vastness somehow 
human-scale. In short, you find symbols and you hope they become 
metaphors for change.
</p>
<p>
For instance, when the United States 
launched a trade war against France for daring to ban hormone-laced 
beef, Jos&eacute; Bov&eacute; and the French Farmers' Confederation 
didn't get the world's attention by screaming about import duties on 
Roquefort cheese. They did it by "strategically dismantling" a 
McDonald's. Nike, ExxonMobil, Monsanto, Shell, Chevron, Pfizer, 
Sodexho Marriott, Kellogg's, Starbucks, The Gap, Rio Tinto, British 
Petroleum, General Electric, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Citigroup, Taco 
Bell -- all have found their gleaming brands used to shine light on 
everything from bovine growth hormone in milk to human rights in the 
Niger Delta; from labor abuses of Mexican tomato farmworkers in 
Florida to war-financing of oil pipelines in Chad and Cameroon; from 
global warming to sweatshops. 
</p>
<p>
      In the weeks since September 11, we have been reminded many times that Americans aren't particularly informed about the world outside their borders. That may be true, but many activists have learned over the past decade that this blind spot for international affairs can be overcome by linking campaigns to famous brands -- an effective, if often problematic, weapon against parochialism. These corporate campaigns have, in turn, opened back doors into the arcane world of international trade and finance, to the World Trade Organization, the World Bank and, for some, to a questioning of capitalism itself. </p>
<p>
But these 
tactics have also proven to be an easy target in turn. After 
September 11, politicians and pundits around the world instantly 
began spinning the terrorist attacks as part of a continuum of 
anti-American and anticorporate violence: first the Starbucks window, 
then, presumably, the WTC. <i>New Republic</i> editor Peter Beinart 
seized on an obscure post to an anticorporate Internet chat room that 
asked if the attacks were committed by "one of us." Beinart concluded 
that "the anti-globalization movement...is, in part, a movement 
motivated by hatred of the United States" -- immoral with the United 
States under attack.
</p>
<p>
In a sane world, rather than fueling 
such a backlash the terrorist attacks would raise questions about why 
US intelligence agencies were spending so much time spying on 
environmentalists and Independent Media Centers instead of on the 
terrorist networks plotting mass murder. Unfortunately, it seems 
clear that the crackdown on activism that predated September 11 will 
only intensify, with heightened surveillance, infiltration and police 
violence. It's also likely that the anonymity that has been a 
hallmark of anticapitalism -- masks, bandannas and pseudonyms -- will 
become more suspect in a culture searching for clandestine operatives 
in its midst.
</p>
<p>
But the attacks will cost us more than our 
civil liberties. They could well, I fear, cost us our few political 
victories. Funds committed to the AIDS crisis in Africa are 
disappearing, and commitments to expand debt cancellation will likely 
follow. Defending the rights of immigrants and refugees was becoming 
a major focus for the direct-action crowd in Australia, Europe and, 
slowly, the United States. This too is threatened by the rising tide 
of racism and xenophobia.
</p>
<p>
And free trade, long facing a 
public relations crisis, is fast being rebranded, like shopping and 
baseball, as a patriotic duty. According to US Trade Representative 
Robert Zoellick (who is frantically trying to get fast-track 
negotiating power pushed through in this moment of jingoistic 
groupthink), trade "promotes the values at the heart of this 
protracted struggle." Michael Lewis makes a similar conflation 
between freedom fighting and free trading when he explains, in an 
essay in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, that the traders who 
died were targeted as "not merely symbols but also practitioners of 
liberty.... They work hard, if unintentionally, to free others from 
constraints. This makes them, almost by default, the spiritual 
antithesis of the religious fundamentalist, whose business depends on 
a denial of personal liberty in the name of some putatively higher 
power."
</p>
<p>
The battle lines leading up to next month's WTO 
negotiations in Qatar are: Tradeequals freedom, antitrade equals 
fascism. Never mind that Osama bin Laden is a multimillionaire with a 
rather impressive global export network stretching from cash-crop 
agriculture to oil pipelines. And never mind that this fight will 
take place in Qatar, that bastion of liberty, which is refusing 
foreign visas for demonstrators but where bin Laden practically has 
his own TV show on the state-subsidized network 
Al-Jazeera.
</p>
<p>
Our civil liberties, our modest victories, our 
usual strategies -- all are now in question. But this crisis also opens 
up new possibilities. As many have pointed out, the challenge for 
social justice movements is to connect economic inequality with the 
security concerns that now grip us all -- insisting that justice and 
equality are the most sustainable strategies against violence and 
fundamentalism.
</p>
<p>
But we cannot be na&iuml;ve, as if the very 
real and ongoing threat of more slaughtering of innocents will 
disappear through political reform alone. There needs to be social 
justice, but there also needs to be justice for the victims of these 
attacks and immediate, practical prevention of future ones. Terrorism 
is indeed an international threat, and it did not begin with the 
attacks in the United States. As Bush invites the world to join 
America's war, sidelining the United Nations and the international 
courts, we need to become passionate defenders of true 
multilateralism, rejecting once and for all the label 
"antiglobalization." Bush's "coalition" does not represent a 
genuinely global response to terrorism but the internationalization 
of one country's foreign policy objectives -- the trademark of US 
international relations, from the WTO negotiating table to Kyoto: You 
are free to play by our rules or get shut out completely. We can make 
these connections not as "anti-Americans" but as true 
internationalists. 

</p>
<p>
      We can also refuse to engage in a calculus of suffering. Some on the left have implied that the outpouring of compassion and grief post-September 11 is disproportionate, even vaguely racist, compared with responses to greater atrocities. Surely the job of those who claim to abhor injustice and suffering is not to stingily parcel out compassion as if it were a finite commodity. Surely the challenge is to attempt to increase the global reserves of compassion, rather than parsimoniously police them. </p>
<p>
Besides, is the outpouring of 
mutual aid and support that this tragedy has elicited so different 
from the humanitarian goals to which this movement aspires? The 
street slogans -- PEOPLE BEFORE  PROFIT , THE  WORLD  IS  NOT  FOR  SALE  -- have 
become self-evident and viscerally felt truths for many in the wake 
of the attacks. There is outrage in the face of profiteering. There 
are questions being raised about the wisdom of leaving crucial 
services like airport security to private companies, about why there 
are bailouts for airlines but not for the workers losing their jobs. 
There is a groundswell of appreciation for public-sector workers of 
all kinds. In short, "the commons" -- the public sphere, the public 
good, the noncorporate, what we have been defending, what is on the 
negotiating table in Qatar -- is undergoing something of a rediscovery 
in the United States.
</p>
<p>
Instead of assuming that Americans 
can care about each other only when they are getting ready to kill a 
common enemy, those concerned with changing minds (and not simply 
winning arguments) should seize this moment to connect these humane 
reactions to the many other arenas in which human needs must take 
precedence over corporate profits, from AIDS treatment to 
homelessness. As Paul Loeb, author of <i>Soul of a Citizen</i>, puts 
it, despite the warmongering and coexisting with the xenophobia, 
"People seem careful, vulnerable, and extraordinarily kind to each 
other. These events just might be able to break us away from our 
gated communities of the heart."
</p>
<p>
This would require a 
dramatic change in activist strategy, one based much more on 
substance than on symbols. Then again, for more than a year, the 
largely symbolic activism outside summits and against individual 
corporations has already been challenged within movement circles. 
There is much that is unsatisfying about fighting a war of symbols: 
The glass shatters in the McDonald's window, the meetings are driven 
to ever more remote locations -- but so what? It's still only symbols, 
facades, representations.
</p>
<p>
Before September 11, a new mood 
of impatience was already taking hold, an insistence on putting 
forward social and economic alternatives that address the roots of 
injustice as well as its symptoms, from land reform to slavery 
reparations. Now seems like a good time to challenge the forces of 
both nihilism and nostalgia within our own ranks, while making more 
room for the voices -- coming from Chiapas, P&ocirc;rto Alegre, 
Kerala -- showing that it is indeed possible to challenge imperialism 
while embracing plurality, progress and deep democracy. Our task, 
never more pressing, is to point out that there are more than two 
worlds available, to expose all the invisible worlds between the 
economic fundamentalism of "McWorld" and the religious fundamentalism 
of "Jihad."
</p>
<p>
Maybe the image wars are coming to a close. A 
year ago, I visited the University of Oregon to do a story on 
antisweatshop activism at the campus that is nicknamed Nike U. There 
I met student activist Sarah Jacobson. Nike, she told me, was not the 
target of her activism, but a tool, a way to access a vast and often 
amorphous economic system. "It's a gateway drug," she said 
cheerfully. 
</p>
<p>
For years, we in this movement have fed off 
our opponents' symbols -- their brands, their office towers, 
their photo-opportunity summits. We have used them as rallying cries, 
as focal points, as popular education tools. But these symbols were 
never the real targets; they were the levers, the handles. They were 
what allowed us, as British writer Katharine Ainger recently put it, 
"to open a crack in history."
</p>
<p>
The symbols were only ever 
doorways. It's time to walk through them.</p>
