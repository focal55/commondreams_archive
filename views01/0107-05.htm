<p>&nbsp;WE WERE arguing about the f-word.
</P>
<P>  My friend Jason told me not to use it. He said it turns people off and gets 
in the way of everything I'm trying to accomplish.
</P>
<P>  "I don't understand," he said, "why you have to call yourself a 'feminist.' 
"
</P>
<P>  Many friends cringe at the label. "Feminist." It conjures up the Ugly 
Feminist, the infamous, anti-Barbie, man-hating, bra-burning, bitter ghost of 
feminist past -- an image that haunts those of us born after the civil rights 
movement.
</P>
<P>  In the history of feminism, so far as we know, no one ever burned a bra. In 
1968 in Atlantic City, during a demonstration against the Miss America Pageant,
</P>
<P>women threw bras and curlers into a garbage can. These weren't burned, but 
some news accounts described a fire, perhaps because reporters made an 
association with draft-card burning in protests against the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>  It's no coincidence that our most enduring image of feminism is a 
caricature of something that didn't happen. Distorting and devaluing the word 
"feminism," continues a long tradition of trivializing women's accomplishments.
</P>
<P>  Young women ought to feel pride and gratitude for the women who came before 
us -- Susan B. Anthony and right to vote; Margaret Sanger and birth control; 
Gloria Steinem and more equality in the institution of marriage.
</P>
<P>  But the Ugly Feminist eclipses our real history. Her spooky image sends a 
warning: Women seeking equality are inherently unattractive.
</P>
<P>  This message is haunting. One of the few ways young women are allowed to 
experience power or be celebrated in our culture is through their beauty and 
sexuality. To warn women they risk losing attractiveness if they vie for some 
other kind of power is yet another way, and an effective one, to keep women in 
their place.
</P>
<P>  The women's movement inadvertently perpetuated the Ugly Feminist image by 
attacking icons of bimbohood like Barbie, the doll. In a struggle to get the 
culture to value women for their brains and accomplishments and not just their 
looks, some feminists pigeonholed Barbie as anti-feminist. It was easy to fall 
into that trap. Barbie is a doll, after all, with torpedo breasts, a tiny 
waist, and curled feet -- as if always ready to slip into a pair of Jimmy Choo 
spikes.
</P>
<P>  But seeing Barbie only for her body is buying into a male point of view, 
not a little girl's.
</P>
<P>  Barbie was our childhood heroine. This isn't because girls are naturally 
drawn to all things pink and prissy. It's because we took what the culture 
gave us. Being creative and resourceful, we made do. Now, as adults, we don't 
want our Barbies misunderstood.
</P>
<P>  In "Manifesta," their book on young feminism, Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy 
Richards write, "Barbie didn't so much influence us as that she was a blank 
screen on which to project what was happening in our heads."
</P>
<P>  More often than not, we hacked off that famous blond hair. When Barbie's 
friend Skipper almost drowned in the Barbie Jacuzzi, Nurse Barbie pulled her 
out and administered CPR.
</P>
<P>  I don't know of a Barbie that wasn't curious and sexually adventurous, 
sometimes resulting in, as with Jennifer Baumgardner's doll, Barbie getting an 
abortion.
</P>
<P>  Even more than Barbie, I loved "Charlie's Angels" on television. I was so 
inspired by the female trio that when I was 9, I wrote a novel (118 pages 
typed) based on what I imagined Cheryl Ladd's character, Kris Monroe, had been 
like as an intrepid child.
</P>
<P>  When "Charlie's Angels" was written off as "Jiggle TV," the perceptions of 
girl fans were ignored once again. Attributing the show's success to T&A also 
trivialized the groundbreaking success of the women who starred in a hit 
series, commanded high salaries and were featured on the cover of Time 
magazine.
</P>
<P>  Too many young women don't realize this battle has been fought before. 
Steinem, criticized for wearing miniskirts, has said that in her early years 
as a feminist she set herself up against the suffragettes. She believed the 
same old hype that they were all anti-sex, puritanical types. Only later did 
she learn about sexually liberated anarchist Emma Goldman or 19th century 
presidential candidate Victoria Woodhull and her Free Love Party.
</P>
<P>  I look forward to the day when women make it to the cover of Time as often 
as men do, not just as actresses or models, but as world leaders. But that 
won't happen as long as we keep recycling images of Ditzy Barbie and Ugly 
Feminist, flip sides of the same coin. When young women use the f-word and 
call themselves feminists, these anachronisms will dissolve, like the Wicked 
Witch when Dorothy dumped a bucket of water on her.
<P><I>Margot Magowan, co-founder of Women Count and the Woodhull Institute, also produces the Bernie Ward Program for KGO radio in San Francisco.</I>
