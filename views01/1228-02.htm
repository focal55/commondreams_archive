These last months have been full of horror, tragedy, cruelty and foreboding. The events of September 11 themselves; the cruelties of the unfinished war in Afghanistan and the refugee crisis in that region; the reported threats that the alliance may take the war elsewhere, perhaps to Iraq; the perception, especially dangerous for Christian minorities in many parts of the world, that the war is a Christian "crusade"; and through it all, a root and breeding-ground for all the rest, the steadily worsening situation in the Holy Land - which our own government seems to follow the US in refusing to pay the necessary attention to. 
<P>I wonder if you find these   verses from Isaiah as acutely difficult to listen to as I do: "I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people; no more shall the sound of weeping be heard in it, or the cry of distress. They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit. They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat." And how might these verses sound, if we were worshipping with our fellow Christians in Jerusalem - let alone in Bethlehem or in Nazareth?  
<P>In Jerusalem people feel under siege, after the killings and maimings there and elsewhere in Israel these last 16 months. The occupied territories are again effectively re-occupied by overwhelming military force. Hundreds have been killed, and hundreds injured, most of them young people. And if the "little town of Bethlehem" lies "still", it is because it is fearful of further invasion, its buildings and streets, hospitals and churches damaged, its people without work and increasingly without hope. In the Holy Land there is much "weeping", many a "cry of distress".  
<P>We read those words from Isaiah 65 at Christmas, because from the beginning Christians have understood them to speak of Jesus's resurrection, to which, with his death, the stories of his birth   look forward. So the present situation around Jerusalem and in the Holy Land more widely, which is the situation of the last 50 or 60 years focused and coming to a terrible climax, uniquely and painfully draws your and my attention to the urgency of the task to which God has commissioned us through Jesus, whose birth we celebrate.  
<P>For only through us and our fellow Christians will people everywhere, and their rulers, learn that in the resurrection of Jesus, God has in principle restored his world to the peace and well-being that is his gift - providing us with the means if we "have the same mind in us that was in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 2:5). St Paul's verses that follow those words are probably   the earliest summary telling of the story of Jesus that we have. Some 25 years after Jesus's resurrection, St Paul is using a little hymn that people already knew. Its beginning mirrors the Christmas stories of the Gospels.  
<P>Jesus did not regard equality with God as something to cling to, like a piece of booty or a new Christmas present. He emptied himself, gave it all up, took human form at   its most humble, was obedient to the point of dying on a cross.  
<P>My early 17th-century predecessor, Lancelot Andrewes, noted that many a manger was made of pieces of wood laid at right-angles... This is "the mind", the attitude, the behavior of Jesus to which I believe that God, this Christmas especially, is pointing us - and in relation to the critical time through which we are living.  
<P>Would we be in this situation, if western - north American and European - electorates, all with deep Christian pedigrees, had not encouraged, supported or at least allowed our governments, over so many decades, to develop our standard of living at the expense of millions in the southern hemisphere? And if we had not sold their rulers armaments on such favorable terms, and with so little forethought? Cruelly evil though they were, I find that I have to understand the events of September 11 as a judgment upon us; and so, to understand these weeks, this Christmas, as a critical moment, an opportunity for a fresh beginning, its character caught in those words we have read: "Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus."  
<P><i>Michael Scott-Joynt is bishop of Winchester. This is an edited extract from his Christmas Day sermon. </i>
