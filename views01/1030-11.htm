A handful of readers were outraged a few weeks back when I employed some 
imagination -- an indispensable tool of journalism --  to put two and two 
together and <a href="http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?ItemID=12097" target="_new">suggest</A> that in the matter of the U.S. assault on Afghanistan, 
feeding and bombing wouldn't mix.   
<p>

Now, sadly, there's no doubt that many of the food packets the U.S. forces have 
dropped have gotten into the wrong hands and as the U.S. bombing mission enters 
its fourth week, the United Nations' World Food Program is saying that <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011030/wl/attack_afghan_aid_dc_2.html" TARGET="_new">the 
first snows -- expected around November 15 -- are about to block mountain 
passes and roads, making it hard to get more effective aid deliveries 
through</a>. 
 
<p>

Relief officials on the ground are fearful that if there is no suspension of 
bombing long enough to let sufficient numbers of truck shipments into the 
country, millions of Afghan civilians will starve to death: "Millions -- 
literally millions -- of Afghan civilians will starve to death this winter 
unless the U.S. military suspends its attacks and allows the UN to 
re-establish effective food distribution." Sarah Zaidi, research director of 
the <a href="http://www.cesr.org" TARGET="_new">Center for Economic and Social Rights</a> in Pakistan told the <a href="http://www.accuracy.org" TARGET="_new">Institute for 
Public Accuracy</a> at the weekend.  Zaidi's group has produced 
three comprehensive fact sheets on Afghanistan since September 11.   
<p>

Meanwhile, the United Nations has sounded an alarm over the use of cluster 
bombs by American aircraft. According to a <a href="http://commondreams.org/headlines01/1026-06.htm">report published Friday</a>, 
in the News International of Pakistan, U.S. cluster bombs killed eight people 
in a Herat village called Shaker Qala last week.  
<p>


Cluster bombs are dropped in a casing which is supposed to split open in 
mid-air, scattering up to 200 bomblets the size of soft drink cans over an 
area as big as a U.S. football field.  They are used to destroy vehicles, to 
start fires and as an anti-personnel weapon. Sometimes they descend with 
mini-parachutes designed to prevent explosion on impact, so that they deny 
the enemy the use of an area such as an airfield. (Shaker Qala, we're told, 
lies near a military camp.) 
<p>

"The villagers have a lot to be afraid of, because these bomblets, if they 
did not explode, are very dangerous," Dan Kelly, manager of a UN mine removal 
program for Afghanistan, told the News.  "They can explode if the villagers 
so much as touch them."  
<p>

And finally, here comes this news, <A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/monitoring/media_reports/newsid_1624000/1624787.stm" target="_new">from the BBC</A>:  "The United States is 
seeking to avert further criticism over the use of cluster bombs in 
Afghanistan by warning the Afghan people not to confuse unexploded bombs with 
food drops." 
<p>

The BBC (Sunday, October 28) reported that the yellow casing on the cluster 
bombs that U.S. forces are dropping on Afghanistan "means that from a distance 
they are hard to distinguish from the emergency food parcels wrapped in 
yellow plastic that U.S. planes have been dropping over the last few weeks." 
<p>

The source for the BBC account was a U.S. psychological operations (psy-ops) 
radio broadcast. BBC Monitoring, a service based in southern England, selects 
and translates information from radio, television, press, news agencies and 
the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages, apparently 
including psy-op broadcasts. 
<p>

According to the BBC, U.S. forces are using radio to reassure Afghans in Dari 
and Pashto -- two of five regional languages. The psy-ops messages also 
reveal U.S. concerns.  
<p>

"Attention, noble Afghan people," the messages begin.  "As you know, the 
coalition countries have been air-dropping daily humanitarian rations for 
you, the food ration is enclosed in yellow plastic bags. They come in the 
shape of rectangular or long squares. The food inside the bags is Halal and 
very nutritional." 
<p>

In future, say the psy-ops broadcasters, "cluster bombs will not be dropped 
in areas where food is air-dropped." 
<p>

"However, we do not wish to see an innocent civilian mistake the bombs for 
food bags and take it away believing that it might contain food."  
<p>

"In areas away from where food has been dropped, cluster bombs will also be 
dropped. The color of these bombs is also yellow." 
<p>

"Do not confuse the cylinder-shaped bomb with the rectangular food bag," the 
message concluded.  
<p>

I only wish I was making this stuff up.
