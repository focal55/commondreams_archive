As the calls for war in the mainstream media and the halls of power grow 
louder, with Senator John McCain speaking for many when he said, "God may 
have mercy on them, but we won't," a different kind of response has been 
building as well.

<p>The peace community, from established groups like Peace Action 
(<a href="http://www.peace-action.org" target="_new">www.peace-action.org</a>) and the Fellowship of Reconciliation 
(<a href="http://www.forusa.org" target="_new">www.forusa.org</a>) to grassroots activists across the country, has united in 
a strong, consistent, and deeply heartfelt response. Reading the statements 
being put out, one sees clearly that the entire community joins 
wholeheartedly with the nation in condemning the brutal attack of two days 
ago, and in the fear, grief, and shattering sense of loss it has occasioned.

<p>There is also widespread agreement that there should be no rush to judgment 
and no massive "retaliation" that would target the innocent civilians of 
any country. Noting that international law does not recognize any right of 
retaliation or vengeance (Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, which governs the 
use of force, requires that any action be taken only with the permission, 
and under the auspices of, the Security Council, the only exception being 
self-defense against imminent attack  which does not include vengeance for 
past attacks), Peace Action and others are calling clearly for any 
remaining perpetrators to be brought to justice through legal channels, 
with international cooperation.

<p>Very similar sentiments were expressed in a community discussion last 
night, organized by Austin's progressive activist community. Two hundred 
and fifty people came together, to express their emotions and their 
experiences, to share ideas and information, and to plan future actions.

<p>From the beginning, it was clear that people really needed to talk. There 
was no good way to cope with the flurry of hands that was raised at every 
pause.

<p>One young man tearfully expressed his fear that, with all the talk of 
America going to war, the draft would be reinstated and that he would have 
to kill or die in an effort he opposed. Several were afraid of the loss of 
our civil liberties. Others shared their fear for friends, relatives, and 
friends of friends who worked near the World Trade Centers, and who had not 
been heard from. Everyone felt grief and anger that so many innocent people 
were killed.

<p>Many, however, expressed strong emotions of a different kind. Deep disquiet 
with their friends and acquaintances caught up in a vortex of fury, often 
racist in tone. Anger at the mainstream media, almost universally perceived 
to be even worse than government officials in their constant calls for 
blood  somebody's, anybody's. Guilt, pain, and sorrow on contemplating the 
seemingly inevitable killing of innocent civilians being planned by our 
government.

<p>And, far and away the most common feeling, isolation. Many expressed their 
heartfelt gratitude that the discussion had been organized, because they 
had been feeling, "Nobody else thinks the way I do."

<p>After talking through their feelings, many who had been sunk in despair 
felt newly energized to do what they could to head off war, and the 
discussion ended in a massive organizing meeting.

<p>The lesson is clear. There are many, many people in this country who see 
clearly that one killing of innocents will not be requited by another, that 
a radically different path is needed to assure our security and that of 
people in other parts of the world.

<p>In the days to come, if those people rely only on the television and the 
big daily newspapers, they will feel isolated and beleaguered, deprived of 
their voices and their democratic right to help shape the public dialogue.

<p>That will be a tremendous tragedy. Even though this is an incredibly 
difficult time to speak up, and voices against war will inevitably be 
branded as apologists for terror, this is also a very important time to 
speak up. Americans have seen up close the tangible effects of our foreign 
policy, and they are interested as they have not been since the nuclear 
freeze movement, maybe even since the Vietnam war.

<p>Let us call, then, for communities across the country to have similar 
dialogues, to work through feelings of pain, fear, and grief and begin to 
fashion a coherent response to warmongering before the war is upon us. We 
who favor peace must create our own national dialogue before we can hope to 
influence the larger one.

<p>Austin could have such a large meeting on such short notice because of a 
multi-year sustained effort (<a href="http://www.nowarcollective.com" target="_new">www.nowarcollective.com</a>), centering around 
antiwar work, that has built up a very large (4000) e-mail announcement and 
rapid response list. Localities without that kind of infrastructure may 
take a little longer, but the need for timely action is great.

Committee of the <a href="http://www.endthewar.org/" target="_new">National Network to End the War Against Iraq</a> and the Board
