            BELL TEXTRON, the Rhode Island-based company that makes helicopter 
            gunships, got some good news a few months ago when Turkey awarded 
            it a $4 billion contract for 146 attack helicopters, one of the largest 
            single arms deals in history. 
            <P> 
            <P>International competition for the contract had been intense, with 
              five companies, including Boeing Aircraft and Bell Textron, submitting 
              bids. When Turkey eliminated Boeing's Apache helicopter from consideration 
              last year, Bell's King Cobra became the favorite to win the award. 
              Soon after it convenes, the new Congress will have to decide whether 
              to grant an export license for the weapons.
            <P> 
            <P>About 80 percent of the Turkish arsenal is US-made, and the Turkish 
              Army has relied on Sikorsky Blackhawks and Apache and Cobra helicopters 
              to win the long (and underreported) war with Kurdish rebels in the 
              southeast.
            <P> 
            <P>In 1997, the Clinton administration granted Boeing and Bell market 
              licenses to build the attack helicopters, brushing aside human rights 
              objections from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch about 
              Turkey's abuse of its ethnic population.
            <P> 
            <P>Since President Clinton took office in 1992, more than $6 billion 
              in US weaponry has been delivered to Turkey. Now that Bell has won 
              the helicopter contract, the Bush administration may try to persuade 
              Congress to override human rights concerns, thus brokering the sale. 
            <P> 
            <P>American-made helicopters are well known to the Kurds. I have often 
              encountered refugees from destroyed villages in southeast Turkey 
              whose only English were the words Sikorsky and Cobra. Villagers 
              know that the soldiers who burn their houses arrive in Blackhawk 
              helicopters, which are made by the Connecticut-based Sikorsky company. 
              And they easily recognize the rocket-equipped Cobras, which are 
              manufactured at a Bell Textron plant in Texas.
            <P> 
            <P>Turkish Kurdistan is a rugged, mountainous region, and helicopters 
              have proved essential in the army's scorched-earth campaign. So 
              far, more than 3,000 Kurdish villages have been burned, depriving 
              the guerrillas of logistical support. Estimates of civilian Kurds 
              displaced by the war range from 500,000 to 2 million. It has been 
              a dirty war, and both sides have been guilty of atrocities.
            <P> 
            <P>The Kurds are a large, diverse group whose members spill across 
              the borders of Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Syria, and parts of the former 
              Soviet Union. With a population of 25 million to 30 million, they 
              represent the largest ethnic minority in the world without their 
              own state.
            <P> 
            <P>The first Kurds I met were in Iraq, where I was shooting television 
              news at the end of the Gulf War. At that time, the networks had 
              an appetite for stories of Saddam Hussein's abuses (the Iraqi dictator 
              had destroyed thousands of Kurdish villages), and I had lots of 
              work. But when I started covering the Kurdish uprising in Turkey, 
              I couldn't give the stories away. I was told that as far as the 
              media were concerned, the Turkish-Kurdish war wasn't on the radar.
            <P> 
            <P>Today, Ankara continues to dispatch US- made F-16s and Cobra attack 
              helicopters to bomb Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, where most 
              of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan's fighters have withdrawn. Last 
              weekend, according to Turkish newspapers, 10,000 Turkish troops 
              crossed 100 miles into Iraq, the deepest cross-border penetration 
              to date. At last report, the US-equipped troops were trying to encircle 
              2,500 Kurdish fighters dug in along the Iraq-Iran border.
            <P> 
            <P>Twelve months ago, the European Union voted to consider Turkey 
              for admission to the EU, but only on the condition that it clean 
              up its human rights record. But the EU may be having second thoughts. 
              Soon after the vote, Turkey blocked an EU delegation from visiting 
              Leyla Zana, the imprisoned Kurdish member of the Turkish Parliament 
              who has received the EU's peace prize. Then a Kurdish educational 
              foundation was indicted on criminal charges of inciting separatist 
              propaganda because it advertised a scholarship for students who 
              could read and write in Kurdish.
            <P> 
            <P>Last year the government ordered a CNN television affiliate off 
              the air for 24 hours because a reporter asked a guest if history 
              might one day regard Ocalan as a Turkish version of the South African 
              revolutionary Nelson Mandela. A few days later, Turkey arrested 
              the Kurdish mayors of three cities on vague charges of separatism. 
              There are 37 elected Kurdish mayors, and many observers had hoped 
              that their leadership would provide a nonviolent alternative to 
              the civil war in Turkey that since 1984 has taken 40,000 lives, 
              most of them Kurds.
            <P> 
            <P>Turkey has hired a stable of former leading members of Congress 
              to pave the way for licensing the King Cobras. The lobbyists include 
              former House Rules Committee chairman Gerald Solomon of New York 
              and former congressman Stephen Solarz, also of New York. Best known 
              is former House speaker-designate Bob Livingston of Louisiana, who 
              has received a $1.8 million contract to lobby for Turkey.
            <P> 
            <P>While Turkey is a valuable ally, what US exports need is gun control, 
              but that demands leadership from Washington. The sale of 146 attack 
              helicopters may be good news to Bell Textron, but human rights are 
              also in America's national interest. The new White House should 
              use its influence to hold up the $4 billion in gunships until Ankara 
              shows a willingness to deal democratically with its own citizens.
