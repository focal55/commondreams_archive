A SERIES OF conversations with Democratic congressional leaders  leaves me with the sinking feeling that George W. Bush is poised for a rout. And if Bush gets his way on a massive tax cut, forget all of the things that Democrats hope to accomplish - better health care, better child care, more support for schools, restored funding for affordable  housing.
<P>
<P>The Democrats are split three ways. Some think a tax cut is just irresistible and want to fight Bush over the details.
<P>
<P>That's a losing  game. In the disastrous 1981 bidding war, the two parties split the difference by accepting each other's proposals and adding more for good measure. The result was a purely Republican program and a decade of escalating deficits.
<P>
<P>A second group, led by conservative think-tank economists, believe  you can trump a tax cut by talking down the surplus and expressing worry about the solvency of Social Security half a century from now. But nobody's listening.
<P>
<P>A third group wants to fight Bush with a whole other public philosophy. That's the crowd I like. But they currently lack the votes to prevail.
<P>
<P>Faced with this split, Bush will simply peel off enough Democrats to get his tax program enacted. Once the cut gains momentum, more Democrats will clamber on board to share the credit.
<P>
<P>Can this runaway train be stopped? Should it? Consider a little  history.
<P>
<P>Public spending has been cut at a faster rate during the 1990s than  at any time in American history except for demobilizations after major  wars.
<P>
<P>In 1992, federal spending accounted for about 22 percent of gross  domestic product. Now, it's down to 18 percent. With the Bush tax cut, it would drop to about 15 percent. That's a net cut of fully one-third.
<P>
<P>You can see the effects. Hospitals are squeezed because of Medicare  cuts. Affordable housing and decent social services are evaporating.  Plans to expand Head Start have been shelved. Federal transit subsidies  are mostly history.
<P>
<P>Five years ago, no serious economist proposed paying off the national debt. But the Democrats painted themselves into a corner, thinking this goal was a clever way to head off a Republican tax cut.  Now they cling to a debt paydown strategy with no political legs but with the  same political result that Republicans seek - a massive shrinkage of the government role.
<P>
<P>The idea of a 10-year budget is also a trap. Nobody really knows where the economy will be in 10 years. The margin of error in past projections by the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget has been hundreds of billions of dollars.
<P>
<P>Current forecasts are that the budget surplus, not counting the surplus in Social Security, is about $3 trillion dollars over 10 years.
<P>
<P>Bush wants most of that for a permanent tax cut, and the business lobbies are  slavering for more. A more realistic surplus figure is about $2.4 trillion - about $240 billion a year - and better to limit planning to five  years.
<P>
<P>Since the Democrats, as Bill Press of ''Crossfire'' put it so trenchantly the other night, are behaving like weenies, herewith the Kuttner Plan:
<P>
<P>Point One: A one-time tax rebate this year of $500 for every man, woman, and child (an idea that was first proposed by the Economic Policy Institute). This would be strong antirecession medicine, and it wouldn't blow a permanent hole in the tax code. Cost: $170 billion. No other tax  cuts.
<P>
<P>Point Two: Infuse $50 billion a year into failing schools, mainly to reduce class size, and $20 billion more each year into early-childhood development. Cost: $350 billion over five years.
<P>
<P>Point Three: Expand Medicare to restore some hospital payments and add prescription drug coverage. Cost: $350 billion over five years.
<P>
<P>Point Four: Give every child a Medicare card and get rid of the patchwork of private insurance, Medicaid, Chip, and other child health programs that miss millions of kids. Net cost: $100 billion over five years if we fold  in other programs.
<P>
<P>Point Five: Restore $6 billion a year of federal money for affordable housing. Cost: $30 billion.
<P>
<P>That's it: a clear, coherent alternative to the Bush program. It doesn't pretend to predict economic circumstances beyond the next five years. It offers a quick anti-recession jolt. And the five-year cost is $1 trillion, or  well under half of the projected 10-year surplus.
<P>
<P>Can the hapless Democrats rally behind something like this? If so,  maybe they can actually get half of it.
<P>
<P>If not, they are Bush's lunch.
