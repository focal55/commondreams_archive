As the first year in  the new millennium draws to a close, it might help us 
sort out what’s happened in the past three+ months -- and thus how to respond 
-- by compiling a summary list of What We Know. 

<p>1. As was the case with various other major mass-murder bombings (East 
African embassies, USS Cole in Yemen, U.S. barracks in Saudia Arabia, etc.) 
we know  that Osama bin Laden’s Al Qaeda was behind the Twin Towers/Pentagon 
attacks. 

<p>2. We know that the Bush Administration, like the administrations before it, 
was exceedingly lax when it came to security matters, including the amassing 
and analysis of intelligence about terror groups. (But the CIA and FBI, 
rather than being investigated and perhaps punished, got  their budgets 
increased instead.)

<p>3. We know that the Bush Administration and its corporate friends had its 
eyes on Afghanistan as a possible war zone -- and possible location for a 
Central Asian oil pipeline -- before September 11.

<p>4. We know that the Bush Administration was wise enough to see in 9/11 the 
homeland beginnings of the new type of war -- low-tech means  to carry out 
high-tech-like results  -- and began to organize a war on terrorism that is 
worldwide in scope and ambition.

<p>5.  We know that the Bush Administration made secret bilateral deals with 
various countries in order to bring them into this anti-terrorist coalition, 
specifically with Russia, the “’stans,” perhaps China and Indonesia also.

<p>6.  We know that the Bush policy of massive bombing  from the air, combined 
with support for the local anti-Taliban forces on the ground (and then 
introducing select U.S. units on the ground), was able to do much more 
psychological and logistical damage that was originally thought could be 
possible in such a limited time-frame. 

<p>7. We know that  the Taliban and Al Qaeda made strategic withdrawals and 
“surrenders” in order not to engage the overwhelming force against them, and 
disappeared into Pakistan, the mountains, the villages, conserving their 
strength for other battles later. In short, we’re in a deceptively quiet 
period at the moment.

<p>8. We know that even with a U.S. policy of limiting “collateral damage” to 
civilians, perhaps as many as several thousand innocent Afghans were killed 
and injured, and several million became internal refugees.

<p>9.  We know that bin Laden and his network have chemical, biological and 
nuclear ambitions, and may well have created  crude  weapons of mass 
destruction.

<p>10. We know that even with the arrests and detentions of Al Qaeda agents  and 
supporters, “sleeper” agents are still living in the 60 nations  where bin 
Laden has operatives. US intelligence agencies estimate that about 70% of Al 
Qaeda’s sleepers are still in place around the world. 

<p>11. We know that even if Bush had no exact foreknowledge of 9/11 events, he 
has used those terrorist attacks -- and the popular response of the citizenry 
to his handling of the crisis -- as a “cover” to try to  force his 
right-wing social and economic agenda through the Congress, and has been 
fairly successful in so doing.

<p>12. We know that Bush feels emboldened by his high popularity ratings to even 
attempt an end-around the Constitution’s Bill of Rights in terms of shrinking 
civil-liberties protections for those suspected of terrorist  connections -- 
all this rationalized by “protecting the homeland” and “national security.” 
And, by and large, a frightened  citizenry has  gone along, preferring 
security seemingly at any price -- and not paying much attention to how 
quickly citizens can be treated like non-citizens.

<p>13. We know that the Democrats in Congress have felt constrained to support 
Bush’s anti-terrorist policies  -- even when many of them knew the damage 
those policies could cause to representative democracy and the Constitution 
-- because of fear of being seen as insufficiently “patriotic.” And so, 
frustrated as hell by their  war constraints, they are (thank goodness!) 
being much less friendly to the Bush agenda on other domestic matters.  

<p>14. We know that so successful and swift has the U.S.-led coalition been in 
the early weeks, with Muslim opposition fairly muted and containable, that 
the Bush Administration feels it can begin attacks in other countries 
suspected of harboring terrorists.

<p>15. We know that there is no clearly understood definition of the  word 
“terrorist.” One man’s or country’s “terrorist” is another man’s or 
country’s “freedom fighter.” So far, this fuzziness of definition has not 
caused major problems -- but it surely will. 

<p>16. We know that there has been no  declaration of a State of War by the 
Congress, only a resolution authorizing the President to do what must be done 
in combating the terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attack on the U.S. 
mainland. 

<p>17. We know that, especially in the heartland captured by Bush in 2000  but 
way beyond as well, a new kind of McCarthyism is rearing its head, taking its 
lead from Bush’s   “you’re-either-with-us-or-you’re-with-the-terrorists” 
kind of demagoguery and Ashcroft’s equation of criticism with aiding 
terrorists. Already, those deemed insufficiently patriotic are being 
blacklisted in academia and journalism, with the result being  
self-censorship.

<p>18. We know that because of Bush’s popularity and the way anti-terror war 
news  dominates the headlines and energies, so many aspects of Bush’s 
right-wing policies are going insufficiently examined, especially with regard 
to environmental and judicial matters. And the Enron scandal, which involves 
Bush on the periphery, is barely visible, whereas Whitewater was front-page 
scandal for months.

<p>19. We know that because the Muslim reaction in the Middle East has been 
relatively muted, the U.S. decided it didn’t need to do anything major to 
keep the Palestinians happy. It said the right words about the need for a 
“Palestinian state,” but it essentially left the Palestinians to the tender 
mercies of Ariel Sharon’s military campaign.

<p>20. We know that if Arafat is eliminated as the Palestinians’ viable leader, 
the Israelis will  have to face Hamas and Hizbollah, which the U.S. has 
declared are terrorist organizations. 

<p>21. We know that Israeli intelligence officials have acknowledged that peace 
and security will not, and cannot, be obtained through military means, and 
that only a political settlement will work.

<p>22. We know that peace and security will come in the Middle East when, and 
only when, Israel withdraws from the Occupied Territories -- including 
withdrawing all Israelis from the settlements (thus turning them over to  
returning Palestinian refugees  -- and the Palestinians formally acknowledge 
Israel’s right to exist and agree to international status for Jerusalem. But 
knowing that -- and knowing that the Israelis and Palestinians also know that 
-- means nothing in the current violence unless somebody else steps in to 
help arrange the peace. The U.S. must be at the heart of that peace-making 
process.

<p>23. We know that helping bring peace to the Palestine area will also, in the 
long run, reduce the impetus for terrorism among fundamentalist Arabs. Along 
the same lines, we know that alterting other policies in the Mideast likewise 
will help alter the soil in which terrorism grows -- such as more economic 
justice and jobs, such as removing  U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia, such as 
encouraging more democratic reforms in the area, etc. We know that Bush, 
thinking that armed intervention and threats can do the job, does not want to 
alter U.S. Policy along these lines.

<p>24. We know that we could significantly reduce our dependence on Mideast oil 
(perhaps as much as 20%)  -- with the concomitant political ramifications -- 
simply by legislatively ordering that our automobiles be made more 
energy-efficient, say, by five miles more per gallon.  We know that Bush does 
not want to do  this.

<p>25. We know that the progressive left is in disarray, not certain how to 
respond  to Bush’s expanded-war policies and civil liberties outrages. But we 
also know that we have to devise a strategy  -- one that includes reasonable 
policies to go after the fanatic terrorist cells and networks -- before  
full-fledged fascism is the “wartime” norm in this country.
