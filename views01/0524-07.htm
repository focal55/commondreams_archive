Few media eyebrows went up when the World Bank recently canceled a 
global meeting set for Barcelona in late June -- and shifted it to the 
Internet. Thousands of street demonstrators would have been in Spain's big 
northeastern port city to confront the conference. Cyberspace promises to 
be a much more serene location.

         <P>The World Bank is eager to portray its decision as magnanimous, 
sparing Barcelona the sort of upheaval that has struck Seattle, Prague, 
Quebec City and other urban hosts of international economic summits. "A 
conference on poverty reduction should take place in a peaceful atmosphere 
free from heckling, violence and intimidation," says a World Bank official, 
adding that "it is time to take a stand against this kind of threat to free 
expression."

         <P>A senior adviser to the huge lending institution offered this 
explanation: "We decided that you can't have a meeting of ideas behind a 
cordon of police officers." Presumably, the meeting of ideas will flourish 
behind a cordon of passwords, bytes and pixels.

         <P>If hackers can be kept at bay, the few hundred participants in the 
Annual Bank Conference on Development Economics will be able to conduct a 
lovely forum over the Internet. The video conferencing system is likely to 
be state-of-the-art, making possible a modern and bloodless way to avoid 
uninvited perspectives.

         <P>The World Bank's retreat behind virtual walls may fulfill its goal 
of keeping the riffraff away, with online discourse going smoothly, but 
vital issues remain -- such as policies that undercut essential government 
services in poor countries, while promoting privatization and user fees for 
access to health care and education.

         <P>"The objectives of the World Bank with this failed conference were 
simply an image-washing operation," said a statement from a Barcelona-based 
campaign that had worked on planning for the demonstrations. Now, the World 
Bank is depicting itself as the injured party.

         <P>Protest organizers are derisive about the Bank's media spin: "The 
representatives of the globalized capitalism feel threatened by the popular 
movements against globalization. They, who meet in towers surrounded by 
walls and soldiers in order to stay apart from the people whom they 
oppress, wish to appear as victims. They, who have at their disposal the 
resources of the planet, complain that those who have nothing wanted to 
have their voice heard."

         <P>The World Bank's gambit of seeking refuge in cyberspace should be 
a wake-up call to activists who dream that websites and email are 
paradigm-shattering tools of the people. Some who take it for granted that 
"the revolution will not be televised" seem to hope that their revolution 
will be digitized.

         <P>But there's nothing inherently democratizing about the Internet. 
In fact, it has developed into a prodigious conduit of political and 
cultural propaganda, distributed via centrally edited mega-networks. 
America Online has 27 million subscribers, the New Internationalist 
magazine noted recently. "They spend an incredible 84 percent of their 
Internet time on AOL alone, which provides a regulated leisure and shopping 
environment dominated by in-house brands -- from Time magazine to Madonna's 
latest album."

         <P>At the same time that creative advocates for social change are 
routinely putting the Internet to great use, powerful elite bodies like the 
World Bank are touting online innovations as democratic models -- while 
striving to elude the reach of progressive grassroots activism.

         <P>If, in 1968, the Democratic National Convention had been held in 
cyberspace instead of in Chicago, on what streets would the antiwar 
protests have converged? If, on Inauguration Day this year, the swearing-in 
ceremony for George W. Bush had taken place virtually rather than at one 
end of Pennsylvania Avenue, where would people have gathered to hold up 
their signs saying "Hail to the Thief"?

         <P>Top officials of the World Bank are onto something. In a 
managerial world, disruption must be kept to an absolute minimum. If global 
corporatization is to achieve its transnational potential, the discourse 
among power brokers and their favorite thinkers can happen everywhere at 
once -- and nowhere in particular. Let the troublemakers try to interfere 
by doing civil disobedience in cyberspace!

          
<P>In any struggle that concentrates on a battlefield of high-tech 
communications, the long-term advantages are heavily weighted toward 
institutions with billions of dollars behind them. Whatever our hopes, no 
technology can make up for a lack of democracy.
