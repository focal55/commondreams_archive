Ralph Nader, one of the most frequent and well-received visitors 
              to Madison over the past 40 years, returns tonight to deliver a 
              distinguished lecture at the University of Wisconsin.
<P>Nader arrives as the same man who spoke in Madison in the '70s, 
              '80s, '90s and during the 2000 presidential campaign, and he will 
              deliver the same message about the need for citizens to organize 
              at the grass roots in opposition to the threats to democracy and 
              liberty posed by corporate monopolies and cowering politicians.</P>
<P>But there is no question that Nader is now viewed differently. 
              As the Bush presidency unfolds, with the new president and his misguided 
              minions pushing the ideological envelope further and further to 
              the right, the anger over Nader&#146;s Green Party candidacy of 
              last year has, if anything, mounted. Old friends now dismiss him 
              as "arrogant" and "delusional" because he continues to suggest that 
              the Democratic and Republican parties are, at least at the upper 
              levels, bought by the same special interests. Local Democrats who 
              once hailed Nader as a visionary figure now reject him as a threat 
              to his own achievements or, worse yet, as a political eccentric 
              who ought to be consigned to the scrapheap of history.</P>
<P>But here&#146;s an amusing twist on the Nader bashing that is so 
              much in vogue this spring:</P>
<P>Among the most powerful Democrats in Washington, Nader is viewed 
              in a far friendlier light. Yes, there is a measure of anger at him 
              for having maintained a candidacy that hurt Al Gore in key states. 
              But there is, as well, a grudging acknowledgment that Nader drew 
              progressive voters to the polls, and that those progressive voters 
              almost certainly provided the narrow margins of victory for Democratic 
              Senate challengers Maria Cantwell in Washington state and Debbie 
              Stabenow in Michigan &#151; giving the Democrats a 50-50 split in 
              the Senate &#151; and for several Democratic House candidates, including 
              San Diego&#146;s Susan Davis and Madison&#146;s own Tammy Baldwin.</P>
<P>Perhaps that is why genuinely progressive Democrats, such as U.S. 
              Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga., 
              suggested after the election that Nader&#146;s campaign had at least 
              some positive impact &#151; most particularly when it came to mobilizing 
              young people. As McKinney said recently, "My ability to get elected 
              has always relied on nontraditional people &#151; bringing new people, 
              new supporters (into) the process &#151; so every new voter the 
              Green Party attracts is a potential new voter for me. The whole 
              idea of progressives, I thought, was to have more people participating, 
              not fewer."</P>
<P>When Nader visited Capitol Hill in February, at the invitation 
              of Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the Democratic minority leader 
              complimented Nader for running "a terrific campaign." They spoke 
              at length about the success of Nader&#146;s super rallies, where 
              thousands of people &#151; most of them young &#151; packed arenas 
              and paid as much as $20 to hear Nader talk about "deep democracy."</P>
<P>"Nobody is paying to hear (mainstream Democrats) talk about policy," 
              Gephardt admitted. Part of the appeal, Nader told Gephardt, was 
              that "the Greens actually have a more legitimate platform for the 
              old Democratic Party than the Democratic Party does."</P>
<P>Gephardt &#151; who disagreed with the Clinton-Gore line on trade 
              policy, welfare reform, farm aid and a host of other key issues 
              &#151; no doubt agreed. As he prepares his own presidential candidacy 
              in 2004, Gephardt will attempt to avoid the mistakes that Gore made 
              in 2000 &#151; the most significant of which was the assumption 
              that Ralph Nader would bend to the political winds of the moment.</P>
<P>Nader remains an uncompromising force in American public life. 
              For Democrats who have bent so far that they would not recognize 
              Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Nader is a threat. For Democrats such 
              as Gephardt, McKinney and Feingold, however, Nader poses far less 
              of a threat. Rather, he is a necessary reminder that Democrats can 
              and should pursue a more progressive politics.
