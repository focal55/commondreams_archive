<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"John," 
              came the voice on the phone last Thursday, "it&#146;s Sam Day."
</font>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
              he had a hundred times before, Madison&#146;s most determined activist 
              was calling to promote another noble cause that, were it not for 
              his rare combination of duty and optimism, might otherwise have 
              gone without note. This time, he was looking for support from The 
              Capital Times editorial pages for anti-nuclear weapons activists 
              who were about to be tried for exercising their First Amendment 
              rights in a military "no-protest zone" in northern Wisconsin.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
              usual, the answer was, "Of course, Sam." No matter how controversial 
              or obscure the movement embraced, no one with a conscience ever 
              feared going out on a limb to back his activist endeavors. The 74-year-old 
              writer and activist was the Underwriter&#146;s Laboratory of the 
              left &#151; if he passed the petition, joined the picket line or 
              risked the arrest, there was never any question that the cause was 
              just. With Sam, however, there was always some question about whether 
              the cause would prevail.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
              that he has passed &#151; the victim of a stroke that felled him 
              Friday &#151; anyone who seeks to turn this world onto a more peaceful 
              and humane course will find their good burden heavier. That&#146;s 
              because Sam carried more than his share of the load.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sam&#146;s 
              causes were never hopeless, and he could count more than his share 
              of victories. His 1979 fight as The Progressive&#146;s managing 
              editor to overcome federal government attempts to censor Howard 
              Moreland&#146;s account of how to build an hydrogen bomb &#151; 
              the details of which had been obtained from public records &#151; 
              resulted in a landmark free speech precedent.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              celebrity he obtained during the H-bomb imbroglio guaranteed Sam 
              steady work as a writer and editor. Instead, like internationally 
              renowned historian E.P. Thompson, Sam put his pen down &#151; for 
              the most part &#151; and in the early years of that dark decade 
              went into the streets as a campaigner for peace and nuclear disarmament.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those 
              Cold War days were heady times for anti-nuke activists, and Sam 
              was in the thick of it &#151; inviting the arrests for nonviolent 
              civil disobedience at military facilities that would ultimately 
              land him in federal prison for six months.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
              the arrival of the 1990s, the Cold War ended. Yet Sam recognized 
              that the nuclear peril remained. So he carried on in the lonelier 
              but no less necessary struggle to collect the peace dividend. Others 
              moved on to the easier causes of the moment, but Sam retained an 
              appropriate focus on the nuclear weapons that posed the greatest 
              threat to humanity.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
              an age of forgetting, victories were harder won. But Sam had a way 
              of reminding us all of the lingering danger and of the injustices 
              done in its name. He was a diligent crusader to free Mordechai Vanunu, 
              the Israeli nuclear technician who was jailed for revealing that 
              his country was secretly developing nuclear weaponry.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              man who had battled to blow the lid off America&#146;s nuclear secrets 
              knew the necessity of defending whistleblowers in other lands. Thompson, 
              the British historian who shared Sam&#146;s view that anti-nuclear 
              activism was a moral imperative, referred before his death to those 
              who battled militarism as the heroes of "a war of faith against 
              a class of destroyers."</font></P>
<P align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Another 
              hero has fallen. But the long and often thankless war of faith is 
              not done; not so long as the stations of power remain occupied by 
              destructive practitioners of a nuclear madness.
