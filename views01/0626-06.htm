The Supreme Court handed free-lance writers a major legal victory on Monday when it ruled in New York Times vs. Tasini that authors must be compensated when their work is sold as part of a database. A part of this writer is thrilled, and another part is worried sick.
<p>LEGALLY AND MORALLY, the free-lancers could hardly have had a stronger case. Because the contracts under question &#151; most of which are 10 years or older &#151; did not contain clauses explicitly dealing with the rights in question, they fell under the 1976 revision of the copyright laws determining that publishers would be presumed to own only the right to use the free-lancer&#146;s contribution as part of that particular &#147;collective work&#148; or a &#147;revision&#148; of it. To argue that they had a legal right to resell the work, newspapers and publishers had to argue that placing it on a database-such as Lexis/Nexis somehow constituted a &#147;revision.&#148; That&#146;s just plain silly, as even this notoriously pro-corporate court agreed, by a 7-2 margin.
<p>Morally, the publishers&#146; case was even weaker. When The New York Times sells its database to another source, it does so for a profit. When that source sells it to an end-user, it does so for an additional profit. How is it justifiable, therefore, that the only person in the transaction is who is entitled to no profit is the person who created the work in the first place? Add to this the fact that most free-lancers &#151; I exclude myself for the time being &#151; are among the worst compensated and most exploited workers in the entire media industry. To see the corporate moguls trying to squeeze a few pennies out of these writers is enough to make one rethink capitalism from the ground up. 
<p>Alas, there is a great deal more to the story. While the members of the National Writers Union &#151; of which I am a member largely for its excellent health insurance plan &#151; brought this suit, they were doing so to protect the earning power of their members. That is what unions do. But unions can be wrong about the best interests of their members, and the NWU might turn out to be wrong about this case, too. 
<p>
       In the first place, the dollar figures in question are minuscule. I have probably written a few thousand articles during my career, but if I earn a hundred bucks as a result of this decision, I&#146;ll be surprised. If you look at the perceived failure of ventures like Contenville as well as the tiny dollar figures generated by newspaper and magazine database sales, you&#146;ll see that while the principle may be large, the pay-off is not. Meanwhile, as a writer and an author of three works of history, I benefit enormously from the availability of these databases online when I do my research. I would gladly forgo whatever tiny checks to which I am entitled to prevent the companies from deleting everyone else&#146;s articles from their databases for fear of compensation. The historical record is bound to suffer, although just how much, no one can say for certain. Competing groups of historians filed opposing briefs on this point.
<p>
       Second, I benefit, at least indirectly, from the availability of my own work online, where others can cite it in their work, thereby increasing my &#147;brand recognition&#148; as a writer.
<p>
THE LOWLY FREE-LANCER
<p>
       True, the companies that are threatening to delete writers&#146; work from their databases rather than come up with complicated schemes to pay them are probably blowing a great deal of smoke. 
<p>Other creative industries have managed to solve this problem with collective pay schemes. If it’s possible to pay billions to Holocaust survivors, it can’t be too hard to pay pennies to free-lancers. But the net effect of this lawsuit has been that these same companies are now demanding all kinds of contractual rights to a writer’s work that they never owned before. If you are Norman Mailer or Salman Rushdie, you can tell them to get lost. But precious few writers are in a position to negotiate from a position of power with The New York Times magazine or Conde Nast. I recently agreed to sell reprint rights to articles I had written for The New York Times Book Review and The New Yorker — for nothing in the first case and about thirty bucks in the latter. If I had said no, they would have been just as happy to exclude my work from their collection. What would I have gained?
<p>WAS IT WORTH IT?
<p>Sometimes it’s worth sacrificing material gain to defend a principle. Perhaps this is one of them. Perhaps the numbers will turn out to be much larger than anticipated and we writers will all be driving Lexuses to work. I sure hope so. But this may turn out to be a case where what’s right is the enemy of what’s best. If so, it will add yet another burden to the last group of people in the mega-media business who can afford to shoulder it.
