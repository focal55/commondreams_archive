Last Tuesday they were celebrating Inglewood's finest hour in more
than a decade: the "grand opening" of a revitalized Market Street, the
main downtown thoroughfare. The band was playing, the balloons were
swaying and the flowering jacaranda trees were framing a picture of a
city on the verge of a renewed civic identity.
<p>Inglewood, City of Champions, put out the welcome mat to show off its
$3.6-million renovation effort and illustrate its urban vitality. Mayor
Roosevelt Dorn said there's "something good in Inglewood." Now if they
could only let the "perception managers" know about it.
<p>What does a city do when outside perceptions cloud its reality? Is it
Inglewood or "Inglehood," Inglewood or "Ingle Watts"? As one who lives in
the adjacent L.A. neighborhood of Westchester, I've been met with puzzled
looks and wide-eyed stares at my residence location. My safety is the
immediate concern. If my address were Bel-Air, Brentwood, Westwood or
Beverly Hills-adjacent, would safety be the topic of conversation? I've
tested the theory, and the other locations lead to excited conversations
about where to shop, eat or do business.
<p>In his book, "Public Opinion," journalist Walter Lippmann wrote: "We
do not first see, and then define, we define first and then see." In
other words, distorting reality is part of the human condition, and it is
the "pictures in our heads" that determine reality.
<p>The pictures in our heads in Los Angeles and its surrounding
communities are of two cities--one of "neighbor-hoods," the other of
neighborhoods. One type of neighborhood is deserving of our attention,
our dollars and our investments--places overwhelmingly white and
affluent. These are the neighborhoods and communities that are desirable,
so much so that even if you aren't lucky enough to live there, you
describe your neighborhood as XYZ-adjacent.
<p>The other Los Angeles holds neighborhoods that are better off left
alone, not to be experienced firsthand lest you become a victim to its
unpredictable cast. These neighborhoods are overwhelmingly African
American and Latino, generally less newsworthy and less visible in the
business and economic buzz circles, but very visible in those pictures in
our heads. Those pictures are often mediated, housed in the Metro
sections of newspapers telling us about yet another disaster over
there--another sad shooting or tragic mishap that triggers the Pavlovian
head nod and the reminder to check our gas gauges if we're ever adjacent
to these areas.
<p>Where one person sees a "hood," others see a neighborhood. Where one
person sees a city on the verge of revitalization and ripe for community
development, others see a city on a desperate or futile path to redefine
itself.
<p>When Lippmann published "Public Opinion" in 1922, we had no mass media
like today. Even then, he wrote that we live in a world that is
constructed by what others tell us--through stories, pictures and
newspaper accounts. No one has the ability to directly experience the
dramatic accounts we're told or read about, so we must experience them
second-hand, through the prism of others' interpretation.
<p>Today's mass media, and individual journalists and reporters, are our
prism for the most part. They have an enormous responsibility to tell
stories that reflect the reality, and not just the pseudo-reality, of
places. Without these stories, our city of Los Angeles will remain
divided between neighborhoods and communities deserving of our time and
money and those that are not.
