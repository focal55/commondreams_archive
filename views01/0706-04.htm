WASHINGTON -- Poor David Satcher. Like so many other medical professionals before him, our surgeon general has fallen victim to public scorn and outrage on account of that perennial American hang-up: human sexuality.
<p>Although Satcher got some of this at the outset of his stint as the nation's No. 1 physician, it turns out that the stir caused by his positions on HIV research and reproductive rights was nothing compared to the commotion under way since Satcher released "The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior."</p>
<p>From the profusion of venom that has been spewed since Satcher disclosed his findings, one would think the surgeon general had ventured something radical or revolutionary. He hasn't.</p>
<p>Satcher's proposed treatment of the alarming rates of sexual infection, unintended pregnancy and sexual abuse is as old-fashioned as the hills. It's communication. The honest kind, which is the only kind that counts. "We need to talk about sex," he has said. To young people, he means.</p>
<p>It's sad that there is still a bunch of folks who think that talking about the infamous "It" is tantamount to encouraging It. And the last thing they want to do is to let kids in on the joys of sex.</p>
<p>There are certainly good reasons for that. Sex, though primal and simple in most animals, becomes considerably more complex in the human kind, mainly because of how we load it down with moral and emotional baggage while hyenas and bears, for example, don't.</p>
<p>Love and intimacy and respect and commitment are not part of the package when the birds and bees get together -- at least not that we know of -- so, while sexual urges are just as natural and physiological for us as they are for Shamu, we are the lone members of the animal kingdom who are expected to manage, calibrate or suppress those impulses.</p>
<p>Indeed, we are so serious about this that we have developed layers of penalties for those who do not manage, calibrate or suppress the urges according to the cultural rules. </p>
<p>If nothing else, we will pelt violators with shame and exclusion, yanking the rug of opportunity from beneath their frisky feet.</p>
<p>But that's the subjective stuff. What drove Dr. Satcher to wade into this risky territory is the objective material, the cold, unflinching facts.</p>
<p>Among them: 12 million Americans with a sexually transmitted disease, many of them teenagers; 40,000 new cases of HIV infection a year.</p>
<p>These facts and others present what Satcher calls a "public health imperative." In other words, we have no choice but to face the facts. Actually, I guess we do have one other, and that would be to perish.</p>
<p>Trouble is, folks don't want to talk about sex with their kids and they don't want the school to do it either. </p>
<p>Nor, for that matter, the church. I suppose they'd rather let them find out the old-fashioned way, which is by hearsay and experimentation.</p>
<p>"No," they would surely protest, "we don't mind telling the kids about sex as long as the message is abstinence."</p>
<p>The abstinence argument can't be beat. But real sex education -- the kind that will protect mental, emotional and physical health -- cannot be one-dimensional. </p>
<p>An honest conversation -- a conversation that is fair to the kids -- will stress abstinence while telling kids what to do and why, in the event they decide to do something we know they're not ready for yet.</p>
<p>That happens, you know. In the best of families. To the best of kids. Even to kids who have been drenched in abstinence talk. Seems to me you don't punish a hardhead with a life-threatening lesson.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe the anti-sex-ed crowd knows something the surgeon general of the United States does not. Maybe they know that talking about it honestly and openly will lead to better judgment and wiser strategies. And down would go the rate of STDs, and down would go the rate of HIV infection, and down would go the unintended pregnancies.</p>
<p>And down would go the suffering for people who, perhaps, did It too soon.</p>
<p>And where's the future of self-righteousness in that?</p>
