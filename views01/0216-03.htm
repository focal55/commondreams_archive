Rougemont, North Carolina --  Bill, I am so angry at you. You probably totally lost sight of it, but there were a lot of us out here who cared about you. You were the first of my generation to occupy the White House, and despite your moments of cowardice and personal sleaziness, you also stood for something. Or seemed to.
<P>You made a genuine effort to form an inclusive government. You brought an unprecedented number of women and minorities into your administration. You tried (although ham-fistedly) to do something about the ridiculous state of health care in this country. I wanted you to succeed.
<P>I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. You were a 'New' Democrat, after all.
<P>Many of my ideals, you'd concluded, like total inclusion of gay people into the mainstream of American life, wouldn't wash with the Great Middle that determines the direction of this country. We had to learn to be practical. I thought your policy on gays in the military was wishy-washy and constitutionally suspect, but at least it was a try. Right?
<P>You didn't seem to have the guts to ignore the right-wing Cuba lobby, although as an intelligent person you knew very well that the embargo against Havana was our longest-standing foreign policy failure. Florida, after all, was an electorally important state. (You didn't know the half of it, of course.)
<P>When you and Hillary decided to try to do something about health care, you didn't dare disturb the insurance companies too much. Hillary's behemoth was an attempt to have it both ways that was so ungainly that no intelligent person could even figure out how it would work. The result: Insurance execs were left in charge of life-and-death decisions about our lives. You then came up with a puny Band-Aid "patients' bill of rights" to try to make up for your massive failure, and that didn't fly either.
<P>Your foreign policy consisted mainly of trying to open markets for multinational corporations.
<P>And then there was Monica.
<P>Well, Bill, the problem is that through all that, you still looked better than the alternative. There was still some kind of aura of trying, when practicable, to stand up for ordinary people. It boggled my mind that a man as smart as you had so little sense about how to conduct your very public private life. But then, I've known a lot of deeply flawed people who have managed to do a great deal of good despite their enormous character defects. A few former presidents come to mind. I could still reflect that there was some kind of double standard at work in judging you so harshly. It was, I figured, between you and Hillary. I sure wished you'd have been a better role model, but in public life, I'm aware, good role models are in short supply. It's a big ask.
<P>Here's what I need to know: Why did you have to blow it so outrageously on your way out?
<P>Talking to my brother, who voted for George W., I expressed my disgust at your plundering of the White House for a few couches you could have bought for yourself, and your nearly inexplicable pardoning of an international criminal whose ex had given your party and your library gazillions. "To me, it's just more of the same," he said.
<P>I didn't think so. I mean, political cowardice comes in all stripes, and unruly libidos bring even the most humble people to grief. But using the power of your office to sweeten the life of a super-wealthy international criminal? Bill, that's fat-cat sleaze. That's real betrayal.
<P>What makes it all the more painful is that, from my little perch here in North Carolina, I know a lot of folks will generalize from your actions. This is a tough time for liberals, for those of us who still believe in trying to use government to create a fairer playing field, who care that poor women may be off welfare but their kids are being cared for inadequately while they work minimum wage jobs, all that bleeding-heart stuff.
<P>Aha, the newly victorious will crow, that's what liberals are like. No moral fiber. See? We toldja so.
<P>Eight years of some imperfect but not totally useless attempt to assert those ideals comes to an end with one of the most graceless exits imaginable.
<P>Biographers and psychohistorians will have a field day with you one day, Bill. But for right now, I hope you'll have the good taste to lie low and work on your golf game. Once again, though, I know it's a big ask.
