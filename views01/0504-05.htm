Media commentators are split about Bob Kerrey and what happened 32 
years ago in the Vietnamese village of Thanh Phong. Some journalists seem 
eager to exonerate the former senator. Others appear inclined to turn him 
into a lightning rod for national guilt.

         <p>Syndicated columnists have been a bit unpredictable. "This is a 
murder story that lacks the basic underpinnings high standards should 
require," liberal Thomas Oliphant wrote. Conservative John Leo was less 
evasive: "The village was a 'free-fire' zone, meaning that all who lived 
there were regarded as enemies who could be fired on at will. Did that 
policy amount to a blank check for American troops to commit atrocities? 
Even at this late date, we need to know the answer."

         <p>In some media quarters, fury erupted after a New York Times 
editorial declared: "It is a story that -- with its conflicting evidence, 
undeniable carnage and tragic aftermath -- sums up the American experience 
in Vietnam and the madness of a war that then, as now, seemed to lack any 
rationale except the wrecking of as many lives as possible on both sides."

         <p>The punditry duo on the "NewsHour With Jim Lehrer" condemned the 
Times as terribly unfair to Kerrey. The editorial was "an act of moral 
arrogance rarely seen," Mark Shields charged. Paul Gigot chimed in: "Mark 
stole my thunder beating up the New York Times." Similar noises, on "Fox 
News Sunday," came from the host of NPR's "Talk of the Nation," Juan 
Williams, who claimed that reporters were giving Kerrey shabby treatment.

         <p>Striving to encourage such sentiments, Kerrey has resorted to the 
kind of media-as-traitors bombast that Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon 
found so irresistible as commanders in chief. "It's disgraceful," Kerrey 
complained in an Associated Press interview several days ago. "The 
Vietnamese government likes to routinely say how terrible Americans were. 
The Times and CBS are now collaborating in that effort."

         <p>New York Times columnist William Safire is also sounding familiar 
themes these days. While not bothering to note his own specialized 
war-making services as a top speechwriter in the Nixon administration, he 
rushed to the defense of Kerrey -- and the war on Vietnam. In a column that 
decried a "humiliating accusation of national arrogance," Safire urged us 
to "recall a noble motive."

         <p>But when motives were based on lies and illusions, how could they 
have been "noble"?

         <p>Commonly, in the U.S. media frame, the vast majority of the war's 
victims -- including a few million dead people in their home countries of 
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia -- are rendered as little more than props for 
the anguish of Americans. How much we have suffered as a result of killing 
those people! Their importance grows only to the extent that they 
underscore our own.

         <p>A year ago, Kerrey wrote a Washington Post op-ed piece that 
concluded: "Was the war worth the effort and sacrifice, or was it a 
mistake? Everyone touched by it must answer that question for himself. When 
I came home in 1969 and for many years afterward, I did not believe it was 
worth it. Today, with the passage of time and the experience of seeing both 
the benefits of freedom won by our sacrifice and the human destruction done 
by dictatorships, I believe the cause was just and the sacrifice not in vain."

         <p>Only our own national narcissism, mendacity and denial can 
preserve the binary myth that the war was either "worth the effort" or "a 
mistake." The war was wrong not because it proved to be unwinnable but 
because it was, fundamentally, mass murder from the start. Propaganda 
aside, U.S. forces invaded Vietnam -- welcomed by a succession of Saigon 
regimes that Washington installed and propped up.

         <p>Kerrey did his deadly work in the Mekong Delta in early 1969. So 
did Brian Willson, a first lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. As a ground 
security officer, he saw bombing operations up close and witnessed effects 
on the ground, in villages. "The only difference between Kerrey and myself 
is that I was never in a position to personally kill while in Vietnam," 
Willson says. "But I was part of a killing machine, even being complicit in 
the bombing campaigns, and I saw dozens and dozens of the bodies of women 
and children."

         <p>Willson went on to become an Air Force captain. Later, he studied 
the Pentagon Papers and other official documents clearly showing that -- 
from the outset -- U.S. leaders knew the overwhelming majority of 
Vietnamese wanted the U.S. out of their country. "It was true that we could 
not determine friend from foe," Willson remembers. "Most, at least 
secretly, were foe." Vietnamese people "were defending their integrity and 
sovereignty from us invaders." The entire war was "immoral and illegal."

         <p>One day in 1987, Willson lost his legs when he joined with other 
peace activists for civil disobedience on some train tracks in California. 
A train -- carrying munitions on the way to Central America -- ran him 
over. At the time, Willson was trying to impede the shipment of weaponry 
destined for use in warfare largely aimed at civilians.

         <p>Since the early 1990s, the bombing and ongoing embargo of Iraq 
have killed at least several hundred thousand children. A current 
billion-dollar military aid package from the United States, under the guise 
of a "war on drugs," is boosting the death toll in Colombia. Just 
foreign-policy business as usual. Rest assured, we have no blood on our hands.

         <p>"They have destroyed and are destroying ... and do not know it and 
do not want to know it," James Baldwin wrote a few decades ago. He added: 
"But it is not permissible that the authors of devastation should also be 
innocent. It is the innocence which constitutes the crime."
