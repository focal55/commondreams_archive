The defection of Sen. Jim Jeffords came not a moment too soon,
even if the Vermonter stayed Republican long enough to ensure passage
of George W. Bush's trillion-dollar tax break for the least
needy.
<P>It took a lot of courage, that rare commodity on Capitol Hill, for
Jeffords to quit the Republicans, even though they had treated him
badly when he was among the most liberal of the their number. But
when he joined the Democratic caucus (albeit as an independent), it
was a sweet reversal of fortunes for the Rs who had usurped the
public's will and a boon for the Ds who had been cheated out of the
White House. Tom Daschle, by the slimmest of margins, assumed the
title of Senate Majority Leader from Trent Lott while Jesse Helms,
Phil Gramm, Orrin Hatch, Bob Smith and the other mossback Rs had to
turn over their committee gavels. But just rearranging the furniture
won't impress voters. The new Democratic chairmen, with new subpoena
powers, can and should call the Bush administration to task, and at
this writing they already were looking into rising energy prices,
election reform and Medicare prescription drug benefits.</P>

<P>Trent Lott and other Republican ideologues at first tried to
undermine the Democrats' new authority, claiming that Jeffords had
mounted a "coup of one" and that the Ds lacked a mandate. Then it was
noted that the Rs had been the nominal majority in the Senate for the
first four months only because George W. Bush had been awarded the
White House by the Supreme Court on a disputed count in Florida, when
he still trailed Al Gore by half a million popular votes. So Dick
Cheney was the tie-breaking vote in the deadlocked Senate.</P>

<P>Republicans threatened to filibuster the reorganization of the
Senate if Democrats did not agree to give Bush's judicial nominees a
pass in the Judiciary Committee, but that threat was hollow:
Democrats aren't going to get any progressive bills through the
right-wing-controlled House this year anyway, so gridlock in the
Senate hurts the White House more than it hurts the Democrats. But if
the Ds stand their ground in the Senate, the tax bill could be the
last bad bill that gets through that chamber.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, Daschle announced he planned to move the bankruptcy
deform bill to a conference committee to haggle over differences with
the House version. Lobbyists for banks and credit card companies have
been demanding the bill, which would end the ability of middle-income
debtors to wipe out credit card debts, medical bills or other
unsecured debts by filing for bankruptcy. The best hope for consumers
is an impasse between House Republicans and Senate Democrats over the
Senate version's $125,000 cap on home equity that can be shielded
from creditors. That would end an unlimited exemption that now exists
in several states, including Texas, which Republican leaders don't
want to accept. Another Senate provision that House Rs want to strip
out would end the ability of abortion protesters to escape legal
judgments resulting from clinic violence by filing for
bankruptcy.</P>

<P>Still, Democrats are well-positioned to take the initiative in the
Senate. With Tom Harkin of Iowa taking over Agriculture from Richard
Lugar, there is a chance for a discussion of how we might save family
farms from the predation of agribusiness. Robert Byrd's ascension at
Appropriations means more pork for West Virginia instead of Ted
Stevens' Alaska, but Byrd also will vote with the liberals more often
than not. Carl Levin's Armed Services Committee will be much more
skeptical of Pentagon boondoggles such as missile defense than John
Warner's. Under Paul Sarbanes, with a pro-labor and pro-consumer
record (and opposition to bankruptcy deform) maybe the Banking
Committee should no longer be the handmaiden of the financial
industry as it was under Gramm. Jeff Bingaman has signaled an
interest in hearings into price gouging as Energy chair. Jim Jeffords
not only takes over Environment from Smith; he actually cares about
the environment. Fellow Vermonter Patrick Leahy will be in a position
to demand moderate judicial nominees at Judiciary, where Hatch would
have OK'd the most extreme rightwingers Bush could come up with. Max
Baucus, taking over Finance, already plans hearings on a prescription
drug benefit. Joseph Biden replaces the Foreign Relations Helms-man.
Joseph Lieberman can cause headaches for the Bush administration at
Governmental Affairs, and if Jeffords was a middling decent chair of
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, new chair Ted Kennedy is
<I>The Man</I> who has long advocated universal health care.</P>

<P>And soft-spoken Daschle has done a good job leading the fractious
Democrats. As senator from South Dakota, he is well-versed on rural
as well as urban affairs and the challenges faced by health
providers. Most importantly, he is open to progressive populism.</P>

<P>This is no time for small deeds and modest goals for Democrats.
They need to show that they once again are worthy of the people's
support. If Democrats show the will, progressive populists can help
Kennedy get the votes to pass a universal health care bill, if not
after the 2002 elections (since it would still require a veto
override), then perhaps in 2005.</P>

<P>When Democrats approved Bill Clinton's tax increase in 1993,
Republicans predicted that it would lead to a recession. Instead, it
eliminated the record budget deficits of the Reagan-Bush I era and
led to eight years of economic growth, the longest such streak in the
nation's history. Now, with the prospect of budget surpluses as we
head into the 21st century, instead of investing in universal health
care, better schools and providing for the welfare of the 5% of the
population that the Federal Reserve requires to remain jobless, the
Republicans, with no popular mandate but helped by a few quisling
Democrats, passed a tax cut that will cost the Treasury more than
$1.35 trillion over the next decade.</P>

<P>The best thing that can be said of the tax cut -- other than the
one-time rebate of up to $600 for couples, which progressive
Democrats managed to insert -- is that the cuts expire in 10 years,
and many of the worst cuts don't take effect for several years.</P>

<P>That gives progressives time to rebuild a coalition that could
enact an agenda of universal health care, more spending to close the
gap between schools in low-income and wealthy communities and
programs to ensure that working people are able to lift their
families out of poverty.</P>

<P>Senate Democrats should give Bush a choice: Deal with them as
equals, or be a lame duck. Bush has paid some lip service to moderate
Republicans, and he even invited John McCain to the White House for
chicken fried steak. But a few days later, White House Chief of Staff
Andrew Card said Bush would veto the bipartisan HMO reform bill drawn
up by McCain and Ted Kennedy. The bill would let patients sue health
plans for denial of treatment and seek as much as $5 million in
damages. Bush vetoed a similar bill in Texas before Republican
legislators and his Democratic mentor, Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock,
explained to Dubya that he needed to let that one pass. Bush then
embraced the Texas bill in last year's campaign as proof that he was
sensitive to the needs of people.</P>

<P>HMO reform would be a good start, but even that half-measure will
be a tough sell to get past these Republican skinflints, and it won't
help the 44 million or so working poor who can't afford health care
now. Universal health care for every American should be our main
goal.</P>

<P>Timothy McVeigh is dead and undoubtedly there will be a move to
make him a martyr to the militia movement which, ironically, he left
crippled in addition to the 168 victims of the Oklahoma City bombing.
He's no martyr here, just a deluded fanatic who thought he would
ignite a revolution with his fertilizer bomb. But his atrocity only
made Americans forget the atrocity in Waco against which he was
rebelling. (The government only compounded the atrocity by killing
him, but that's another story.) The solution to bad government, dear
friends, is to get good people to run for election and then get your
friends out to vote. Then, of course, see to it that your vote is
counted. But if Mexico can clean up its elections, surely there is
hope for the USA.
