WE thought we had put slavery, holocausts and apartheid behind us 
- that humanity would never again allow dehumanizing and  violent 
systems  to  shape  the  rules by which  we  live  and  die.  Yet 
globalization is giving rise to new slavery, new holocausts,  new 
apartheid.  It is a war against nature, women, children  and  the 
poor. A war which is transforming every community and home into a 
war  zone. It is a war of monocultures against diversity, of  big 
against small, of war time technologies against nature.
<P>
Technologies  of  war  are becoming the basis  of  production  in 
peacetime.  Agent  Orange, which was sprayed on Vietnam,  is  now 
being  sprayed on our farms as herbicide along with Round up  and 
other   poisons.  Plants  and  animals  are   being   genetically 
engineered,  thus making our fields sites of biological  warfare. 
And  perverse intelligence is being applied to  terminate  life's 
cycles  of  renewal  by  engineering  "Terminator"  seeds  to  be 
sterile.
<P>
As  the violence grows, the stress on societies,  ecosystems  and 
living beings is reaching levels of breakdown. We are  surrounded 
by processes of ecological and social breakdown.
<P>
Witness  the events of our times which are now front  page  news. 
Cows in Europe being subject to bovine spongiform  encephalopathy 
(BSE), millions of animals being burnt as foot and mouth  disease 
spreads  due  to  increased trade, farmers  in  India  committing 
suicide  in thousands, the Taliban destroying their  heritage  by 
vandalizing the Bamiyan Buddhas, a 15-year-old boy Charles Andrew 
Williams  shooting his classmates in a Californian  high  school, 
ethnic cleansing.
<P>
All these are wars of peacetime, occurring in our daily lives and 
the last expression of violence in a system which has put  profit 
above life, commerce above justice, ethics and ecology as violent 
technologies.
<P>
Cows  are  herbivores,  they  are not  meant  to  eat  their  own 
carcasses.  But,  in  an industrial  system  of  factory  farming 
globalized  under  free  trade  rules  of  agriculture,  it   was 
"efficient"  to grind up the meat of infected sheep and cows  and 
turn  it into cattle feed. This has spread BSE among cattle  -  a 
disease that can be transmitted to humans.
<P>
Children  should be playing with their friends. Schools  are  not 
supposed  to  be war zones. But a culture of guns  and  violence,  
combined  with one that has focussed so exclusively  on  commerce 
and  economic growth and material accumulation, has  left  future 
generations  uprooted  and unanchored, afraid  and  violent.  Our 
children are robbed of childhood. In Iraq, 12 children die  every 
hour  because of a trade embargo. In other regions, children  are 
being pushed into prostitution or warfare - the only options  for 
survival  when  societies  break down. Across  the  Third  World, 
hunger  and  malnutrition  has grown as a  result  of  structural 
adjustment and trade liberalization policies.
<P>
During 1979-81 and 1992-93, calorie intake declined by three  per 
cent  in  Mexico,  4.1 per cent in Argentina, 10.9  per  cent  in 
Kenya,  10.0 per cent in Tanzania, 9.9 per cent in  Ethiopia.  In 
India,  the  per capita cereal consumption declined by  12.2  per 
cent  for rural areas and 5.4 per cent for urban  areas.  Denying 
food  to  the  hungry  and feeding the  markets  is  one  of  the 
genocidal aspects of globalization Countries cannot ensure  that 
the  hungry  are  fed because this involves  laws,  policies  and 
financial  commitments which are "protectionist" -  the  ultimate 
crime in the globalization regime.
<P>
Denying  medicine  to the ill so that the  global  pharmaceutical 
industry  can make profits is another aspect of  genocide.  Under 
the  Trade Related Intellectual Property agreement of  the  World 
Trade  Organization,  countries  have to  implement  patent  laws 
granting exclusive, monopolistic rights to the pharmaceutical and 
biotech industry. This prevents countries from producing low cost 
generic  drugs. Patented HIV/AIDS medicine costs  $15,000,  while 
generic  drugs  made by India and Brazil cost  $250-300  for  one 
year's treatment. Patents are, therefore, literally robbing  AIDS 
victims of their lives.
<P>
However,  in  the  world  order  of  globalization  dictated   by 
commerce,  greed  and  profits, it  is  providing  cures  through 
affordable  medicine  that is illegal. India,  Brazil  and  South 
Africa  have been taken to the WTO Court (the Dispute  Settlement 
Mechanism) because they have laws that allow low cost medicine to 
be produced.
<P>
At  the World Court of Women, we declare that laws that  force  a 
government  to deny citizens the right to food and the  right  to 
medicine are genocidal.
<P>
Globalization is a violent system, imposed and maintained through 
use  of  violence. As trade is elevated above  human  needs,  the 
insatiable  appetite  of global markets for resources is  met  by 
unleashing  new  wars over resources. The war  over  diamonds  in 
Sierra Leonne, over oil in Nigeria has killed thousands of  women 
and children.
<P>
The  transfer of people's resources to global  corporations  also 
makes  states more militaristic as they arm themselves on  behalf 
of commercial interests, and start wars against their own people. 
Violence has been used by the government against tribal people in 
areas  where Bauxite is mined in Orissa and in Koel  Karo,  where  
the building of a large dam was stopped.
<P>
But it is not just non-renewable resources like diamonds, oil and 
minerals which global corporations want to own. They want to  own 
our  biodiversity  and  water. They want to  transform  the  very 
fabric  and  basis of life into  private  property.  Intellectual 
Property  Rights  (IPRs) on seeds and plants, animals  and  human 
genes  are  aimed  at  transforming life  into  the  property  of 
corporations.  While  falsely claiming to  have  "invented"  life 
forms  and living organisms, corporations also claim  patents  on 
knowledge  pirated  from the Third World. The  knowledge  of  our 
mothers  and grandmothers is now being claimed as  inventions  of 
western  corporations and scientists. The use of neem  (Azarichta 
Indica)  as  pesticide  and  fungicide,  was  claimed  to  be  an 
invention by the U.S.D.A. and W.R. Grace. India challenged it and 
got the patent revoked. The seeds and plants of basmati have been 
claimed  as inventions by a U.S. corporation called Ricetec.  And 
these are only some examples of biopiracy which will lead to  the 
absurd  situation where the Third World pays for  knowledge  that 
evolved cumulatively and collectively.
<P>
From  the  Women's  Court, we declare that patents  on  life  and 
patents  based on biopiracy are immoral and illegal. They  should 
not  be respected because they violate universal  principles  for 
reverence  for  life and the integrity of a  culture's  knowledge 
systems.
<P>
We  will  not live by rules that are robbing  millions  of  their 
lives  and  medicines, their seeds, plants and  knowledge,  their 
sustenance  and dignity and their food. We will not  allow  greed 
and  violence  to  be treated as the only  values  to  shape  our 
cultures  and our lives. We will take back our lives, as we  took 
back  the  right.  We know that violence  begets  violence,  fear 
begets  fear,  peace begets peace and love begets love.  We  will 
reweave the world as a place of sharing and caring, of peace  and 
justice,  not a market place where sharing and caring and  giving 
protection  are crimes and peace and justice are unthinkable.  We 
will shape new universals through solidarity, not hegemony. 
<P>
Women's  worlds are worlds based on protection - of  our  dignity 
and self respect, the well - being of our children, of the earth, 
of  her diverse beings of those who are hungry and those who  are 
ill.  To  protect is the best expression of humanity.  Those  who 
have tried to transform "protection" into a dirty word, the worst 
crime  of the global market place, see the protection of  health, 
nutrition,   livelihoods  all  call  for  trade   sanctions   and 
"punishment" by the W.T.O. and the World Bank.
<P>
To those who have tried to make the protection of life a crime we 
say echoing Archbishop Tutu: "You have already lost. You need  to 
get  out  of  the  way so that we can  protect  each  other,  our 
children and life on this planet." The future does not belong  to 
the Merchants of Death - it belongs to the Protectors of Life.
