A moment when an abyss yawns before the world, when Homo sapiens has replaced the snail darter and the caribou on the endangered species list, is obviously a low point for environmentalists. Still the tree-huggers had a high time at the annual banquet of the League of Conservation Voters and left their revels confident they could and must weather the dark days.
<p>They plainly derive much exhilaration from each other's company, and from the presence of their heroes, the public figures who have joined them in their always marginal struggle for a greener, cleaner world. And they were immensely buoyed by the small victory they won in the Senate earlier in the day. The conservative Republicans who had attempted a little honest profiteering -- they tried to spot-weld the House energy bill as an early Christmas present for industry and polluters -- were repelled by a vote of 100 to nothing. "Even the sponsors voted against it in the end," League President Deb Callahan exulted, bringing whoops of joy from the tree-huggers over their vegetarian dinners.</p>
<p>The conservationists cheered for Vermont's Sen. James Jeffords (I), who tipped the balance in the Senate in their favor. They cheered for Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R), conserving son of a famous conservationist, the late senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, and League Chairman Ted Roosevelt, descendant of the most famous Republican outdoorsman, Teddy Roosevelt. Sen. Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, preached conservation. The star orator was Rep. John Lewis (D), son of a Georgia sharecropper, who exhorted the audience to "HANG IN," a message delivered in a booming bass with such force and volume that it filled the lobby of the Mayflower.</p>
<p>I was called upon and I read a passage from a famous speech of 50 years ago, when the country found itself on the rim of an abyss that yawned before mankind. It was the mighty affirmation of author William Faulkner, who received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1950, when the shock and horror of the atomic bomb was still upon the world, annihilating previous ethical certainties and moral guideposts.</p>
<p>"Our tragedy today," said Faulkner, "is a general and universal physical fear . . . there are no longer problems of the spirit. There is only one question: When will I be blown up?"</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Faulkner concludes: "I believe that man will not merely endure: He will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance."</p>
<p>All this high talk was a long way away from the sticky political considerations and grapplings for the flag on Capitol Hill. Those who were trying to expedite the drilling in the Arctic wildlife reserve argued that true patriotism dictated wholesale adoption of the pro-industry, pro-drilling House bill, even if it added unsustainable weight to the defense authorization measure. </p>
<p>There was another major issue at stake here as well, national unity. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle had made it clear to Republicans that the Democrats could not accept a military measure with the energy bill wrapped into it. Several members of his caucus had made known their intention to filibuster any attempt on those lines.</p>
<p>Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) reminded the drillers in his caucus that unity, the vaunted dividend of the catastrophe, was a two-way street. He told them that out of a new zeal to clear vexing questions out of the president's way, the Democratic chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, had agreed to drop a restriction on the president's pet project, the National Missile Defense. Levin had swallowed hard, McCain said, and it was the Republicans' turn to do likewise. The country would see the power play not as patriotism but as war-profiteering.</p>
<p>It was obvious at the Republicans' pre-vote caucus that, as Lyndon Johnson used to say, "That dog won't hunt." </p>
<p>The coup de grace was administered by Sen. John Warner (R) of Virginia. He explained in his gentlemanly way that he felt very strongly that when so many men and women in the armed forces were leaving every port and airfield in the country to face an unknown enemy, "we have to vote out military appropriations as soon as possible."</p>
<p>And that is what happened three weeks to the day after the hijackers with the box-cutters changed the face of the world.</p>
<p>The news was at once encouraging and ominous for greens. Enemies of the caribou will be back, carrying the flag and insisting on the imperative of a policy that was written in secret and could just as well be the handiwork of oil, coal and nuclear CEOs. The environmental lobby is ready.</p>
