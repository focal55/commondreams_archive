Long ago, in the days before Jerry Springer and the World Wrestling
Federation, people satisfied their baser need for entertainment with a
trip to the town square to watch real-live heathens burned at the stake,
witches drowned and traitors peppered with buckshot.
<p>Cultures chose their instruments of torture carefully. The ancient
Romans devised the cross. The French brought us the guillotine. And in
the Old West, cowboys were partial to hangings at dawn.
<p>While our predecessors considered them even-handed, these practices
seem barbaric today. Yet a couple months ago, the U.S. attorney in
Oklahoma City sent out 1,100 personalized invitations to Timothy J.
McVeigh's execution.
<p>Only 10 ringside seats were available in the death chamber in Terre
Haute, Ind., for the invitation's recipients--survivors of the Oklahoma
City bombing and victims' family members. But U.S. Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft approved the ultimate "reality" show for the rest: a
closed-circuit telecast, in Oklahoma City, of McVeigh's execution.
Victims' families vary greatly in their feelings about the death penalty
for the man who set up the truck bomb that gutted the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and injuring more
than 500. Doris Jones lost her daughter, Carrie, who was pregnant with
what would have been Jones' first grandchild. She resents all the
attention McVeigh has gotten in the press. "Right now I'm paying for his
air, for his food," she says. "My daughter no longer can eat, read a
book, breathe. . . . I don't feel it's right."
<p>Bud Welch, whose daughter, Julie, died in the blast, felt similar
outrage. "I didn't even want trials for Tim McVeigh and Terry Nichols
after they'd been arrested and charged for the bombing; I simply wanted
them fried," he says. For nine months, Bud Welch returned to the bomb
site every day. He smoked up to three packs of cigarettes a day for his
nerves and downed several cocktails so he could sleep at night. Then one
day, watching the steady stream of tourists at the bomb site, Welch
realized that anger was destroying him. "Vengeance and rage motivated
McVeigh and Nichols--rage against the United States government for what
happened at Waco, Texas, and Ruby Ridge, Idaho," he says. "I realized
that to execute either one of them was an act of vengeance and rage."
<p>Welch now speaks against the death penalty. In 1998, while on tour in
western New York, Welch a private reconciliation with McVeigh's father,
Bill.
<p>"What I found that morning was a bigger victim of the Oklahoma City
bombing than myself," Welch says. "I can travel all over the country, to
Europe and to Africa, talking about Julie and bragging on her, but when
Bill McVeigh meets a stranger he probably doesn't even tell them he has a
son. When the invitation arrived in the mail this February, Welch did not
respond. He wishes he had entered the lottery for seats; if he'd won, he
would leave a seat empty in Terre Haute to represent his opposition to
the execution and the spectacle surrounding it.
<p>Six years ago, Timothy McVeigh committed the worst act of terrorism on
U.S. soil, an act further compounded in the American psyche because its
perpetrator--a high school track runner, a decorated Gulf War veteran, a
quintessentially American kid--struck in the heartland of America.
<p>His execution will be in large part symbolic. No death can make up for
the innocent lives lost in Oklahoma City or El Salvador or Cambodia or
the West Bank or Rwanda. Once we start smudging out those who have
committed crimes against humanity, we'll have a list of human symbols a
mile long.
<p>McVeigh will be eliminated by a relatively painless lethal injection.
Perhaps we have come so far since the days of town square hangings. But
I'm willing to bet if we brought execution out of high-security lock-down
and started offering brown-bag executions in the park, public policy
would swiftly shift toward abolishing the death penalty.
<p>No matter how "uncruel and usual" executions have become, we can't
quite deny the queasy rumbling in our stomachs. We're ready for
alternatives. Deep down, we're more humane than we're willing to admit.
