<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->I'm a pushover for a well-crafted argument.
<P></P>
Blame the Jesuits.
<P></P>
Remember those logical headbangers from high school?
<P></P>
<i>Conservatives are political animals. Stockwell Day is a conservative. Stock must be a political animal.</i>
<P></P>
Okay, syllogistic reasoning has never been my long suit.
<P></P>
Still, I was looking forward to hearing George W. Bush roll out the heavy intellectual artillery this week to defend America's daring new nuclear strategy: major weapons cuts, a torn-up Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and a complex missile defence.
<P></P>
Surely the Bush broom would sweep in a rigorous new strategic doctrine, even as it swept out an effective, decades-old approach to nuclear deterrence. 
<P></P>
Or not.
<P></P>
Bush made promising noises about "vision... a new way of thinking" in his speech to the National Defence University. But there was little sign of it. His speech merely announced that the ABM was toast.
<P></P>
Bush did propose, sensibly enough, to slash America's nuclear arsenal of 7,000 warheads. Officials mused about cutting to 1,500 or so.
<P></P>
But he failed dismally to articulate even a half-plausible argument for scrapping the ABM treaty and shelling out $250 billion (yes, that's the latest guesstimate) for a land- sea- and air-based missile shield.
<P></P>
His logic had more holes in it than a Swiss-on-rye at an airport sandwich bar.
<P></P>
This is an issue Prime Minister Jean Chrétien may wish to raise when U.S. envoys arrive sometime soon, lobbying for support. Foreign Affairs Minister John Manley, a tidy thinker himself, seemed deeply unimpressed. Ottawa would regard as "very problematic" a unilateral U.S. breakaway from the ABM treaty, he said after hearing Bush speak.
<P></P>
No kidding.
<P></P>
The 1972 American/Russian treaty has been helpful. It prohibits either party from deploying large-scale missile defences. That reduces the risk that one might "shoot first," then duck behind a shield and fend off its weakened adversary's response. This promotes stability.
<P></P>
Bush provided the thinnest of rationalizations for scuttling the treaty.
<P></P>
Russia and the U.S. are no longer enemies, he said. Hence the ABM has outlived its usefulness.
<P></P>
The real threat today comes from places like Iran, Iraq and North Korea, whose governments are reflexively anti-American and who are acquiring missiles and nuclear weapons technology. The U.S. needs to shield itself and friends. The ABM stands in the way.
<P></P>
Thus, the ABM is history.
<P></P>
Apart from displaying a tendency to assume what ought to be proved, these propositions are far from self-evident to many Americans. To the Russians and Chinese. To Canadians. And to allies. 
<P></P>
There's no doubt that Bush would <i>like</i> to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin that rich, powerful America can retain 1,500 modern warheads, build a missile shield, and not threaten weak, cash-strapped Russia with its rusting warheads and lack of defences. Putin might even say Da, from the bottom of a sufficently deep vodka bottle. But don't bet on it.
<P></P>
Russia and China have been quietly cozying up to each other. The Chinese are unalterably opposed to missile defence, knowing it would neutralize their 18 missiles. Both harbour a nagging suspicion that Bush aims to make America not only the sole superpower, but an invulnerable one.
<P></P>
The Americans envisage a "modest" shield. But what's to stop them from deploying a big one?
<P></P>
Rather than bend to Bush's "logic," Russia and China may embrace the logic of the Cold War and build up their arsenals, aiming to overwhelm any conceivable defence.
<P></P>
That's even likelier if Bush gives the go-ahead, as he says he will, for a shield that may not work very well. 
<P></P>
So much for wanting to reduce the nuclear threat.
<P></P>
Moreover, while Bush has a point about the <i>potential</i> threat from Iran etc., it does not automatically follow that a provocative, costly, unproved missile defence is the smartest response.
<P></P>
The U.S. can flex other muscles — diplomatic, military and financial — to deter aggression.
<P></P>
A decade ago, George Bush senior made war on Iraq just when Saddam Hussein had built missiles and weapons of mass destruction. Earlier, Israel bombed his main reactor. More recently Bill Clinton persuaded North Korea to dismantle worrisome nuclear facilities. 
<P></P>
The Americans aren't without options.
<P></P>
Bush's speech will be remembered, not for setting out a rigorous new strategic vision, but for serving notice that he intends to abandon policies that have kept the peace for 55 years because they impede Republican dreams of invulnerability.
<P></P>
The worst of it is, Bush doesn't seem to be trying very hard to even pretend that there's a strategic rationale behind this fiasco. He's just doing it.
