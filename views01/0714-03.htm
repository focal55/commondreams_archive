It was Denis Healey who suggested that the secret to the funding of government was to find a way of taxing sex, although for many of the middle-classes school fees have now more or less achieved the same effect. 
<P>This week, though, legislatures on two continents attempted the equally controversial move of banning intercourse. 
<P>President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya has urged the population to abstain from sex for at least two years in the hope of reducing the spread of Aids. And, in the US, though for a less terrible reason, judges this week tried to ban one member of the population from intercourse.  
<P>The popular view of middle America as a place obsessed with The Family and appalled by the thought of abortion was challenged by a curious court ruling that a Wisconsin man will be jailed if an ejaculation of his should result in procreation. The state's supreme court upheld the decision of a lower court to, in effect, sentence David Oakley, 34, to life-long contraception.  
<P>The judgment results from the failure of Mr Oakley to support financially the nine children he has so far fathered with four women. He owes $25,000 in child support and therefore qualifies as what modern American vernacular calls a "deadbeat dad". 
<P>As the US supreme court has previously ruled that Americans have a basic human right to attempt reproduction, higher justice may yet allow Mr Oakley to go bare-back on dates again. But the case is an extreme demonstration of the difficulties which arise when a government intervenes in procreation.  
<P>What happened in Wisconsin is that one precept of rightwing politics - that the state should not pay for the upkeep of offspring irresponsibly acquired - has come into conflict with another: that normal healthy people should have as many children as possible. 
<P>While Wisconsin may be saved some welfare dollars, Mr Oakley's last line of defense against imprisonment might well be, as he seems to be a a stranger to latex, to encourage future girlfriends to have terminations. Thus Republicans are presented with a dilemma. It is now legal for Mr Oakley to have a child of his aborted, but not to allow it to be born.  
<P>Their president this week found himself in a similar quandary over procreation. On Wednesday, George II went to New York where, among other duties, he visited St Patrick's Cathedral to present a posthumous congressional medal to the family of the late Cardinal John O'Connor.
<P>Roman Catholics are important to Bush's re-election plans as they are likely to be attracted to his party's solid stand against abortion.  
<P>And yet - like so much in his limping, illegitimate presidency - the strategy of courting the Catholics has turned out to be more complicated than Bush imagined. 
<P>He walked into St Pat's past protesters (Catholic and otherwise) carrying banners with the legend "150 + 2 - what does God think of that?" - a reference to the century and a half of prisoners Bush executed in Texas and the pair of lethal injections he has presided over from the White House. 
<P>Whereas the Pope is opposed to both abortion and capital punishment, Bush chooses to defend potential life while being profligate with actual existence, a position he upholds through a rhetorical wriggle about only "innocent" life being sacred.  
<P>And, as he batted for the cardinals in New York, even that theological platform was being rocked. George II's biggest impending decision is whether to allow federal funding for medical research on stem cells from embryos. 
<P>The Catholic hierarchy opposes such work - in line with its general theological fence around the fetus - but polls suggest that up to 70% of Catholics support such research as, on matters from contraception upwards, the pews tend to be more pragmatic than the pulpits.  
<P>It would take a political and theological genius to resolve this question and America has to make do with George Bush. By appeasing his Christian fundamentalist base in the Republican party and pleasing the Catholic bishops, he might annoy a majority of the electorate and win few Catholic votes.  
<P>And the question becomes more complex even as he contemplates it. Whereas previous researchers have used embryos created for fertility treatment, one American institute was reported this week to be creating stem cells merely for research, while another is exploring the possibility of creating embryos without the use of sperm cells, theoretically leading to the possibility of a child with two genetic mothers.  
<P>What has happened to Bush is that a political position which once seemed simple - pro-life - is becoming ever more intricate as science extends the varieties and definitions of life. 
<P>The methods used to demonize abortion - lurid photographs and descriptions of the medical methods used - won't work for stem cell research, which looks nondescript and seems to many to have consequences which are pro-living.  
<P>The lesson of these disparate but related stories is that -beyond outlawing rape, legislating the age of consent and regulating abortion - governments enter the arenas of sex and procreation at their peril. 
<P>The Kenyan president's plea for a chaste nation is desperately well-meaning but almost certain to be ignored. 
<P>And, as the US president dithers over stem cells, the supreme court which put him in power may be called to consider the case of Mr Oakley of Wisconsin and his right to bear children. Even George Bush is bright enough to see that the debate has got beyond the phrase pro-life.  </p>
