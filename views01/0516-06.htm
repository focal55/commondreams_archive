THERE ARE times when silence is golden. At other times, it is chicken.
<P></P>
Prime Minister Jean Chr&eacute;tien is undoubtedly correct when he denies a speculative report that Canada has already made up its mind about the controversial U.S. missile defence program - and that our reply is going to be, "Ready, Aye Ready, Uncle Sam."
<P></P>
In fact, this story, in the National Post, only claimed that Canada will "ultimately" buy into the missile defence program. It based this claim on some comments by an unidentified "senior official" - pretty tenuous stuff.
<P></P>
The story, itself, as opposed to the hyped-up front-page headline, accepted that cabinet still has to debate the matter. It argued, nevertheless, that the decision was preset because of the advantages for Canada in gaining high-tech contracts and preserving the joint Canada-U.S. NORAD air defence system based in Colorado.
<P></P>
Technically, therefore, nothing has changed since Chr&eacute;tien laid down our policy last month following President George W. Bush's announcement of his plans (other than an official having talked with a reporter, presumably on his minister's say-so) .
<P></P>
Chr&eacute;tien said then: "We are not confronted with the decision now because we do not know exactly what the plan will be."
<P></P>
By this kind of silence, Chr&eacute;tien and his government aren't acting cagey and clever, but are acting chicken.
<P></P>
The details of the plan are indeed not yet known. The system may be a space-based one. It may be a so-called "boost phase" one. It may be located on land or on ships at sea, or both.
<P></P>
As Chr&eacute;tien knows full well, these details change nothing that is consequential. All that matters is that Bush has said he intends to go ahead with the system. 
<P></P>
The consequences of Bush's impending action will be a breaking of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty and the start of a new arms race, particularly one involving China which - justifiably - will feel directly threatened (as will, by extension, China's regional rival, India, and, therefore, its rival Pakistan, and very likely Japan in response to a Chinese buildup). 
<P></P>
Bush's claim that his system is intended to defend the U.S. against "rogue" states is pure public relations: Its real target has to be China, which Bush now refers to provocatively as a "strategic competitor."
<P></P>
Given that some lucrative defence contracts will be coming down the pike, and that NORAD matters to us, and that we risk annoying the U.S. on an issue it claims to be central to its national security, the choice before Canada is going to be a difficult one.
<P></P>
Where Chr&eacute;tien can be faulted is not in delaying a decision, nor in eventually capitulating to the U.S. mixed offering of carrot and stick (as almost certainly he will), but in not deciding now on an alternative diplomatic strategy, and then implementing it.
<P></P>
The potential alternative strategy was well described the other day by former foreign affairs minister Lloyd Axworthy: "The Canadian government must get busy diplomatically to see how we can redirect American unilateralism."
<P></P>
Axworthy had in mind America's unilateralism only about the anti-missile system, no matter what its allies, or anyone else, says.
<P></P>
But it's the general, American unilateralism - scrapping the Kyoto environmental accord is the most dramatic example, withdrawing from an OECD project to crack down on international tax havens is the most recent - that is the real point at issue.
<P></P>
Under Bush, the U.S. is becoming a kind of rogue superpower.
<P></P>
This attitude wasn't invented by Bush. During Bill Clinton's term, the U.S. stood aside from the land mines treaty and the international criminal court treaty, while the U.S. Congress voted against ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
<P></P>
But unilateralism has now become explicit U.S. policy. One aspect of Bush's statement that attracted little attention was his declaration that the U.S. will in future cut back its nuclear missiles as it decides, rather than negotiate mutual reductions with Russia. More recently, Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld outlined a plan for the U.S. to militarize space, again as the U.S. chooses.
<P></P>
In his article, Axworthy defined the anti-missile issue as "a defining issue for Canadians."
<P></P>
It's important in itself, but what's really at issue is whether we have the will, the nerve and the diplomatic skill, to challenge American unilateralism and to remind Washington that despite all its power, it's part of the world and has a responsibility to the rest of the world.
<P></P>
Either we do that or our foreign policy is just a game of pretending to be different and of pretending, occasionally, to be brave.
<P></P>
