If you 
        know even as little history as I do, it is hard not to doubt the efficacy 
        of modern war as a solution to any problem except that of retribution&#151;the 
        &#147;justice&#148; of 
        exchanging one damage for another.</font>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Apologists 
        for war will insist that war answers the problem of national self-defense. 
        But the doubter, in reply, will ask to what extent the cost even of a 
        successful war of national defense&#151;in life, money, material, foods, 
        health, and (inevitably) freedom&#151;may amount to a national defeat. 
        National defense through war always involves some degree of national defeat. 
        This paradox has been with us from the very beginning of our republic. 
        Militarization in defense of freedom reduces the freedom of the defenders. 
        There is a fundamental inconsistency between war and freedom.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a 
        modern war, fought with modern weapons and on the modern scale, neither 
        side can limit to &#147;the enemy&#148; the damage that it does. These 
        wars damage the world. We know enough by now to know that you cannot damage 
        a part of the world without damaging all of it. Modern war has not only 
        made it impossible to kill &#147;combatants&#148; without killing &#147;noncombatants,&#148; 
        it has made it impossible to damage your enemy without damaging yourself.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 
        many have considered the increasing unacceptability of modern warfare 
        is shown by the language of the propaganda surrounding it. Modern wars 
        have characteristically been fought to end war; they have been fought 
        in the name of peace. Our most terrible weapons have been made, ostensibly, 
        to preserve and assure the peace of the world. &#147;All we want is peace,&#148; 
        we say as we increase relentlessly our capacity to make war.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet 
        at the end of a century in which we have fought two wars to end war and 
        several more to prevent war and preserve peace, and in which scientific 
        and technological progress has made war ever more terrible and less controllable, 
        we still, by policy, give no consideration to nonviolent means of national 
        defense. We do indeed make much of diplomacy and diplomatic relations, 
        but by diplomacy we mean invariably ultimatums for peace backed by the 
        threat of war. It is always understood that we stand ready to kill those 
        with whom we are &#147;peacefully negotiating.&#148;</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our 
        century of war, militarism, and political terror has produced great&#151;and 
        successful&#151;advocates of true peace, among whom Mohandas Gandhi and 
        Martin Luther King, Jr., are the paramount examples. The considerable 
        success that they achieved testifies to the presence, in the midst of 
        violence, of an authentic and powerful desire for peace and, more important, 
        of the proven will to make the necessary sacrifices. But so far as our 
        government is concerned, these men and their great and authenticating 
        accomplishments might as well never have existed. To achieve peace by 
        peaceable means is not yet our goal. We cling to the hopeless paradox 
        of making peace by making war.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Which 
        is to say that we cling in our public life to a brutal hypocrisy. In our 
        century of almost universal violence of humans against fellow humans, 
        and against our natural and cultural commonwealth, hypocrisy has been 
        inescapable because our opposition to violence has been selective or merely 
        fashionable. Some of us who approve of our monstrous military budget and 
        our peacekeeping wars nonetheless deplore &#147;domestic violence&#148; 
        and think that our society can be pacified by &#147;gun control.&#148; 
        Some of us are against capital punishment but for abortion. Some of us 
        are against abortion but for capital punishment.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
        does not have to know very much or think very far in order to see the 
        moral absurdity upon which we have erected our sanctioned enterprises 
        of violence. Abortion-as-birth-control is justified as a &#147;right,&#148; 
        which can establish itself only by denying all the rights of another person, 
        which is the most primitive intent of warfare. Capital punishment sinks 
        us all to the same level of primal belligerence, at which an act of violence 
        is avenged by another act of violence.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
        the justifiers of these acts ignore is the fact&#151;well-established 
        by the history of feuds, let alone the history of war&#151;that violence 
        breeds violence. Acts of violence committed in &#147;justice&#148; or 
        in affirmation of &#147;rights&#148; or in defense of &#147;peace&#148; 
        do not end violence. They prepare and justify its continuation.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        most dangerous superstition of the parties of violence is the idea that 
        sanctioned violence can prevent or control unsanctioned violence. But 
        if violence is &#147;just&#148; in one instance as determined by the state, 
        why might it not also be &#147;just&#148; in another instance, as determined 
        by an individual? How can a society that justifies capital punishment 
        and warfare prevent its justifications from being extended to assassination 
        and terrorism? If a government perceives that some causes are so important 
        as to justify the killing of children, how can it hope to prevent the 
        contagion of its logic spreading to its citizens&#151;or to its citizens&#146; 
        children?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If we 
        give to these small absurdities the magnitude of international relations, 
        we produce, unsurprisingly, some much larger absurdities. What could be 
        more absurd, to begin with, than our attitude of high moral outrage against 
        other nations for manufacturing the selfsame weapons that we manufacture? 
        The difference, as our leaders say, is that we will use these weapons 
        virtuously, whereas our enemies will use them maliciously&#151;a proposition 
        that too readily conforms to a proposition of much less dignity: we will 
        use them in our interest, whereas our enemies will use them in theirs.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Or we 
        must say, at least, that the issue of virtue in war is as obscure, ambiguous, 
        and troubling as Abraham Lincoln found to be the issue of prayer in war: 
        &#147;Both [the North and the South] read the same bible, and pray to 
        the same God, and each invokes his aid against the other&#133; The prayers 
        of both could not be answered &#151; that of neither could be answered 
        fully.&#148;</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recent 
        American wars, having been both &#147;foreign&#148; and &#147;limited,&#148; 
        have been fought under the assumption that little or no personal sacrifice 
        is required. In &#147;foreign&#148; wars, we do not directly experience 
        the damage that we inflict upon the enemy. We hear and see this damage 
        reported in the news, but we are not affected. These 
        limited, &#147;foreign&#148; wars require that some of our young people 
        should be killed or crippled, and that some families should grieve, but 
        these &#147;casualties&#148; are so widely distributed among our population 
        as hardly to be noticed.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Otherwise, 
        we do not feel ourselves to be involved. We pay taxes to support the war, 
        but that is nothing new, for we pay war taxes also in time of &#147;peace.&#148; 
        We experience no shortages, we suffer no rationing, we endure no limitations. 
        We earn, borrow, spend, and consume in wartime as in peacetime.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
        of course no sacrifice is required of those large economic interests that 
        now principally constitute our economy. No corporation will be required 
        to submit to any limitation or to sacrifice a dollar. On the contrary, 
        war is the great cure-all and opportunity of our corporate economy, which 
        subsists and thrives upon war. War ended the Great Depression of the 1930s, 
        and we have maintained a war economy&#151;an economy, one might justly 
        say, of general violence&#151;ever since, sacrificing to it an enormous 
        economic and ecological wealth, including, as designated victims, the 
        farmers and the industrial working class.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
        so great costs are involved in our fixation on war, but the costs are 
        &#147;externalized&#148; as &#147;acceptable losses.&#148; And here we 
        see how progress in war, progress in technology, and progress in the industrial 
        economy are parallel to one another&#151;or, very often, are merely identical.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Romantic 
        nationalists, which is to say most apologists for war, always imply in 
        their public speeches a mathematics or an accounting of war. Thus by its 
        suffering in the Civil War, the North is said to have &#147;paid for&#148; 
        the emancipation of the slaves and the preservation of the Union. Thus 
        we may speak of our liberty as having been &#147;bought&#148; by the bloodshed 
        of patriots. I am fully aware of the 
        truth in such statements. I know that I am one of many who have benefited 
        from painful sacrifices made by other people, and I would not like to 
        be ungrateful. Moreover, I am a patriot myself and I know that the time 
        may come for any of us when we must make extreme sacrifices for the sake 
        of liberty&#151;a fact confirmed by the fates of Gandhi and King.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
        still I am suspicious of this kind of accounting. For one reason, it is 
        necessarily done by the living on behalf of the dead. And I think we must 
        be careful about too easily accepting, or being too easily grateful for, 
        sacrifices made by others, especially if we have made none ourselves. 
        For another reason, though our leaders in war always assume that there 
        is an acceptable price, there is never a previously stated level of acceptability. 
        The acceptable price, finally, is whatever is paid.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is 
        easy to see the similarity between this accounting of the price of war 
        and our usual accounting of &#147;the price of progress.&#148; We seem 
        to have agreed that whatever has been (or will be) paid for so-called 
        progress is an acceptable price. If that price includes the diminishment 
        of privacy and the increase of government secrecy, so be it. If it means 
        a radical reduction in the number of small businesses and the virtual 
        destruction of the farm population, so be it. If it means the devastation 
        of whole regions by extractive industries, so be it. If it means that 
        a mere handful of people should own more billions of wealth than is owned 
        by all of the world&#146;s poor, so be it.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
        let us have the candor to acknowledge that what we call &#147;the economy&#148; 
        or &#147;the free market&#148; is less and less distinguishable from warfare. 
        For about half of the last century, we worried about world conquest by 
        international communism. Now with less worry (so far) we are witnessing 
        world conquest by international capitalism.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though 
        its political means are milder (so far) than those of communism, this 
        newly internationalized capitalism may prove even more destructive of 
        human cultures and communities, of freedom, and of nature. Its tendency 
        is just as much toward total dominance and control. Confronting this conquest, 
        ratified and licensed by the new international trade agreements, no place 
        and no community in the world may consider itself safe from some form 
        of plunder. More and more people all over the world are recognizing that 
        this is so, and they are saying that world conquest of any kind is wrong, 
        period.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They 
        are doing more than that. They are saying that local conquest also is 
        wrong, and wherever it is taking place local people are joining together 
        to oppose it. All over my own state of Kentucky this opposition is growing&#151;from 
        the west, where the exiled people of the Land Between the Lakes are struggling 
        to save their homeland from bureaucratic depredation, to the east, where 
        the native people of the mountains are still struggling to preserve their 
        land from destruction by absentee corporations.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To have 
        an economy that is warlike, that aims at conquest and that destroys virtually 
        everything that it is dependent on, placing no value on the health of 
        nature or of human communities, is absurd enough. It is even more absurd 
        that this economy, that in some respects is so much at one with our military 
        industries and programs, is in other respects directly in conflict with 
        our professed aim of national defense.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It seems 
        only reasonable, only sane, to suppose that a gigantic program of preparedness 
        for national defense should be founded first of all upon a principle of 
      
        national and even regional economic independence. A nation determined 
        to defend itself and its freedoms should be prepared, and always preparing, 
        to live from its own resources and from the work and the skills of its 
        own people. But that is not what we are doing in the United States today. 
        What we are doing is squandering in the most prodigal manner the natural 
        and human resources of the nation.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At present, 
        in the face of declining finite sources of fossil fuel energies, we have 
        virtually no energy policy, either for conservation or for the development 
        of safe and clean alternative sources. At present, our energy policy simply 
        is to use all that we have. Moreover, in the face of a growing population 
        needing to be fed, we have virtually no policy for land conservation and 
        no policy of just compensation to the primary producers of food. Our agricultural 
        policy is to use up everything that we have, while depending increasingly 
        on imported food, energy, technology, and labor.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those 
        are just two examples of our general indifference to our own needs. We 
        thus are elaborating a surely dangerous contradiction between our militant 
        nationalism and our espousal of the international &#147;free market&#148; 
        ideology. How do we escape from this absurdity?</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I don&#146;t 
        think there is an easy answer. Obviously, we would be less absurd if we 
        took better care of things. We would be less absurd if we founded our 
        public policies upon an honest description of our needs and our predicament, 
        rather than upon fantastical descriptions of our wishes. We would be less 
        absurd if our leaders would consider in good faith the proven alternatives 
        to violence.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such 
        things are easy to say, but we are disposed, somewhat by culture and somewhat 
        by nature, to solve our problems by violence, and even to enjoy doing 
        so. And yet by now all of us must at least have suspected that our right 
        to live, to be free, and to be at peace is not guaranteed by any act of 
        violence. It can be guaranteed only by our willingness that all other 
        persons should live, be free, and be at peace&#151;and by our willingness 
        to use or give our own lives to make that possible. To be incapable of 
        such willingness is merely to resign ourselves to the absurdity we are 
        in; and yet, if you are like me, you are unsure to what extent you are 
        capable of it.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here 
        is the other question that I have been leading toward, one that the predicament 
        of modern warfare forces upon us: How many deaths of other people&#146;s 
        children by bombing or starvation are we willing to accept in order that 
        we may be free, affluent, and (supposedly) at peace? To that question 
        I answer: None. Please, no 
        children. Don&#146;t kill any children for my benefit.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If that 
        is your answer too, then you must know that we have not come to rest, 
        far from it. For surely we must feel ourselves swarmed about with more 
        questions that are urgent, personal, and intimidating. But perhaps also 
        we feel ourselves beginning to be free, facing at last in our own selves 
        the greatest challenge ever laid before us, the most comprehensive vision 
        of human progress, the best advice, and the least obeyed:<br>
        <i>&#147;Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that 
        hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you; 
        That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he 
        maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the 
        just and on the unjust.&#148;</i></font></P>
