Gushy reviews began as soon as George W. Bush stepped away from 
the podium in the House chamber. On NBC, Tim Russert explained that the 
performance was especially impressive due to the new president's personal 
history of being podium-adverse: "I was amazed at how conversational he was 
tonight, and confident and comfortable." An analyst for ABC News marveled 
that Bush had established a "commanding presence."

         <p>By the next day, the media verdict was in: The nation's leader is 
learning to make effective use of a TelePrompTer!

         <p>Stage presence, cadence, rhythm, choreography -- they can really 
add up in the professional calculations by journalists. And Bush, known to 
have a remarkably short attention span, seems to be well-suited to a medium 
that greatly values style over substance. Like a negative in a developing 
pan, the current president's TV profile is taking shape. Some political 
reporters scoff in private, no doubt, but their on-the-job respect is thick 
as dense smoke.

         <p>Journalists who specialize in critiquing televised images are 
watching closely. The Washington Post's Tom Shales greeted the big speech 
with notable satisfaction at signs of progress: "George W.'s television 
persona is definitely improving. He was relaxed and confident and thereby 
reassuring." Evidently, we're supposed to feel reassured that the president 
is competent, wise and kind -- rather than bumbling, vacuous and greedy -- 
if he exudes relaxation and confidence on TV screens.

         <p>Shales is the most influential critic of television to be read at 
Washington's breakfast tables, and perhaps that stature has inflated his 
sense of omniscience. During the speech, he wrote, Bush "proceeded to make 
himself welcome in the American home." But if such a singular entity as 
"the American home" ever existed, it long ago went the way of Ozzie, 
Harriet and the Beav.

         <p>Plunging ahead to his climax, Shales went on: "Chances are, most 
of those who saw the speech feel much better about Bush this morning than 
they did one second before he began it." Shales concluded: "Bush took the 
oath of office on Jan. 20, but he really became president last night."

         <p>It's one thing to predict, monitor or analyze the public's 
gullibility, and quite another to worsen it by proclaiming your own. The 
words from Shales were delightful for the White House spinners who have 
worked hard to orchestrate the opening performances of the George W. Bush 
presidency.

         <p>And Bush media strategists must be pleased that countless 
journalists -- egged on by network anchors -- have launched a new round of 
exclamations about Bush's ability to confound adversaries who underestimate 
him.

         <p>"This is not an original thought -- he constantly surprises people 
by exceeding expectations," Dan Rather said on CBS after Bush's address to 
Congress. Meanwhile, on ABC, Peter Jennings made the same observation. 
Neither one paused to wonder aloud about whether they weren't simply 
playing their part in a ritual of a president's high jumps over low media 
standards.

         <p>Tom Brokaw made note of cordial relations between President Bush 
and Democratic congressional leaders, then wrapped up NBC's coverage for 
the night by observing: "The times they are a'changin' here in Washington 
in the 21st century." Roll over, Bob Dylan.

         <p>Perhaps there are some constants in American political life. As 
potential counterweights to dubious presidents, the lawmakers at the other 
end of Pennsylvania Avenue have a history of being rather lightweight. "Who 
are they, as bats and night-bogs, askant in the Capitol?" wrote Walt 
Whitman. "Are those really Congressmen?"

         <p>Whitman's haiku-like couplet has stood the test of time. Giving 
undue deference even to a president who lost the national popular vote by 
more than half a million ballots, the present-day loyal opposition provides 
much more loyalty than opposition.

         <p>What's wrong with most media coverage of two-party conflicts and 
accommodations is akin to what's wrong with those two parties themselves: 
The narrowness of outlooks and paucity of wide-ranging debate is 
self-reinforcing. And when the vast majority of media coverage is scarcely 
wider than the range of the Republican and Democratic party establishments, 
the closed loop of public discourse is in mortal danger of choking on its 
own toxic effluents.

         <p>In defense of the media status quo, high-profile journalists are 
apt to insist that they're simply doing their jobs by reporting "the news" 
-- and naturally the most powerful elected officials and their appointees 
make the most newsworthy pronouncements. But that kind of logic makes sense 
for democracy only if we forget that they're all functioning inside 
concentric circles that revolve around big money.

         <p>In the corporate-funded vessels that carry presidents and 
congressional leaders -- as well as network anchors and their colleagues -- 
on mainstream journeys, the process of going along to get along with 
corporate power is routine for getting and keeping their jobs. You won't 
find vehement boat-rockers among them.
