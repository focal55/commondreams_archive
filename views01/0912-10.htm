America is living through a tragedy of unprecedented depth. Our military 
and economic might has been targeted, and our vulnerability exposed. We are 
shocked, outraged, determined to respond. Yet we awake to a new day 
sickened by the cruelty and insanity of this political violence--and many of us are uncertain if we too want blood on our hands. Will vengeance, even when 
guided by the best of America's surgical strike technology, ease this 
tragedy and end the cycle of terror? We know better.

<p>The crime was horrific. Never have so many Americans died from violence on 
a single day. It felt and looked like war. Our national security came under 
direct attack, and the resulting carnage was comparable to the worst of 
war--Pearl Harbor, firebombing of Dresden, Cambodia, and Normandy. However, 
having four commercial airliners commandeered by political fanatics is not 
war, but international terrorism. No nation or peoples have declared war on 
the United States. In terms of intent and character, the political violence 
yesterday in Washington and New York bears more similarity to the terrorist 
bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City than to Pearl Harbor. Yes, 
yesterday was a day of infamy, but it was not "an act of war," as president 
Bush suggests, and should not be the beginning of war. It was, as president 
Bush also described it, a "cowardly act" of terrorism.

<p>America and all nations concerned about peace, justice, and dignity will 
need to respond. But the response should be deliberate, just, and humane. 
In the past, the U.S. has responded to terrorist attacks with military 
strikes that were misdirected, mistakenly targeted, and counterproductive. 
The 1986 bombing raids on two Libyan cities, the bombing of a Baghdad 
neighborhood in 1993 in response to rumors of a planned assassination 
attempt on former President Bush, and most recently the air strike on a 
Sudanese pharmaceutical plant mistakenly believed to be chemical weapons 
factory associated with Osama bin Laden are three cases that should remind 
us of the folly--and terrorism--of revengeful retaliatory strikes.

<p>Talk by our leaders of war and retribution, while possibly boosting our 
patriotic spirit, is dangerous and irresponsible. The politics of vengeance 
will do little to protect us, and will only fuel more terrorism. But 
neither can we accept our helplessness and vulnerability. We need to mourn, 
bury our dead, and move on, but not to business and foreign policy as 
usual. What's needed now is a new U.S. resolve to address--and not simply 
react to--the causes of political violence in the post-cold war world. Our 
president's father promised at the onset of the Persian Gulf War to 
establish a "new world order," but it's a promise that has gone 
unfulfilled. Instead, over the past decade we have seen rising global 
disorder and conflict.

<p>The attack on America's centers of power was an extremist reaction to what 
is perceived as a new world order where only the U.S. calls the shots. But 
it was also a crime against humanity. If there is to be justice in this 
incident and if there is to be the rule of law in international affairs, 
the U.S. should seek the solace and support of the international community. 
Despite differences with U.S. foreign policy, especially in the conflicted 
Middle East, nations around the world have been quick to express their own 
outrage and willingness to join with America to fight and reduce the causes 
of international terrorism.

<p>In recent years, we have made encouraging process of establishing and 
enforcing international norms for human rights and crimes against humanity. 
This is an opportunity to forge a broader international coalition, bringing 
disparate nations together in a common determination to fight against such 
crimes against humanity. A first principle, then, must be that we treat 
this as international crime not an act of war, and that the rules of law 
should guide international response.

<p>A second principle that should guide U.S. policy is that our investigation, 
pursuit, and prosecution should as much as possible count on the 
consultation and cooperation of the world community of nations. Any 
government suspected of harboring or otherwise aiding these international 
terrorists should answer to concerted international pressure, not just 
American outrage. If indeed, military action is deemed necessary, it should 
carry the approval of the UN Security Council; otherwise the U.S. too will 
be violating the basic principles of international law.

<p>While charting the appropriate response, the U.S. government must also 
begin the long-overdue task of formulating a security policy that truly 
protects Americans from new global threats. As critics have insisted, the 
Bush administration's promise of a national missile defense system looks 
increasingly hollow. If terrorists want to attack us, they can do so from 
our own soil and with our own aircraft. Our politicians would dishonor the 
dead, however, if they focused the new security debate solely on issues of 
intelligence reform and increased defense spending. More fundamentally, the 
U.S. needs to take a hard look at the policies and political structures 
that fan the flames of terrorism to understand why such anger in the Middle 
East and elsewhere is directed at America.

<p>Terrorism is mainly the weapon of the politically weak, frustrated 
ideologues, and religious fanatics. The U.S. should not retaliate in kind. 
The task of forging a security policy not just on our response capability 
but also on addressing the new causal factors for war and terrorism is 
surely America's greatest challenge--and our success will be the true 
measure of our character.
