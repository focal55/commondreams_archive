Quebec City  &#151;  Down on the flats last night, underneath the overpass with its spray-painted murals and graffiti, a bank of speakers thumped out a techno beat. In masks and painted faces, bathed in the orange light of street lamps, the ragged people danced and drank beer and chewed over the day's extraordinary events.
<P> Up on the hill stood a line of masked riot cops, backlit by a fluorescent fog of tear gas, guarding the now-famous security fence and the posh hotels and chasing demonstrators down along a set of wooden stairs. </P>
<P> It was one eerie sight, I tell you, a midnight post-apocalypse vision of faceless androids arrayed against the young and disenfranchised. Images from Latin America's most frightful times, superimposed on one of Canada's great historical jewels. One hopes this was not what Prime Minister Jean Chrétien had in mind when he decided Canada's future lay in a closer relationship with the Americas.</P>
<P> Five years ago, the third Summit of the Americas looked like a plan. Snag a major international meeting as the showpiece of Mr. Chrétien's third mandate. Hold it in Quebec City; assert the federal presence in Quebec once again. Give Quebeckers a chance to play to a Latin audience. Make the point that they don't need an independent country to establish a presence on the global stage. Spread a little more money around the place. Hope the Latins are captivated by its Old World patina — maybe even enough to work out a deal or two.</P>
<P> One by one, things went wrong. The Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting in Vancouver dissolved into an ugly nightmare of protest and pepper spray. The 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle established the possibility of violent protest as a risk to be factored into every major global gathering. Financial crises plunged parts of the developing world into recession, deepening the suspicions of millions about globalization and open markets.</P>
<P> On the home front, Lucien Bouchard decided to resign as premier of Québec. Hardliner Bernard Landry took over, and the temperature began to rise. Quebec City complained about being shut out of preparations. The sense grew that Quebeckers resented being treated like visitors in their own home. The summit's location was supposed to be a showcase of history; it became a reminder that in Canada, hostility is part of the national reality. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, the rhetoric surrounding the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas became increasingly cranky. Brazil served notice on the United States that market access must be a two-way street. Tiny island nations in the Caribbean warned that free trade could easily bankrupt them. Nasty trade spats broke out among major players — including Canada and the United States.</P>
<P> Somehow, all this background noise jelled into the suspicion that maybe those seemingly incoherent, seemingly marginal "globophobes" had a serious point to make. It dovetailed, in Canada, with a sense of political impotence, a feeling that governments can't make a difference any more. In that context, it became more difficult to defend the idea of 33 men and one woman getting together in secret and cooking up a new economic strategy for two of the world's continents. Add to that the horrors of Colombia, and widespread suspicion over the motives behind the United States' billion-dollar anti-narcotics plan there. Even the mildest skeptic had more than enough reason to demand, at the very least, that the summit process be opened up.</P>
<P> The resulting gestures — the promise to release the draft FTAA negotiating documents and televise part of the summit — were too little and too late to head off protest. One would hardly expect Mr. Chrétien to move the summit elsewhere. But as things stand today, these images of inchoate frustration and visceral repression are the legacy of Quebec City. </P>
<P> The police had their orders last night. The strategy was clearly to bathe this fine old city in tear gas — dispersing civilians efficiently, making physical restraint unnecessary, and avoiding inconvenient television footage of clubs and bloody faces. </P>
<P> But there is tragedy here, in the wasted energy of confrontation, in the Prime Minister's glib and patronizing dismissiveness, in the whole sorry saga of hubris, poor judgment and bad luck. On the plus side, it appears the pressure for results has strengthened the summit's final declaration and action plan. That offers the hope of locking in some of the progress toward freer societies that has been made in the Americas over the past two decades.</P>
<P> Canadians should celebrate that "democracy clause." You never know when it might come in handy.</P>
