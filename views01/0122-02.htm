WASHINGTON-At Dupont Circle, Ilva Wilson stood in the drizzling rain holding an
umbrella.
<P>
    Across town, George W. Bush, surrounded by his family and a coterie of
well-wishers, was about to be sworn in as president. But people like Wilson had
come to this park to proclaim that Bush wasn't their president.
<P>
    Their signs said it all: "Not My President," "Hail to the Thief," and "Send
in the Clowns."
    The crowd was mostly white and young-with college boys in cheap top hats,
girls in rain slickers and at least one girl with green hair. Few young people
bother to vote these days, but this gathering brought out quite a few who said
they were upset over the way this last election went down.
<P>
    "I just felt like I had to get my voice heard," Wilson, a student at MIT,
said. "This is about the fact that every vote should count, and I don't think
it did in this election."
    There were harsh words for the U.S. Supreme Court and charges that Bush
stole the election. And protesters had come from all over the country to say
so. At 10 a.m., there were about 100. By 11, hundreds more were streaming up
the steps of the Metro station and flowing out into the park.
<P>
    "Did George Bush win this election?" a man called from the stage.
<P>
    "No!" the crowd shouted back.
<P>
    "Did the people elect George W. Bush?"
    "No!"
    Despite their enthusiasm, I felt it was too late for the protest. George W.
<P>
Bush is president, and nobody now in power in Washington seems to care that
some feel robbed. The previous night, one sensed that Washington is a city
where an occupying army has packed up and left only to be replaced by another.
<P>
Men in tuxedos and women in fur coats hurried out of hotels and through the
streets on their way to inaugural parties. A Texas contingent threw a
boots-and-black-tie ball at the Marriott. Great-four years of cowboy hats, big
hair and people getting dressed for dinner.
<P>
    It's as if Washington has gone back in time.
<P>
    It was thought that George W. Bush's inauguration would bring out the
biggest group of protesters since at least 60,000 Vietnam War protesters
besmirched Richard Nixon's swearing-in ceremony in 1973. On Saturday, they
didn't get close to that but there were at least 10 separate protest rallies
and marches. Their causes ranged from upgrading the machinery of voting to
outlawing the death penalty to saving Roe v. Wade to "freeing Mumia."
    At Stanton Park near Capitol Hill, several hundred protesters, most of them
black, stood in the rain to speak out against the disenfranchisement of black
voters in Florida.
<P>
    "We come today to underscore that today in this capitol city they are
perpetuating one of the greatest untruths in American history," the Rev. Al
Sharpton told the fired-up crowd. "A man who lost the election is being sworn
in as president of the United States!"
    Referring to the blacks and whites who fought and died so that blacks could
have the right to vote, Sharpton said the protesters were there "to let the
world know we are not going to give that right back."
    But not long before Sharpton rose to speak, Chief Justice William Rehnquist
swore George W. Bush in as president. In Bush's brief and generic speech, which
he might have given at any Republican fund-raiser or Rotary Club meeting, he
repeated his stock promises to cut taxes, reclaim schools, reform Social
Security and Medicare and build a national missile defense system.
<P>
    If one was looking for clues as to how Bush will reach out to the half of
the country that didn't vote for him, not a word was uttered. Bush didn't seem
to hear or care about what the people at Dupont Circle and Stanton Park were
saying.
<P>
    As the protesters started off on a march to the Supreme Court, it was clear
that they've got a long four years ahead. So why not march and shout and
protest?
