On the magazine cover, the big headline next to Oprah's shoulder 
is as warm and cuddly as the pair of cocker spaniels in her lap. "WE ARE 
FAMILY," it says. "Now more than ever: the power and pleasure of feeling 
connected."

         <p>Inside this new issue of O -- "The Oprah Magazine" -- the 
editorial director's lead-off article offers a profound explanation. "Our 
vision of family has been expanded," writes Oprah Winfrey. "From the ashes 
of the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and that field in Pennsylvania 
arose a new spirit of unity. We realize that we are all part of the family 
of America."

         <p>It's an appealing concept, especially during these uncertain 
times. Ever since Sept. 11, countless media outlets have provided similar 
themes. The December issue of O deftly hits the now-familiar high notes. 
Three-quarters of the way through the thick, glossy, ad-filled magazine, 
"We Are Family" reappears in large type, under an American flag and over 
another message from Oprah. "America is a vast and complicated family," she 
declares, "but -- as the smoke clears and the dust settles -- a family 
nonetheless."

         <p>Such sentiments are lovely. But what do they really mean? They're 
certainly not meant to be taken literally. Oprah isn't inviting you or me 
over to her place for the holidays, and we wouldn't even think of asking 
her to add us to her family's topnotch medical coverage.

         <p>Likewise, no amount of uplifting rhetoric about the national 
family can cut much ice when it comes to the cold hard realities of 
dividing up the national pie. Within a family, it would be unusual for some 
at the dining room table to feast on one sumptuous meal after another while 
others can't put enough food on a plate to meet their minimal caloric 
needs. It would be odd if some family members got top-of-the-line health 
care while others got none.

         <p>If the United States is one big family, then it's a remarkably 
cruel one, with extremes of privilege and deprivation. The recent book 
"Economic Apartheid in America," by Chuck Collins and Felice Yeskel, 
presents sobering statistics. For instance: "In the last 20 years, the 
overall wealth pie has grown, but virtually all the new growth in wealth 
has gone to the richest 1 percent of the population." In the United States, 
"the top 1 percent of households now has more wealth than the entire bottom 
95 percent."

        <p> "We are family"?

         <p>Like other magazines owned by corporate giants, O devotes most of 
its pages to casting a consumer spell. O is a successful Hearst property, 
stuffed with voluptuous ads for high-priced makeup, clothes, perfumes, 
cars, alcohol and the like. With a paid circulation of nearly 2.4 million 
copies, it's in the business of "selling" its readers to advertisers.

         <p>The latest O has some macabre twists. Turn the page after reading 
Oprah's little "We Are Family" essay, and a headline appears above a large 
photo of the first female secretary of state: "Making Sense of the 
Unimaginable. Oprah talks to Madeleine Albright."

         <p>When Albright was running the State Department, she worked avidly 
in support of numerous regimes -- such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, 
Turkey and Indonesia -- routinely guilty of horrendous human rights abuses. 
But in the current edition of O, when she discusses Sept. 11, Albright 
depicts the U.S. government as a heroic defender of decency.

         <p>Winfrey: "Is there any way to make sense of this calamity?"

         <p>Albright: "The only way to make sense of why this happened is that 
we are a country that stands up for freedom, democracy and human rights."

         <p>But the magazine's next spread includes a few paragraphs from 
novelist Isabel Allende, who recalls the calamity that befell her native 
land: "I lived in Chile, a country that had one of the oldest democracies 
in Latin America. We never thought that anything like a military coup could 
happen to us -- those only happened in banana republics! Until one day it 
did happen -- and the brutality lasted for 17 years. The eerie coincidence 
is that it happened on Tuesday, Sept. 11, 1973. This was a military coup 
orchestrated by the CIA -- a terrorist attack against democracy."

         <p>Speaking as someone who has made her home in the United States for 
the last 14 years, Allende adds: "We are a society that expects to be happy 
and entertained all the time. We are also a spoiled society that hasn't had 
war in its territory in more than a century. But we contribute to war in 
other countries all the time. We invaded Grenada and support the worst 
dictatorships all over the world. And it is we who helped create the Taliban."

 <p>Spinning the USA as a big family is not only deceptive. It also 
reinforces the notion that Americans are in a superlative class by 
themselves, distinct from the rest of humanity. In contrast, Allende evokes 
a global vision: "More than 800 million people in the world are hungry. The 
distribution of wealth is completely unfair and helps to create conditions 
for hatred and violence. This can't continue forever without paying the 
consequences."

<p>Touting our country as a family can produce fog that obscures 
actual national priorities and vast economic inequities. To float off on a 
comforting media cloud, all we need to do is ignore the real world.

syndicated column focuses on media and politics.</i>
