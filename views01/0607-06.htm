"Vote early and vote often" is the old Irish revolutionary command that I have always sought to obey. I have voted in parliamentary elections, in municipal elections, in European elections and in union elections. I have even put myself forward as a parliamentary candidate so that others could vote for me. (The voters of North Hull were bribed not to vote for my campaign against the Vietnam war in 1966 with a Labour promise to build a bridge over the River Humber - a preposterous white elephant unequalled until the construction of the dome.) I have been a model citizen, voting over the years for candidates of almost every stripe and colour - except blue. (Since I blame the appeasement Tories for the outbreak of the second world war, I cannot ever see myself voting for them.) 
<P>Yet at this election, for the first time in my life, I am go ing to stay at home. Like millions of others, I am planning to put my weight behind what I hope will prove to be the single largest political block in the country: the abstainers. Often dismissed by the media for being "apathetic", this is a group that does not share in the drama of Westminster and Whitehall that so excites the journalistic class. Maybe some of the two or three million abstainers are indeed apathetic, but in my experience the larger number are wholly antipathetic to what has been going on. Many of them are angry, disgruntled and disillusioned. Outside the ivory tower of the media, caught up in its bubble of "democracy" and "press freedom", a tidal wave of frustrated rage is preparing to break at any moment, just like the image on the Hokusai print.  
<P>For 40 years I have belonged to that grouping of the left that regularly resigns from the Labour party over the issue of foreign wars or nuclear weapons, and then is sheepishly corralled back into the fold at election time when faced with the awesome reality of a Tory government. Not any more. Four years of New Labour have devalued politics in this country to such an extent that the political system itself is teetering on the verge of illegitimacy. How can it be right to support a system where two ideologically bankrupt parties hold an absolute monopoly of political power?  
<P>During the past half century, Labour and Conservative have stood for genuinely different traditions, with markedly different programmes. Yet today, as they steal each other's clothes, the two-party system looks more and more like a one-party state. On all important subjects - including the irresistible drift towards globalisation, the war against Iraq and in the Balkans, support for the American alliance and the Americanisa tion of outer space, the recolonisation of Africa - Blair and Hague chime as one. Their political world has not been able to remain apart from the growing Americanisation that affects every other aspect of our culture, so perhaps it should not be surprising that their parties come to ape the artificial divisions of a society where Avis competes with Hertz, Pepsi with Coca-Cola, and Democrats with Republicans. During an election campaign, of course, the politicians and the media will seek to highlight the tiny areas of disagreement between the parties, but most people already recognise that Blair's new-found radicalism is merely a promise to restore Thatcherism with a New Labour label.  
<P>Not to vote, for anyone on the left, seems like a terrible treason against everything that has gone on before. Has not the right to vote been one of the great progressive slo gans of recent centuries, a vote for the emancipation of the working class, a vote for the rights of women? In parts of the world, the right to political participation, the right to freedom of assembly, is still contested and has to be fought for. So how come that in Britain in the year 2001 it seems right and proper, necessary even, not to vote at all?  
<P>Wandering down memory lane, I find that there have been occasions when I have campaigned for abstention. At a byelection in South-West Norfolk early in 1959, a small group of anti-nuclear protesters, objecting to the siting of the ill-fated Thor missiles at two bases in the constituency (the last figleaf of Britain's independent nuclear deterrent), campaigned for a "voters' veto", on the grounds that all the candidates supported the missiles. On a later occasion, in 1961,    when Harold Macmillan was about to be elected as chancellor of the university of Oxford, I was among a tiny gathering of students who stood outside the Sheldonian as the MAs queued up to vote. We carried banners with the euphonious message: "Don't vote for the man who votes for the Bomb". Harmless enough, you might think, but we were hauled before the university police,   and told that any repeat of the incident would mean the end of our university careers. That year the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the United Nations Association were the two largest political clubs in the university, and the authorities had become deeply troubled by the political disaffection of the young. Today that youthful disaffection takes a different form - a rejection of politics altogether.  
<P>On previous occasions, I have willingly given a protest vote to the Liberals, to the Greens, or to the fleetingly phantom presence of "the left", represented this year by the Socialist Alliance. Yet this time the protest vote has lost its appeal. The Liberals, ever since they allied themselves with the Social Democrats, have embodied the liberal imperialist strand in their history, rather than the non- interventionist, Little England, tradition of Richard Cobden and John Morley. To day's Lib Dems are too keen on foreign wars and the American alliance to get my vote. The Greens are an attractive option at first sight, but their appeal is now limited by the appalling record in government of the German Greens, who also love the American alliance and wars of intervention. Many of my friends will vote for the Socialist Alliance, but this construct is too artificial to have much appeal. It seeks to unite disparate groups with no common programme that would survive beyond the election campaign, and it places too much hopeful reliance on the recent relative success of leftist parties in the rather different circumstances of continental Europe.  
<P>For much of my life I have supported lost causes and tiny groupuscules; in this campaign, by staying at home, I shall at last be marching with the big battalions.
