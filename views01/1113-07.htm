As fighters from the Northern Alliance dare further into northern 
Afghanistan, the Bush administration is struggling to answer the tricky question of who would govern Kabul if the Taliban abandon the capital. 
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is going to take up the issue today in New 
York, when he meets with his Russian counterpart, representatives of 
Afghanistan's six neighbors, and United Nations officials. 
<p>

There's been much talk about how to establish a broad-based post-Taliban 
government that would guarantee the rights of women and ethnic minorities. 
Powell has been particularly clear that he doesn't 
want to see a repeat of what happened last time the elements that now 
comprise the Northern Alliance entered Kabul in the 1990s. What followed then 
was a brutal internecine civil war that left that city and most of  the 
country in ruins. Washington didn't use the words then, but each group did 
its best to "ethnically cleanse" their region. <A HREF="http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?itemid=12070" target="_new">Afghan women call it the "dark 
times"</A> of abduction, forced "marriage" and rape.
<p>

"We have seen what has happened previously when you had an uncontrolled 
situation and two forces arriving in Kabul at the same time not meaning each 
well," Powell told NBC this weekend. <p>

Meanwhile, Donald Rumsfeld has his eyes on the delicate world of global 
diplomacy.  As most folks have probably figured out by now, every player in 
the U.S.-led war against the Taliban has a self-interest that conflicts with 
just about every other player. Russia has backed the Northern Alliance for 
years, along with India. They want their closest proxies to be in charge in 
Kabul. Pakistan helped to create the Taliban. They don't want to lose their 
investment when it comes to a new government in their neighbor, Afghanistan. 
President Musharraf has suggested that Taliban "moderates" (whatever that 
might mean) deserve a place in a new regime. <p>

"On the one hand, you've got Taliban and Al Qaeda in Kabul, and anyone would 
want them out," he said on CBS on Sunday. "You would want to free the Afghan 
people from the oppressive regime of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in that city. 
You certainly would want to try to do it in a time, in a way that it was 
clear to the world, to the Afghan people, to the neighboring countries, that 
everyone understood that the new post-Taliban leadership in that country 
would be broadly based." <p>

Consistently left out of this so-called "broad government" are the broads, to put it crudely. For all its talk, no one in this picture has seriously begun to address the 
role of women in any future form of government in Afghanistan. And although 
several organization including Amnesty International, the Feminist Majority, 
RAWA, Equality Now!, The Global Center for Women's Leadership and  the 
Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan, are actively 
campaigning for women to be involved and some have met with the Bush 
Administration and with the UN Secretary General privately, when it comes to 
formal planning meetings, Afghan women's groups seem so far to have been shut 
out. <p>

Last month when anti-Taliban Northern Alliance leaders met in Peshawar, 
women's rights weren't on the agenda. Now world leaders are meeting at the UN 
and they too, have apparently agreed that it is too complicated, too 
difficult, and generally not necessary to include women's organizations in 
their talks.  If history is any guide, Northern Alliance claims of victory 
are likely to be heavily inflated. Any new government in Kabul could still be 
years away, but it is telling that at this moment, not one of the many 
organizations representing Afghan women or more generally women's human 
rights have been invited to the table. 
<p>

"Countless women have been working on issues of peace and security for 
decades and have expertise and insights into terrorist violence and 
methodology," says a statement from the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice at 
the United Nations.  The Caucus has drawn up a <A HREF="http://www.whrnet.org/12points.html" target="_new">12-point plan for 
stopping the war and rebuilding a just society in Afghanistan</A>. Now signed by over 1,000 
individuals and groups from around the world, the petition was personally 
presented to each member of the UN Security Council last month.

<p>

United Nations Security Council resolution 1325 specifically mandated that 
women should be given increased decision-making power with regard to conflict 
prevention and resolution. That resolution, passed last year, requires  the 
UN to "ensure the equal participation and full involvement" of women "in all 
efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security." <p>

There's no disputing that women have been singled out for discrimination and 
abuse for years inside Afghanistan, most dramatically, if not exclusively, by 
the Taliban. In a war situation, women always play a disproportionate role in 
the care of the hungry and the injured and bear the greatest burden of 
poverty and destitution. <p>

The Northern Alliance can't get anywhere near Kabul without U.S. military and 
diplomatic support and at least at home, the U.S. claims that at least that part of 
this fight, as Bush put it last week -- is to topple a regime "under which 
women are imprisoned in their homes." While world leaders are talking about 
"broad fronts" and not alienating rival forces, they must not be allowed to 
abandon the women of Afghanistan and the region.  Women can't be put on the backburner again. They've been burning for too long. <p>
