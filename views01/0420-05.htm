When the New York Times finally printed the name of a 12-year-old 
organization called Rabbis for Human Rights, the mention had to be bought 
-- in a full-page ad expressing support for actions by the group, which is 
"the only Israeli rabbinic association that includes Orthodox, Reform, 
Reconstructionist and Conservative rabbis."

<p>Days before the advertisement appeared on April 8, the executive 
director of Rabbis for Human Rights had been arrested while participating 
in nonviolent civil disobedience against Israeli demolition of houses. 
"Palestinian homes are being systematically bulldozed all over the West 
Bank," said a bulletin from Rabbi Arthur Waskow, director of the Shalom 
Center in Philadelphia. "In this case, there isn't any pretense of 
'security interests' or 'military targets.' The houses destroyed yesterday 
and today belong to ordinary Palestinian citizens whose only crime is the 
wish to have a roof over their heads."

<p>Groups like Rabbis for Human Rights, and Jewish American activists 
like Rabbi Waskow who vocally oppose Israeli policies, get short shrift in 
U.S. news outlets. Meanwhile, the reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian 
cycle of violence is badly skewed by an endless cycle of media bias.

<p>Searching the Nexis database of U.S. media coverage during the 
first 100 days of this year, I found several dozen stories using the 
phrases "Israeli retaliation" or "Israel retaliated." During the same 
period, how many stories used the phrases "Palestinian retaliation" or 
"Palestinians retaliated"? One.

<p>Both sides of the conflict, of course, describe their violence as 
retaliatory. But only one side routinely benefits from having its violent 
moves depicted that way by major American media. The huge disparity in the 
media frame is a measure of the overall slant of news coverage.

<p>To help maintain pressure for a favorable media tilt, supporters 
of Israel have a not-so-secret weapon, brandished most effectively as a 
preemptive threat -- the charge of anti-Semitism. Any Americans who speak 
out against Israel's extreme disregard for human rights are liable to be in 
the line of fire.

<p>Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner, is a 
reminder that victims of tyranny are capable of later aligning themselves 
with perpetrators of enormous cruelty. In March, he delivered a speech to a 
national conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one of 
Washington's most powerful lobbying groups. Wiesel declared that anyone 
"who uses their Jewishness as a context to attack or condemn Israel -- 
that's something I'm against." And he denounced criticisms of Israel as 
"anti-Semitism in Jewish leftist circles."

<p>Such salvos are warning shots that Joseph McCarthy would have 
understood. To quash debate, just smear, smear, smear.

<p>Instead of trying to refute critiques of Israeli policies, it's 
much easier to equate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism -- a timeworn 
way of preventing or short-circuiting real debate on the merits of the 
issues. It is absurd and dangerous to claim that bigotry is at the root of 
calls for adherence to basic standards of human rights. But the ongoing 
threat of the "anti-Semitic" label helps to prevent U.S. media coverage 
from getting out of hand.

<p>Last year, I had an interesting experience with one of Florida's 
daily papers, the Palm Beach Post. A reader's letter, published in early 
June, charged that a column I'd written "had an anti-Semitic undertone" 
because it criticized media spin for Israel. Eleven weeks later, on Aug. 
25, the newspaper printed a second letter from the same reader, objecting 
to a column I wrote about Sen. Joseph Lieberman. This time the letter was 
more emphatic and sweeping, though less specific: "I have noticed in some 
of his previous columns, he is apt to express anti-Semitic views."

<p>The Palm Beach Post printed my weekly syndicated column 30 times 
during 2000 -- for the last time on Aug. 19, six days before publication of 
the second letter accusing me of being "anti-Semitic." After that letter 
came off the press, my column never again appeared in the Palm Beach Post. 
When I inquired, the newspaper's opinion-page editor told me: "There was no 
connection."

<p>Whatever the case may be, there's no doubt that journalists 
generally understand critical words about Israel to be hazardous to 
careers. "Rarely since the Second World War has a people been so vilified 
as the Palestinians," comments Robert Fisk, a longtime foreign 
correspondent for the London-based daily Independent. "And rarely has a 
people been so frequently excused and placated as the Israelis."

<p>Fisk is asking his colleagues to search their consciences: "Our 
gutlessness, our refusal to tell the truth, our fear of being slandered as 
'anti-Semites' -- the most loathsome of libels against any journalist -- 
means that we are aiding and abetting terrible deeds in the Middle East."

<p>Anti-Semitism is a reality in the world. Like all forms of 
religious and racial bigotry, it should be unequivocally opposed. The 
effectiveness of such opposition is undermined by those who cry wolf, using 
charges of anti-Semitism as a weapon in a propaganda arsenal to defend 
Israel's indefensible crimes against Palestinian people.

syndicated column focuses on media and politics.</i>
