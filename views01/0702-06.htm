Jacqueline Jackson returned to Chicago with a new public profile and many
new friends after spending 10 days in a Puerto Rican jail for protesting the
Navy bombing of the island of Vieques. The 57-year-old wife of the Rev. Jesse
L. Jackson stepped out of her husband's shadow and enlisted in a growing
effort by prominent black Americans to find common cause with the nation's
burgeoning Hispanic population.<P>
   Jackson joins the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been in jail since his May 29
protest of the Vieques bombing, in a gesture of solidarity with Puerto Rican
opponents of the U.S. military exercise on the tiny island. Cynics will insist
that Sharpton and Jackson used Vieques as a platform for their personal
agendas: Sharpton, to garner Hispanic support for his future political
escapades, and Jackson to help her escape the limbo of public humiliation
imposed by her husband's extramarital fling.
<P>

But aside from those cynical assessments of their motives, the two are on
the leading edge of a new approach to issues of racial disadvantage. The 2000
census revealed that Hispanics soon would surpass African-Americans as the
nation's largest "minority" group. This historic change will alter the
black-white dichotomy that has defined race relations since the nation's
beginnings. Some analysts fear the role reversal could provoke increasing
tensions between African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.
<P>
   There already are troubling signs of those tensions.<P>
   In Georgia, for example, some African-American legislators last March tried
to kill an effort to alter the state's definition of "minority" to include
Hispanics. The Hispanic population has increased by at least 120 percent in
Georgia during the last decade and the change would have included them in a
law designed to give tax breaks to companies that hire minority
subcontractors.<P>
   But the law allowing tax breaks was intended to help compensate Georgia's
black community for a history of racist exclusion from state jobs. Expanding
eligibility to Hispanics might "dilute the original intent of such programs,"
said Rep. Bob Holms (D-Fulton), a member of the state's Legislative Black
Caucus.<P>
   The situation is similar throughout the Southeast, where Hispanic
populations have skyrocketed. "All over the Southeast, the blacks and
Hispanics are competing for low-wage jobs," said Walter Farrell Jr., a
professor of social work and public policy at the University of North
Carolina, in an Atlanta Constitution article on the growing tensions. "That's
causing friction."<P>
   There are continuing battles in Dallas over control of the school board and
programs it funds and the major antagonists are black and Hispanic. James
Hahn, the mayor-elect of Los Angeles, defeated Hispanic candidate Antonio
Villaraigosa with 80 percent of the black vote. Although Hahn was a popular
candidate with the black electorate, poll data revealed that some blacks voted
for Hahn because of anxiety over Hispanic gains.<P>
   Examples abound and the tensions are found wherever there are significant
populations of both groups. Hispanics are becoming more insistent in their
demand for larger, more proportionate slices of the economic and political
pie. African-Americans fear that Hispanic gains will come at their expense and
curtail hard-fought attempts to rectify the effects of past discrimination.
The media reinforce this zero-sum perspective with hysterical reports on the
looming Hispanic takeover of the status of "largest minority."<P>
   But there also is the potential of a powerful coalition that together now
constitutes more than one-quarter of the U.S. population. Many
African-American activists understand this awesome potential and are trying to
bolster relationships to encourage coalitions and head off potential
conflicts.<P>
   The diversity of the Hispanic population makes coalition-building a tricky
proposition, however. "A large number of Hispanics are white," notes Yvonne
Scruggs-Leftwich, executive director of Black Leadership Forum, a national
confederation of black civil-rights groups. "The issues that resonate with
people of color may not resonate throughout the Hispanic population."<P>
   The issues may be complicated and nuanced, but there is little doubt that
Hispanics will become the largest U.S. minority population and that this
demographic reality will force new paths in the ongoing struggle for civil
rights and democracy. Black leaders would do well to follow Sharpton and
Jackson on the path to coalition.<P>
