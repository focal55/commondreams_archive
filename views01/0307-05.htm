Archaeologists and historians, curators and collectors are peering into the blizzard of disinformation coming out of Afghanistan to discern whether the Taliban have carried out their threat to destroy the world's largest Buddhist statues at Bamiyan. Already at war with the present and the future, the Taliban seem to have declared war on the past. 
<P>The justification they offer, of course, is religious, the oldest and most common excuse for the destruction of art created by rival faiths. Although the international outrage is justified, it is also true that few countries are innocent of past zealotry and iconoclasm. Genghis Khan's forces destroyed Bamiyan in 1221, despite the fact that Genghis Khan himself was to become one of history's less likely Buddhists; British forces demolished most of the 15th-century mosque in Musallah in Afghanistan in 1885 and in China, temples and monasteries were demolished during the Great Leap Forward. From some perspectives, history seems like one long catalogue of destruction by one tribe of the treasures of another.  
<P>None of this excuses the destruction of the Bamiyan statues; the puzzle, though, is why the destruction should have become a matter of urgency to the Taliban now. Religious monuments were usually destroyed during active fighting or as part of a real struggle for power between competing ideologies. In this respect, the Bamiyan case is an oddity. This is not the first - or even, arguably, the greatest damage to Afghanistan's Buddhist treasures: the country's museums and their collections of early Buddhist art were looted in the early 90s. Even now, smuggled and looted treasures, including the unique Begram ivories from the Kabul museum, circulate in the world of unscrupulous dealers and collectors.  
<P>Even last year, the Taliban seemed content to live with the Bamiyan statues. When a local Taliban commander captured the valley in 1998 and began to destroy one of the Buddhas, he was ordered to stop by Mullah Mohammed Omar - the leader who has now ordered their destruction. Omar also ordered an end to the illegal excavations, organised out of Peshawar, and the Taliban appeared to be concerned to protect what was left, if only to encourage a revival of tourism.  
<P>The religious justification derives from the ban on graven images, common to the jealous God of the Old Testament and to Allah. But Dr Mohammad Hashim Kamali, himself an Afghan and professor of Islamic law and jurisprudence at the International Islamic University in Malaysia wrote, in an agonised public letter to the president of Afghanistan, "If destroying idols was justified at the time of the advent of Islam when the new faith was challenged by the idol-worshippers of Mecca, that logic does not obtain now, and there is no imminent fear of the Muslims of Afghanistan converting to idol worship ... Islam is not under threat of destruction, and justifying acts of destruction under its name is repugnant to reason, to the benefit of the people and the prevailing custom and experience which Islam itself demands to be protected and preserved." There is no battle now in Bamiyan and Buddhism has not been active there for more than a thousand years.  
<P>As Omar himself said last November when he announced that they would be protected as tourist attractions: "There are no Buddhists left in Afghanistan to worship them." If the Taliban's own pronouncements acknowledge that the religious imperative is not absolute, the question remains, why act now? The evidence points to a political gesture in which doctrine is only a pretext. Afghanistan has suffered Russian invasion, a proxy cold war, a devastating civil war, international isolation and now, UN sanctions in support of the United States' pursuit of Osama bin Laden. Only three countries recognise the Taliban government, despite the fact that it controls 90% of the country. It is not the most appealing regime, but nor is it the only regime in the world that stones adulterers to death, condemns women to a half-life behind the veil or amputates the hands of thieves. Since the moment last year when it briefly promoted tourism and today's bleak confrontation, relations with the west have deteriorated. In January another set of UN sanctions was imposed on Afghanistan, the first having produced no result.  
<P>With no commercial flights now, even last year's slim hopes of an increase in foreign visitors have withered. Afghanistan has suffered more than 20 years of war and a devastation that is as much the responsibility of outsiders as of Afghans. Afghanistan's cultural heritage, belatedly, has our attention. For the sake of the statues of Bamiyan, as well as the people of Afghanistan, perhaps we could find a more constructive response than another round of sanctions. Unless we do, the giant Buddhas will be remembered as the latest victims of a crisis the west contributed to then tried to forget.
