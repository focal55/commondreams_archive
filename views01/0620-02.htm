AS A LONG-TIME civil disobedient, I have experienced police mistreatment and
incarceration. So I have great empathy with the protesters calling for an end
to the Navy's bombing on Vieques, Puerto Rico. The organizers are utilizing
principles that Henry David Thoreau spelled out in his 1849 essay, "On the Duty
of Civil Disobedience."
    In Thoreau's time, the government took Mexican land, and he responded by
refusing to pay a tax and spending a night in jail. Today, the Navy "legally"
bombs Vieques, and protesters "illegally" enter the bombing range to face
police and imprisonment.
<P>
    As one of a very few national leaders willing to risk freedom for their
beliefs, the Rev. Al Sharpton is serving a 90-day sentence for a May 1 protest
against the bombing. Called to trial on May 23, Sharpton's request for his own
counsel was denied by U.S. District Judge Jose Fuste, who found Sharpton and
three elected New York officials guilty of trespass. The three others received
40-day sentences.
<P>
    In nonviolence training, it is important to stress that one must expect the
unexpected. Defendants have the right to counsel of their choice, but the
federal judge in San Juan denied this. The sentences he handed out were
excessive for mere trespass.
<P>
    Sharpton, well-versed in the nonviolent tactics employed by the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. and others in the struggle for racial equality, used the
courtroom as a forum. Activists often try to get their message across during
their trials. Later, from his jail cell, Sharpton invoked the memory of the
Nobel Peace Prize winner: "If Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was here today, he
would be in Vieques protesting."
    King visited India in 1959 and learned how Mahatma Gandhi was influenced by
Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy. The trip helped solidify his understanding of what
Gandhi called satyagraha-firmness in the search for truth or what we know as
nonviolent action against injustice.
<P>
    The hunger strike is a weapon of the spirit in a satyagraha campaign. So it
isn't surprising that Sharpton decided to fast until he is released, in an
attempt to further publicize the bombing exercises. He is not the first to use
a hunger strike in the Vieques protests. Last year, from July 25 until Oct. 2,
Andres Thomas Conteris, a United Methodist lay missionary, engaged in a 70-day
fast, the last 50 on water only. But he was unsuccessful in his appeal to
President Bill Clinton to meet with Puerto Rican leaders.
<P>
    Some cynics may believe that Sharpton's hunger strike is driven by his
political aspirations. He, in turn, has suggested that his 90-day sentence may
be a response to his announcement that he's considering a run for president in
2004, an announcement that came a few days before the trial. Indeed, Sharpton
may find that jail time boosts his candidacy. Eugene Debs, the bodacious
pacifist union leader, ran for president on the Socialist ticket five times.
<P>
When he spoke out against World War I, he was convicted of sedition and
sentenced to prison in Atlanta. While there, in 1920, he garnered almost 1
million votes for president.
<P>
    During nonviolence training, I ask who knows the name of the British judge
who sentenced Gandhi to six years imprisonment in 1922. No one yet has known
it. I suspect the judge who sent Sharpton and the others to prison for engaging
in satyagraha will soon be forgotten.
<P>
    As an activist, I applaud the fact that Sharpton knows his Thoreau: "Under
a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is
also a prison." Before dismissing the intentions of the imprisoned activist,
critics, judges and prosecutors should first serve some time in jail.
