ISLAMABAD, Oct 19 (IPS) - Addressing the American people on Oct.  
11, U.S. 
President George W Bush seemed as perplexed as millions of  
Americans about 
the ''vitriolic hatred for America in some Islamic countries''. He  
added: 
''Like most Americans, I just cannot believe it because I know how  
good we 
are.'' <P>
   The day after Bush's remarks, Pakistan, Nigeria, Indonesia,  
Egypt and 
Palestine witnessed more violent anti-American protests. What  
accounts for 
this dichotomy between the American self-image and how others,  
particularly 
Muslims, view them? 
<P>
   For any foreign visitor to America, the goodness of the average 
American, and the fact that immigrants rightly perceive America as 
providing opportunities and freedoms denied at home is certainly  
an 
important ingredient that makes the United States the world's most  
popular 
destination. Their deeply ingrained empathy, candor, humor and  
hard work 
endear Americans to all those who interact with them.  
<P>
   How is this 'good guy' transformed into the 'bad guy' abroad?  
The 
problem is that American goodness is hardly ever exported,  
remaining 
confined to its shores. This gap between what American says at  
home - 
liberties, rule of law and democracy - is rarely practiced in  
American 
foreign policy. 
<P>
    After all, what was common among a diverse group of leaders  
like Mao 
Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Fidel Castro or Dr  
Sukarno?  <P>
   They were all great admirers of America and the American  
Revolution 
prior to assuming office. They all looked up to the United States  
of 
America, whose 20th century role and ideology had been defined by  
Woodrow 
Wilson as supporting the 'right of self-determination' of  
subjugated 
peoples and colonies. <P>
   An enterprising American journalist, Edgar Snow, whose  
sympathetic 
account of the Chinese Communist Party's struggle, 'Red Star over  
China', 
remains a classic, launched Mao on the international stage.  <P>
   When Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam's independence from France on  
Sep. 2, 
1945, he borrowed the opening words from the American Declaration  
of 
Independence regarding the ''inalienable right of people to life,  
liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness'', so inspired was he by American  
ideals. <P>
   Before the July 1952 overthrow of the Egyptian monarchy which  
he and 12 
other members of the Free Officers Movement initiated, Nasser was  
very 
close to the Americans, including the Middle East chief of the  
Central 
Intelligence Agency (CIA) of that period, Kermit Roosevelt, who  
was 
covertly communicating with Nasser through Anwar Sadat.   
<P>
   Sukarno idolized Thomas Jefferson and his speeches were laced  
with 
Jeffersonian quotes. And when Castro launched the Cuban  
Revolution, he was 
confident of receiving American support. 
<P>
   But then, what happened? After coming to power, they became  
implacable 
American foes after a rude shock that the America they admired and  
idolized 
and the one they had read about in history books was different in  
real life.  
<P>
   Then there were two events which were to prove a forerunner of  
the 
emerging patterns of American policy: the first successful CIA  
coup against 
a popular, democratic government because it was perceived to be  
acting 
contrary to U.S. economic interests, DR Mossadeq in Iran in 1953.  
<P>
   A decade later, the CIA engineered the ouster and assassination  
of South 
Vietnam's President Ngo Dinh Diem, a friend and ally of the United  
States 
simply because he had outlived his utility to American interests.  
<P>
   From ousting an elected nationalist to killing a friend, the  
U.S. 
persona was now being defined as an amoral, ruthless power whose  
foreign 
policy instruments were capable of anything, irrespective of  
friend or foe. 
It was perhaps in this context that DR Henry Kissinger once  
remarked, ''to 
be an enemy of America can be dangerous, but to be a friend is  
fatal.'' 
<P>
   Negativism about America has largely been derived and shaped by 
predominant popular perceptions in three areas: dignity, double  
standards 
and democracy. <P>
   The leading London-based Saudi-owned Arabic newspaper, 'Al  
Hayat', 
recently carried a poet's lament on the plight of the Arabs that  
includes 
lines such as ''Children are dying, but no one makes a move.  
Houses are 
demolished, but no one makes a move. Holy Places are desecrated,  
but no one 
makes a move. 
I am fed up with life in the world of mortals.'' <P>
   The author of these lines is not some raving radical in a  
Palestinian 
refugee camp, but Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Britain, and the  
sentiments 
he has expressed represent what is by now almost a universally- 
held belief 
among Arabs, the poor and the elite alike.  
<P>
   For Muslims, the double standards they see reinforced this  
hostility. 
For instance, when United Nations resolutions apply to Iraq, they  
exempt 
Israel. And nuclear weapons are even given religious labels, such  
as 
Pakistan's 'Islamic' bomb. Or terrorism is treated as a virtual  
Muslim 
monopoly, forgetting that Timothy McVeigh, DR Baruch Goldstein  
(the Jewish 
settler who gunned down 29 worshippers in a Palestinian mosque in  
1994) and 
the Tamil Tigers, who blew up Rajiv Gandhi, were not Muslim.  
<P>
    Democracy, or its absence in countries that are American  
allies, is 
another key ingredient of anti-Americanism, more so when the  
United States 
has conspired or connived to undermine the democratic process. <P>
   Patrice Lumumba was ousted in 1960 in the Congo and replaced by  
General 
Mobuto. In 1965, Sukarno's replacement by General Suharto was  
followed by a 
massacre of almost 500,000 Indonesians, some of whose names were  
in lists 
proved by the American Embassy to Suharto's men. And in 1973, the  
elected 
leftist President of Chile, Salvador Allende, was ousted and  
killed in a 
CIA-backed military coup.  <P>
   It is no surprise that those peoples in these countries traced  
their 
plight at home - the injustice, the police state repression, the  
poverty, 
and the corruption - to American actions.  <P>
  However, not many Americans were aware of the adverse impact of  
American 
foreign policy on billions of lives overseas. <P>
   All that changed on Sep.11, 2001. Nineteen suicide bombers have  
done 
more damage to America's self-confidence than World War II,  
Vietnam or the 
Cold War combined. On Oct. 7, after returning from bombing  
Afghanistan that 
Sunday night, Commander Biff, head of an F-14 Tomcat squadron,  
told the 
media: ''Tonight was about restoring America's confidence.''  <P>
   However, restoring America's confidence must not be at the  
expense of 
renewing America's relationship with the Muslim world, which is  
facing 
severe strains. Hence, the crisis needs to be handled with  
patience, 
maturity and wisdom. <P>
   Of all the hordes of Western journalists who have been in  
Pakistan after 
Sep. 11, not one has reported any hostility or harassment from the  
people 
they encounter in the streets, even those in anti-American  
demonstrations.  <P>
   There is no personal animosity toward any American or Westerner  
from 
people they have met, only a strident political critique and  
resentment of 
American foreign policy, which is where the roots of anti- 
Americanism lie. </p>
