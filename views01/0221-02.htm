ONCE THE PILE of snow in your backyard begins to melt, it melts ever faster as the exposed patches of earth or stone reflect the sun's heat onto the receding pile.
<P></P>
The Earth behaves in the same way. Global warming generates its own self-reinforcing cycle of warming.
<P></P>
Once scientists anticipated that the globe would warm up by about 4 degrees C over the next century. In its latest report, published this week, the United Nations Panel on Climate Change reckons the globe may heat up by as much as 6 degrees C over the same time frame. 
<P></P>
Probably the most chilling - if that's the right word - evidence of what's happening comes from drilling done in the Vostok ice core in Antarctica: Temperatures there are not only the highest ever - by far - but have never risen by as much as quickly in 400,000 years.
<P></P>
Evidence that's easier to relate to than deep down ice samples is now cropping up all over the place. Last summer, a stretch of open water was discovered at the North Pole. The ice cap on Africa's famous Mount Kilimanjaro is retreating so rapidly that it may disappear entirely in less than 15 years. Pacific salmon are turning up in Arctic waters.
<P></P>
The scale of the impending temperature increase isn't certain. Computer models, while impressive, are still iffy: The climatic variables are almost infinite and their interactions are complex.
<P></P>
Even after allowing for some important question marks - while the Earth's surface is warmer, the temperature of the lower troposphere (the atmosphere up to eight kilometres) hasn't changed - there is no doubt now that the globe is warming up. 
<P></P>
Nor can any doubts remain that humans have caused the greater part of the problem and are continuing to do so. 
<P></P>
Nor do any doubts remain about the principal consequences of global warming of this magnitude. More and more severe weather, such as cyclones, floods, droughts, heat waves. A rise in sea levels, with disastrous consequences for poor, low-lying countries like Bangladesh. Acute water shortages in the Mediterranean and equivalent regions on both sides of the equator with the lush Amazon Basin turning into a parched savannah.
<P></P>
But between analysis and action, there is a complete disconnect. There is silence. There is timidity. There is an impregnable absence of will and of imagination.
<P></P>
The U.N.'s environmental conference in the Hague last November, called in an attempt to get an agreed action plan on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, ended in complete failure. A group of naysayers, led by the U.S. and including Canada, Australia, Japan, succeeded in preventing any agreement being reached to implement the modest emission reduction targets (a 5 per cent cut from 1990 levels, to be achieved by 2010) agreed to at the U.N.'s 1997 conference in Kyoto, Japan. Indeed, most of the political attention is now being given to how not to cut emissions - by substituting carbon dioxide ``sinks,'' such as expanded forests, which will absorb carbon dioxide but will also quicken warming by their dark leaves.
<P></P>
It makes a major difference that none of today's decision makers, from George W. Bush to Jean Chr*tien, will be around to shoulder the blame. It's critical, also, that developed countries, like Canada, will have to bear the principal cost of Kyoto-type remedial measures and, at the same time, by sheer geographic luck, will be affected adversely only tangentially. Indeed, in some respects global warming will benefit Canada - with a longer northern growing season, for example.
<P></P>
The root problem is a more fundamental one. Action can only be taken by government, including by requiring industries to meet agreed targets. Moreover, this action has to be taken collectively, on a global scale.
<P></P>
Governments, though, have lost their nerve. For more than a decade, government itself has been trashed and ridiculed by the neo-conservatives. Today, few governments - Bush's is a prime example - aspire to do much more than make their country - and the world, to the extent they can - safe for their corporations. Our only collective regulatory instrument left is the marketplace. Or everyone looking after their own, immediate, needs.
<P></P>
The scale of the global warming problem is so vast that it can only be tackled by institutions that believe in themselves and that can persuade their public to believe in their actions. Our governments now are too hollowed out to do that. 
<P></P>
So not until the seas rise and the Earth starts to crack will we actually do anything. Unless we regain our sense of ourselves as a collectivity, all we will do before the crisis hits will be to sigh with regret as Mount Kilimanjaro turns into a dusty brown hill - and then switch to another TV channel.
