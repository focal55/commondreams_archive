Media speculation since the horrific terrorist attacks on America has
pointed the finger at Muslims and the Arab world, and that has meant ordinary citizens of the US and other
Western countries becoming easy prey for anti-faith hooligans. Shame. Sadly, the latest horror to hit the US looks to have been caused by
people of Middle Eastern origin, bearing Muslim names. Again, shame. This fuels more hatred for a religion and
a people who have nothing to do with these events. This is why I want to explain some basic facts about
this noble way we call Islam, before, God forbid, another disaster occurs - next time probably aimed at Muslims.
<p>I came to Islam in my late 20s, during my searching period as a wandering pop star. I found a religion that
blended scientific reason with spiritual reality in a unifying faith far removed from the headlines of violence,
destruction and terrorism. One of the first interesting things I learned in the Koran was that
the name of the faith comes from the word salam - peace. Far from the kind of Turko-Arab-centric message I expected,
the Koran presented a belief in the universal existence of God, one God for all.
It does not discriminate against peoples; it says we may be different colors and from different tribes, but we are
all human and "the best of people are the most God- conscious".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, as a Muslim, I have been shattered by the horror of recent events; the display of death and
indiscriminate killing we've all witnessed has dented humanity's confidence in itself. Terror on this scale affects
everybody on this small planet, and no one is free from the fallout. Yet we should remember that such violence
is almost an everyday occurrence in some Muslim lands: it should not be exacerbated by revenge attacks on
more innocent families and communities.</p>
<p>Along with most Muslims, I feel it a duty to make clear that such orchestrated
acts of incomprehensible carnage have nothing to do with the beliefs of most Muslims. The Koran
specifically declares: "If anyone murders an (innocent) person, it will be as if he has murdered the
whole of humanity. And if anyone saves a person it will be as if he has saved the whole of humanity."</p>
<p>The Koran that our young people learn is full of stories and lessons from the history of humanity as a whole.
The Gospels and the Torah are referred to; Jesus and Abraham are mentioned. In fact there is more mention in
the Koran of the prophet Moses than of any other. It acknowledges the coexistence of other faiths, and in
doing so acknowledges that other cultures can live together in peace.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no compulsion in religion," it states, meaning that people should not be compelled to change their
faith. Elsewhere it states, "To you, your religion; to me mine." Respect for religious values and justice is at the Koran's core. The
Koranic history we teach our young provides ample examples of inter-religious and international relationships;
of how to live together. But some extremists take elements of the sacred scriptures out of context. They
act as individuals, and when they can't come together as part of a political structure or consultative process,
you find these dissident factions creating their own rules, contrary to the spirit of the Koran - which demands
that those recognized as being in charge of Muslims must consult together regarding society's affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p> There is a whole chapter in the Koran entitled Consultation. Communal well being is central to human life, so there is a concept
in Islam called Istihsan, which means "to look for the common good". Even though the Koran may lay down a diktat,
scholars are also supposed to consider the circumstances prevalent at the time.
Sometimes that means choosing the lesser of two evils or even suspending legislation if necessary: for
instance, a person who steals bread during a famine is not treated as a thief.</p>
<p>Once I wrote in a song, "<a href="http://catstevens.com/cgi-bin/ram.pl?file=songs/00054_00101.ra">Where do the children play?</a>" Our sympathy and thoughts go out to the families of all
those who lost their lives in this tragic act of violence, as well as all those injured. But life must go on. Children
still need to play, and people need to live and learn more about their neighbors so that ignorance doesn't breed
more blind fanaticism. Moderation is part of faith, so those who accuse Muslim schools of fostering fanaticism
should learn a bit more about Islam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Ruined are those who insist on hardship in faith," and, "A believer
remains within the scope of his religion as long as he doesn't kill another person illegally." Such knowledge
and words of guidance are desperately needed at this time, to separate fact from falsehood, and to recognise
the Last Prophet's own definition of that which makes a person representative, or otherwise, of the faith he
lived and the one we try to teach.
