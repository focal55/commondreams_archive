It is common knowledge that President Bush was not much of a student.
Although the facts of his lack of academic distinction--at Phillips Academy in
Andover, Mass., Yale University and Harvard Business School--are well known,
few people have stopped to ask a seemingly obvious question: How did someone
with mediocre grades get admitted to two of this nation's most prestigious
universities? With respect to Yale, the answer is plain. George W. Bush was
admitted to Yale because his father, George Herbert Walker Bush, and his
grandfather, Prescott Bush, were prominent alumni.
<P>
   Giving preferential treatment to the children of alumni is standard
practice at most elite institutions of higher learning. University officials
claim these "legacy admittees" strengthen their schools by creating continuity
across the generations and building a loyal alumni base. This justification
parallels the most commonly articulated defense for affirmative action in
minority admissions. But Bush and many of his supporters have expressed
skepticism--and in the case of U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, outright
hostility--for affirmative-action policies for minority students while saying
virtually nothing about the affirmative help routinely given to alumni
children.
<P>

The president's admirers who oppose affirmative action for minorities might
try to avoid this uncomfortable analogy by offering a different justification
for Yale's decision. During the campaign, those supporting Bush typically
chalked up his academic difficulties to youthful indiscretion, emphasizing
instead his record in business and as governor of Texas. Judged from the
perspective of his post-graduation accomplishments, his defenders implicitly
assert, Yale's decision to admit the future president was a wise one.
<P>
   The empirical record, however, belies any attempt to distinguish the two
forms of affirmative action on the basis of post-graduation success. The
overwhelming majority of minority students who benefit from affirmative action
in university admissions also go on to become productive and public-spirited
citizens. In the most comprehensive study to date, former university
presidents William Bowen and Derrick Bok conclude that black students from
selective colleges and universities lead successful and rewarding careers that
parallel those of their white classmates. A recent study of the University of
Michigan Law School's minority graduates reaches a similar conclusion. Indeed,
the post-graduation success of minority students who neither enjoy Bush's
ready access to circles of power, nor the automatic assumption of competence
that still is attached to those who are white and male, suggests that
minorities actually get more out of their education than their white peers.
<P>
   Rather than seeking to distinguish affirmative action for legacies from
other practices designed to tailor admissions policies to meet university
objectives, Bush and his supporters would do better to ask what the success of
both kinds of affirmative action says about the predictive value of the
"standard" criteria used to admit all students. In the Michigan study, for
example, researchers found, with only one exception, no statistically
significant correlation for any student between undergraduate grades and
scores on the Law School Admissions Test and future income or public service.
The exception is the inverse correlation between test scores and public
service-- the higher a student's LSAT score, the less likely he or she is to
engage in significant public service. These findings suggest that law schools
and other educational institutions should re-examine their admissions
processes for all students.
<P>
   President Bush claims he wants to "leave no child behind" and to "improve
the tone in Washington." Minorities might take this effort more seriously if
Bush were to acknowledge forthrightly the role that legacy affirmative action
has played in his own life. Such candor would go a long way toward persuading
minorities that the president really intends to move beyond traditional
Republican rhetoric that brands any effort to aid minorities as preferential
treatment while ignoring advantages routinely given to those already in
positions of power.
<P>
   Similarly, Bush's pledge to leave no child behind would be more credible if
it were accompanied by an explicit promise that the Bush Justice Department
will, notwithstanding the views of Atty. Gen. Ashcroft, defend admissions
policies that ensure minority students have the same opportunity to succeed as
Bush was given when he was admitted to Yale.
<P>
   Should Bush yield to those on the right and attack affirmative action for
minorities while saying nothing about legacy admissions, he will reveal that
compassionate conservatism has almost nothing to do with practices that
promote diversity and everything to do with policies that protect the children
of privilege.
