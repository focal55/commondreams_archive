Despite the gloss of consumerism and the glitz, not fading, of the Nasdaq stock market, we live in uncertain times. Supporters - mostly American - of the Bush administration's proposed anti-missile shield, base their support upon fear of unprovoked attack from "rogue" states, such as North Korea, Iran or Iraq. Much of the rest of the world does not feel similarly menaced, or does not believe America's proposed missile shield represents an adequate defence.
<P></P>
Canadians, in a familiar bind, are wedged between the need to support their neighbour and the duty to maintain their integrity and the right to their own judgment. The relationship can be acutely sensitive; as blessed as are the ties that bind, the constraints we sometimes feel are not so blessed. However, as we continue to go along and get along, we have come to accept the internal realities, that we will win some and lose some, in this peculiarly one-sided relationship, but also that we are uniquely positioned: America is simply the greatest laboratory on Earth and we are in the best position to observe and learn.
<P></P>
For example, Canadians who share the enthusiasms of their national daily newspapers for a pedigree right-wing party with matching agenda, and all who are opposed to same, can go to school on the trials and tribulations of the new administration of President George W. Bush. There is the assertion in this country, among the right, that Canadians and Americans are really much the same, with more in common than not, each a product of identical mass cultures, beneficiaries of the same technology, separated only by different currencies and a few tribal eccentricities. These vaporizings lend verisimilitude to the notion, for example, that Canadians would admire and enjoy America's health-care regime at least as much as their own, once they "opened their minds" and got to know it.
<P></P>
The truth is that most Americans despise and mistrust their private health-care plans. The outrage against the health insurance bureaucracy has grown each year so that even the U.S. Congress has picked up the cries of protest. To the historic demands for human rights, civil rights, and minority rights, add now this universal cry for patients' rights - freedom from the oppression and bullying of their health insurance firms. And, at last, there is a bill before Congress.
<P></P>
Canadians would have had the same loathing of a system so fundamentally rigged for profit and against the provision of services. They would have reacted sooner, and with more effect, through their own political system, which is more responsive than the U.S. system.
<P></P>
Go figure: Why has it taken so long to respond to the abuses in the American health-care system? Why is the issue even today still in doubt? In a national poll, reported on CNN the other day, only 18 per cent of those sampled believed they were properly served by their health-care insurance provider. Why, then, the lingering doubts?
<P></P>
There can be no doubts about the injustices and inadequacies endemic to private health-care plans in which the money always comes first, the patient second. There are, however, ideological grounds, an obsessive priority of the far right, now given sanction and support by the Bush White House. But observers of this American drama, viewed from our northern vantage, may see the growing opposition to the president's brand of arch-conservatism. His approval ratings are low and on hold; the nation doubts his commitment to the environment and does not agree with his energy policy. More telling, there is a strong belief he is more devoted to the concerns of corporate America than the concerns of the American people.
<P></P>
In a related development, the House of Representatives, where the Republicans hold a majority, last week reinstated an $800 million Bush budget cut in land and wildlife protection programs, voted against Bush's offshore oil and gas exploration plans and voted to uphold a Clinton administration program requiring mining companies to clean up their own environmental mess. This was all achieved with the help of Republican votes and in defiance of the Bush-Cheney White House.
<P></P>
<i>Time</i> magazine has provided an interesting vignette on current events in Washington: "Bush's close ties to the anti-big-government Republican right are on vivid display at a weekly meeting hosted by conservative activist Grover Norquist. A fervent ally of the Bush White House, Norquist confidently declares, "We're on the right side of history." Every Wednesday, more than 100 true believers - from industry, religious groups, the gun lobby, right-to-lifers - gather in Norquist's boardroom to plot strategy. The White House always sends an emissary.
<P></P>
This ad hoc committee represents the Bush coalition of interests, but no one would be so naive as not to understand who is truly in charge. Although it's comforting to have a few godly men on side, more important to have the Norquists.
<P></P>
The benefit to Canadians is to remain engaged observers and to watch the fantasies of the "united right" play out on real time and in a real place. The true right, under Bush, now has the power and the opportunity. All it needs is the support of the people. We don't have to suffer through this hard right turn, but only contemplate the result. We should report progress, or the lack of it, as "the right side of history" unfolds before us.
