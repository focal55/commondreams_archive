Now here's a nice puzzlement for those of us who oppose the death penalty on both moral and practical grounds. 
<P>
Morally, because executions validate fatal violence as a legitimate problem-solver and put the state  &#151;  that is, you and me  &#151;  into the business of killing needlessly and for the insupportable pleasures of vengeance. 
<P>
Practically, because no human institution is infallible, certainly not an emotionally charged criminal justice system, and we can never be sure we are executing rightly. There is no margin for error  &#151;  death is not reversible  &#151;  and error is inevitable. 
<P>
So what are we to make of the recommendations from a well-meaning panel for new and improved executions? Adopted, they would make the death penalty less liable to mischance but, reducing its misapplications, would make the process arguably more legitimate. 
<P>
A committee set up by the Constitution Project  &#151;  a nonprofit that husbands consensus on controversial issues  &#151;  has proposed 18 policies that its members could agree on and that the members, a mix of death penalty supporters and opponents, suppose the similarly split polity at large could agree to as well. 
<P>
The group urges that minimum standards be set for defense lawyers and that counsel in capital cases be paid adequately. Bad lawyering would make it easier for death row inmates to appeal convictions. 
<P>
Juries would be clearly informed that life without a parole is an option. Post-conviction DNA evidence would be admissible and it would be easier to get new trials on newly discovered evidence. 
<P>
Execution of the mentally retarded and juveniles would be ended, as would death sentences for persons who intended no murder but were part of a crime in which one occurred. 
<P>
And so on. These are largely matters of simple decency and common sense. It is our shame that they are not already the practice by acclamation. 
<P>
More than 90 persons in 22 states have been freed from death rows since 1973 because of doubts about their guilty. So many capital convictions have been discredited in Illinois that its Republican governor has called a moratorium on executions there. 
<P>
And the standards and practices around the country vary so widely executions are often more like roulette than like justice. Texas, notoriously, kills almost casually. 
<P>
Would these and the other reforms just whitewash what would still be an unconscionably bloody-minded business? And even if they made the process less vulnerable to specific error, they would do nothing to end the gross racial disparities in a criminal justice system that, beginning at the earliest intake, accumulate into a hideous social deformity in our death houses. 
<P>
Still, it cannot be argued that, to make the death penalty less defensible, hapless defendants should be burdened with inept counsel, truncated appeals and other preventable vagaries of the capital system if a political consensus can be cobbled together to end or ease those. 
<P>
The base case against executions would remain. 
<P>
Indeed, a board member of the National District Attorneys Association complains that the reforms wouldn't stop death penalty opponents from still opposing the system. 
<P>
Count on it.
