NO PRESIDENT since 1877, when Rutherford B. Hayes took the oath of office, has come to power with less legitimacy than George W. Bush.
<P>Having lost the popular vote by a record margin of more than half a million, President Bush shares with Hayes the dubious distinction of being the only 
other man whom many Americans believe also lost the electoral vote as well. As 
recently as last weekend, according to a CNN poll, 48 percent of all Americans 
did not believe that the man now residing in the White House won the election 
"fair and square."
<P>The results of the widely reported Florida recount conducted by the Miami 
Herald and USA Today, trumpeted in headlines as proof that Bush won the 
election, are unlikely to change this perception. Properly understood, those 
results show no such thing.
<P>The main thrust of the Herald account is that Bush would have increased his 
lead under most scenarios had the U.S. Supreme Court not intervened to stop 
the counting. Yet an astonishing fact is buried deep in the article: had all 
67 counties examined all the "under-votes" (those ballots which seemingly did 
not record a clear vote for president), Gore would have won Florida -- and the 
White House.
<P>Gore's margin of victory would have been by 393 votes under the most 
inclusive standard and by 299 votes under a more stringent standard. In this 
thicket of competing ways of conducting the recount, the only reasonable 
conclusion is this: who won hinges almost entirely on which standards are 
applied.
<P>Having come to office lacking a popular mandate, Bush has compounded his 
political problems by steadfastly refusing to govern from the center.
<P>Elected in good part because of his carefully cultivated image as a 
"compassionate conservative" and a "different kind of Republican," he quickly 
revealed -- through his nomination of John Ashcroft, his reversal of new Labor 
Department rules designed to prevent repetitive stress injuries, and his 
reneging on a highly touted campaign pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 
-- that the moderate George W. Bush was a campaign creation, and one quickly 
discarded once in office. Not surprisingly, right-wingers have been ecstatic: 
in the words of Edwin J. Feulner, president of the conservative Heritage 
Foundation, the Bush administration is "more Reaganite than the Reagan 
administration." But for many Americans, who took Bush's campaign rhetoric 
seriously, his actions in office have come as a shock.
<P>Is running a deeply deceptive campaign, they wonder, the way -- as Bush 
promised time and again during the campaign -- to restore honor and integrity 
to the White House? In the final analysis, however, Bush's greatest 
vulnerability may come neither from his lingering legitimacy problems nor from 
the growing sense among Americans that the man now in the White House 
campaigned for president "in borrowed clothes" (as Bush once famously said of 
Al Gore), but rather from the simple but jarring realization that he does not 
share their fundamental values.
<P>The values gap between the president and the American public has been 
revealed most dramatically on the environment, where a series of provocative 
acts -- the proposal to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the 
violation of the campaign pledge on carbon dioxide, the perverse unwillingness 
to acknowledge the scientific evidence on global warming, and the disastrous 
proposal (quickly withdrawn) to end salmonella testing for meat served in 
school lunches -- has made clear that George W. Bush is a man who places 
profits and economic development above all competing values.
<P>So extreme has been Bush's policy on the environment that even the National 
Wildlife Foundation -- a centrist group with 4.5 million members, about half 
of them Republicans -- has sent the administration a message: "Mr. President," 
said NWF President Mark Van Putten, "stop the war on our environment and our 
national heritage."
<P>With even moderates like Van Putten angry and a growing number of 
congressional Republicans already jumping ship on the environment, the 
vulnerability of the Bush administration -- and of its philosophy of corporate 
profits above all -- is more and more apparent. Already, according to an 
ABC/Washington Post poll released this past week, 60 percent of the public 
believes Bush cares more about "protecting the interests of large corporations,
" compared to only 28 percent who believe he cares more about the interests of 
"ordinary working people."
<P>The veil of moderation, which permitted Bush to win the White House, has 
now been stripped away to reveal the president for who he is: a man willing to 
place the narrow, short-term interests of big business over our environment, 
our health and our safety.
<P>These are not the values of the American people. And as this becomes 
increasingly clear, the man who came to the presidency as the "values 
candidate" will ironically have to face a formidable, and perhaps fatal, 
values problem of his own.
