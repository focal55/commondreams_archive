The following is a first-hand account of current conditions in Afghanistan and Pakistan from human rights organization Global Exchange, which recently completed a two-week fact-finding trip is presenting their report and recommendations in Washington this week.</i><b><br>
<br>
Introduction:
</b>
<p>A four-person women's delegation, organized by Global Exchange and led by Medea Benjamin, traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan from November 20 to December 3. The purpose of the trip was to investigate the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and among the refugee population, to assess the consequences of US bombing, and to
talk to women¹s groups about what role they would like to play in a
transition government.

<p>The group traveled to Islamabad and Peshawar in Pakistan, refugee camps
along the border, and Jalalabad and Kabul in Afghanistan. Our group met with a wide
range of women¹s organizations involved in activities such as educating
Afghan youth, providing economic alternatives for street children and
beggars, running clinics and health care centers, assisting refugees,
educating women about their rights, and promoting the legal rights of women
in a post-Taliban government. These groups include the Afghan Women¹s
Council, the Afghan Women's Network, Women's Commission for Peace, the
Afghan Women's Resource Center, Afghan Women Skills and Development Center,
Humanitarian Assistance for the Women and Children of Afghanistan, the
Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA), and the International Human Rights Law Group.

<p>In addition to women's groups, we met with representatives of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Program, the United
Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan, and the UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Activities. We also met with foreign and local
non-governmental organizations, including Oxfam, Save the Children, the
International Committee for the Red Cross, the Human Rights Commission of
Pakistan, the Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation, the
International Catholic Migration Commission, the Agency Coordinating Body
for Afghan Relief, the Norwegian Afghanistan Committee, and the Japan
International Friendship and Welfare Foundation.

<p>The conclusions and recommendations of the delegation are outlined below.
The first section addresses how to get assistance to the millions of Afghans
suffering absolute deprivation. The second examines how to best assist
Afghans in their effort to rebuild their devastated country. And the third
looks at how to ensure that women play a substantial role in a post-Taliban
government.

<p><b>Emergency Assistance to Those in Need, Both Inside and Outside
Afghanistan
</b>
<p>We are gravely concerned about the situation of the refugees, the internally
displaced people, and the needy population in general. The fighting that has
ensued in the wake of the September 11 events has displaced hundreds of
thousands of Afghans. The recent US military actions have created a whole
new class of refugees. Many of these people‹predominantly women and
children‹are receiving little or no assistance. Many are already
malnourished and face starvation with the onset of winter.

<p>Reaching the needy inside Afghanistan: The populations facing the greatest
disaster are those who remain inside Afghanistan in refugee camps, in the
areas where fighting continues, or in areas where access to humanitarian aid
is blocked by fighting and/or looting. Aid workers spoke to us of extreme
misery in the internal refugee camps, where there is an alarmingly high
incidence of malaria, malnutrition and dysentery. There is a shortage of
food, blankets and tents; many of the children have no warm clothing, or
even shoes and socks. With no toilets and no clean drinking water, hygiene
is abysmal. People are dying every day from cold and starvation.

<p>"My little sister died from the cold when we were refugees in Afghanistan, "
an 11-year-old boy named Hamasa who made it to a camp in Pakistan told us.
"There we went days without food, we slept on the cold ground with no
blankets. Many people died."

<p>Many of the refugees are from rural areas already devastated by a three-year
drought. The international aid they had been relying on for food stopped
with the US airstrikes, when most relief agencies closed their offices.
While relief workers are restarting their efforts, they are overwhelmed by
the need and the inaccessibility of the refugees.

<p>It is the "wild west" along some of the roads, with trucks looted,
provisions diverted, and truck drivers putting their lives at risk to
deliver aid. Looting and sudden eruptions of violence are making
humanitarian deliveries difficult and dangerous in areas around Kunduz,
Kandahar, Herat, Kabul, Jalalabad and Mazar-i-Sharif. The refugee camps
themselves are also plagued by violence. Women are especially vulnerable,
and face rape and other abuse.

<p>"I came here with 8 children from Kabul, but two died along the way," said a
woman in a refugee camp outside Jalalabad who did not want to give her name.
"I was forced to accept food from men in the camp to feed my children. They
would come to my tent at night, then leave me some bread."

<p>The US airlifts of food are not an adequate way to reach the needy. The food
and supplies are often commandeered by those with guns, and either taken to
feed troops or sold on the market. There are also reports of food landing in
fields laced with land mines, making the gathering of rations a risky
affair. 

<p><b>Recommendation:</b> Given that the humanitarian crisis has been greatly
exacerbated by the US bombing campaign, the US has a grave responsibility to
help. The air drops of food are inappropriate, dangerous, and should be
discontinued. There should be a halt to the US bombing and an immediate
deployment of a UN security force to ensure the safe distribution of food
and supplies. As the cold intensifies, so does the horrific humanitarian
crisis. This is why time is of the essence.

<p>It is unconscionable for the US to focus solely on the destruction of the
Taliban regime and the Al Qaeda network. The vast majority of the Afghan
people have nothing to do with Osama bin Laden or the Al Qaeda network. They
are now innocent victims of this war. It is our responsibility to help stave
off mass starvation and help rebuild the country. This is not only the right
thing to do for the Afghan people, it is also in our self interest. If the
US contributes to the starvation of thousands of people, it will feed the
cynicism and anger that people in the region feel toward the US, setting
back the larger campaign against terrorism.

<p>External refugees: The refugees who have migrated to Pakistan since
September 11 are in a precarious situation. The Pakistani government has
been reluctant to accept new refugees, insisting it was already overburdened
with nearly 3 million Afghans who had fled over the past 23 years of
fighting. Thousands were turned back or walked for days in the mountains to
enter through unpatrolled border areas. Those who have managed to cross the
border are not given refugee status and therefore have not been receiving UN
assistance. The UNHCR estimates 135,000-200,000 Afghans have crossed into
Pakistan since September 11, most of them "illegally."

<p>Some refugees have entered already-existing refugee camps such as Shamshatoo
and Jalozai, moving in with relatives who must then share their meager
rations with the "illegal" newcomers. The overcrowding and inadequacy of the
aid in several of the camps has led to a hostile atmosphere that negatively
impacts the refugees, particularly the newcomers. Those who have not entered
the camps have melted in with the general population, but without money and
few possessions, they are barely surviving. Children as young as five are
working as carpet weavers, maids or street vendors to supplement the
families¹ meager income. Hundreds of women, mostly widows trying to raise
their children, beg in the streets. The new camps that the UNHCR is
organizing in the tribal areas along the Afghan border are better organized
and provide rations to all, whether they entered legally or not. However,
they are located in Pashtun areas that support the Taliban. The locals have
threatened to attack non-Pashtun refugees, leading the UNHCR to exclude
non-Pashtuns from these camps for the time being.

<p><b>Recommendations:</b> The refugees must all be given legal status and registered
with the United Nations so that they may receive aid. Non-Pashtuns must be
given special attention and relocated to areas where their security can be
guaranteed. The level of aid in the camps, particularly the quality and
variety of food, must be improved.

<p>As more Afghans flee from Kunduz, Kandahar and other front lines, it is more
vital than ever that Afghanistan¹s neighbors allow refugees to cross their
borders, without the threat of involuntary return, and with proper
assistance and security in those neighboring countries.  Donor governments
must urgently provide the cash, not just the pledges, so that this
substantial burden does not fall on Pakistan and Iran in particular, which
already host so many Afghan refugees.

<p><b>Direct victims of US bombing </b>

<p>Everywhere we went, both in Afghanistan and in the external refugee camps, we met people who lost loved ones or were injured by US bombs.

<p>"We lived in Kabul near one of the Taliban military bases, where my father
had a small grocery store," explained 12-year-old Haziza. "One day I was out
with my father, when we heard planes roaring overhead and scary, loud sounds
like thunder. When we returned home, we found my mother and younger brother
lying dead in a pile of rubble that was once our house. My father went into
shock and lost his mind. Now I'm the one in charge of our household, taking
care of my five brothers and sisters. We have no money and it¹s hard for me
to find them enough food to eat."

<p>Children are traumatized by the loss of their parents and are left with no
source of sustenance. Parents are traumatized by the loss of their children.
We heard of several cases where the deadly cluster bombs, which break up
into hundreds of bright yellow bomblets, were picked up by curious
children‹and then exploded. Once injured, there is a severe lack of medical
care. 

<p>Rasmir, a 24 year-old mother from Kabul that the delegation met in Peshawar,
told of how on October 11 a bomb landed  on a park in the capital's
Makrorayan neighborhood, killing three children and injuring others. "All
the mothers were screaming, 'where's my child?' After that all the kids stay
at home because everyone is too afraid to go out," Rasmir said. "Now my five
year-old has mental problems from the shock."

<p>Little is known about the actual numbers of innocent civilians killed. The
US says the casualties are few. Aghans we spoke with said there are probably
thousands of dead.

<p><b>Recommendations:</b> We must conduct a serious investigation of the innocent
victims of the bombing. And just as we have made a strong commitment to help
the families of those innocent civilians who died or were hurt in the
September 11 attacks, so we must make a similar commitment to help the
innocent Afghan civilians injured by US bombs.

<p>Moreover, we must stop the loss of further innocent lives. The US must put
an immediate end to the use of cluster bombs, which have been denounced by
the human rights community. But we must put an end to the entire bombing
campaign. Too many innocent people have been killed, maimed and displaced to
justify a continuation of the bombing.


Reconstructing Afghanistan

<p>Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries on earth. Infant mortality is
one of the highest in the world at around 165 per 1,000 live births. Life
expectancy at birth is an abysmal 41 years of age. Due to decades of war,
Afghanistan has the world¹s largest population of disabled.

<p>The nation's economy is in a state of collapse, crippled by the three-year
drought, two decades of war and the present bombing campaign. Social
services such as schools and health care facilities are non-existent or
woefully inadequate.Basic infrastructure‹roads, bridges, irrigation, canals,
telecommunications, electricity, markets‹have been destroyed. In the
countryside, crop production has plummeted and livestock herds heavily
depleted. Drug production is one of the only cash crops, making Afghanistan
the largest opium producer in the world.

<p>A massive reconstruction and development program is needed and will require
a significant investment of funds. The World Bank estimates that merely the
clearance of landmines from all mine-contaminated areas in Afghanistan could
cost as much as $500 million. Total reconstruction and development costs may
total $30 billion. 

<p>During our visit, we encountered much skepticism about America's long-term
commitment to Afghanistan. People wondered if the US would even repair the
damage of the bombing campaign. Some said that once the US finds Osama bin
Laden, it will simply abandon this poor nation. Others expressed the view
that the US simply wanted to use Afghanistan to extract natural resources
and as a conduit for the vast oil and natural gas reserves in Central Asia.
They speculated that reconstruction would put Afghanistan on a debt
treadmill and leave the country indefinitely beholden to the West.

<p>"I don¹t know if the US is a friend or foe. That remains to be seen," said
Orzala Ashraf of the Humanitarian Assistance for Women and Children of
Afghanistan. "The proof will be whether or not the US sticks with us not
only to oust the Taliban, but to ensure that we are not oppressed by another
group of thugs‹the Northern Alliance‹and that we can feed, house and find
work for our people."

<p><b>Recommendations:</b> The US must show a long-term commitment to rebuilding, and
demonstrate that its support for reconstruction is not tied to its own
narrow economic interests. The model of development we promote should not be
in the interests of oil companies such as UNOCAL, a company that has long
been anxious to build a major pipeline through Afghanistan, but in the
interests of the people. It should not be a top-down, centralized model,
with huge projects controlled by government that would just lead to
corruption. Financing micro projects and giving micro credit will be the
best development path, especially for revitalizing the critical rural sector
that has been so devastated by drought and providing farmers with an
alternative to growing opium poppies.

<p>To show the goodwill of the international community, the World Bank, the
Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund should cancel the
debts Afghanistan owes them. (The World Bank/ADB debt is $38.7 million, and
the IMF debt is $9.6 million, for a total of $48.3 million.)

<p>Security conditions permitting, Global Exchange and other groups plan to
sponsor a sustainable development summit in Kabul in the spring that would
bring to Afghanistan some of the best examples of locally-based, bottom-up
development that reaches those in most need. These would include the Grameen
Bank model of micro loans, agricultural cooperatives, village-based health
care that combines western and local medicine, decentralized energy
generation from clean sources such as solar and wind.

<p>Also, redevelopment must help the most oppressed and depressed sector of
society, i.e. women. Respect for women's rights should be a pre-condition
for funding. Just as the US and the international community threatened to
withhold reconstruction funding if the Northern Alliance did not accept a
broad-based interim government, so they should use their financial muscle to
ensure gender equity. Moreover, women should be major beneficiaries of the
aid money, particularly the hundreds of thousands of widows who must support
their children. Micro loans should be targeted to women, women's groups
should receive significant resources, and activities such as women¹s
education and health care should be top priority.

<p>If Afghanistan is to emerge from the nightmare of 23 years of war and mass
destruction, and cease to be a safe haven for terrorists and a major
producer of drugs, there must be a serious commitment of funds from the
international community. The US is willing to spend over one billion dollars
a month on its military campaign in Afghanistan; it must also be willing to
spend billions on rebuilding. This will not only be good for the people of
Afghanistan, but it will show the entire Muslim world that we are their
friends and that we do, indeed, care about the well-being of the Afghan
people.

<p><b>Ensuring a Significant Role for Women in the Future Government of
Afghanistan
</b>
<p>While it is a positive development that several women were asked to
participate in the Bonn talks on the transition government, the women were
selected by the male delegates in a completely undemocratic fashion. We met
many women who felt that several of the women delegates were selected
primarily due to family connections. Women¹s group that have been on the
forefront of defending women¹s rights under the reign of the Taliban were
not invited. Moreover, out of a delegation of 57, only five were women.

<p>A larger number of women were invited to participate in a separate meeting
of civil society groups taking place in Bonn as well. However, those women
were also chosen in a top-down manner (in this case by the UN), according to
many of the women we spoke with. They also complained that the civil society
meeting was not given nearly the weight of the political meeting. Women
insisted that civil society groups should not get just a backseat role. In
fact, several women said that the only way to build a stable government
would be to give less importance to the "guys with guns" and a more critical
role to those with the skills and commitment to rebuild the country.

<p>Women were also concerned that the US was giving far too much power to the
Northern Alliance, a group they greatly distrust given their past record of
brutal killings, rape and looting when they were in power from 1992-1996.

<p>One of the women¹s groups, the Revolutionary Association of the Women of
Afghanistan (RAWA) is vehemently against the Northern Alliance, saying that
many of the leaders should be prosecuted for the war crimes they committed.
They are afraid that as soon as the journalists leave and the international
attention is shifted from Afghanistan, the Northern Alliance will revert to
their old ways. There are already allegations that Northern Alliance
soldiers have mistreated women.

<p>"Before the Taliban there was the mujahadeen, who kidnapped and raped
women," Zarlasht Waziry told us. "Being from a family of five sisters, my
father was afraid to let us leave the house. Then when the Taliban came,
women were imprisoned in their homes. And now the mujahadeen leaders are
back as part of the Northern Alliance, and women are once again afraid to
leave the house. We don¹t trust them."

<p><b>Recommendations:</b> There are hundreds of distinguished Afghan women, both
inside Afghanistan and in exile, who have done incredible work opposing the
Taliban and providing basic services. These women are the real building
blocks of a democratic, peaceful society. They must be represented, in
significant numbers, in all phases of the post-Taliban government, and they
must be equal participants. Some women have suggested a quota system to
guarantee significant representation by women. We strongly support this
suggestion. We also recommend that a women¹s forum be convened as soon as
possible in Kabul itself, composed of women inside the country and abroad
who have a proven commitment to women¹s rights, peace and sustainable
development. The purpose of this forum would be for the women themselves to
choose their own representatives in the transition government.
