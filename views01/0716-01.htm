The Bush administration's recent moves to thwart a United Nations pact
curbing the global flow of small arms reveals just how much it is a captive of
the National Rifle Association's gun-happy lobby.
<P>
   But it also underscored the growing incompatibility of right-wing
Republicanism with emerging global trends.
<P>

At the opening of the UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and
Light Weapons, John R. Bolton, the U.S. undersecretary of state for arms
control and international security, made it clear that the U.S. did not find
all guns "problematic" and would not join any effort to "constrain legal trade
and legal manufacturing of small arms and light weapons."
<P>
   The UN estimates that there are more than 500 million small arms in the
world, about half of which were acquired illegally. These weapons are used to
arm child soldiers, rival militia, criminal gangs and other "irregular forces"
that kill about 4 million people each year, say UN officials. The problem is
particularly acute in places like Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Angola, where
the UN estimates there are more than 17 million light weapons in circulation.
<P>
   The conference is seeking ways to curtail the bustling trade in illicit
arms that fuels those deadly conflicts; its goal is to introduce global
standards and tracing methods that assure some control of weapon distribution.
Some regional groups and nations already have implemented rigorous efforts to
reduce the flow of small arms (for example, South Africa and Norway have
programs that destroy small weapons found in the wrong hands).
<P>
   The 10-day UN conference, which will end July 20, is the first attempt to
forge an international consensus.
<P>
   "The United States would not join consensus on a final document that
contains measures abrogating the constitutional right to bear arms," Bolton
said in his remarks. He said the U.S. would object to any plan that included
prohibitions on private ownership of military arms, or any steps toward a
binding global treaty.
<P>
   Critics complained that the U.S. opposes the UN effort because it is the
world's leading arms producer and, like Russia, China and India, reaps huge
profits from looser weapons controls. While there undoubtedly are commercial
pressures at work, Bolton wrapped his remarks in 2nd-Amendment imagery. UN
officials went out of their way to allay the Bush administration's fears that
constitutional protections would be infringed, even publishing a booklet
addressed to the U.S. called "Setting the Record Straight." What's more, the
conference's action plan would not be legally binding.
<P>
   Bolton is a former vice president of the American Enterprise Institute, a
Washington, D.C.-based conservative think tank, so he understood the need to
pitch his remarks to the anti-UN theme so beloved by the American right. For
many years, far-right groups like the John Birch Society and various branches
of the so-called "Patriots" movement (even the Ku Klux Klan) have railed
against the UN for its reputed intent to strip away U.S. rights and liberties
and create a One World government. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
international agency has been elevated to the global headquarters of godless
communism by many of these right-wing forces.
<P>
   That sense of paranoia reached a crescendo in the mid-1990s with various
militia groups warning of an impending, UN-imposed New World Order and citing
the appearance of UN-owned black helicopters flying clandestine missions over
the U.S. Although the clamor has died down a bit, many partisans on the right
still are nurturing these black helicopter scenarios. More importantly, some
of them are now a part of the Bush administration effort. Rep. Bob Barr
(R-Ga.), one of the House's most extreme right-wingers and a board member of
the National Rifle Association, was an official observer at the UN conference.
<P>
   In truth, the hard-line conservative critique of the UN is winning over
increasing numbers of Americans because its partisans are the most passionate
evangelists. Those on the hard right place a high premium on UN paranoia; by
contrast, the political mainstream is rather tepid in its defense of the
international organization. The left's voice is virtually mute.
<P>
   The Bush administration's actions in the UN, as well as its position on a
growing number of international treaties and protocols, demonstrate an
allegiance to a reactionary world view that ill suits an enlightened
democracy.
