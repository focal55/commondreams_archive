When the U.S. and Colombia meet on the soccer field in Miami this
Saturday, the rules are clear, the time is fixed, the game is officiated,
and one team will win. In contrast, the U.S. is playing a far different
game in Colombia: there are no rules, no referee, a maze of different
'teams,' and no clear end. The playing field is a battlefield. No one
wins; everyone loses.

<p>I have just returned from a five-day, fact-finding trip to Colombia's
southern state of Putumayo where U.S.-trained army battalions have been
deployed since December, and where thousands of acres are being sprayed
with herbicides. 

<p>The results are not good. Indigenous and peasant farmers have had their
food supply destroyed by U.S.-funded aerial spraying. A grade school
garden and a government-sponsored alternative agriculture project designed
to teach peasants to grow cash crops other than coca were destroyed by
fumigation. Paramilitary gunmen have gone on killing sprees whose total
toll will never be known. 

<p>There are some very unhappy conclusions to be drawn:

<p>First, the U.S. is teamed up with the most abusive military force in the
hemisphere. And Colombia's military, in turn, frequently works hand in
glove with brutal paramilitary forces that are estimated to be responsible
for three-quarters of the politically motivated civilian murders. Members
of the Colombian military help the paramilitaries with intelligence,
logistics and transportation, and by blocking official investigations into
their activities. This directly violates the human rights conditions set
by Congress as a prerequisite for U.S. military assistance. During the
first 18 days of January alone, paramilitary groups committed 26
massacres; in one incident paramilitary thugs beat more than 20 people to
death with sledgehammers and stones. Yet U.S. aid continues to flow.

<p>Second, there's no clear end. The $1.3 billion extraordinary aid package
passed by Congress last July was sold as a one-time emergency
appropriation, a part of "Plan Colombia" that would end the civil war and
bring peace and economic growth. Now the U.S. military is asking Congress
for an additional $1 billion a year, continuing into the foreseeable
future.

<p>Third, the strategy is unclear. While Plan Colombia was sold to the
American public as a counter-drug plan, U.S. funds were earmarked
primarily for military aid to train, equip, and transport three new
Colombian army battalions, blurring the lines between counterinsurgency
and counternarcotics missions. U.S. policymakers are desperate to appear
hard on drugs; but for Colombians this is not a war on drugs, it is the
fifth decade of a counterinsurgency struggle.

<p>Fourth, there aren't two sides: there's a maze of intertwined,
overlapping, and heavily armed competitors. The drug cartels, under the
protection of paramilitary forces, have diversified their operations,
finding new production and trafficking routes. Colombian guerrillas,
primarily the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), have financed their
expansion through profits from the drug trade, but their objective is
territorial control and pursuing a war against the state. After more than
40 years, this war will not be won on the battlefield, but at the
negotiating table.

<p>Fifth, there are no winners. Ordinary Colombians lose. Human rights lose.
Peace loses. The region loses. There have already been clashes between
guerrillas and paramilitaries in surrounding countries. And the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has begun preparing camps along the
border for thousands of displaced persons. The U.S. war on drugs is
pushing drug cultivation and trafficking into floundering Ecuador, Peru,
and the fragile Amazon ecosystems.

<p>The U.S. loses. Our most important interests and objectives in the
region--including strengthening democracy, promoting human rights and the
rule of law, and fostering trade and investment--are being severely
undermined. Treatment programs for addicts go underfunded at home, and,
despite spending some $19 billion a year on the war on drugs, illegal
narcotics remain cheap and plentiful within America.

<p>It's time for a new U.S. game plan in Colombia. First, we must send an
unequivocal message to the Colombian military that it must cut its ties
with paramilitary forces. Second, we must put our money into proven
programs of supporting human rights, rule of law, and economic
development. Finally, we must solve our drug problem at home with
effective medical, treatment, and educational solutions to this largely
public health problem.

<p>If the U.S. team played soccer the way we're engaging Colombia, we'd score
minus 50 goals, the team would be billions of dollars in the red, and 10
percent of the spectators would wind up dead. Maybe it's time for a new
game plan.
