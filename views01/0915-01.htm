Nothing will ever be the same, we’re told, after the cataclysmic
terrorism of 911.  Yet some things seem unchanged in the media -- such
as the pundit clamor for retaliation against someone, somewhere, fast.

<p>As a talk radio host in New York put it: "Bomb somebody, goddamnit!"

<p>We’ve been here before, almost exactly three years ago.  In the wake of
terror bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, President Clinton was
urged to take decisive action, and on August 20, 1998, he ordered
missile attacks on two targets purportedly linked to Osama bin Laden,
the accused mastermind of the bombings.

<p>One target of operation “Infinite Reach” was bin Laden’s paramilitary
camp in Afghanistan. “The U.S. picked the highly accurate cruise missile
for the strikes against the Afghan camp,” reported CNN’s military
correspondent Jamie McIntrye, “because of their ability to fly with
pinpoint accuracy.” One of the missiles was so inaccurate it hit the
wrong country, Pakistan, several hundred miles off-course.

<p>The other target was the Al Shifa factory in Sudan, alleged by the
Clinton administration to be linked to bin Laden and to be producing
chemical warfare agents.  The factory was destroyed and workers there
were killed and maimed.

<p>That night, Sen. John McCain appeared on five national TV programs in
less than three hours to endorse the President’s action. The next day,
the missile attacks were supported on the editorial pages of America’s
leading dailies.

<p>But soon, Western professionals who had worked at the Sudan plant began
to speak credibly of the plant being just what the Sudanese government
claimed it was: a civilian factory producing a major share of the
pharmaceuticals for an impoverished country.

<p>Western journalists who rushed to the scene of the U.S. missile attack
found medicine, but no security features that one would expect at a
military or weapons facility. Sudan’s government offered journalists
unfettered access to the area.

<p>The U.S. government said that it had obtained a suspicious soil sample
from near the plant nine months before the cruise attack.  But as New
York Times reporter James Risen noted in an exhaustive study a year
after the Sudan factory had been leveled, “officials throughout the
government raised doubts up to the eve of the attack about whether the
United States had sufficient information linking the factory to either
chemical weapons or to Mr. bin Laden.”

<p>Risen reported that intelligence analysts in the State Department were
drafting an internal report saying the cruise attack on the Sudan
factory had not been justified, but the report was killed by higher ups.

<p>What’s not in dispute is that Sudan government officials forced Osama
bin Laden to leave their country in 1996. Or that the Al Shifa factory
had been purchased by a Sudanese businessman five months before the
missile attack -- a fact that was unknown to the U.S. at the time it
targeted the plant.

<p>Three years after the U.S. government may have killed and injured
innocent people on foreign soil in a misguided “retaliation against
terrorism,” media voices are again calling for a quick and forceful
reprisal.

<p>Outrage is the natural and appropriate response to the mass murder of
September 11. But media should not be glibly encouraging retaliatory
violence without remembering that U.S. retaliation has killed innocent
civilians abroad, violated international law and done little to make us
safer.
