Once but alas no more to be Senate majority leader Trent Lott kicked up quite a stir last weekend when he wrote to his Republican colleagues that the Democrats' control of the Senate "lacks the moral authority of a mandate from the voters." Some huffy folks rushed to remind Lott that the same might be said of the current White House occupant, a second-place finisher in the popular vote who reached the Oval Office by way of a controversial Supreme Court ruling.
<p>Hush your mouths!</p>
<p>The Republican minority leader is eminently qualified to opine on the matter of politicians who wield power in Washington without the moral authority of a mandate. After all, Trent Lott hails from Mississippi -- a state that wrote the book on morally bankrupt political systems.</p>
<p>For most of the 20th century, an unbroken succession of Mississippi congressional delegations arrived in the nation's capital from a state known for its disenfranchising laws, acts of violence, economic reprisals and physical intimidation -- all designed to keep Mississippi's huge black population out of the voting booth.</p>
<p>It took the 1965 Voting Rights Act and federal examiners to bring Mississippi blacks into the political process. How bad was it before Washington intervened? In March 1965 -- and with blacks making up around 40 percent of the population -- Mississippi's black voter registration rate was still a lowly 6.7 percent compared with the white rate of 69.9 percent. But thanks to the most potent civil rights law ever put on the books -- and with no help from Mississippians in the House and Senate, who fought civil rights laws tooth and nail -- black voter registration increased to 74.2 percent by November 1998. Only after the implementation of the Voting Rights Act did Mississippi come close to producing election results that could lay claim to the kind of moral authority that envelops a non-racist victory.</p>
<p>And in case there's some inclination among Mississippi apologists to chalk up low black registration to apathy, listen to this now stilled voice from that state's not too distant past:</p>
<p>Fannie Lou Hamer:<i> Well, when I first tried to register it was in Indianola. I went to Indianola on the thirty-first of August in 1962; that was to try to register. When we got there -- there was eighteen of us that went that day -- so when we got there, there were people there with guns. . . . We went on in the circuit clerk's office, and he asked us what did we want; and we told him we wanted to try to register. He told us that all of us would have to get out of there except two. I was one of the two persons that remained inside, to try to register, with another young man named Mr. Ernest Davis. We stayed in to take the literacy test. So the registrar gave me the sixteenth section of the Constitution of Mississippi . . . told me to look at it and then copy it down just like I saw it in the book: Put a period where a period was supposed to be, a comma and all of that. After I copied it down he told me right below that to give a real reasonable interpretation then, interpret what I had read. That was impossible. I had tried to give it, but I didn't even know what it meant, much less to interpret it.</i> (Tougaloo College Archives)</p>
<p>After they left the clerk's office, they were arrested. That night, for trying to vote, Hamer was forced by a white landowner to leave the home that she and her family had sharecropped for 18 years.</p>
<p>Now hear the words of the Rev. Johnny Barbour Jr., pastor of Grove Street AME Church in Jackson, Miss.:</p>
<p>
<i>They tried to discourage you about the civil rights movement, and voting. I pastored Bethel Church, which is the oldest black church there and which all of them [civil rights workers] were coming to Yazoo City to try to get started. They came to my house. . . . I never shall forget, they [white police] penned us in around there and Dr. Robert Harrison, a black dentist, finally got them to let us out. But I remember Tom Brown and I who used to pastor Pearl Street [Church], we were walking back because everybody had left us by ourselves. And these policemen drove up to us and said, "Where are you boys coming from?" So, I told him where we were coming from. And he said, "We thought you were going to lie and we were going to get out and beat your heads in." You know, and that kind of thing. And they were just riding along beside you until we finally got to my parsonage."</i> (University of Southern Mississippi, Civil Rights in Mississippi Digital Archive.)</p>
<p>And this doesn't include the murders of NAACP field director Medgar Evers, civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman, and James Chaney, and the others who lost their lives for the "crime" of trying to include black people in Mississippi's nearly lily-white electorate.</p>
<p>That system of voter disenfranchisement and economic and physical reprisals kept a large percentage of Mississippi's population away from the polls. It also made winning elections a lot easier for such stalwart segregationists as Theodore Bilbo, John Bell Williams, John Stennis, James Eastland and the man who gave Lott his first political job in Washington -- arch foe and executioner of civil rights legislation, William Colmer. Lott was Colmer's right-hand man for four years until Colmer went back home for good, turning his seat over to his young protege.</p>
<p>So leave Trent Lott alone when he elects to pontificate on such matters as "moral authority," "mandate from the voters" and stuff like that. As an astute student of Mississippi political history, Lott knows better than anybody in the Senate, with the possible exception of Strom Thurmond, about how political victory can be achieved without a truly democratic vote.</p>
