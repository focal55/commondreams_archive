In Washington, a "gaffe" occurs when a high-level official
accidentally says what he means. The Bush administration has been
remarkably gaffe-free so far, with almost everyone sticking to the same
bland script. All except Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, that is, whose
gaffes offer a glimpse into the real philosophy of the Bush corporation
that now runs the United States.
<p>  O'Neill's latest occurred in a recent interview with the Financial
Times in which he questioned why the government should provide Social
Security, Medicare or any other social insurance.
<p>"Able-bodied adults should save enough on a regular basis so that they
can provide for their own retirement and, for that matter, health and
medical needs," he said.
<p>  The Treasury secretary's candor goes a long way toward explaining why
Bush's giant $1.3-trillion tax cut--most of whose benefits will go to
multimillionaires like O'Neill--hasn't caused more worry in the White
House about what will happen to Social Security and Medicare when the
baby boomers retire and there's no money left to pay the bill.
<p>Bush Inc. assumes that boomers will just take care of themselves.
<p>  Seen in this light, the commission recently launched by George W. Bush
to recommend ways to save Social Security (packed with people already
committed to "privatizing" it) and the new White House move to overhaul
Medicare with "market-based changes" are fig leafs for a long-term
strategy to get rid of these social insurance schemes altogether.
<p>  O'Neill's candor is refreshing. It deserves more than a "gotcha" from
Democrats looking for ways to scare elderly voters in the 2002 mid-term
elections and the 2004 presidential contest.
<p>The Treasury secretary raises one of the most fundamental questions
society faces: Why should there be any social insurance at all?
<p>  The idea for Social Security was dreamed up by Labor Secretary Frances
Perkins and signed into law by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935.
Unemployment insurance and welfare were parts of the original scheme.
<p>Medicare was President Johnson's doing, 30 years later.
<p>  The broad idea was easily understood by the generations that
experienced the Depression, World War II, the Cold War and some deep
recessions. Any family could find itself down on its luck through no
fault of its own. Family savings could go down the drain if the economy
turned really sour.
<p>Its breadwinner might lose his (almost always "his") job and have a
hard time finding another. Or he might become disabled or die, leaving
his wife and children destitute. An elderly person or couple might lose
everything in an economic down draft and face their twilight years in
grinding poverty.
<p>  A humane society, it was assumed, would pool some of its resources to
guard against these personal misfortunes.
<p>Like any insurance system, citizens would be expected to pay small
premiums. But unlike private insurance, everyone would be included
regardless of the likelihood that they'd need to draw on the insurance
pool.
<p>Rich and poor, healthy and sick, young workers and older workers--all
would pitch in.
<p>  Treasury Secretary O'Neill would prefer going back to the days before
social insurance, when individuals either had to save their own earnings
against the possibility they'd need help down the line or buy their own
private insurance. Presumably, if the responsibility rested entirely on
their shoulders, they'd save more and take better precaution to avoid
harm's way.
<p>  Some families, however, don't earn enough to allow them to save much of
anything. And some harms--a catastrophic illness, a disabling accident, a
factory closing, a stock-market plunge--can't be avoided.
<p>  Meanwhile, private insurers naturally will do everything they can to
sign up clients at the lowest risk of needing them, while eschewing the
high risks. After all, insurance companies and HMOs aren't charitable
institutions--they need to show profits. And all are becoming more
efficient at discriminating among potential consumers, weeding out the
high risks and marketing to the low.
<p>  So without social insurance, people who are poorer or who face higher
risk of having bad things happen to them won't be covered.
<p>People at the other end--richer and at lower risk--will efficiently
pool their resources and get insurance at a much lower rate than if they
had to bear the extra cost of insuring the poorer and the riskier.
<p>  It's coming to be like that all over the land. The richer, healthier,
younger, well-educated and well-connected and their children are doing
better and better. (They even got a big tax windfall just now.) And the
gap between them and the bottom half of the nation widens.
<p>  It's not just an income and wealth gap. It's also a geographical
gap--they live farther and farther apart. And a psychological gap--the
better off don't even encounter the other half or understand them or
empathize with the daily burdens and challenges they face.
<p>  The welfare "safety net" that was included in the Social Security Act
of 1935 already is in shreds. Unemployment insurance reaches a far
smaller percentage of people who lose their jobs than it did two decades
ago.
<p>And now Social Security and Medicare are on the dock.
<p>  When Americans faced a common problem--the Depression, a hot war, a
cold war--we understood intuitively that we were all in it together.
Someone's misfortune could be anyone's: "There but for the grace of God
go I." Social insurance was a natural impulse, a first cousin to
patriotism.
<p>But that sense of commonality is waning as we drift into separate
worlds of privilege and resignation.
<p>  Treasury Secretary O'Neill and the administration of which he is a part
may see the future of American society better than we would like to admit
to ourselves. But if that's the future, it won't be much of a society.
