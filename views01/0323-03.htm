Nike's website allows visitors to create custom shoes bearing a word or slogan -- a service Nike trumpets as being about freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are. Confronted with Nike's celebration of freedom and their statement that if you want it done right, build it yourself, I could not help but think of the people in crowded factories in Asia and South America who actually build Nike shoes. As a challenge to Nike, I ordered a pair of shoes customized with the word "sweatshop." Nike rejected my request, marking the beginning of a correspondence between me and the company [see box]. None of Nike's messages addressed the company's legendary labor abuses, and their avoidance of the issue created an impression even worse than an admission of guilt. In mid-January I forwarded the whole e-mail correspondence to a dozen friends, and since that time it has raced around the Internet, reaching millions of people, even though I did not participate at all in its further proliferation. The e-mail began to spread widely thanks to a collection of strangers, scattered around the world, who took up my battle with Nike. Nike's adversary was an amorphous group of disgruntled consumers connected by a decentralized network of e-mail addresses. Although the press has presented my battle with Nike as a David versus Goliath parable, the real story is the battle between a company like Nike, with access to the mass media, and a network of citizens on the Internet who have only micromedia at their disposal.
<p>Everyone knows about the 
power of mass media, especially Nike. Nike is primarily a brand; its 
main product is advertisements rather than shoes or clothing. By 
spending nearly a billion dollars a year, Nike gains access to all 
major media outlets. Nike broadcasts a message that equates its 
famous swoosh with freedom, revolution and personal exuberance. Of 
course, this image is sharply at odds with the oppressive conditions 
faced by Nike factory workers. Nike's celebration of freedom never 
reached the ears of the Indonesian woman who had to trade sexual 
favors to get her job or the Mexican worker who was struck with a 
hammer by his angry manager. Both of these violations were reported 
earlier this year, and similarly graphic episodes have been 
discovered regularly over the past ten years. However, even with the 
benefit of these reports, activists have had trouble counteracting 
the lure of Nike's slick TV ads and high-profile 
endorsements.
</p>
<p>
Micromedia has the potential to reach just as 
many people as mass media, especially in the emerging networked 
economy. Most e-mail forwards die before they are widely distributed, 
but if critical mass is attained, it is possible to reach millions of 
people without spending any money at all. Another benefit is that 
each person receives the e-mail from a friend, often with a personal 
recommendation such as "I thought you would like this," or "This is 
really funny." So the audience is preselected for its receptivity to 
the message. When a recipient does enjoy the message, he or she can 
begin the process again by reforwarding it. It takes so little effort 
for each person to pass the message to multiple recipients that an 
idea can almost seem to be spreading on its own, like a 
self-replicating virus.
</p>
<p>
Nike has the advantage when it 
comes to mass media, but activists may have the advantage with 
micromedia. I discovered this accidentally when I sent my Nike 
e-mails to a few friends. My small group of friends may be divided 
from everyone else in the world by only six degrees of separation, 
but until the large-scale adoption of the Internet, this did not have 
such dramatic consequences. I never expected my conversation with 
Nike to be so widely distributed; the e-mail began to proliferate 
without my participation. The only force propelling the message was 
the collective action of those who thought it was worth forwarding. 
Unions, church groups, activists, teachers, mothers, schoolchildren 
and members of the US armed forces sent me letters of support. This 
contradicts Nike's claim that only fringe groups identify with 
anti-Nike sentiment. Rather, an expansive group of people from all 
walks of life are concerned about sweatshop labor and are dismayed by 
Nike's brand hegemony. 
</p>
<p>
But the Nike e-mails did not reach 
these people all at once. Like all micromedia, the Nike e-mails 
jumped haphazardly around a network defined by personal 
relationships. The first people to get the message were friends or 
friends of friends who tended to be left-leaning and interested in 
technology. At this point, I received responses from people like 
Johana Shull, a college student in California, who informed me that 
she posted the Nike e-mails to her sociology class discussion list to 
support their discussion of freedom of expression as it relates to 
pop culture. As the message spread, it began circulating among 
die-hard activists who saw it as supporting their life's mission. The 
tone changed the day I got an urgent message from someone who called 
himself Biker-X. His query: "Please confirm if the entire Nike 
exchange took place for me. Inquiring activists want to know." In the 
coming days the message would race through the anti-Nike, 
culture-jamming, activist community. At this point, I was getting 
twenty or thirty e-mails a day, mostly from the United States and 
Britain, and I assumed that the circulation had peaked. 

</p>
<p>
Then, something interesting happened. The micromedia 
message began to work its way into the mass media. This 
transformation was helped along by postings on media startups 
Plastic.com and Slashdot.org, two sites that use an innovative 
publishing technique somewhere between micro- and mass media. These 
democratic sites blur the line between editors and readers, so that 
Internet buzz can be transformed into a hotly debated news item seen 
by thousands of people. Reporters from traditional media outlets 
noticed posts on these sites or received the e-mail forward directly 
from friends, with notes saying things like, "You should really do a 
story about this." At first articles appeared in technology-focused 
and left-leaning publications like the<i> San Jose Mercury News</i>, 
Shey.net, Salon.com, the <i>Village Voice</i> and <i>In These 
Times.</i> But soon mainstays like<i> Time</i>, the BBC, the <i>Los 
Angeles Times</i>, <i>USA Today</i>, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 
and <i>Business Week </i>were covering the story. NBC's <i>Today</i> 
show flew me to New York for an appearance on national television. In 
almost every case, the reporters noted that they discovered the story 
online or heard about it from a close friend. Fatigued by PR-driven 
pitches, journalists saw the Nike e-mails as an opportunity to 
discover a story for themselves. 
</p>
<p>
As the mass-media 
attention grew, so did the circulation of the e-mail. I began 
receiving 500 messages a day, sent from Australia, Asia, Africa and 
South America. The majority were letters of support or messages, like 
the one from Katy Joyce, to verify whether I was a real person or 
just an urban myth. Those who assumed I was real started to request 
advice about politics, economics and the kind of shoes they should 
buy. I knew the message had spread well beyond my circle of friends 
when I was cc'd this message from a man named George Walden: "I get a 
kick out of these elitist, eggheads and their self-serving, 
selfrighteous 'rain forest' ethics and contrived secular pieties. 
Somebody should burn 'sweatshop' into this foolish c**ksucking 
faggot's forehead with a cigarette." On the other extreme, I also 
began to receive marriage proposals and correspondence that could be 
described as fan mail.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, my e-mail volume is 
finally back down to fewer than a hundred messages a day, and the 
media blitz is tapering off. The exchange is working its way into 
sociology textbooks, viral marketing seminars, business-school cases 
and doctoral dissertations. My guess is that in the long run this 
episode will have a larger impact on how people think about media 
than how they think about Nike and sweatshop labor. This larger 
lesson suggests an exciting opportunity for activists. The dynamics 
of decentralized distribution systems and peer-to-peer networks are 
as counterintuitive as they are powerful. By understanding these 
dynamics, new forms of social protest become possible, with the 
potential to challenge some of the constellations of power 
traditionally supported by the mass media.
