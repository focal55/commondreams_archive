BOSTON <wbr>--<wbr> Despite scant coverage in the U.S. media, a controversy over
depleted-uranium ammunition used in the Gulf and Balkan wars has been
raging in Europe. Several governments that provided troops for these
conflicts fear that a rash of unexplained illnesses in
veterans--including hemorrhaging, tumors and cancers--may have been
caused by ammunition fired by U.S. warplanes.
<p>Germany, Italy, Norway and the European Parliament have called for a
moratorium on using the ammunition, while the World Health Organization
has announced plans for a study of civilians in Kosovo and Iraq who may
have been exposed. Last week, Pekka Haavisto, the head of the United
Nations' investigation of depleted uranium, warned of the necessity to
"closely follow the state of health" of those exposed to the ammunition
in the Balkans.
<p>Questions abound: Is there a causal link between depleted uranium and
serious illnesses? What constitutes dangerous levels of exposure? How
many soldiers and civilians have been exposed? How much plutonium is
there in the ammunition?
<p>One thing is certain: The Pentagon has inflamed the controversy by
withholding information and stonewalling investigations. It is likely to
remain a major headache for the Bush administration, especially for
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.
<p>Depleted uranium is a chemically toxic heavy metal that emits
low-level alpha radiation. It is used in armor-piercing ammunition
because it is extremely dense and pyrophoric, which enables it to punch
and burn its way through hard targets such as tanks. But depleted uranium
also contaminates the impact area with a fine depleted-uranium dust that
presents a health hazard if inhaled in sufficient quantities. In the
aftermath of the Gulf War, research on rats conducted by the military's
Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute found that depleted
uranium's chemical toxicity--not its radioactivity--may cause immune
system damage and central nervous system problems and may contribute to
the development of certain cancers.
<p>Dr. David McClain, the military's top depleted-uranium researcher,
told a presidential committee investigating Gulf War illnesses in 1999
that "strong evidence exists to support [a] detailed study of potential
DU carcinogenicity." A separate Army-funded study conducted by the
Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque, N.M., found that
depleted uranium caused cancer when implanted in laboratory animals.
While Fletcher Hahn, a senior scientist at Lovelace, cautioned about
applying the findings to human beings, he also called the study "a
warning flag that says we shouldn't ignore this."
<p>Despite the military's own research, however, in recent weeks Pentagon
spokesmen have dismissed concerns about depleted uranium as unscientific
hysteria and propaganda. For example, Army Col. Eric Daxon recently
attributed concerns about depleted uranium to "a purposeful
disinformation campaign" by the Iraqi government. Yet, the Army
anticipated the current controversy even before the war against Iraq. A
July 1990 report from the U.S. Army Armament, Munitions and Chemical
Command predicted that, "Following combat, the condition of the
battlefield and the long-term health risks to natives and combat veterans
may become issues in the acceptability of the continued use of DU
[ammunition] for military applications." The report added that depleted
uranium is "linked to cancer when exposures are internal."
<p>Six months after the Army's prescient report, U.S. and coalition
fighting forces charged into Kuwait and Iraq, oblivious to the hazards of
the 320 tons of depleted-uranium ammunition shot by U.S. tanks and
aircraft. When thousands of veterans reported myriad health problems
after the war, a series of federal investigations queried the Defense
Department about its use of depleted uranium. In each case, the Army
Surgeon General's office asserted that only 35 veterans had been exposed,
a number so small that it did not justify further research.
<p>Through Congressional inquiry and the determined work of Gulf War
veterans' advocates, however, the Pentagon was forced to dramatically
increase its estimates of the number of veterans exposed to depleted
uranium.
<p>In January 1998, the Pentagon's Office of the Special Assistant for
Gulf War Illnesses made a long-overdue admission: "Combat troops or those
carrying out support functions generally did not know that DU
contaminated equipment such as enemy vehicles struck by DU rounds
required special handling. The failure to properly disseminate such
information to troops at all levels may have resulted in thousands of
unnecessary exposures."
<p>The Pentagon's figure of "thousands" tells us little about the effects
of depleted uranium on these veterans. Unfortunately, until 1998 the
Department of Veterans Affairs accepted the Pentagon's original number
and examined only 33 veterans exposed to depleted uranium. Some of these
veterans continued to excrete depleted uranium in their semen and urine
six years after the war. Several have mild central nervous system
problems. The VA removed a bone tumor from one veteran who was wounded by
DU shrapnel.
<p>In the absence of an epidemiological study of a larger number of
exposed veterans, however, no firm conclusions about the role of depleted
uranium can be drawn. Unfortunately, the lack of candor has continued
even after Kosovo. When the war ended, a United Nations task force asked
NATO to identify areas contaminated with depleted uranium so that
peacekeepers, civilians and relief workers might be warned about the
potential hazard. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization inexplicably
refused to comply with the request. In February 2000, eight months after
the war, NATO finally confirmed that U.S. jets had released the
equivalent of 10 tons of depleted uranium in Kosovo and Serbia. Another
seven months passed before NATO disclosed the 112 locations of
contamination. But it wasn't until last month--19 months after the
bombing stopped--that NATO finally posted warning signs at the sites.
<p>From all accounts, peacekeepers, civilians and relief workers in
Kosovo were surprised to learn about depleted-uranium contamination in
their midst. There, as in Iraq, children had long been playing on
destroyed equipment. In addition, adults had scavenged destroyed
equipment for usable parts and scrap metal.
<p>European outrage increased when the U.N. disclosed that some
depleted-uranium ammunition used in Kosovo contains plutonium and other
highly radioactive elements. Pentagon spokesmen asserted that the amounts
of plutonium in the ammunition are extremely low, but they have failed to
publicly disclose the levels of plutonium in ammunition shot in Kosovo,
Bosnia, Iraq and Kuwait and on training ranges in Japan, Germany, Puerto
Rico and the United States.
<p>The Pentagon's history of withholding information about depleted
uranium has fueled suspicions among many of our allies. Rumsfeld should
try a new approach: ordering full disclosure of all information and
complete cooperation with international investigations.
