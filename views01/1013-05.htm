The Pentagon's air drops of food parcels and President Bush's plea 
for American children to aid Afghan kids with dollar bills will go down in 
history as two of the most cynical maneuvers of media manipulation in the 
early 21st century.

<p>Many U.S. news outlets have been eager to play along. A New York 
Times editorial proclaimed that "Mr. Bush has wisely made providing 
humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people an integral part of American 
strategy." Four days later, on Oct. 12, the same newspaper still had 
nothing but praise for the U.S. government's food aid charades: "His 
reaffirmation of the need for humanitarian aid to the people of Afghanistan 
-- including donations from American children -- seemed heartfelt."

<p>While thousands of kids across the United States stuff dollar 
bills into envelopes and mail them to the White House, the U.S. government 
continues a bombing campaign that is accelerating the momentum of mass 
starvation in Afghanistan.

<p>Relief workers have voiced escalating alarm. Jonathan Patrick, an 
official with the humanitarian aid group Concern, minced no words. He 
called the food drops "absolute nonsense."

<p>"What we need is 20-ton trucks in huge convoys going across the 
border all the time," said Patrick, based in Islamabad. But when the 
bombing began, the truck traffic into Afghanistan stopped.

<p>In tandem with the bombing campaign, the U.S. government launched 
a PR blitz about its food-from-the-sky effort. But the Nobel-winning French 
organization Doctors Without Borders has charged that the gambit is 
"virtually useless and may even be dangerous." One aid group after another 
echoes the assessment. The U.S. has been dropping 37,000 meals a day on a 
country where several million Afghans face the imminent threat of 
starvation. Some of the food, inevitably, is landing on minefields.

<p>The food drops began on Sunday, Oct. 7, simultaneous with the 
start of the bombing. "As of Thursday, a Pentagon spokeswoman said more 
than 137,000 of the yellow-packaged rations had been dropped," the 
Knight-Ridder News Service reported on Oct. 12. "International aid 
organization officials say, however, that around 5 million Afghans are in 
danger of starvation because the nation's borders are sealed and food 
supplies are diminishing by the day -- meaning that only a tiny percentage 
of the hungry are receiving the U.S. food." The borders are sealed because 
of the continuous bombing.

<p>Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld wasn't worried about provoking 
appropriate derision and outrage when he told reporters on Oct. 8: "It is 
quite true that 37,000 rations in a day do not feed millions of human 
beings. On the other hand, if you were one of the starving people who got 
one of the rations, you'd be appreciative."

<p>Avowedly, the main targets of the bombing are the people in the 
bin Laden network and their Taliban supporters. But the rhetorical salvoes 
will be understood, all too appropriately, in wider contexts. "We will root 
them out and starve them out," Rumsfeld said, just before closing a news 
conference with a ringing declaration: "We are determined not to be 
terrorized."

<p>Supposedly, bombing Afghanistan is going to make us safer back 
here in the USA. But as soon as the attacks began on Oct. 7, the FBI called 
for heightened alerts across the United States -- because the risk of 
another deadly attack in this country had just increased. What's wrong with 
this picture?

<p>Unlike the media herd, longtime foreign correspondent Robert Fisk 
is exploring key questions. "President Bush says this is a war between good 
and evil," he writes in the London-based Independent newspaper. "You are 
either with us or against us. But that's exactly what bin Laden says. Isn't 
it worth pointing this out and asking where it leads?"

<p>Fisk asks other questions that aren't ready for prime time: "Why 
are we journalists falling back on the same sheep-like conformity that we 
adopted in the 1991 Gulf War and the 1999 Kosovo war? ... Is there some 
kind of rhetorical fog that envelopes us every time we bomb someone?"
<p>In wartime, media accounts seem to zigzag between selected facts 
and easy sentimentality. Michael Herr, a journalist who covered the Vietnam 
War, later wrote that the U.S. media "never found a way to report 
meaningfully about death, which of course was really what it was all 
about." Obscured by countless news stories, "the suffering was somehow 
unimpressive." Accustomed to seeing its military might as self-justifying, 
the USA powered ahead. "We took space back quickly, expensively, with total 
panic and close to maximum brutality," Herr observed. "Our machine was 
devastating. And versatile. It could do everything but stop."

<p>In its Oct. 12 editorial, headlined "Mr. Bush's New Gravitas," the 
New York Times concluded that the current president is providing exactly 
the kind of leadership we need: "As he reflected on the sorrow, compassion 
and determination that have swept the country since those horrifying hours 
on the morning of Sept. 11, he seemed to be a leader whom the nation could 
follow in these difficult times."

<p>Among the leadership qualities most appreciated by editorial 
writers is the Bush administration's aptitude for shameless propaganda. 
While the Pentagon keeps dropping tons of bombs, it scatters some meals to 
the winds. While the U.S. government persists with a bombing campaign that 
shows every sign of resulting in mass starvation, the president urges the 
young people of the United States to send in dollar bills -- "to join in a 
special effort to help the children of Afghanistan."
