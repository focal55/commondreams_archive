When the Ameritrade company launched a $200 million marketing 
drive to explain the joys of online trading in autumn 1999, a barrage of TV 
commercials invited viewers to join in the fun. The news was bullish, and 
the firm's motto -- "Believe in yourself" -- provided an upbeat message. 
Tech stocks led advances in self-affirmation.

         <p>A senior vice president at Ameritrade proclaimed that online 
investing "empowers individuals to take control of their financial lives." 
Within several months, the Nasdaq composite index nearly doubled. When 
spring 2000 began, plenty of satisfied new customers were glad to be 
playing the click-and-invest game.

         <p>Now, four seasons later, the Nasdaq is less than half of where it 
was. Losses have been particularly devastating for many of the investors 
who'd found the get-with-it advertisements and other media hype too 
irresistible to resist a year ago.

         <p>These days, the online trading commercials are on television with 
less frequency and less exuberance. They seem to be more targeted at 
long-term professional investors. Meanwhile, journalists speak ruefully, 
sometimes in morose tones, about the digital gold that has turned to 
silicon ashes in the mouths of America's stock-buying public.

         <p>Sure, "caveat emptor" and all that. Everyone should have known the 
risks. The same can be said for millions of consumers who have let smiley 
cigarette advertisements coax them into smoking. But if the online trading 
ads carried any warning labels at all, they were in very small print.

        <p> On a daily basis, CNN's "Moneyline" and many other national TV 
programs stoked the buying frenzy. It was all quite lucrative -- bringing 
in record levels of commissions for brokerage houses and high ratings for 
market-fixated network shows. Only spoilsports warned that disaster loomed, 
and they didn't get nearly as much air time as the boosters.

         <p>Today, news reports tell about formerly soaring dot-com executives 
who have seen their multimillions (or billions) turn into Nasdaq rubble. 
Even in burned-out condition, the stars of cyberspace get plenty of media 
attention. Less common are the stories that focus on rank-and-file 
investors who lost most of their life's savings.

         <p>We still aren't getting much coverage of some grim details. For 
instance: How were so many people drawn in by the warm-and-cuddly images of 
investment-by-mouse as a means to financial security and personal glory? 
What was it about the prevailing media environment that persuaded millions 
of Americans to put money they couldn't afford to lose into high-tech 
stocks that were incapable of sustaining vastly inflated share prices?

         <p>Eighteen months ago, Ameritrade was boasting in a news release 
that its huge ad blitz would go after every sector of society: "The 
campaign's target audience is more psychographic than demographic, cutting 
across all ages, races, professions and income levels."

         <p>All "income levels" included people with close to zero disposable 
income. The online brokerage firms proved adept at separating a lot of 
those individuals from their money.

         <p>Whatever their economic class, many in the cross hairs stood to 
forfeit more than dollars. To the extent that they bought into ad pitches 
and broader media mania for online trading, people were also vulnerable to 
bait-and-switch tactics that manipulated insecurities in the realm of 
self-esteem. With stocks climbing, a slogan like "Believe in yourself" was 
apt to seem like a welcome boost, a pat on the back. But when self-regard 
is pegged to stock prices, what happens when the market tanks?

        <p> Embedded in the ostensible affirmation was a much less humanistic 
message: Believe in wealth. And no matter where the market is headed, 
that's a message that ends up doing enormous damage -- inflicted with the 
help of ongoing media themes -- portraying a person's capital buildup as a 
key indicator of worth as a human being.


         <p>Let's face it: From splashy magazine features to commercials and 
entertainment shows on television to laudatory news profiles of 
venture-capitalist billionaires, mass media outlets are frequently touting 
the accumulation of financial assets as the pinnacle of achievement.

         <p>Viewed from another planet, the basic character of these dominant 
media values would be clear. But we're accustomed to this constant 
propaganda. We're encouraged to think it's normal. And the costs -- for 
individuals and for our society -- go well beyond any losses in the stock 
market.
