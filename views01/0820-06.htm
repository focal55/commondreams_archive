PRESIDENT BUSH has directed that scientists may get federal research money to work on stem cells that already exist, but not on new ones. However, private companies are free to extract additional stem cells from human embryos.
<P>

<p>Stem cells, you will recall, are undifferentiated cells in microscopic very early embryos. With cloning techniques, they can be turned into specialized cells, which have immensely promising medical uses - everything from repair of spinal injuries to treatment of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, even cancer.
<P>



<p>Bush's dictum is bizarre as science policy. If stem cell research holds such immense promise for relieving human suffering, there's no good reason to artificially limit a few grandfathered lines of cells. But neither does Bush's distinction make ethical sense. If there is some moral case against stem cell research, it's just as suspect with private dollars. Indeed, it is probably worse, since research underwritten by the National Institutes of Health tends to proceed with more careful ethical guidelines than private corporate research.
<P>



<p>The apparent incoherence of Bush's approach makes sense only when you appreciate that it was driven by one concern - how to appease the antiabortion lobby without alienating most scientists and many Republicans.  The faction that calls itself the prolife movement is denying health and life to millions of people suffering diseases that will be treatable and curable thanks to stem cell advances.
<P>



<p>In right-to-life theology, any fertilized human ovum is a potential human being. Hard-core right-to-lifers don't even like fertility treatments, because they leave leftover embryos. For the most part, it is these surplus embryos that are the source of laboratory stem cells.   When stem cells are extracted from a microscopic embryo, the embryo is necessarily destroyed. But these surplus embryos in fertility clinics would be destroyed in any event. By limiting stem cell research with federal dollars to stem cells that have already been created, Bush's rationale to the antiabortion lobby is that what's done is done, and at least other embryos are being spared.
<P>



<p>Bush's tortured logic satisfied some right-to-life groups, which had braced for a more liberal policy. It did not mollify the Catholic hierarchy. Catholic theology holds that since only God creates life, human researchers have no business growing embryos, with public dollars or private ones. Say what you will, this view at least has the virtue of consistency.
<P>



<p>Absurdly, Bush's policy will not spare embryos. The research will continue (as it should), if not with public dollars then with private ones, if not here, then overseas. There are certainly difficult ethical questions. If it is reasonable to extract stem cells from embryos that are leftover products of fertility clinics, what about aborted embryos? What about laboratory embryos created explicitly for their stem cells? What about the cloning of cells with the DNA of particular individuals to create customized spare body parts? Bush's distinction may appease America's ayatollas, but it doesn't address the real conundrums.
<P>



<p>And how shall US policy be reconciled with that of other nations? The United States is unique among advanced nations in having religious zealots dictate science policy. Britain is creating a general registry of all stem cell research and has no strictures on the source of embryos for this research. Britain offers public funding and makes the products available to other researchers.
<P>



<p>The very globalism that Bush so fervently embraces in other policy areas makes it impossible for American religious conservatives to block this research. But it is indeed possible for the right-to-life lobby, with Bush's collusion, to hamstring American science.  The press, for the most part, has been lazily deferential. Press accounts have taken at face value Bush's claims that he agonized over the ethics of this decision. The press has complimented him in on choosing a politically astute, even a Solomonic middle ground.
<P>



<p>Some editorialists are counseling a wait-and-see posture: Let's see how many of the supposed 60 existing colonies of stem cells (which nobody outside the administration can identify) prove useful; let's see if the prolife concerns are mooted by sources of stem cells in adults (which most scientists consider far more problematic).
<P>



<p>Without quite appreciating it, we are at risk of accepting the premise of the religious right that a few dozen cells in a petri  dish are a human being. Religious zealots have every right to practice their faith - but not to impose it on others. It is a disgrace that this president has made himself and science policy their hostage.
