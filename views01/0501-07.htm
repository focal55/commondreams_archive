The global energy cartel is imperiling the world's environment and
economic stability in a greedy grab for profits that is empowered by a heavy
investment of campaign contributions and corporate connections with media
conglomerates. The energy cartel understands the world's dependency on their
energy commodities such as fossil fuel, natural gas and nuclear.  One of
their top executives,  Dick Cheney, is now Vice-President and the "Czar" for
the energy policy of the United States.   The evil empire of energy has used
OPEC since its inception as a convenient shill to reduce the "supply" and
drum-up the "price" of oil to create an "energy crisis" and an excuse to
charge exorbitant prices for their products.

<p>In the 1970s I worked with a coalition of consumer groups that
brought public awareness to the "energy crisis" rip-off by challenging rate
hike requests and nuclear plant construction permits before the South
Carolina Public Service Commission that regulates the electrical utilities
in our state.  The excuse for raising the price of electricity was the cost
of fossil fuel, natural gas, and nuclear energy and was all blamed on the
short "supply" and  high "price" of  "foreign oil" set by a bunch of Arabs
and Africans in turbans and togas who "ruled" the OPEC nations.  Remember
OPEC causing the gasoline shortage?   When President Jimmy Carter called for
energy conservation and funding research for harnessing renewable energy
sources such as wind, water and the sun, the powerful energy cartel helped
him become a one-term President.

<p>Maybe that's why the Democratic political leadership hasn't
challenged Cheney's proposal to develop new domestic sources of oil, gas and
coal and build new coal-fired and nuclear generating plants.  Cheney
dismissed conservation as "1970s era thinking" that could not get us out of
what he called an "energy crisis".  Cheney favors a government backed push
to drill for oil and gas, including the protected areas of the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge.  Cheney expounds a "supply" oriented energy
philosophy he learned at the Halliburton Corporation, the largest energy
services corporation in the world,  where he was the CEO for 5 years and
holder of 45 million dollars of stock before he became George W. Bush's
Vice-Presidential running mate.   During Cheney's tenure, Halliburton
received federal contracts and taxpayer insured loans totaling $3.8 billion.

<p>In 1998 Halliburton paid $8.1 billion for drilling and oil industry
equipment supplier, Dresser Industries.  Halliburton also owns Landmark
Graphics Corp., suppliers of production information services and systems
that help energy companies find, produce and manage oil and gas reservoirs
and NUMAR Corp. that furnishes nuclear magnetic imaging to measure oil
drilling.  The most notorious Halliburton subsidiary is Kellogg, Brown and
Root that builds offshore oil rigs, drills wells, and builds nuclear
reactors while employing more than 20,000 people in more than 100 countries,
including the OPEC nations.  Brown and Root has been in the heavy
construction business for more than 65 years and was a big U.S. military
contractor in Vietnam and Kosovo with strong world-wide connections to CIA
activities.

<p>As Bush's Presidential campaign set fund-raising records with hefty
contributions from the  energy business, OPEC began to raise the price of
oil and, by the middle of 2000, energy prices  began to affect business
costs and the stock market.   As the stock market nose-dived, energy
companies' profits soared in the first quarter of 2001, with Exxon Mobil's
profits up 44% from a year ago, enabling them to become the world's top
revenue producer at $52.28 billion; Chevron's profits were up 57% for the
first quarter; and Duke Energy's stock was up 12% in 2001 after rising 70%
in value in 2000, partly from selling high priced electricity to "rolling
blackout" stricken California.  From my experience in opposing Duke's rate
hike requests in South Carolina 25 years ago, I can vouch for their ability
to make big bucks from energy.

<p>By pulling out of the Kyoto global warming agreement to limit carbon
dioxide emissions that cause global warming and increasingly volatile
weather conditions and by pushing for domestic oil and gas drilling, the
Bush-Cheney Administration have prioritized energy profits over the global
environment.     Energy's media connections make  it difficult for the
public to get an unbiased picture of the "energy crisis".   General Electric
Corp. owns NBC, CNBC and MSNBC and GE Nuclear Energy, who design nuclear
reactors and already own and operate 91 reactors world-wide.  Conservative
media mogul Rupert Murdoch owns Fox; the nuclear intensive Westinghouse
Corp., until recently, owned CBS.   Such media influence and the fat "energy
crisis" profits the energy companies can invest in campaign contributions
make it even difficult for politicians to oppose the Administration's
energy cartel juggernaut.
