<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->When President-elect George W. Bush announced his final three Cabinet choices: Asian-American Norman Mineta for transportation secretary, Arab-American Spencer Abraham for energy secretary and Latina Linda Chavez as labor secretary, reactions across the country seemed were unanimous. Bush had assembled a real rainbow of Americans.
<P>

   Team Bush includes two black men, an Arab-American man, three white women, one Asian-American man, a Hispanic man and a Hispanic woman.<P>

   The Washington Post called his Cabinet ``a strikingly diverse'' group, noting that of 14 choices, ``six white men in Bush's Cabinet will be in the minority.''<P>

   The Los Angeles Times said Bush's appointees show his ``determination to present an administration that is diverse in race, ethnicity and gender.''<P>

   The New York Times chimed in that Bush's Cabinet is ``every bit as ethnically and racially diverse as President Clinton's.''<P>

   Bush himself declared he wanted Americans ``from every walk of life.''<P>

   Now, excuse me for pointing this out, but isn't what Bush did called affirmative action? Were his choices perhaps even shaped by the dread Q-word: quota?<P>

   ``Walks of life'' must be how they refer to ethnic and racial diversity in Texas. It leaves enough to the conservative imagination so that people who think minorities have too many advantages won't get riled.<P>

   But the popular perception that Bush is practicing some sort of racial and ethnic preference -- before he's even in the White House -- has got to have Linda Chavez, in particular, all tied up in knots. Chavez has built her career as a conservative activist trying to tear down affirmative action in all its various shapes and forms. That includes her long battle against all things bilingual -- such as education, ballots and information on needed government services for immigrants.<P>

   Chavez was even the president of U.S. English, a national organization founded by John Tanton, a Michigan man with ties to the eugenics movement. Much has been made of her resignation in 1988 after a year with U.S. English, when Chavez denounced Tanton's racial views. She claimed she had been previously unaware of them. But in 1986, the group's campaign to pass an English-only law in California stirred a national controversy. Tanton and his ideology were well documented, and if Chavez was unaware of the racist roots of U.S. English, she must have been taking a siesta.<P>

   Chavez is in a bind. Becoming labor secretary would be the pinnacle of her career, and yet she appears to have been chosen, in part, because she claims Hispanic ancestry. Chavez, the foe of affirmative action and ethnic preference, now stands to benefit from that very policy.<P>

   Of course, it wouldn't be the first time Chavez has exploited being Hispanic in order to promote herself and her ideas. She has been the darling of conservatives precisely because her last name is Chavez. There's nothing better than having a Latina bash social programs that benefit Latinos.<P>

   There is only one honorable way out for Linda Chavez, and that's to tell Bush, ``Thanks, but no thanks.'' After all, what's more important? Taking a stand for your principles, or chucking them to become a player in the next administration?
