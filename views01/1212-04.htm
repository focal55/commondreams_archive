It is a serial, a real cliffhanger.  It's a fable.  It's about
cavemen.  Cavemen on horseback and in high-tech command centers.  Stone
Age meets Space Age, isn't that what they say?  Vice President Cheney is
in a bunker in a mountain.  Batman had a Batcave.  Osama bin Laden is
like that, like a bat, but he's also a rat, scurrying into his fortified
hole, leaving droppings, a videotape here and there.  I've already heard
songs about it, Country songs and corridas.  I'm sure there are ballads
in Arabic.  

<p>There will be epic poems, folktales.  There are probably lots of
limericks.  There will be serious plays and ridiculous movies.  It's a
religious lesson.  It's a morality play.  It's a pageant.  It's a
costume drama.  They are the Evil-doers.  We are the Evil un-doers. 
Hooray.  Boo, hiss.

<p>We try to follow the narrative.  We post-moderns know what the old
bards knew--there are many narratives.  Al Qaeda, a band of True
Believers from around the world, gather in Talibanland, and with money
from a dozen or a hundred sources storm the castle and citadel of the
Super Power.  The Twin Towers fall and fall and turn inside-out. 
Tolkien may be too tame for our tastes.  

<p>With $200,000 they caused more than $20,000,000,000 damage and another
$20,000,000,000 in subsequent costs.  How's the ROI, the return on their
investment?  What is the multiplier effect?  They lost 19 men who killed
over 3000.  Most of them were from Saudi Arabia, the dead were from at
least 86 countries.  They are all men, the dead are women as well as
men.  They are all fervent Muslims, the dead are of many faiths and no
faith.  How do we calculate the symmetry and asymmetry, how do we
measure the moral equivalence?        

<p>The fire is still burning in lower Manhattan.  (There is a coal mine in
Pennsylvania that has been burning for 40 years.)  There are fires
burning in the hearts of people everywhere.  There is snow on the
mountains in Afghanistan.  "Into the valley of death rode the six
hundred."  (Tennyson, 1853.)  There is major poetry here.  Death from
the sky.  Avenging angels. 
   
<p>What is the story and the glory?  How will the tale be told?  There are
heroes of different cultures and uniforms, of different worldviews and
accents and time zones.  They meet from the opposite ends of the earth,
from Washington, D.C. and London, at the Khyber Pass, for God's sake,
and on CNN and al-Jazeera.  Strike up the band.  

<p>The fighting is taking place where Alexander the Great, the British
Empire and the Soviet Union gave up and went home.  Now, the Western
allies and the Northern Alliance, the United Front, the United Kingdom
and the United States against Al Qaeda, the warlords of the Pentagon and
the clans of the Stans, the tribes and the bribes, against the
guerrillas, criminals, terrorists, fanatics, brigands, holy warriors
all.  It's a melodrama.  It hurts too much to laugh.

<p>This is great material.  There are more than enough mixed metaphors.
There is too much history.  It is Grand Guignol and Greek chorus.  It is
1492 in reverse, from the fall of the Alhambra to breaching the
Pentagon.  It is 661, with the split between Sunnis and Shi'ites still
reverberating.  It is the Old West and the new West.  Wanted: Dead or
Alive.  Saladin meets Paladin.  $25 million on his head, for his head on
a platter or a spike.  We are told, tellingly, Afghanistan is the size
of Texas.  "Don't Mess With Texas."  This will be a musical soon, even
an opera.  I've always liked "The Desert Song" (1926, then three movie
versions).  But that was a love story.  

<p>"In the next war, the dead will be buried in cellophane," Ernest
Hemingway wrote, in a poem, not his war reporting.  What an
old-fashioned idea.  The dead in New York became dust.  An even older
idea.  

<p>It's El Cid, Lawrence of Arabia, Kipling, the Great Game, Marco Polo,
the Desert Mystics.  Take notes for the mid-term exam.  "Poetry is
emotion recollected in tranquility," wrote Wordsworth.  Meanwhile, bombs
are falling, fires are burning.  Christmas is a-comin' and the geese are
getting fat.  People killing people, what do you think of that?  Peace
on earth as a vaudeville routine.  It's in such bad taste, but that's
the name of the game.  Please, hold your applause.  It's not over yet.
