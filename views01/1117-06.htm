For most people in the United States, the picture of events since 
Sept. 11 has been largely framed by television. When pollsters with 
Princeton Survey Research asked "Where have you gotten most of your news 
about the attacks?" more than a week later, a whopping 87 percent of adults 
gave TV as the answer.

<p>While newscasts are still apt to be disturbing, television is 
mostly back to normal. Some commercials pay respect to patriotic themes, 
and Old Glory continues to get a lot of screen time. But an ultimate 
expression of media normalcy -- the relentless barrage of TV ads -- 
returned to full strength after a mid-September hiatus of several days. The 
one-two punch of mind-numbing commercials and checked-out entertainment has 
never packed more of a wallop than it does now.

<p>Overall, the media disconnect is pretty extreme: Journalists and a 
range of commentators have told us that our world changed profoundly and 
irreversibly on Sept. 11. Yet the vast majority of what's on television is 
in the same old groove.

<p>In our society, the one-track momentum of commercialism has so 
much velocity that even horrific events don't slow it down for very long. 
The corporate-driven locomotives of consumerism keep barreling ahead. Like 
the cloying MasterCard commercial with its endless variations, the messages 
are slyly contradictory: There are precious things that money can't buy. 
So, to fully avail yourself of those precious things, be sure to buy buy buy.

<p>President Bush has stressed that Americans shouldn't fail to shop, 
as if pulling out credit cards is a defiant blow against "the evildoers." 
Thousands of TV commercials go on their merry way, oblivious to dire 
circumstances outside the calculus of huckstering.

<p>The sensuous imagery of a current Jaguar ad includes a man and 
woman kissing as the word "wicked" flickers through sultry jump-cuts. 
Flashing snippets seem to imitate the Orson Wells film "Touch of Evil" -- 
all in the service of selling a high-priced car, marketed for prestige and 
sublimation.

<p>Such commercials are merely business as usual, but at a time of 
extraordinary crisis -- when the yearning for straight talk and human 
connection is especially acute -- the customary TV onslaughts ring more 
hollow than ever. And while advertisers can't stop treating the public like 
gullible children, top government officials can't resist using the rhetoric 
of idealism to paper over the huge gaps between pretension and policy.

<p>The president tells us that the tragic events compel us to engage 
with our deeper values, that we should hug our kids, actively treasure our 
loved ones. On TV news, we see the Pentagon's grainy computerized-video 
abstractions of a far-off war on Afghanistan. Tiny blips and pixels 
represent Afghan individuals who -- with no more links to Osama bin Laden 
than you or I -- hugged their loved ones and watched them die.

<p>This country's fabled "exceptionalism" -- aided by the buffers of 
huge oceans, massive economic clout and military prowess -- has involved 
the wishful belief that to be an American is to be exempt from some basic 
human vulnerabilities. We're encouraged to assume that the United States 
can keep speeding through history without really looking at grim 
consequences for some other people on the planet. But they, too, want to 
hug their children; they too want to provide their loved ones with a safe 
future; they too experience rage that springs from grief and fear.

<p>Particularly in times of crisis, our mass-mediated democracy makes 
us part of a swift marketing loop: The media spin is intense; opinion polls 
gauge its effects; the polling results are grist for further media spin. 
Among the American public, we're told triumphantly, the president's 
favorable ratings -- like the approval numbers for the war -- are very 
high. Television has served the White House well.

<p>To credulously watch TV is to submit to a numbing process. What 
television offers today, perhaps more than ever, is anesthesia in the face 
of apprehension. As a stunned spectator, the body politic is incessantly 
coached as to the implicit limits of sensitivity -- the innocent lives at 
home are clearly precious, the innocent lives in Afghanistan nearly 
worthless. With impressive high-tech visuals, the TV set offers us 
expansive zones of unreality, swaddled in the comforts of commerce, 
hermetic entertainment and propaganda. If we must watch, it's essential 
that we recognize what we're seeing.
