 Timothy McVeigh reportedly believes there are ideas worth killing for.
That's why, in 1995, he ignited a bomb that killed 168 people and injured
hundreds more. The federal government will help him make his point by killing
him.
<P>
   Due to an FBI screw-up, in which the agency withheld many pieces of
evidence from his defense lawyers, McVeigh will not be slain as scheduled on
May 16. But few doubt that he eventually will be sent to meet his maker by the
people's executioner.
<P>

His death will continue the barbaric practice this country resumed in 1976
when it re-instituted the death penalty. The state has killed 712 people in
our name since that time. McVeigh will be the 30th inmate executed this year
and the first federal prisoner in 38 years. The last public execution occurred
in Missouri in 1937, when Roscoe "Red" Jackson was hanged for murder. The
event provoked such a circus atmosphere, it led to the end of public
executions.
<P>
   According to the book "American Terrorist: Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma
City Bombing," McVeigh wreaked his slaughter in an idealistic attempt to
avenge the 80 or so Branch Davidians who died in Waco, Texas, and the two
survivalists who died in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, all at the hands of federal
agents. This belief that some metaphysical scorekeeper is noting deaths on
each side of the moral ledger is magical thinking at it's most primitive. But
the federal government uses precisely the same kind of primitive thinking by
putting him to death.
<P>
   Since capital punishment does not deter crime, insure equal justice or
facilitate domestic tranquility, its sole purpose is to provide a public
expression of vengeance. However, the recognition that justice and vengeance
are often unrelated provides the reason societies must develop judicial
systems.Thus, the idea of capital punishment is subversive to the logic of
criminal justice.
<P>
   Murdering miscreants only makes sense if one subscribes to McVeigh's
magical thinking that it will balance a spiritual scorecard in eternity.
<P>
   For McVeigh and those of his ideological ilk, protecting Americans from
governmental abuse is akin to a spiritual crusade and an idea worth killing
for. Indeed, the bombing sparked a flurry of stories and reports about a
growing militia movement of "angry white men" in camouflage uniforms with
combat on their minds.
<P>
   These men had political as well as religious justifications for their
hatred of the U.S. government, and their grievances had ominous echoes in the
political system. The Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 was one symptom
of what seemed to be growing discontent.
<P>
   McVeigh himself was a Gulf War veteran who became well versed in the
militarized logic of warfare. His use of the term "collateral damage" to
describe the deaths of 19 children who died in the April 19, 1995 blast eerily
echoes the Pentagon's use of that term to dismiss civilians deaths in its
varied bombing campaigns.
<P>
   McVeigh's experience in the U.S. armed forces taught him well that superior
armaments were more important than superior arguments when confronting
America's enemies-- and he considers the federal government a lethal enemy.
<P>
   Another unlearned lesson of the McVeigh case is the way in which the
militarized logic he embodies is seeping into American culture. It is
particularly evident in the criminal justice system, where the escalating
"wars" on drugs and crime are more than just a metaphorical embrace of the
term. Police increasingly are adopting combat-zone strategies to cope with
domestic situations. But that's another problem for another time.
<P>
   McVeigh made his mark by carrying out the most deadly terrorist act in the
nation's history because he believed the abuses of the federal government were
worth killing for. His ideas about governmental abuse were more important to
him than human lives.
<P>
   The state--in our names--also kills for an idea. When death penalty
opponents argue that it is merely a revenge ritual, capital punishers counter
that they are not concerned with revenge, but an expression of society's
highest values. We commit premeditated murder to nurture the notion that
certain behavior is worthy of death.
<P>
   Rather than using McVeigh's murderous behavior to note the pitfalls in the
notion that certain ideas are worthy of murder, the government will deepen the
cycle of violence by confirming the notion.
