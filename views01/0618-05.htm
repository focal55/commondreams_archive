Can the Bush Administration actually get
away with privatizing and cutting the nation's
most successful government program? Social
Security provides support to 45 million people --
nearly one out of six Americans. It keeps half of
the nation's elderly above the poverty line. For
these reasons it was long considered politically
untouchable. Yet we are currently in the midst of
a prolonged campaign to partially privatize the
system and reduce its benefits.

         <p>The outcome will depend quite a bit on
how much the "reformers" -- which include
powerful Wall Street financial interests -- can get
away with lying about Social Security.

         <p>"The threat to the stability of Social
Security has been apparent for decades . . . " said
President Bush last month. "We can postpone
action no longer. Social Security is a challenge
now; if we fail to act, it will become a crisis."

         <p>It so happens that Social Security is
financially in better shape than it has been for
most of its 65-year history, including the 1940s,
50s, 60s, and 70s. But you would never know that
from reading the newspapers.

         <p>The only "threat to the stability of Social
Security" comes from the "President's
Commission to Strengthen Social Security." Who
are they kidding with that name? They fully
intend to slice off a chunk of Social Security's
revenue for private individual accounts, and then
cut benefits to make up for the shortfall. These
guys could make Orwell blush.

         <p>According to the numbers that President
Bush and everyone else in the debate is relying
upon, Social Security will be able to pay all
promised benefits for the next 37 years, without
any changes whatsoever. And there is no "crisis"
involved in extending the program's benefits for
the whole 75-year planning period: the shortfall is
less than three-fourths of one percent of our
national income.

         <p>If it were only President Bush saying these
things about Social Security, they could be
dismissed as merely an effort to promote
privatization. But many journalists share his
confusion on the subject.

         <p>The Washington Post reported in a news
article last week that Social Security "is predicted
to start becoming financially unstable in the
middle of the next decade." Financially unstable?
According the latest Social Security Trustees'
report, in 2015 the program will have income of
$868.5 billion, and expenses of $678.4
billion, giving it an annual surplus of $190.1
billion. The accumulated Trust Fund will have
$3.1 trillion dollars. (These figures are in 2001,
inflation-adjusted dollars).

         <p>Again, none of the members of the
President's Commission would dispute these
numbers. Instead, they try to fool the public and
the press with the equivalent of one half of a
baseball score. As in "the Orioles had a bad game:
they only scored two runs." Without telling you
that the other team didn't score any.

         <p>Take Richard Parsons, Chief Operating
Officer of AOL Time-Warner and co-chair of the
President's Commission. "When you have two
workers for every retired person, it can't work; do
the math," he says, referring to the Trustees'
projections for 30 years from now. Well, the
actuaries at Social Security have done the math,
and it works just fine. The system may eventually
need a bit more revenue, because people will be
living longer. But it will be a very small amount
relative to the nation's future income.

        <p> There is every reason to believe that
people who are living longer, and earning 40 or
50 percent more (adjusted for inflation) than we
do today would be willing to spend an additional
one or two percent of their income, in order to
support a longer retirement. They have always
been willing to do this in the past. But even if they
weren't, there is hardly any reason to be worrying
about it now.

         <p>And very few people would be worried
about Social Security if they had any idea what
the numbers looked like. But most people don't: in
fact, as a result of a highly successful
disinformation campaign, they do not even
believe they will see their promised benefits.
Ironically, if the President's Commission were to
have its way, this could come true.

         <p>In about six and a half years the first baby
boomers will begin to retire, and there will be no
noticeable impact on Social Security or on the
federal budget. Perhaps then it will finally be
obvious that this whole story about Social
Security's financial troubles was nothing more
than an urban legend.
