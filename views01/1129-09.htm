President Bush used a traditional Thanksgiving visit to a soup kitchen -- 
and new holiday TV ads -- to prod Americans last week to "dig a little deeper 
in their pocket" for neighborhood charities left wanting in the rush to aid 
terror victims. 
<p>

"I hope Americans will not substitute the gifts they've given in the 
aftermath of September 11 for neighborhood groups," said George W. 
<p>

There's no question, local charities are in trouble.  Post 9-11, donations 
are down and needs are up and nowhere is the confluence of crises worse than 
in New York. 
<p>

The city's largest food bank, Food for Survival, took a survey of the soup 
kitchens it serves in the days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and 
found that 64 percent of the people receiving free food in New York were 
taking donations for the first time. "Most of these first-time clients were 
single mothers who needed emergency food because they had lost their jobs in 
the attack," Lucy Cabrera, the president of the food bank, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/21/nyregion/21PANT.html?" TARGET="NEW">told the New York 
Times</a>.
<p>

In the aftermath of the attacks, New York has -- officially -- lost over 
100,000 jobs, and with them, nearly that many health benefits. The city's 
jobseekers join a national line on which some eight million Americans stand 
right now, and that's just those that have been officially counted. 
<p>

But it was bleak around here before any terrorist attacked, unless you call the shredding of the social safety net an act of terror. 
<p>

Before Sept. 11, more than 1.5 million New Yorkers, including 510,000 
children, already relied on soup kitchens, food pantries and shelters to 
avoid going hungry. That story ran briefly, in the papers, back in August.
<p>

Mayor Giuliani is proud of having "shrunk" the welfare rolls by half. The 
City Bar Association, in its August report, noted that public assistance 
rolls dropped about 45 percent from where they stood in 1995, to 497,113 last 
July. During the same time, the number of people who in the course of a year 
obtained at least some emergency food relief tripled. 1.5 million equals one 
out of every five of us in New York.  The number of homeless New Yorkers 
using the shelter system hit 29,000 -- an all-time high --- <i>before</i> September 
11.
<p>

Bush tells Americans not to "substitute" their giving. We're to dig a little 
deeper to help our neighborhoods in need. But without debate, there was 
federal money for carpet-bombing and bunker-busting, dollars for daisy 
cutters and aircraft carriers, cash for deployment of special forces and Marines -- some 1,000 new ground troops were deployed in Afghanistan just this week.
<p>

The administration tells us we'll be paying something in the region of $1 
billion a month for their logo-rich War on Terrorism. 
<p>

That doesn't count the cost of rounding up those who may have committed the 
crimes. Racial profiling is expensive, especially when local police forces 
won't do the work. We'll have to pay the feds to throw the dragnet. Then 
there are those military tribunals -- there may be some cost cutting on 
defense attorneys, juries and  appeals, but  "intelligence" never comes 
cheap, no matter how poor the return. Almost all we know about the CIA's 
secret "black budget" is that it never runs into the red. 
<p>

The President's War on Terrorism doesn't depend on private charity. Our 
pockets are picked to pay for that war. But how about the terror of hunger? 
We the people could do with a war on that. Call it the people's war against 
poverty. In that war, we'd have the money we need to combat hunger and 
homelessness. Let the Pentagon hold a bake sale.
