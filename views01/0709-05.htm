There he was at Wimbledon on Saturday, doing the rain-interrupted cabaret familiarly reserved for Cliff Richard: William Jefferson Clinton, the smirk that won't wash off. He could have asked why - in an era of national missile defense shields - this snotty, tinhorn shambles of an event can't even build a roof over the Center Court, but he let it pass. He is, and will always be, a master politician. Both Tony Blair and America are missing him terribly. 
<P>Watch the numbers. When George Bush became president, his approval ratings nestled comfortably over the 60% mark (much where Clinton's were when he left). But Bush has been sliding ever since, far into the lower 50s. Any moment now, he'll be in the 40s - and the pending chat with our prime minister over NMD will become even more vexed. One term, Mr President? Are you the next one reserving your chair in the royal box alongside Princess Michael of Kent?  
<P>Well, of course (as Bill Clinton would say) what goes down can also go up. He did, after a couple of shaky years. But that was because he got a grip. The looming question for George W is whether he has any grip to get. Where was he this weekend? Up in Kennebunkport with a dad who knows all about single terms.  
<P>It is instructive to see what (apart from the economy) is going wrong. First, what you were promised isn't what you've been getting. The mood music of the campaign was all about "compassionate conservatism", a touchy-feely centrism made more necessary by the closeness of the result. But there's been none of that in the seven months since. He's delivered a whopping tax cut (which the voters didn't particularly want). He has failed to deliver on health, education, energy and the environment (which the voters do want). He has become, with a few clumsy strokes, the president of the rightwing minority - and lost control of the Senate in the process.  
<P>Second, what you see is also what you get. As Bob Herbert wrote in the New York Times the other day: "He comes across as so detached, so removed from the major issues of the day, so uninterested in them, that he's in danger of coming to be seen as president in name only." Thus the real alarm over Dick Cheney's dicky ticker and the malign gags when the vice-president declares that: "It's something you live with." Could he be replaced? Naturally. No one is indispensable. But there's a nasty public perception that he couldn't be replaced by a president moving into higher, hands-on gear.  
<P>George W isn't a fool. Write him down too much and you exalt the mere competence of any subsequent recovery. Yet there's no sense so far, in anything said or done, that he could actually take charge as Bill Clinton took charge. His grasp of detail is Reagan vestigial. He peddles too much charm with too little substance. He is already in danger of looking a bit of an   ass on the world stage. Last month's meetings with Putin especially were too full of hail-fellow-well-met (and swiftly undermined by what Moscow said next).  
<P>So to Tony Blair's dilemma, which grows no easier by the minute as the Greenpeace hordes storm Menwith Hill and storm clouds gather over Fylingdales and his own backbenches. Helping George with national missile defense can be presented as a clear choice of principle. Are we a "bridgehead" to the States? Do we always play the special friend in our own special interests?  
<P>Mr Blair, writhing along, seems prepared to make that case. But what - awful thought - if it's all redundant? What if, like so much about this new administration, it fails to happen? Only last month, William Hague was taunting the PM for not signing instantly on the NMD bottom line. Whatever happened to him? Why go out and make a redundant gesture, hitching your wagon to a loser? Donald Rumsfeld hasn't even finished his strategic review of US defense policy yet and his $32.8bn increase is hanging out to dry on Capitol Hill. The Pentagon's management systems (as the defense secretary admits) are sclerotic and chaotic.  
<P>The first steps to missile defense by 2004 aren't steady, measured ones. They are deeply uncertain. The Democrats, growing ever more bullish about next year's mid-term elections, have also grown ever more skeptical about NMD on present terms. That is why George W needs the compliance of his "partners" so anxiously. Not to cement a deal already in place, but to put pressure on Congress to pass something these partners allegedly want. We are, already, a long, long way from the swaggering and blustering of January. We're back in the real world.  
<P>There has been, perhaps, too much made of our re-elected government's dodgy start. Mange on the swollen backbenches isn't a fatal condition. Lord Hattersley (may heaven defend him) is an unlikely Robespierre. The BMA is stupidly set to become the Majorca coach drivers of 2002 (with, on examination, rather less to complain about on pay, hours and conditions than the Balearics' finest). Mr John Edmonds hasn't sent a check to Charlie Kennedy yet. While the Tories are a political vacuum, we must expect other dark, overblown forces to seek to fill it - at least until MPs push off for the hols.  
<P>Nevertheless, there is already a premium against canceling your last announcement. Brown and Blair nuancing on about euro referendums are misty accidents waiting at every bend. Blair has got his Calvin Klein's in a public/private twist. The appearance of blank incoherence (an appearance that sticks) is never far away. Who needs an endless witter about NMD on top?  
<P>There are many ways of looking at the dream of missile defense As a pump primer for US defense giants. As a reward for campaign donations past. As a necessary, far-seeing response to safety in a multipolar globe. As, suitably negotiated, the imposer of security against terrorist threat. As futile as the next suitcase rolling off the belt at John F Kennedy airport. It isn't necessary for Mr Blair to reconcile such dreams now. What is necessary is that he shows some political judgment.  
<P>Bill Clinton, letting a mini-version wither on its own technical incapacity, exercised non-heroic judgment. This was a project going nowhere with Gore. Mr Blair should take the hint. British interests ( his  interests) can't get stuck in the mud at the bottom of Menwith Hill. Let him set the terms and conditions, including full Russian backing - just like Gordon's five sacred tests. Let Jack Straw, not Downing Street, become the custodian of them. Let time, the great sweeper, roll on four years, when he will still be in charge, but George W may be sharing his strawbs with Princess Michael. Tie-break, anyone?
