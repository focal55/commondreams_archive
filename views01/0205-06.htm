The recent recall of one million pounds of E. coli-contaminated ground beef
and 16.7 million pounds of chicken and turkey products has generated an
industry-sponsored chant for meat irradiation in the Middle west. But
irradiation is a deal
with the devil. The fact that nothing is known about a childhood or
long-term diet of irradiated food makes the practice tantamount to human
experimentation. With scores of people made sick locally, industrialists who
stand to make millions from irradiation are turning concern for the victims
of bad meat into a rush for profits.

<p>Irradiation will not eliminate E. coli from the meat supply or halt the
spread of food-borne disease, since E. coli is often introduced locally --
after irradiation. This is because local supermarkets regularly mix their
meat scraps with ground beef from meat packers. The meat industry can use
cheaper, conventional methods of killing pathogens such as better hygiene,
safe chemical rinses, hot water and steam vacuums. Steam pasteurization at
185 degrees eliminates E. coli and is the normal practice at most meat
packers.

<p>In approving irradiation, the FDA reviewed 441 short-term toxicity studies.
Dr. Marcia van Gemert, who was in charge of the review, testified that all
441 reports were flawed. In fact the FDA now says only six were "properly
conducted, fully adequate by 1980 standards, and able to stand alone in
support of safety."(1)  One of the six showed a statistically significant
increase in stillbirths among rats fed irradiated wheat.(2)  The study used
irradiation levels well below those proposed for human food. Public Citizen,
the consumer group in Washington, concludes in an Oct. 2000 report that "the
FDA legalized -- and continues to legalize -- food irradiation without
testing it for safety."(3)

<p>Today's irradiators, using radioactive cesium or cobalt or electron beam
linear accelerators, expose food to the equivalent of between 30 million and
150 million chest X-rays. Some of the foods now approved for irradiation are
beef, pork, poultry, nuts, potatoes, wheat, wheat flour, fruits and
vegetables, tea and 60 dried herbs and spices.

<p>As if irradiation doesn't have a past, its proponents say, "It's safe ...
with no reported cases of harm to humans or test animals."(4)  This is not
true, as the FDA's own rat studies prove. Indeed, irradiation has already
had it own Three Mile Island.

<p>Outside Atlanta, Georgia, Radiation Sterilizers, Inc. (RSI) got 252
canisters of cesium-137 from the Energy Dept. and in 1988 began irradiating
spices. Within two years, a capsule began leaking cesium into RSI's storage
pool. While workers took the carcinogen home on contaminated clothing, it
took federal officials six months to find the leak's source. In 1992, the
contaminated building was abandoned.(5)

<p>Any widespread use of cesium-137 and cobalt-60 will further compound deadly
radioactive contamination with inevitable accidents along highways and
railways, inside irradiation facilities and in surrounding communities.

<p>The origin of cobalt-60 and cesium-137 is rarely mentioned in glowing
reports of irradiation's benefits: they are radioactive wastes left in huge
quantities from nuclear weapons programs. Cesium-137 is extremely hazardous,
deadly for 300 years, water-soluble and very expensive to store. The FDA's
Jim Greene said in 1986 that using cesium-137 for irradiation, "could
substantially reduce the cost of disposing of nuclear waste."(6)  In 1983
the Energy Dept. told the House Armed Services Committee, "The utilization
of these radioactive materials simply reduces our waste handling problem .
we get some of these very hot elements like cesium and strontium out of the
waste."(7)
<p>The FDA says irradiation doesn't change food's nutritional content, but it
destroys vitamins A, B, B-12, C, E, and K, and it creates new chemicals in
meat known as "radiolytic products," some of which are known carcinogens  --
like benzene and formaldehyde. Dozens of  "unique radiolytic products" or
URPs are completely unknown and as such haven't been identified or tested
for toxicity. The government granted these irradiation-induced chemicals a
blanket exemption from safety testing -- deciding that they didn't qualify
as "food additives."

<p>While industry claims that irradiation doesn't change the flavor or aroma
of meat, taste testers disagree. New York Times food writer Marian Burrows
found, "In a side-by-side test, all the irradiated meat smelled funny,
especially the ground beef. A slight barnyard odor escaped from the package.
like steamed cow."(8)

<p>At a Nov. 27 meeting of the Sauk Rapids, MN City Council, officials from
Huisken Meats of Chandler, MN and Titan Corp. of San Diego were on hand to
counter public opposition to their plan for a meat irradiator across from
the local high school. Opponents warned that irradiation can't eliminate E.
coli and pointed to the shortage and weakness of safety studies, but the
Council approved industrial bonding for the project.

<p>Titan's "SureBeam" electron linear accelerator (e-beam) irradiator was
described as "safe and effective." But e-beams cause the same food safety
problems as cesium and cobalt -- the loss of vitamins, nutrients, and the
introduction of radiolytic products and carcinogens. Furthermore, e-beams --
unlike the cesium-137 irradiators -- cause activation of trace minerals in
the meat, contaminating the meat with radioactivity. Even the
pro-irradiation Council for Agriculture, Science and Technology (CAST)
acknowledges this Achilles heel of e-beams. CAST says in its food
irradiation report, "The increased . risk of cancer from the induced
radioactivity caused by treating meat with accelerated electrons thus is
negligible."(9)  Are you reassured?
For Better Sales, Hide the Label

<p>Labels are required on bulk packages of irradiated food, but consumers are
wary, and poor test-market sales have kept irradiated food out of most
stores. Enter industry pressure, which moved Congress to minimize the label
requirement -- from a prominent "Treated With Radiation" warning on the
front, to a tiny ingredient list-size notice on the back. However, no
labeling of irradiated ingredients is required, so canned soup made with
irradiated potatoes, onions and spices need not be so labeled. Likewise,
food caterers, hospitals, schools, restaurants, retirement homes and
childcare centers are not required to inform their clients that foods they
serve were irradiated.(10)

<p>Stamps of approval from the FDA and USDA shouldn't ease healthy pubic
skepticism -- not after 80 deaths were attributed to Propulsid, and another
63 to Rzulin -- both FDA approved, then banned. Consumers will be better off
demanding tougher regulation of meat packers and handlers, rather than
submitting to the nuclear industry's latest radiation experiment.
