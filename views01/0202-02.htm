PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil -- The question, from a participant here at 
the World Social Forum, was polite and understated: "Sometimes, one wonders 
if the poor political consciousness and the lack of information about the 
world of the standard American is not one of the problems of the world 
today. Do you think we all could help in some way to get Americans more 
aware of the rest of the world?"

         <p>The question -- directed at me because I'd just given a speech -- 
hung in the air while my brain fumbled for a fitting response. Programming 
decisions by U.S. media executives loom large at home and abroad. A hundred 
years ago, when Queen Victoria died, the sun never set on the British 
empire. Today, around the world, the market shares are shimmering for AOL 
Time Warner, the Walt Disney Co. and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

         <p>When I tuned into CNN International in this city on Brazil's 
southern coast, a report about fashion was explaining that "today's 
revolutionary woman" prefers to wear chiffon. More Spanish-speaking people 
on the planet get their news from one website -- CNNenEspanol.com -- than 
from anywhere else on the Web. Editors in Atlanta and Washington, employed 
by a subsidiary of AOL Time Warner, are deciding what news and views will 
reach huge numbers of readers online.

         <p>Corporate media globalization is part of what's come to be known 
as "neo-liberalism" -- worldwide policies giving top priority to 
corporations and their quest for maximum profits. As part of the movement 
to challenge neo-liberalism, about 4,700 delegates and 10,000 other people 
from 122 countries participated in the first-ever World Social Forum to 
share information and develop strategies.

         <p>Key concerns of the global South -- where extreme poverty and 
rampant inequities are ever-present -- came through loud and clear here in 
Porto Alegre. The men and women crowding into overflow sessions included 
1,700 journalists. But in the United States, even the most avid news 
consumers didn't learn much about this auspicious convergence.

         <p>Don't blame the wire services. For a week, some of the world's 
biggest -- including the Associated Press -- produced a steady stream of 
informative news reports from Porto Alegre. But the day after the World 
Social Forum adjourned, when I did a search of the comprehensive Nexis 
database, it was clear that the event didn't make the U.S. media cut.

         <p>The Washington Post did better than most American outlets, but it 
wasn't much -- a single news story on Jan. 27. The Los Angeles Times didn't 
mention the World Social Forum at all. Neither did USA Today.

         <p>During the week, the country's "paper of record" -- the New York 
Times -- published only one paragraph on the subject, rendered in McPaper 
roundup style. "BRAZIL: ORDERED OUT -- The French farm workers' leader Jose 
Bove, best known for vandalizing McDonald's restaurants to protest 
globalization, has been detained by the federal police and ordered to leave 
Brazil. The action came after Mr. Bove, at a forum in Porto Alegre held to 
counter a world leaders' meeting in Davos, Switzerland, joined Brazilian 
farmers in attacking a farm owned by the Monsanto Corporation, which grows 
genetically modified soybeans."

        <p>Readily available AP stories had offered much more context for the 
Bove incident. For instance: "Bove and about 1,300 farmers destroyed five 
acres of soybeans at the Monsanto farm near Porto Alegre last Friday, 
saying the beans were genetically engineered. At the Forum's closing rally, 
Bove urged the Landless Workers' Movement to reoccupy the farm and turn it 
into an environmentally friendly operation." At that rally, thousands of 
people chanted: "Bove is my friend, touch him and you touch me."

         <p>Landless workers of Brazil and a leader of French farmers joined 
together to fight for redistribution of land, social justice and 
environmental protection. It was a dramatic alliance -- just one of many 
that flowered at a highly disciplined and creative international conference 
of activists from all over the world. There were hundreds of other highly 
significant stories to be told from the World Social Forum. Most U.S. news 
outlets didn't tell even one.

        <p>National Public Radio did send a correspondent to Porto Alegre, 
and a pair of his reports aired. On "Morning Edition," NPR correspondent 
Martin Kaste provided a rather upbeat definition of "neo-liberalism," 
describing it as "the American-inspired philosophy that smaller government 
is better."

         <p>NPR's final report from Porto Alegre mentioned a proposed policy 
step toward reducing the world's extreme economic disparities. But in that 
"All Things Considered" piece, the subject came up not to be explored but 
to serve as a setup for a cutesy -- and disparaging -- tag line.

         <p>"One of the most talked-about plans is a worldwide tax on 
international financial transactions, something that defenders say could 
raise money for developing countries while at the same time making it 
harder to move funds across borders," the news report said. "Even this 
concept, however, is not embraced by everyone. At the start of the 
conference, an anti-globalization delegate from Holland was seen loudly 
cursing the Brazilian cash machines for not accepting her Dutch ATM card. 
Martin Kaste, NPR News, Porto Alegre, Brazil."

         <p>From North America, it's difficult to get a clear look at the 
global South -- and at the pro-democracy movement against corporate rule -- 
with nose pointed high in the air.
