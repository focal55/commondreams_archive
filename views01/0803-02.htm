Vieques proves the old adage that the military always prepares for the next war
by re-running the last war.
<P>
    What else could explain the U.S. Navy's insistence on rehearsing for
amphibious assaults on the island - whose inhabitants voted Sunday for an
immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces - in exactly the same way famous battles
were won in the Pacific during World War II? The sands of Iwo Jima ran red with
the blood of heroic Marines storming ashore, but that certainly is not the way
conflicts will be fought in the foreseeable future.
<P>
    Proof of that was evident during Desert Storm in 1991. With enormous naval
superiority in the Persian Gulf and major amphibious assault forces in position
to invade Kuwait, not one Marine went ashore in the face of Iraqi defenses.
<P>
Why? Because casualties would have been unacceptably high. Modern defensive
weaponry is capable of inflicting intolerable damage on lightly armored
amphibious warships and slow-moving waves of assault craft; and the U.S. Navy
lacks the sustained firepower today needed to suppress defending fire. In the
Pacific campaign, the Navy employed 17 battleships plus countless cruisers and
destroyers to pound defending forces for days with heavy-caliber guns before an
assault began. There is not one heavy-caliber gun in service today.
<P>
    Furthermore, more than 40 carriers were available to provide air support
before and during the assaults, and today there are only 12 carriers and 11 air
wings. In short, the Navy-Marine Corps team lacks the means to overpower
defenders, and frontal amphibious assaults are no longer feasible against
modern weapons.
<P>
    This is why Vieques is no longer required for fleet readiness. The Navy
should leave Vieques now - instead of waiting for the 2003 withdrawal date set
by President George W. Bush.
<P>
    The military should always practice operating in the same manner it intends
to fight. Now, it is neither equipped nor planning to fight across heavily
defended beaches.
<P>
    This is the reason that the Marine Corps has waged a desperate battle to
acquire the V-22 Osprey aircraft. Recognizing that its historic amphibious
assault mission (which distinguishes it from the Army) is in jeopardy, the
Marine Corps considers the V-22 necessary to restore the perception that such
assaults are still feasible by avoiding enemy defenses.
<P>
    In principle, the Osprey would give Marines the capability to fly around
beach-area defenses and envelop the objective area with air- landed troops who
would then move overland to engage enemy forces. Whether this proves feasible
in the face of costly safety problems and program delays, it does demonstrate
that the Corps recognizes the need to abandon the World War II tactics that are
still being employed on the beaches of Vieques.
<P>
    As for the necessary training of pilots in the delivery of ordnance, there
is no shortage of facilities in the United States. Much better bombing ranges
than Vieques abound in California, Nevada, Idaho, Arizona, Texas and Florida as
well as overseas. These ranges permit live fire and close air-support training
far more extensive than that available at Vieques, and in many cases
instrumentation provides precise assessment of pilot performance and precision.
<P>
    In purely military terms, there is no requirement for continued access to
Vieques as a bombardment area. After being subjected for 60 years to abuse and
sacrifice that no community in the United States would have accepted, it is
truly time to achieve peace for Vieques.
