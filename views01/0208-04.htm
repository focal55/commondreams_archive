For his critics, Ariel Sharon's electoral victory in Israel spells defeat
for Middle Eastern peace. For his supporters, however, only a tough,
right-wing politician with military credentials can deliver a lasting deal.
<P>
   Yet whatever steps Sharon takes vis-a-vis the Palestinians, he will be
dogged by persistent allegations of past involvement in crimes of war. In a
world where notions of international justice loom increasingly large, Sharon's
record may prove acutely embarrassing for Israel.
<P>

At issue are at least three incidents in Sharon's past. The first took
place in 1953, when a force under his command raided Qibya, a West Bank
village, killing more than 60 inhabitants. A contemporaneous Time magazine
report said Sharon's soldiers shot "every man, woman and child they could
find" and then dynamited 42 houses, a school and a mosque. "The cries of the
dying," the magazine reported, "could be heard amidst the explosions."
<P>
   Sharon's autobiography acknowledges civilians were killed at Qibya, but
says they were a mistake. Given the evidentiary record, however, his
explanation seems weak.
<P>
   Under international law, Sharon could be indicted for crimes against
humanity.
<P>
   The second incident took place during Israel's 1982 thrust into Lebanon,
when Sharon was defense minister. For three months Israeli forces laid siege
to West Beirut, where Palestinian guerrillas had dug in amid civilians. At the
time, The Washington Post wrote that Sharon's army subjected the city to
"punishment so intense and indiscriminate that terror was the result."
<P>
   By Aug. 16, 1982, the International Herald Tribune wrote, Beirut had become
a city of "broken concrete, flattened apartment buildings and death," and
Israeli journalists offer evidence of Sharon's direct responsibility. Zeev
Schiff and Ehud Yaari wrote that in June 1982, Sharon told officers that
Palestinian neighborhoods in Beirut should be "utterly destroyed," even though
they contained some 85,000 civilians. "Not a single terrorist neighborhood
should be left standing," Sharon reportedly said.
<P>
   The guerrillas violated international law by sheltering in a city, but the
Geneva Conventions also ban the indiscriminate and disproportionate shelling
of populated areas.
<P>
   Fifteen years later, a war crimes tribunal indicted Bosnian Serb leaders
for a similar assault on Sarajevo, even though Bosnian Muslim soldiers were
stationed throughout the city.
<P>
   The third case--the famed massacres at Sabra and Shatila--occurred on Sept.
16-18, 1982, toward the end of the battle for Beirut. The Falangists, an
Israeli-allied Lebanese militia, were ordered by Sharon to mop up armed
resistance in Palestinian refugee camps as Israeli forces stood guard.
<P>
   Israeli reports say Falangist gunmen killed 700 to 800 civilians, but other
sources estimate 2,000 dead. The New York Times' Thomas Friedman said he saw
"groups of young men in their 20s and 30s who had been lined up against walls,
tied by their hands and feet, and then mowed down gangland-style." Women,
children and the elderly were also among those slain in the 62-hour assault.
<P>
   Although Sharon denied responsibility, an Israeli commission of inquiry
ruled in February 1983 that he bore "indirect responsibility" for the
massacres, harshly castigating him for his role. In 1985, a U.S. Military Law
Review analysis argued that Sharon had "command responsibility" for the
killings. In 1999, former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic was indicted by
the Yugoslav war tribunal under a similar clause for Serbia's Kosovo crimes.
<P>
   During the Cold War, men such as Sharon had little to fear from
international legal prosecution. The Geneva Conventions obliged countries to
pursue war criminals, but few countries cared.
<P>
   Recently, however, activists have dramatically changed international legal
practice. Chile's ex-president was indicted in Spain, Chad's ex-ruler was
arrested in Senegal and Congo's foreign minister was charged by Belgian
authorities. In addition, special tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda have
proved increasingly able to catch, try and imprison war criminals.
<P>
   Sharon's electoral victory thus coincides with a global sea change in legal
standards. Whether Sharon really wants peace, his reputation, as well as that
of the nation that elected him, will be consistently undermined by his past.
While waging Israel's wars, Sharon has amassed a record too awful to ignore.
