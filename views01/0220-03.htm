            It may be legal, but it's still a coup d'etat. The nomination of Theodore 
            B. Olson to be solicitor general, a position of such influence that 
            it is often referred to as "the 10th member of the Supreme Court," 
            affirms that President Bush has turned the U.S. judiciary over to 
            the far right. 
            <p>We can't say we weren't warned when Bush, during the campaign, 
              named Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia as his role models for 
              future judicial appointments. They returned the compliment by obediently 
              bowing to the arguments of Bush's lawyer, Olson, that abruptly stopped 
              the vote counting in Florida, thus handing the election to Bush. 
            <p>Once in office, Bush quickly appointed three of Thomas' closest 
              personal and ideological buddies to head the judicial branch of 
              the U.S. government. Newly minted Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft made 
              that point when he rushed off to Thomas' chambers to be sworn in 
              out of the public eye. Then came the appointment of Larry Thompson, 
              who had defended Thomas in his stormy confirmation hearings, as 
              deputy attorney general. Then the piece de resistance: Olson. 
            <p>While newspaper editorials praised the Bush administration for 
              its moderate style, the often mute Thomas emerged from the shadows 
              to celebrate the far right's triumph. At a conservative dinner soiree, 
              Thomas issued a militant call to arms decrying "an overemphasis 
              on civility." Indeed, instead of being civil to those with whom 
              he disagrees, we had the unseemly spectacle of a Supreme Court justice 
              calling for ideological war: "The war in which we are engaged is 
              cultural, not civil." He chided moderates in his own party saying 
              he was "deeply concerned because too many [conservatives] show timidity 
              today precisely when courage is demanded." 
            <p>Surely he wasn't referring to the president, who has given the 
              GOP right wing the prize it really wanted: control of the judiciary. 
              Clearly, the intention is to use the powers of the state to pursue 
              the right's social agenda while virtually dismantling the federal 
              government as a force for social justice. 
            <p>The choice of Olson as solicitor general seals the right wing's 
              seizure of power. But it could not have happened without the denigration 
              of the Clinton administration and its threat to marginalize the 
              right by moving politics back to the center. Key to the effort to 
              destroy Clinton was this same Olson, who will now represent the 
              U.S. government in cases involving affirmative action, the environment 
              and women's rights. Guess what side of those issues Olson has represented 
              in the past?Olson, a member of the board of directors and legal 
              counsel for the extreme right American Spectator magazine, was a 
              principal figure in smearing Clinton even before the man was elected 
              to his first term. The magazine used $2.4 million provided by far-right 
              billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife to dig up dirt on Clinton in what 
              started as Troopergate and ended up propelling the Paula Jones case 
              to the status of an impeachable offense. It was this same Olson, 
              a close friend of Kenneth Starr, who coached Jones' attorneys before 
              their successful request to the Supreme Court to allow a civil suit 
              to be heard against a sitting president. 
            <p>Olson is one of those family values conservatives who evidently 
              believes that only wealthy women like his lawyer-talk show pundit 
              third wife should work. He argued unsuccessfully before the Supreme 
              Court against a California law that protected the jobs of women 
              who took four months of unpaid disability leave for pregnancy, terming 
              it "destructive to women." 
            <p>Olson had another major failure when in 1996 he argued against 
              women being admitted to the publicly financed all-male Virginia 
              Military Institute on the grounds that the school's character would 
              be fundamentally altered. To which Justice Stephen Breyer tartly 
              replied, "So what?" 
            <p>One of Olson's unsavory victories came when he got a federal appeals 
              court to rule that the affirmative action program for admissions 
              at the University of Texas was unconstitutional. An opponent of 
              environmental protection, Olson has gone to court to get sections 
              of the Endangered Species Act declared unconstitutional. 
            <p>Now Olson and the other friends of Thomas are in a position to 
              weigh in heavily on future nominations to the court, and their own 
              names will surely head the list. These are lawyers who have devoted 
              not only their professional lives but their personal political activity 
              to reshaping the court as an activist vehicle to turn back the clock 
              on the rights of women, minorities and working people as well as 
              to leave the environment open to corporate exploitation. 
            <p>By selecting this triumvirate to head the Justice Department, Bush 
              has sent the strongest of signals as to his intent to use the court 
              to advance the far right's agenda. So much for moderation.
