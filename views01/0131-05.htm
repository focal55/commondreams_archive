BELGRADE — Already in Serbia the effects of NATO’s depleted uranium munitions
are apparently being felt by members of the Yugoslav Army who fought in
Kosovo. Two former soldiers were recently discovered to have cancerous eye
tumors. The Belgrade weekly tabloid Nedeljni Telegraf recently reported that
three officers from the Army’s Pristina Corps died of leukemia, while 10
others now suffer from the disease; four of them terminally. They join the
dozens of soldiers involved with the wars in the Balkans now sick from what
is being referred to as “Balkans Syndrome.”

<p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t until soldiers from Western countries began dying
of cancer and getting sick that depleted uranium in the Balkans became an
international issue for the corporate media. A fact not lost on people here.

<p>“The West wouldn’t give a damn if their troops weren’t getting sick and
dying,” says 53 year-old taxi driver Nenad Bulatovic. “If we get sick, that’
s collateral damage. We call that America’s Milosevic Syndrome.”

<p>While leading scientists and environmentalists in Serbia are indeed
concerned about the effects of DU munitions, they say it is just the tip of
the toxic iceberg. “Depleted uranium is just one page in a very thick book
of the ecological and health catastrophe caused by the NATO bombing,” says
Vukasin Pavlovic, Director of the Belgrade-based ECOCenter.

<p>Pavlovic’s group has just issued a ground-breaking report titled
“Environmental Impacts of the NATO War in Yugoslavia.” Though the report
does deal with the question of depleted uranium, it seeks to sound alarm
bells about the lesser-publicized effects of NATO’s targeting of
petrochemical factories, oil refineries and chemical plants during the 1999
bombing.

<p>"War-induced negative effects cannot be viewed as collateral damage, because
they are not induced by unintentional targeting, but by the deliberate and
planned destruction of industrial and other environmentally hazardous
systems,” the report states.

<p>During the bombing it became domestic wisdom not to eat fish from the Danube
River because of concerns the NATO bombardment had contaminated the
international waterway.

<p>Their fears are certainly not unfounded.

<p>One of the stunning revelations in the report is the sheer quantity of
toxins released into the Danube, the source of drinking water for 10 million
Europeans. The report highlights NATO’s April 14-15th strikes on the
Petrochemical Industrial Complex in Pancevo, which lies on the banks of the
Danube, 10 miles outside of Belgrade. Within moments of the bombings, a
devastating toxic cocktail poured into the river. This included some 3,000
tons of alkalis, 1,400 tons of vinyl-chloride monomers (VCMs), 1,000 tons of
ethylene dichloride and 800 tons of 33% hydrochloric acid, according to the
report. Attacks on the plant also resulted in an estimated 20 tons of highly
carcinogenic VCMs entering the atmosphere. In 78 days of attacks, the
petrochemical plant was bombed 9 times.

<p>“NATO didn’t use chemical weapons during the bombing,” says Dr. Zorka
Vukmirovic, a leading environmental physicist and one of the authors of the
report. “But indirectly it caused the effects of chemical weapons use. If
you release so many hazardous substances, major air pollutants and
carcinogens in the vicinity of big cities like Belgrade and Nis, it is
obviously a deliberate action against the civilian population.”

<p>But NATO’s attacks on the Pancevo petrochemical plant are not limited to
Serbia. Environmental groups and environment ministries from throughout the
Balkans have discovered contamination of the Danube in several other
countries. There are also studies from Greek environmentalists that the
bombing caused increased pollution levels in the air over the northern Greek
city of Xanthi.

<p>The ECOCenter’s report also raises particular concern over the repeated
attacks on an oil refinery situated in a populated area in Serbia’s second
largest city Novi Sad. The report estimates that over the course of 12 NATO
attacks on the refinery, some 80,000 tons of crude oil were incinerated,
exposing the city’s residents to a high concentration of hazardous,
carcinogenic and toxic substances multiple times during the bombing.

<p>“These compounds have a high cancer risk, particularly when inhaled,” writes
Professor Pavlovic. “Their deposition in the environment also jeopardizes
other environmental media, particularly food storages and grain silos.”

<p>“The people of Novi Sad are and will continue to be victims of the NATO
bombing,” says Dr. Vukmirovic.

<p>The report estimates that up to 50% of the sites targeted by NATO warplanes
were “industrial and other hazardous objects with high environmental risks.”
Professor Pavlovic is now calling for modification of international war law
conventions and standards. “Crimes against nature and its ecosystems must be
added to the list of war crimes,” he says. “International war law should
confirm that ecocide, equal to genocide, is the most harmful and most
dangerous form of destruction of nature.”

<p>The environmental destruction wrought by NATO’s attacks continues to pierce
through everyday life in Serbia. Dr. Vukmirovic says she doesn’t drink the
milk from a leading dairy farm near Pancevo for fear of contamination, “I
only buy milk from Subotica (in the north of Serbia),” she says. Professor
Pavlovic admits, “I love fish soup, but all of the scientists I know who are
monitoring the Danube tell me not to eat it, so I just go without.”

<p>These sentiments are echoed at Green Markets around Belgrade where people
make it a practice of asking merchants where their food is from. “We know
they lie sometimes if they have goods from an area heavily hit by NATO,”
says Mirjana, a mother of 2. “It just makes me feel better to ask.”

<p>There are also fears in the agricultural sector here that goods exported
from Serbia will eventually require labels with warnings about their safety.

<p>Though the discussion of depleted uranium is certainly not new in Serbia,
the current publicity makes it difficult to go anywhere without encountering
a discussion or mention of DU. “Carla Del Ponte should take her depleted
uranium out of this country before she takes Milosevic,” a 70-something
pensioner said outside the press conference of the Chief War Crimes
Prosecutor when she was in Belgrade last week (He was not allowed in to the
press conference).

<p>In Kosovo, NATO has identified some 112 sites where it acknowledges using
depleted uranium munitions. But NATO has not given the government in
Belgrade a comprehensive list for the rest of Serbia. Estimates from the
Yugoslav Army say that as much as 1.5 tons of DU was dropped on other areas
of Serbia. Authorities in Belgrade have to date confirmed 5 sites in Serbia
other than Kosovo where depleted uranium munitions were used. Four of these
have been fenced off and declared public health risks.

<p>Since NATO’s bombing ended in June 1999, a number of reports from
international agencies have examined the environmental impact of the NATO
bombing. In several instances, these studies have supported NATO’s
contention that the consequences are negligible. In the first visit of the
United Nations Environmental Program to Serbia weeks after the attacks
ended, the agency declared they found no negative impact of the use of
depleted uranium. When asked what methodology was used to search for DU
contamination, the head of the delegation, Pekka Havisto, said they had
taken random soil samples in Serbia. Scientists here say that’s like trying
to find a needle in a haystack. Rather than publicizing the fact that NATO
refused to provide the UNEP with a map of areas targeted by DU munitions,
the agency elected to declare it had found no significant health risks.

<p>“The United Nations tried to diminish or reduce the scope and negative
environmental impacts of the NATO campaign,” says Professor Pavlovic.

<p>Eventually NATO released the map of 112 sites in Kosovo, most likely a
fraction of the actual total. Now, almost two years after the bombing
campaign started, the UN has begun analyzing the areas. But that’s just
Kosovo. The rest of Serbia remains in the dark because of NATO’s refusal to
make public the full extent of its DU use.

<p>Without a highly detailed map of areas hit by depleted uranium, future
health consequences may be the only way to discover where measures might
have been taken to prevent further tragedies.
