THE PROBLEM with Western national forests, timber industry 
representatives tell us, is that there are too many trees.
<P>Logging corporations conveniently propose to remedy this through a massive 
"thinning" program across tens of millions of acres of federal lands, 
ostensibly to protect both forests and nearby homes from severe forest fires.
<P>As with all good deceptions, this one contains some grains of truth.
<P>Most experts believe, for example, that in some areas excessively high 
levels of undergrowth can cause unnaturally severe fires, and that reducing 
these hazardous fuels is warranted.
<P>Environmentalists agree.
<P>However, as U.S. Forest Service chief fire specialist Denny Truesdale said 
in a recent interview, the woody materials that need to be reduced are shrubs, 
twigs, and saplings less than 3 inches in diameter -- not mature trees.
<P>Unfortunately, there is a cognitive disconnect between the Forest Service's 
scientists and its timber sale planners, whose budgets are dependent upon 
selling valuable mature timber.
<P>The result of this bureaucratic schizophrenia is that hundreds of large 
thinning timber sales are being executed right now on Western national forests 
under the guise of "fire risk reduction." Nearly all focus primarily on the 
removal of mature and old-growth trees between 10 and 30 inches in diameter, 
resulting in 300,000 acres of deforestation annually.
<P>Ironically, this very type of logging, experts inform us, is likely to 
increase, not decrease, the frequency and severity of wildland fires.
<P>In the Forest Service's own National Fire Plan, agency scientists warned 
against the use of commercial logging to address fire management. The report 
found that "the removal of large, merchantable trees from forests does not 
reduce fire risk and may, in fact, increase such risk."
<P>Commercial thinning operations leave behind dry twigs and limbs, cause 
rapid growth of flammable shrubs and weeds, and reduce forest canopy closure, 
creating hotter, drier conditions on the ground.
<P>Likewise, while the timber industry's claims about dangers to homes near 
national forests are true, their proposal to do intensive logging deep into 
the forest -- far from any home -- is likely to put homes at greater risk of 
burning.
<P>The Forest Service's expert on this issue, Jack Cohen, has produced recent 
reports, which clearly state that if the goal is to protect homes from fires, 
logging on national forest lands isn't the answer. Cohen's research reveals 
that the only way to protect homes effectively is to reduce the flammability 
of the homes themselves and their immediate surroundings within 44 yards.
<P>The timber industry also claims that last year's fire season was the "worst 
in 50 years." Again, there is a grain of truth: More than 7 million acres 
burned in 2000 -- more than in any year since the 1940s. However,the annual 
average over the past 50 years was about 5 million acres, and the average over 
the past century was 13.9 million acres per year.
<P>In light of this, last year's fire season is hardly remarkable.
<P>The truth is that Western forests burn. This can't and shouldn't be stopped.
<P>Fire is an essential, natural and necessary part of Western fire ecology. 
Many species of trees can only reproduce after fires occur. Wildland fires 
burn underbrush and return important nutrients to the soil.
<P>Even in extreme circumstances in which all trees are killed, the forest 
ecosystem still thrives and rejuvenates if left alone, as we learned from the 
1998 Yellowstone fire.
<P>In the end, we as a society must decide whom we trust more to implement 
fire management on our national forest system: logging corporations or 
scientists.
<P>We can end all commercial logging on our national forests and shift to a 
true, science-based ecological restoration program, as HR1494, the National 
Forest Protection and Restoration Act, would do.
<P>Or, we can continue to allow the timber industry to destroy ecosystems and 
increase severe fires on federal lands -- at taxpayer expense.
<P>The choice is ours.
