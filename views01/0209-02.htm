Governments and their leaders can no longer hide from global justice, we have been repeatedly assured. They cannot shelter behind national jurisdictions and state sovereignty. Those responsible for human rights abuses, ethnic cleansing, atrocities and, most of all, war crimes, must and will be pursued regardless of national boundaries in an inter-dependent world.
<P>That was the theme of Nato's "humanitarian war" against Yugoslavia - enthusiastically championed by Tony Blair - and of the hunting down of Serbian and Croatian warlords, the plans for an international war crimes court and the millions of dollars handed out by the US congress for the prosecution of Iraqi leaders and their families.
<P>It was also the message of the citizen-led attempt to prosecute the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and the rupture of political relations between Austria and the rest of the European Union in response to the rise to power of Jörg Haider's far right Freedom party in Austria.  But the partisans of this brave new "doctrine of international community" have been strangely subdued since the election of the extreme rightwing general Ariel Sharon as Israel's prime minister. It has, it transpires, been business as usual with the man held personally responsible for the largest massacre of civilians in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
<P>The British prime minister had a reportedly cordial chat with Sharon on Wednesday, while Robin Cook looked forward to "building on common ground" and "moving the peace process forward" with a politician whose swaggering provocation in Jerusalem last year triggered the current Palestinian uprising and whose suggestion for dealing with demonstrators was to "cut off their testicles". President Bush meanwhile promised Sharon that US support for Israel was "rock solid".
<P>Of course, governments deal with all sorts of leaders with ugly records. But Sharon is more than that. By any reasonable reckoning, he is a war criminal. This is a man of blood, whose history of terror and violation of the rules of war stretches back to the early 50s, when his unit slaughtered Palestinian villagers, through his brutal onslaught on the refugees of Gaza in the 70s, to his central role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon in which up to 20,000 people died.
<P>Around 2,000 of them were butchered in 36 hours in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila by Lebanese Phalangists effectively under Sharon's control. Sharon had repeatedly insisted that the camps were full of terrorists. In reality, the victims were overwhelmingly unarmed civilians, the PLO's fighters having been evacuated with an American-brokered promise of protection for their families.
<P>Israel's own Kahan commission found Sharon "personally" but "indirectly" responsible for the massacre, though whether an independent court would be so generous is open to question. 
<P>Now Sharon's return to power will put the good faith of supporters of an international justice system to the test. Their critics maintain that the new supranational doctrine of intervention and extra-territorial legality is a fraud, designed to give a spurious human rights legitimacy to big power bullying of weaker states that threaten their authority or interests. War crimes or human rights violations committed by the major powers, or by western allies in particular, they argue, will always be treated according to different standards and go unpunished.
<P>The prospects are certainly not encouraging in the case of Israel, which has long been allowed by its western sponsors to violate a string of UN security council resolutions, while other states in the region are subjected to lethal regimes of sanctions and bombing attacks for their transgressions. 
<P>Sharon's most horrific crimes are more recent than Pinochet's and his responsibility for the Sabra and Shatila killings is better documented than, say, that of the indicted former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic for the comparable Srebrenica massacre. It will be objected that Sharon has been chosen in a democratic election and that pursuing him for 18-year-old crimes will do nothing to advance the chances of a peace settlement.
<P>Such a settlement will become more likely once the majority of Israelis realise that Sharon's hardline policies of repression will not deliver the security they crave, while sanctions seem more suitable for a state whose citizens have a say in policy, rather than for dictatorships where they have none.
<P>Of course, no western government is likely to lift a finger against Sharon, though human rights and pro-Palestinian groups are already gearing up to attempt a Pinochet-style legal action if he ventures abroad. There is little prospect even of some mark of disapproval, such as a Haider-style diplomatic protest or the suspension of arms sales called for by a group of Labour MPs on Wednesday. These might at least send Israeli voters the message that there are limits to external material support. 
<P>During the Kosovo war, Tony Blair announced that his foreign intervention policy was based on a "subtle blend" of self-interest and moral purpose. Given the reaction to Sharon's election, this seems to boil down to moral purpose with enemies, but self-interest when it comes to friends.
