It is unprecedented in our history for a government
to take advantage of both war and economic recession to
fleece the American people. During the Vietnam War we
got Medicare and Medicaid, and during World War II there
were profit and price controls, not to mention
unemployment falling to 1.2 percent. The Great Depression
brought us Social Security and unemployment insurance.

         <p>But the Bush Administration has discovered that
September 11 was different: an attack for the first time
since the Civil War on the American mainland, with
thousands buried in the wreckage of a smoldering inferno
as the nation watched helplessly. The American people
were, and to some degree still are, in a state of shock. This
opens up all kinds of opportunities for those who are
unscrupulous enough to take advantage of the public's
increased reliance on government to provide both physical
and economic security.

         <p>Thus we have seen the House majority pass an
"economic stimulus" package that not even conservative
economists would consider a stimulus, with most of the
money going for tax breaks to corporations and the very
rich (households with income of more than a million
dollars a year). While jobs evaporate at the fastest rate in 20
years, the airlines get $15 billion from Congress, and their
laid-off employees get nothing. And every wasteful and
destructive project from missile defense to drilling the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has been repackaged and
hawked as a vital component of the War Against Terrorism.

         <p>When they said, "United We Stand," who knew
how small the group described by "We" really was?

         <p>All of this is an outrage, and will eventually be
understood as such. But the most dangerous development
has been the Administration's assault on our civil liberties
and freedoms. The detention of hundreds of people who,
the authorities concede, are not even suspected to be
connected with terrorism; the expansion of police powers
for wiretapping, secret searches, and surveillance, even of
previously protected conversations between attorney and
client; and most menacing, President Bush's executive
order authorizing secret military tribunals, without appeal
to civilian courts, to try and even to execute non-citizens
accused of links to "terrorism."

         <p>For the sake of truth in advertising, we should put a
sign for visitors at our airports and borders: "Warning: you
have no rights in this country. Do not be fooled by our
Constitution and Bill of Rights, or the appearance of the
rule of law. If you are not a US citizen, these do not apply
to you. You may as well be in Burma."

         <p>The expanded police powers apply to citizens, too.
Mostly they will legitimize what the FBI has been doing
illegally for decades. In the 1960s the Bureau ran an
enormous, centrally directed domestic "Counterintelligence
Program" which targeted civil rights organizers (including
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., described in a high-level FBI
memo as "the most dangerous Negro in the future of this
Nation,"), peace groups and other dissidents. Their tactics
included infiltration, blackmail, disruption of legal political
activity, and covert media operations to discredit political
opponents.

         <p>Most people think these illegal domestic operations
ended in 1972 with the death of the FBI's extremist
director, J. Edgar Hoover. But in fact they continued well
into the 1980s -- targeting thousands of religious, student,
and other activists opposed to US foreign policy in Central
America -- and even into the 90s. The pretext for the FBI's
abuses in the 1980s was a spurious charge that peace
activists were linked to "terrorism."

         <p>This sordid record should give us a preview of what
the Orwellian-named "USA-Patriot Act," passed by
Congress on October 25, is likely to deliver. President
Bush's executive order also indicates that the
Administration is trying to intimidate dissent: actions that
cause or threaten to cause "adverse effects on the United

States [or] its foreign policy" are included in the order's
definition of "international terrorism."

         <p>If these keeps up, we won't have to worry about
terrorists destroying our way of life: our own government
will have done it for them.
