<p> (adapted from Pastor 
Niemoller’s 1945 quote about the Nazis*)



<p>I’ve been steering clear of the F-word, because too many on the Left fling 
that term so carelessly that it soon loses its truth-punch. But things are 
happening, so quickly, in this country that are taking us closer to a brand 
of near-fascism that is frightening in its seeming acceptance by the American 
populace and in its implications for the future of American democracy.

<p>The non-domestic corollary: America, already resented and hated for its 
arrogant attitudes and policies around the world, is behaving more and more 
like a mad bull on a Pax Americana rampage.

<p>In short, we appear to be at one of those moments in American history where 
the executive branch, using the genuine need to respond to a terrorist attack 
of massive proportions, is badly over-reaching in both domestic and foreign 
areas. (The first draft of Ashcroft’s anti-terrorism law even recommended 
suspension of the rule of habeus corpus, which would have allowed for 
indefinite incarceration without charges or trials.) The Administration figure
s it can get away with its current actions, and assume even more power, 
because the Congress and the American people are frightened and willing to 
bend over backwards to make sure the President has the power he needs during 
“wartime.” 

<p>(Of course, there has been no official declaration of a State of War by the 
Congress, and the Bush Administration is not about to try to get one; doing 
so would give the legislative branch its rightful place in the 
balance-of-power arrangement the founders set up in order to prevent 
political mischief.)

<p>Now, whether we’re moving into the outskirts of fascism because the Bush 
Administration is merely confused and incompetent when dealing with issues of 
such moment is not clear. Equally plausible, especially given their ruthless, 
take-no-prisoners style as revealed in the Florida election chaos and beyond, 
is that they know exactly what they’re doing: attempting to enforce a harsh 
interpretation of justice so as to more easily cram their far-right cultural 
and economic agenda through a complacent Congress and public, under the cover 
of “national security” and “homeland protection.” (I grant that it’s 
possible they sincerely believe they’re doing so out of the best motives -- 
protecting the American people from further terrorism -- but, even if that 
were the case, the damage being done to the American polity and 
Constitutional system of government is incalcuable.)

<p>FOREIGN POLICY

<p>The hawks in the Administration seem to have convinced Bush that with the 
successes in Afghanistan -- forgetting that perhaps as many as 20,000 Al 
Quiada troops are holed up for the winter, in caves and in neighboring 
Pakistan -- it’s time to  widen the war by  going after Iraq, and maybe a few 
weaker states, such as Somalia, Yemen, Sudan, maybe even North Korea. (This 
plan may be put on temporary hold while the U.S. assays the 
military/political fallout from the quick-building war between Israel and the 
Palestinians.)  

<p>Why go to war against any of these countries? There is no evidence that any 
of the states named above has engaged in threatening activity -- no bombs 
exploded on U.S. soil or U.S. assets abroad, no airplanes flying into tall 
buildings, no biochemical attacks launched -- but, we are lead to believe, 
these rogue states threaten America’s vital interests merely by existing and, 
in some instances, by having weapons similar to ours.

<p>Iraq may be a special case. Saddam Hussein, who Bush Sr. let stay in power, 
is a truly vicious, monomaniacal dictator who has been known to dabble in 
biological weaponry and other weapons of mass destruction. Since he kicked 
out the U.N. inspectors, we don’t know what mischief he’s been up to. A good 
candidate, so goes hawk-logic, for getting his ass whupped by the U.S., 
provocation or not.

<p>Were the U.S. to bomb or invade Iraq to topple Saddam and install an 
opposition government, the current war coalition would collapse, and the 
worst stereotype of U.S. foreign policy -- of America as a giant bully not 
averse to arranging a Pax Americana with massive violence -- would be 
verified in a good share of the globe.

<p>There might well be uprisings widely in the Muslim world, and probably the 
toppling of several key governments in the process, Pakistan and Indonesia 
being the top candidates -- either by popular revolts or, more likely, by 
military coups. (Let us not forget that Pakistan has nuclear weapons.)

<p>But let us suppose that the U.S. approach is successful, and that it is able 
to navigate its way through the negative foreign consequences flowing from 
that demonstration of high-tech warfare carried out against low-tech 
resistance. How would you feel living in a modern version of the Roman 
Empire, our armies abroad enforcing a peace on several continents at bayonet 
point?


<p>DOMESTIC POLICY

<p>Which brings us to what life would be like domestically in such a 
neo-imperialist arrangement. Even some right-wingers are reacting negatively 
to the alterations of our judicial and Constitutional system a la Bush and 
Ashcroft. There have been columns in  the Wall Street Journal, William 
Safire’s blistering attack on Bush as a would-be “dictator,” ex-FBI 
officials willing to be quoted denouncing the Administration’s more extreme 
policies, politicians such as right-wing Republican Bob Barr decrying Bush’s 
policy excesses, editorials in the mainstream press chorusing that Ashcroft 
has gone  way over the top.

<p>Unless you’ve been living in a cave -- whoops!, wrong metaphor these days -- 
you must have become acquainted with Ashcroft’s way-out-there approach to 
civil libertiesm mostly, it is claimed, directed at non-citizens suspected of 
terrorism. That would be bad enough. But the wording of some of Ashcroft’s 
orders -- and Bush’s setting up of secret military tribunals  -- is so vague 
and (deliberately?) sloppy that it wouldn’t take much to blur the distinction 
between citizen and non-citizen. Already -- shades of J. Edgar Hoover’s 
COINTEL program of the 1960s-70s! --  Ashcroft wants to begin more spying on 
U.S. citizens, especially religious and political organizations.

<p>In short, the foundations for officially-sanctioned neo-fascist policies are 
swiftly being put into place and contemplated. And, since Bush and Ashcroft, 
from the beginning, have made it clear that if you’re not on the side of the 
war on terrorism, you’re probably a supporter of terrorists, the way is clear 
for cracking down on dissent internally against U.S. citizens. It’s not 
outside the realm of speculation that in the near-future even writing 
analyses such as the one you’re reading might be adjudged detrimental to the 
war effort and thus liable for prosecution -- or  to being “disappeared” 
into the judidical system, with all that suggests in the way of  respect 
being paid to citizens’ constitutional rights.

<p>Am I being overly paranoid? I hope  to God I am, that I’m misreading what’s 
happening. After all, Bush & Ashcroft and their spokesmen claim that their 
approach will NEVER overstep Constitutional bounds and everything will be 
handled fairly. Maybe you trust the government, especially THIS government, 
that much; I don’t. These guys are playing political hardball, and they 
appear to be aiming at any institution and individuals that dissent beyond 
certain boundaries.

<p>Those boundaries are being laid out clearly for the usual sources for 
dissent: the media and academia. Most of the big papers and networks are now 
owned by huge corporate conglomerates; Lynne Cheney’s American Council of 
Trustees and Alumni, a well-financed conservative group devoted to curbing 
liberal tendencies on campuses, already has issued its first blacklist of 
professors it considers insufficiently “patriotic.” Many will be fired or 
eased out, many more will tone down their criticism -- as many journalists 
already have -- and the message will be quite clear: Do not dissent too 
vocally.

<p>Two scary  ramifications: 1)  We’re only in the first year of Bush’s term; 
the damage he can cause to the Constitution and the body politic during the 
next  three (or, God help us, seven) years is frightening to imagine.  2) The 
American people, for the most part, still appear to be lending strong support 
to Bush’s interpretation of the war on terrorism, although cracks are 
starting to show up.

<p>So what is to be done? If there ever was a time for a rebirth of the 
Movement, this is the time. Street action is probably not as important these 
days -- and, if violence is attached to it, would be counterproductive -- as 
opinion-shaping and education. I’m talking here about writing letters to the 
editor of your local paper, calling and writing your Member of Congress and 
Senators, helping organize your friends and mailing lists online and urging 
them to act as well, contributing money to organizations resisting what’s 
happpening. (When I contact my legislators or newspapers, I make sure I let 
them know that I am in support of the campaign to break up and eradicate the 
terrorist networks: these guys are a bad lot, I believe, and need to be taken 
down, but not at the expense of the Constitution.)

<p>The U.S. Senate is probably  the place where most attention should go at the 
moment, given that the House is pretty well dominated by the 
Bush/Armey/Delay-led  rightwing majority. The Democrats in the Senate, who 
rolled over too easily on the so-called PATRIOT anti-terrorism act, need 
backbone; hearing from their constituents, urging them to stand up for the 
Constitution and the balance-of-powers that rein in power-hungry executives, 
might actually work in stopping some of the more extreme actions to date, and 
to come, by the Bush Administration.

<p>This struggle for peace and justice and respect for the Constitution will not 
be  an easy one, if only because of the politicized nature of the Supreme 
Court majority. But  it is one we must join, and, for the sake of our 
representative democracy, we must win.

<p><i>*First they came for the Communists,<br>
  and I didn’t speak up,<br>
    because I wasn’t a Communist.<br>
Then they came for the Jews,<br>
  and I didn’t speak up,<br>
    because I wasn’t a Jew.<br>
Then they came for the Catholics,<br>
  and I didn’t speak up,<br>
    because I was a Protestant.<br>
Then they came for me,<br>
  and by that time there was no one<br>
    left to speak up for me.
