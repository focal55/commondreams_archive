With the installation of a new US president in the White House, the time for an early test of the "special UK-US relationship" is at hand, on an issue of great importance to the security and well being of British citizens. The issue is the strong commitment of George Bush to the early deployment of a "robust national missile defense (NMD) system". 
<P>The dangerous illogic of this commitment is evident in his simultaneous call for deep reductions in the numbers of US and Russian strategic nuclear weapons. Calling for both early deployment of an NMD system and deep reductions in nuclear weapons suggests that he is unaware that both Russia and China have repeatedly warned that any NMD system which violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty will stimulate an increase in nuclear weapons - not reductions. Unfortunately, it is not hard to believe that he is oblivious to this danger because he has no experience, knowledge or previous interest in international security matters.  
<P>Because Mr Bush has surrounded himself with security advisers who are second-time-around cold war hawks from the first President Bush's team, it appears unlikely that he will hear any cautionary words from them. What is desperately needed is knowledgeable, objective and forceful advice from America's closest allies who will suffer the consequences of an unwise decision in Washington. It is all too easy for the hawks to dismiss threats by Russia and China but it will be much harder to ignore reasoned objections from America's closest friends and indispensable security partners.  
<P>Today the US and Russia remain locked in a cold war confrontation with nearly 5,000 nuclear warheads on hair-trigger alert, ready to launch in less than 15 minutes. What little stability exists rests on a fragile framework of arms control agreements which gradually have cut the numbers in half from the peak of almost 25,000 strategic weapons in 1989. Talks already under way could reduce that total to as low as 3,000 if the Russian proposal for 1,500 for each side is accepted. This will not happen - cannot happen - if the foundation of all nuclear arms control agreements, the 1972 ABM treaty, is abrogated by the US. All constructive efforts to reduce weapons will end. Instability will return, not only between the US and Russia but in China, India and Pakistan.  
<P>Furthermore, Russia is sending signals that such instability will force it to place more reliance for security on its vast arsenal of tactical, short range nuclear systems. These pose no threat to Americans at home, only to Russia's neighbours in Europe and Asia.  
<P>Fortunately, Britain has a strong reason to speak up, plus leverage to apply in   Washington where the need for foresight and common sense has never been greater. The two levers are Fylingdales, the RAF radar station in Yorkshire, and the future role of Nato in European security. In a display of superpower hubris, current US planning for the NMD system assumes London's assent to effect a major upgrade of missile tracking facilities at Fylingdales. Such an upgrade would make the UK a willing abettor in America's abrogation of the ABM treaty, as well as create a major nuclear target on British soil. There is also the near certainty that in domestic political terms Fylingdales will become the new Greenham Common. Even Republicans will remember the role that location played in the removal of nuclear-tipped ground launched Cruise missiles from Europe and ultimately in their destruction under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Force (INF) treaty of 1987.  
<P>Even more important, British support is essential to US efforts to maintain the primacy of the Nato alliance in European security arrangements. Without such support,   the pendulum will inevitably swing to the EU and thus mute America's dominant voice in Brussels. This may happen anyway, but Washington will be loath to speed the process by alienating London with demands for support of an NMD system which will weaken all efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation globally.  
<P>While no formal objection has yet emerged in Ottawa, former minister of foreign affairs, Lloyd Axworthy, has called a conference of interested parties in Vancouver on February 16 to formulate a strategy for Canadians to oppose NMD deployment. This could add weight to a growing chorus of allied opposition to an NMD system.  
<P>There is an American saying that friends don't let friends drive drunk. The time is right to use the special UK-US relationship as the basis for telling a new American president, with a tenuous grasp on security issues, that the US seems intoxicated with its role as the only superpower. Mr Bush must be cautioned to reasses.  
<P>  <i>Rear Admiral Eugene J Carroll Jr was on General Alexander Haig's staff in Europe from 1977 to 1979 and director of US military operations for US forces in Europe and the Middle East. He is now vice president of the <a href="http://www.cdi.org">Center for Defense Information</a> in Washington DC.
