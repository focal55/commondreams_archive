            <p> WHEN EVANGELICAL Christian kids began broadcasting their behavioral 

              ethic on their sweatshirts - ''WWJD'' - they raised a question useful 

              to church people as they debate faith-based initiatives: ''What 

              Would Jesus Do?'' Would increased partnering in social programs 

              between government and churches merely facilitate the delivery of 

              social services, or would it make churches servile clients of a 

              government with diminishing passion for social justice? 

            <P> 

            <p>Luke's Gospel in particular advances what theologians call ''the 

              preferential option for the poor.'' It begins with Mary's Song in 

              the first chapter: ''He hath put down the mighty from their seats, 

              and exalted them of low degree./He hath filled the hungry with good 

              things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.'' As one Latin American 

              theologian put it, God takes sides in the struggle of haves and 

              have-nots we call history. God sides with the least, the lowest, 

              and the left-out.

            <P> 

            <p>Later in Luke, Jesus uses the compassionate act of a Samaritan 

              - the racial outcast of his day - to illustrate what one must do 

              to fulfill God's great commandment of love. He then tells his hearers 

              to imitate the hated Samaritan, to ''go and do likewise.''

            <P> 

            <p>But for all that, the kingdom Jesus described was radically inclusive. 

              Jesus, as God's son who goes from the uttermost to the guttermost, 

              wants to expand the franchise to everyone, even those unlikely to 

              buy in. Some of Jesus's stories about the kingdom make precisely 

              this point: a net capturing different kinds of fish, fields with 

              different crop yields, laborers with different pay scales.

            <P> 

            <p>Moral: In the kingdom, it takes all kinds. Even the Pharisees. 

              Luke makes a point of showing that Jesus refused to write off those 

              arch-villains of Sunday School lore. Luke tells of several dinner 

              invitations Jesus received from the Pharisees. He accepts them all. 

              Each, however, ends in social disaster: Jesus never fails to offend 

              his host.

            <P> 

            <p>In the 11th chapter of Luke, a Pharisee invites Jesus to a power 

              lunch, which he attends without hesitation. As the guests sit down, 

              the Pharisee is outraged that Jesus has not washed his hands before 

              dinner. In that time and place hand washing was a matter of holiness, 

              not hygiene: It was a ritual that signified the sanctity of the 

              meal, and was observed scrupulously by religious folk. So Jesus 

              is caught in a faux pas.

            <P> 

            <p>Instead of offering an apology, Jesus launches a verbal attack. 

              He berates his host for being obsessed with clean exteriors while 

              being filthy inside with greed. He goes on to say that clean hands 

              come by the purifying act of feeding the poor, that the Pharisees 

              leave the hard work of justice undone. These insults were in earshot 

              of other guests whom the Bible calls ''scribes'' or ''doctors of 

              the law,'' ancient Israel's equivalents of today's policy wonks.

            <P> 

            <p>The scribes are put off by Jesus's rudeness and tell him so. But 

              he has a few choice words for them, too. He says that their policy 

              directives harm more than help, and that they polish the monuments 

              of great leaders of the past while betraying their principles. They 

              use their insider knowledge to keep people locked out, and they 

              use their expertise - the buzzwords, jargon, and doublespeak - not 

              to illumine but to confuse. By the time Jesus finished his harangue 

              the Pharisees and scribes were steaming and planning revenge.

            <P> 

            <p>So we know what Jesus would do sitting at the table of the decision-makers 

              in Washington. He would tell the truth about how their fiscal conservatism 

              and corporate welfare have further enriched the wealthy and impoverished 

              the wretched. He would tell them how the wealth of our nation makes 

              the poverty of children a greater obscenity than any four-letter 

              words they might learn from their desperate music. He would describe 

              how the worst offenses are committed through policy-regulating, 

              deregulating and otherwise legislating the bread right out of the 

              mouths of the victims by perpetrators who go to Congress, not to 

              prison. He would note how the power-brokers are now trying to persuade 

              faith-based organizations to become branch offices of a kingdom 

              that offers less and less, too little, too late.

            <P> 

            <p>That's what Jesus would do if he were invited to a power lunch 

              with Bush, his spin doctors, and his policy wonks. He'd go. He'd 

              talk. He'd probably be invited to leave unfed.

            <P> 

            <p>Let the churches go and do likewise.

            <P>
