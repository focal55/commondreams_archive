WHILE WE bemoan the energy crisis, pointing fingers at Gov. Gray Davis 
and the big utility companies, some even looking to nuclear power, an ancient 
and less-than-radical practice presents itself as a viable solution: 
vegetarianism.
<P>The meat and dairy industries depend on inordinate amounts of natural gas, 
electricity and fossil fuels to house, warm, ventilate, water, feed, clean, 
transport and slaughter billions of animals destined for our dinner tables.
<P>People in this state are preparing to read by candlelight and wash clothes 
by hand. Understandably, many Californians are demanding to know who the 
biggest energy hogs are. Agribusiness should be definitely high on that list.
<P>Washington state, Oregon and California lose 17 billion kilowatt-hours of 
electricity to livestock production. With this kind of power, every home in 
the United States could leave the lights on for a month and a half.
<P>John Robbins, author of the book, "Diet for a New America," reveals some 
interesting statistics on America's production of animal flesh and fluid:
<P>
<ul>
<li>If humans switched from a meat-based diet to a plant-based one, the 
world's petroleum reserves would last 260 years, as opposed to 13.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Raising animals for food requires more than one-third of all raw 
materials and fossil fuels in the United States. If we all adopted a vegetable-
based diet, only 2 percent of raw materials would be used.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The creation of a single hamburger patty (often containing the flesh of 
up to 100 different cows) uses enough fossil fuel to power a car 20 miles and 
enough water for 17 warm showers.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>More than half of the U.S. water supply goes to livestock production.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>If water used by the meat industry were not subsidized by taxpayers, 
common hamburger meat would cost $35 a pound. You need 25 gallons of water to 
produce a pound of wheat -- 2,500 gallons to generate a pound of meat.
</li>
</ul>
<P>This is ridiculously wasteful.
<P>The Environmental Protection Agency identifies 60 percent of U.S. rivers 
and streams as having impaired water quality, and wastes from animal 
agriculture create three times more organic water pollution than all other 
industrial sources combined.
<P>This, all for bacon, eggs and a glass of milk?
<P>In a letter to Davis, the California Cattlemen's Association and the 
Western United Dairymen, among others, plead for special consideration 
regarding the energy crunch. They have asked the state to consider using 
"available electricity supply sources," and they have encouraged the "refining 
of diesel fuel within the state by easing restrictions and providing tax 
incentives."
<P>These groups and companies have admitted to their hog status -- insisting 
that energy is "more vital" to food production than to most industries, and 
that "this is compounded by the fact that agricultural cultivation and 
husbandry often require a number of necessary steps that are energy-intensive."
<P>These "steps" include extreme measures to house and maintain factory-farmed 
animals. No longer do animals frolic in green pastures on small family farms. 
Instead, most animals are kept in confinement, while conveyor belts bring in 
food and water and remove waste.
<P>Poultry and dairy workers must wear gas masks to avoid breathing dangerous 
methane and ammonia fumes. To keep chickens alive and breathing in these toxic 
facilities, egg producers must blow chilled air constantly.
<P>There are so many energy-wasting practices connected with eating animals. 
We can ease some of our own burden by adopting sensible eating habits.
