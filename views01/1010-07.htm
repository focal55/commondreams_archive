No sane nation hands to a wartime enemy atomic
weapons set to go off within
its own homeland, and then lights the fuse.

<p>Yet as the bombs and missiles drop on Afghanistan,
the certainty of terror
retaliation inside America has turned our 103
nuclear power plants into
weapons of apocalyptic destruction, just waiting
to be used against us.

<p>One or both planes that crashed into the World
Trade Center on September 11,
could have easily obliterated the two atomic
reactors now operating at
Indian Point, about 40 miles up the Hudson.

<p>The catastrophic devastation would have been
unfathomable. But those and a
hundred other American reactors are still running.
Security has been
heightened. But all are vulnerable to another
sophisticated terror attack
aimed at perpetrating the unthinkable.

<p>Indian Point Unit One was shut long ago by public
outcry. But Units 2 & 3
have operated since the 1970s. Back then there was
talk of requiring reactor
containment domes to be strong enough to withstand
a jetliner crash. But the
biggest jets were far smaller than the ones that
fly today. Nor did those
early calculations account for the jet fuel whose
hellish fire melted the
critical steel supports that ultimately brought
down the Trade Center.

<p>Had one or both those jets hit one or both the
operating reactors at Indian
Point, the ensuing cloud of radiation would have
dwarfed the ones at
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Three Mile Island and
Chernobyl.

<p>The intense radioactive heat within today's
operating reactors is the hottest
anywhere on the planet. So are the hellish levels
of radioactivity.

<p>Because Indian Point has operated so long, its
accumulated radioactive burden
far exceeds that of Chernobyl, which ran only four
years before it exploded.

<p>Some believe the WTC jets could have collapsed or
breached either of the
Indian Point containment domes. But at very least
the massive impact and
intense jet fuel fire would destroy the human
ability to control the plants'
functions. Vital cooling systems, backup power
generators and communications
networks would crumble.

<p>Indeed, Indian Point Unit One was shut because
activists warned that its lack
of an emergency core cooling system made it an
unacceptable risk. The
government ultimately agreed.

<p>But today terrorist attacks could destroy those
same critical cooling and
control systems that are vital to not only the
Unit Two and Three reactor
cores, but to the spent fuel pools that sit on
site.

<p>The assault would not require a large jet. The
safety systems are extremely
complex and virtually indefensible. One or more
could be wiped out with a
wide range of easily deployed small aircraft,
ground-based weapons, truck
bombs or even chemical/biological assaults aimed
at the operating work force.
Dozens of US reactors have repeatedly failed even
modest security tests over
the years. Even heightened wartime standards
cannot guarantee protection of
the vast, supremely sensitive controls required
for reactor safety.

<p>Without continous monitoring and guaranteed water
flow, the thousands of tons
of radioactive rods in the cores and the thousands
more stored in those
fragile pools would rapidly melt into super-hot
radioactive balls of lava
that would burn into the ground and the water
table and, ultimately, the
Hudson.

<p>Indeed, a jetcrash like the one on 9/11 or other
forms of terrorist assault
at Indian Point could yield three infernal
fireballs of molten radioactive
lava burning through the earth and into the
aquifer and the river. Striking
water they would blast gigantic billows of
horribly radioactive steam into
the atmosphere. Prevailing winds from the north
and west might initially
drive these clouds of mass death downriver into
New York City and east into
Westchester and Long Island.

<p>But at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, winds
ultimately shifted around the
compass to irradiate all surrounding areas with
the devastating poisons
released by the on-going fiery torrent. At Indian
Point, thousands of square
miles would have been saturated with the most
lethal clouds ever created or
imagined, depositing relentless genetic poisons
that would kill forever.

<p>In nearby communities like Buchanan, Nyack, Monsey
and scores more, infants
and small children would quickly die en masse.
Virtually all pregnant women
would spontaneously abort, or ultimately give
birth to horribly deformed
offspring. Ghastly sores, rashes, ulcerations and
burns would afflict the
skin of millions. Emphysema, heart attacks,
stroke, multiple organ failure,
hair loss, nausea, inability to eat or drink or
swallow, diarrhea and
incontinance, sterility and impotence, asthma,
blindness, and more would
kill thousands on the spot, and doom hundreds of
thousands if not millions.
A terrible metallic taste would afflict virtually
everyone downwind in New
York, New Jersey and New England, a ghoulish curse
similar to that endured by
the fliers who dropped the atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagaskai, by those
living downwind from nuclear bomb tests in the
south seas and Nevada, and by
victims caught in the downdrafts from Three Mile
Island and Chernobyl.

<p>Then comes the abominable wave of cancers,
leukemias, lymphomas, tumors and
hellish diseases for which new names will have to
be invented, and new
dimensions of agony will beg description.

<p>Indeed, those who survived the initial wave of
radiation would envy those who
did not.

<p>Evacuation would be impossible, but thousands
would die trying. Bridges and
highways would become killing fields for those
attempting to escape to
destinations that would soon enough become equally
deadly as the winds
shifted.

<p>Attempts to quench the fires would be futile. At
Chernobyl, pilots flying
helicopters that dropped boron on the fiery core
died in droves. At Indian
Point, such missions would be a sure ticket to
death. Their utility would be
doubtful as the molten cores rage uncontrolled for
days, weeks and years,
spewing ever more devastation into the eco-sphere.
More than 800,000 Soviet
draftees were forced through Chernobyl's seething
remains in a futile attempt
to clean it up. They are dying in droves. Who
would now volunteer for such
an American task force?

<p>The radioactive cloud from Chernobyl blanketed the
vast Ukraine and Belarus
landscape, then carried over Europe and into the
jetstream, surging through
the west coast of the United States within ten
days, carrying across our
northern tier, circling the globe, then coming
back again.

<p>The radioactive clouds from Indian Point would
enshroud New York, New Jersey,
New England, and carry deep into the Atlantic and
up into Canada and across
to Europe and around the globe again and again.

<p>The immediate damage would render thousands of the
world's most populous and
expensive square miles permanently uninhabitable.
All five boroughs of New
York City would be an apocalyptic wasteland. The
World Trade Center would be
rendered as unusable and even more lethal by a jet
crash at Indian Point than
it was by the direct hits of 9/11. All real estate
and economic value would
be poisonously radioactive throughout the entire
region. Irreplaceable
trillions in human capital would be forever lost.

<p>As at Three Mile Island, where thousands of farm
and wild animals died in
heaps, and as at Chernobyl, where soil, water and
plant life have been
hopelessly irradiated, natural eco-systems on
which human and all other life
depends would be permanently and irrevocably
destroyed,

<p>Spiritually, psychologically, financially,
ecologically, our nation would
never recover.

<p>This is what we missed by a mere forty miles near
New York City on September
11. Now that we are at war, this is what could be
happening as you read
this.

<p>There are 103 of these potential Bombs of the
Apocalypse now operating in the
United States. They generate just 18% of America's
electricity, just 8% of
our total energy. As with reactors elsewhere, the
two at Indian Point have
both been off-line for long periods of time with
no appreciable impact on
life in New York. Already an extremely expensive
source of electricity, the
cost of attempting to defend these reactors will
put nuclear energy even
further off the competitive scale.

<p>Since its deregulation crisis,
California---already the nation's second-most
efficient state---cut further into its electric
consumption by some 15%.
Within a year the US could cheaply replace
with increased
efficiency all the reactors now so much more
expensive to operate and
protect.

<p>Yet, as the bombs fall and the terror escalates,
Congress is fast-tracking a
form of legal immunity to protect the operators of
reactors like Indian Point
from liability in case of a meltdown or terrorist
attack.

<p>Why is our nation handing its proclaimed enemies
the weapons of our own mass
destruction, and then shielding from liability the
companies that insist on
continuing to operate them?

<p>Do we take this war seriously? Are we committed to
the survival of our
nation?

If so, the ticking reactor bombs that could
obliterate the very core of our
life and of all future generations must be shut
down.
