Since Sept. 11, people have been on the march to reclaim the Bay Area's 
place as a center of dissent and spawning ground of some of the great social 
movements of the past century.
<P>It's an uphill climb.
<P>The challenge facing this incipient peace movement is whether it can evolve 
into a potent force -- as did opposition to the Vietnam War -- or whether it 
will remain a sideshow with little impact on how the United States wages its 
battle against terrorism.
<P>The Bay Area's war protesters in the late '60s and early '70s had 
advantages. Theirs was a widely unpopular war, fought far from home (without 
homeland terrorism) for reasons unpersuasive to many Americans. The draft was 
in full swing, and growing weekly death counts were frightening.
<P>Today's anti-war fervor comes at the end of an era when activism had faded. 
For much of the 1990s, the Bay Area was synonymous in the national imagination 
not with protest but with an obsession with stock options, million-dollar 
homes, BMWs and upscale restaurants. Young people streamed to the Bay Area not 
to challenge the power elite but aspiring to become part of it.
<P>Since Sept. 11, a new generation of anti-war activists has begun to 
reconnect with the Bay Area's past. Rallies, marches and teach-ins resemble 
protests against U.S. policies regarding Vietnam, El Salvador, the Gulf War, 
South Africa and elsewhere.
<P>While familiar, the new protests have a distinctive flavor. Giant puppets 
of President George W. Bush were displayed at a large march in San Francisco's 
Mission District last weekend. And at a lunchtime rally at the University of 
California at Berkeley on Monday, several non-Muslim demonstrators sported 
kaffiyehs, a traditional Arab headdress.
<P>Chants have been updated. In 1970, students protesting the secret U.S. air 
war against Cambodia yelled, "On Strike, Shut It Down" as they tried to close 
universities. Last week, Berkeley students shouted, "Join Us, Take a Stand, 
Stop the Bombing in Afghanistan." (And a small group of counter-protesters, 
shouting "USA! USA! USA!" held signs proclaiming, "Terrorize Terrorism!")
<P>For the anti-war protests to become more than just a cry from the heart -- 
or a soapbox for complaints against U.S. policies abroad -- today's peace 
movement will have to come up with more than slogans.
<P>A fundamental problem is that the protesters have been unable to generate a 
clear alternative to the Bush administration's anti-terrorism strategy. It's 
one thing to decry the bombing of Afghan citizens. It's quite another to come 
up with a realistic strategy to stop another murderous attack by bin Laden or 
his cronies.
<P>At one Berkeley rally, an emblematic moment occurred when a counter-
demonstrator confronted an anti-war protester.
<P>"No one wants this war," she said. "Sometimes violence is unavoidable. What 
is your solution?''
<P>There was no response.
<P>Just what is the protesters' strategy?
<P>There isn't one.
<P>Adding to the confusion is that progressives are themselves divided. Many 
believe the United States has no choice but to chase down Osama bin Laden and 
his terrorist collaborators. Others think that by doing so the United States 
is playing into his hands. And some don't know what to think.
<P>Two days after the attack, Alice Walker, author of "The Color Purple" and 
other books, argued before a packed crowd at the Berkeley Community Theater 
that the answer is love and compassion, rooted in Buddhist principles.
<P>Kevin Danaher, co-founder of San Francisco-based Global Exchange says 
"tough love" is needed.
<P>"I'm all for heart, but these guys are killers, they are mass murders, they 
can't be ignored," says Danaher. This is not an anti-war movement, he says, 
but a fight for "global justice."
<P>"If you're going to get these guys, you need something more sophisticated 
than just bombing and killing," he says. "I don't want them dead. I want them 
alive. I want them on the stand. And I want whoever aided or abetted them 
behind bars."
<P>Another obstacle to building an effective opposition is that often the new 
protests have turned into fuzzy forums for complaints about every conceivable 
misdeed. At the Berkeley rally, for example, one student dressed in a black 
cape declared, "Terrorism didn't start on Sept. 11 -- it started the day 
Christopher Columbus set foot on American soil."
<P>Few protesters have embraced the new mood of patriotism that has surfaced 
even in some radical strongholds of the Bay Area. That will make it tougher to 
win over the 9 out of 10 Americans who support the war. Protesters wearing 
kaffiyehs risk inciting the same "love it or leave i" hostility Vietnam War 
protesters faced a generation ago. Arguing that dissent is itself patriotic is 
a hard sell when people's nerves are at the breaking point.
<P>For the growing but scattered movement to morph into a full-fledged social 
and political force will also depend on events beyond its control.
<P>Will there be large number of U.S. casualties? Will there be more terrorist 
attacks? Will there be a draft? How long will the war go on? Will it evolve 
into a wider war? Will it drain the nation's financial reserves? Will other 
interest groups and constituencies rise up against it?
<P>For now, the budding peace movement has shown surprising vitality. Alice 
Hamburg, a 95-year-old peace activist from Berkeley, says people have 
responded more quickly than at the beginning stages of the Vietnam War.
<P>"You can't expect that within a week people will come flocking to the peace 
movement," says Hamburg, whose autobiography, "Grassroots: From Prairie to 
Politics," will be published later this month. "That is too much to expect. It 
is a slow process."
<P>But as the conflict deepens, as it is sure to do, the peace movement will 
have to engage in some fancy footwork. It will need a clear message, a well-
defined purpose and a compelling answer to combatting terrorism without 
dropping bombs. Recycling Vietnam-era rhetoric won't work.
<P>"The way this war is going to touch people is different," says Charles 
Wollenberg, chairman of the Social Sciences Department at Vista Community 
College in Berkeley. "The fact that there was this terrible attack on U.S. 
soil justifies it in a way the Vietnam War never could be."</p>
