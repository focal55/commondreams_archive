<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->This week the U.S. House of Representatives will take up an economic
stimulus package that indicates just how much the House has sold out to the
big corporate and wealthy interests at the expense of poor and working class
people.  It is class warfare.  According to a New York Times editorial on
October 20, the bill has $54 billion in accelerated tax cuts with every
penny going to the top 30% of taxpayers and half going to the top 5%.  80%
of the benefits from the capital gains tax cuts would go to the top 2% of
households, and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, only $2.3
billion of the $100 billion stimulus for 2002 would be spent on benefits for
unemployed workers who would be the most likely to spend it to stimulate the
economy.

<p>It is also poor economics because it would lower rates on capital gains held
more-than-one but less-than-five years and if investors took advantage of
the lower rates to raise cash, share prices would drop.  Elimination of the
corporate alternative minimum tax would cost $25 billion in 2002 and would
not guarantee any new investment, but would give a windfall to companies
that usually find a way to elude taxes anyway.  Such corporate tax breaks
would reduce their taxes on the state level and force states to reduce
spending, hindering economic recovery.
Unemployment in South Carolina climbed from 4.2% in August, 2000 to 5.4% in
August, 2001, with 28 of our 46 counties having more than 6% and 9 counties
over 10%.  Since the August unemployment figures were reported,  several
other big layoffs have been announced. On October 19, the South Carolina
Board of Economic Advisors, who are our state's official economic
forecasters, predicted a $310 million reduction in budget estimates for the
current budget year. The reduction is the largest dollar amount in history
and will result in 4.2% state budget cuts across-the-board.

<p>For the past decade or so, the increasing income disparity between the
wealthy and the poor and working class has been unprecedented in U.S.
history. If the average pay for production workers had  risen at the level
as CEO pay, the annual workers salary would be $120,491.00 - not $24,668.00.
The wealthiest 1% of Americans control about 38% of America's wealth.  The
bottom 80% control 17% of America's wealth.  The top 1% of stock owners have
48% of stock holdings.

<p>Congress already delivered a bonanza to the wealthy earlier this year when
they passed the Bush tax cut plan that gave about 25% of the largesse to the
richest 1% and well over 50% to those with incomes over $100,000.00.
Congress should subsidize an increase in unemployment benefits that will
give money to the poor and working class whose safety net was diminished by
"welfare reform."  They will spend their money at the grass-roots level that
will really stimulate the economy.  Congress should increase spending for
better public education, health care, housing, and transportation to benefit
everyday people --- the poor and working class.

<p>Rather than declaring war on the poor and working class, Congress needs to
declare war on our fossil fuel and nuclear energy dependency which has a lot
do with the "War on Terrorism."   Saudi Arabia has been our biggest oil and
military buddy in the Arab world for 70 years. 10 of the 19 September 11
hijackers were Saudis and Saudi Arabia has also been identified as the major
financier for the most radical, terroristic networks of Islamic
fundamentalists, including Osama bin Laden's Al Queda organization.  To
further substantiate how oil policy dominates our foreign policy, Chris
Mondics reported for Knight Ridder Newspapers on October 21 that the U.S.
government "actively supported a proposal by Houston-based energy developer
Unocal to build a 1,000 mile pipeline through Afghanistan to link gas fields
in Turkmenistan" and worked with the Taliban until 1998 to cut such a deal
even though the U.S. knew of bin Laden's terrorist activities.

<p>Our only long-term solution is to develop renewable energy sources like the
wind and the sun and encourage conservation, but the politicians who run our
government are subservient to the giant energy cartels who control  fossil
fuel and nuclear power.  They spend enormous sums to fight wars for oil and
gas and subsidize about anything big energy asks for but they see no big
campaign contributions in helping develop alternative sources of energy.
For example, South Carolina's U.S. Rep. Lindsey Graham, who is running to
replace the retiring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, voted against a $30
million increase in renewable energy programs in 1995, and against a $45
million dollar solar energy research and development bill in l996.

<p>Hopefully, the South Carolina Congressional Delegation and the entire
Congress will address the needs of the poor and working class in the
stimulus bill debate this week and will also take a stand for conservation
and renewable energy.
