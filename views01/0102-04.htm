Last summer's Republican convention was applauded and condemned for the
large number of African-Americans showcased. Critics claimed it was a
deceptive performance ("minstrel show" was a popular put-down) but others
praised the GOP's attempt at racial outreach.
<P>
   Whatever it was, the strategy failed to attract many black voters to the
Republican ticket. Texas Gov. George W. Bush pulled just 9 percent of the
black vote, the fewest garnered by a Republican since the second term of
Ronald Reagan, a man loathed by most African-Americans. Even in Texas, where
Bush was reputed to have crafted an effective interracial alliance, he polled
merely 5 percent of the black vote.
<P>

   Many Republicans strategists are wondering what went wrong. Why did
African-Americans, particularly the black middle class, resist the Republican
embrace so resolutely? And, since they did, why should the GOP continue to
make gestures of racial outreach when its hand is consistently rejected?
<P>
   The answer to that question is simple: It must. The GOP can never claim to
be a national party unless it can attract a national constituency. Oh, it can
gain control (as it has) over all three branches of the federal government,
and it may use that brute political force to push its policies through. But in
order to be truly representative, Republicans must earn--through policy, not
symbolism-- the support of Americans across all spectra, especially the racial
spectrum.
<P>
   What's more, changing demographics make it clear that white Americans, not
just white Republicans, will be a minority in this country in the next 50
years. If either party is to ensure long-term durability, it will have to gain
a significant following among "minority" Americans. Unless the GOP mounts a
serious challenge, the Democratic Party will be the party of the future, by
default.
<P>
   This means the party of Lincoln must stop exploiting white resentment to
blacks' demands for civil rights, a la the "Southern strategy," and begin
serious efforts to find solutions to our continuing racial impasse. The
inclusive, "opportunity conservatism" pushed by 1996 GOP vice presidential
candidate Jack Kemp, for example, was attractive to many in the black
community and should have been absorbed as official Republican strategy.
Instead, with the "Gingrich revolution," the GOP re-engaged the power of the
white backlash to help fuel its political bandwagon.
<P>
   Were that to change, the Democrats must then resist the temptation to
exploit African-Americans' racial fears, a tactic that paid big dividends in
this year's presidential election. Demonizing Bush was the low road, but it's
a road well traveled by backlash strategists.
<P>
   Bush's handlers understand this need for change; that's why the
president-elect selected two black Americans as his first cabinet members,
despite the black electorate's rejection of his candidacy. His choices of
Condoleezza Rice and retired Gen. Colin Powell as national security adviser
and secretary of state, respectively, stir both pride and anxiety within the
African-American community. Pride, because the exceptionally qualified duo
were chosen to fill slots not typically associated with black officials;
Powell will be the third-highest-ranking official in the Executive Branch.
Worry, because many African-American activists fear Republicans are trying to
camouflage harmful policies with black faces, as with U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Clarence Thomas.
<P>
   When the first President Bush nominated Thomas for a spot on the U.S.
Supreme Court, blacks by and large supported him; his race trumped his
Republican pedigree. Today, however, there is a widespread consensus among
blacks that Thomas has been a disaster for the interests of African-Americans.
Racial symbolism is regarded a bit more warily these days.
<P>
   Powell supports affirmative action and credits it for aiding his rise. In
that, he differs from Thomas, who now wants to kick down the same ladder of
affirmative action he climbed to his lofty perch. But in other ways, Powell's
history is cause for even more concern among African-Americans than Thomas'.
Powell had a major role in supporting right-wing terrorism in Guatemala, El
Salvador and Nicaragua during the 1980s; in helping to design the Reagan
administration's 1983 invasion of Grenada (an action by the Western
hemisphere's largest nation against the hemisphere's smallest); in leading the
1989 invasion of Panama which killed hundreds of (mostly black) Panamanians,
leaving thousands wounded and homeless. Rice has less to live down, but her
connection to the GOP's foreign-policy brain trust makes many wary.
<P>
   If those fears turn out to be baseless, the GOP may be on its way to
becoming a truly national party.
