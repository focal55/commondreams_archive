THOUSANDS of abortion-rights supporters will gather again Sunday in 
Washington for a rally and a "March for Women's Lives." A familiar ritual of 
the 1980s and early '90s, such events were not necessary during the Clinton-
Gore years when the pro-choice movement had reliable allies in the White House.
<P>Now, of course, abortion-rights activists have plenty to march about. 
President Bush has appointed the most anti-abortion attorney general in 
history, John Ashcroft. RU-486, the "French abortion pill" that received FDA 
approval only last fall, is threatened with difficult restrictions.
<P>Most worrisome of all, Bush will undoubtedly have the opportunity to 
nominate one or more Supreme Court justices, and one of these may be the vote 
that overturns Roe vs. Wade. The numbers that gather in protest may be even 
greater, and passions higher, if Americans realize that this administration 
opposes not just abortion rights, but a much broader set of reproductive 
services.
<P>The president stunned many last week by presenting a budget that included 
ending contraceptive coverage in the health plans of federal employees. This 
move will affect even more women than the thousands of federal workers 
involved because private insurance companies often take their lead from what 
is covered under the federal health insurance plan.
<P>In an ironic twist, it was this president's father, George H. W. Bush, who 
in 1967, as a congressman from Texas, was a key sponsor of legislation 
establishing the first federal program to make family planning services more 
widely available in the United States.
<P>These two quite different political acts tell us more about how the 
Republican Party's ideological character has changed over 30 years than they 
do about any genuine differences between father and son.
<P>By the 1980s, much of the Republican Party was in thrall to a group of 
religious extremists whose crusade against birth control is nearly as fervent 
as its opposition to abortion. As president, the senior Bush dutifully did 
everything possible to impede access to contraception and abortion, including 
attacks on the family planning program he sponsored.
<P>His son's actions since his first day in office have shown more than an 
hostility to abortion. Bush has embraced the extremists' broad assault on 
reproductive freedom. He started his presidency with an executive order 
reinstating the so-called "global gag rule" -- a policy which forbids the 
federal government from giving family planning money to countries or 
organizations that spend their own funds for abortion services or counseling.
<P>This misguided policy of withholding family planning aid will only increase 
unwanted pregnancies -- and add to the tragic number of 75,000 women who die 
each year in the developing world from illegal abortions.
<P>Bush's moves against both foreign and domestic family planning programs 
will further cement his credentials with his "social conservative" right-wing 
base. For years, this group has viewed contraception as "supportive of the 
abortion mentality," rather than the way most of us see it -- as preventing 
unwanted pregnancies, and hence abortions.
<P>In casting his lot with the extremists on birth control, Bush is buying a 
package that includes the requirement that government support for sex 
education should go exclusively to "abstinence only" programs.
<P>Programs geared toward pregnancy prevention or AIDS prevention are not 
allowed to mention any form of birth control, including condoms, or they lose 
their federal funding. Bush's budget adds millions of dollars to such 
"abstinence only" programs.
<P>Bush's right-wing allies have also done everything possible to deny 
American women information about and access to Emergency Contraception ("the 
morning-after pill"). This drug's ability to prevent pregnancy up to 72 hours 
after unprotected intercourse has long been known by researchers, but to date 
only 1 percent of American women have used it.
<P>If used properly, this pill could prevent as many as half the approximately 
3 million unplanned pregnancies that now occur annually in this country. It 
would thus reduce abortion rates.
<P>Even though health experts insist that Emergency Contraception cannot 
disrupt an established pregnancy, the pill is viewed as an "abortafacient" by 
the right. We can expect administration officials to attempt to block efforts 
by women's health advocates to expand access to the pill.
<P>But in opposing contraception, as well as abortion, Bush may have 
overplayed his hand. While the public is divided on abortion, no such 
ambivalence exists about birth control. Many Americans viewed it as a scandal 
when health insurance plans that did not cover contraception began to cover 
Viagra after its U.S. debut in 1998. The rapid approval by Congress of Viagra 
coverage under the federal health care plan, had -- thanks to the efforts of a 
group of determined congresswomen -- the unintended effect of spurring 
embarrassed legislators to vote for birth control coverage as well.
<P>When mainstream Americans, including many Republicans, encounter the full 
sexual agenda of the right, they find such positions unacceptable -- not to 
mention absurd, given the stated goal of reducing the number of abortions.
<P>Diane DeGette, a pro-choice congresswoman from Denver, speaking of Bush's 
move against contraceptive coverage, said, "If the suburban women who live 
near my district knew this, they would march on Washington." Well, women -- 
and men -- are planning to march on Washington for abortion rights. Their 
banners should also demand the right to birth control coverage for all 
Americans who need it, as well as sensible sex education and access to 
Emergency Contraception. And President Bush will be sent a message he would be 
foolish to ignore.
