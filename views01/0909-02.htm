As the youth of America head back to school this year, they will face a much greater chance of being kicked out than their parents did when they were in school.
<P>Ironically, today's kids are at least as well behaved as their parents were at the same age. The headlines would be almost comical if they didn't have real-world implications for flesh and blood students.</P>
<P>A pair of kindergartners in New Jersey were suspended for forming their hands into a gun and saying "bang, bang" on their school's playground. Two 10-year-olds from Arlington, Va., were actually prosecuted for putting hand soap into their teacher's coffee as a prank. A 13-year-old in Denton County, Texas, who wrote a scary story for an English class on which he received a passing grade, was suspended from school and locked up for six days.</P>
<P>While these individual news stories can be written off as isolated overreactions, the most recent data published by the U.S. Department of Education has quantified the impact of zero tolerance policies on America's young people. Their data show that public school students are nearly twice as likely to be suspended from school as students were during the 1970s.</P>
<P>In the 1974-'75 school year 1.7 million youths - or about 3.7% of all students - were suspended from schools. By the 1997-'98 school year, a whopping 3.2 million students were suspended from public schools. That works out to 6.8% of all students or about one out of every 15 students enrolled in public schools.</P>
<P>Surely, this must be because students today are worse behaved than students in the halcyon 1970s. Not so.</P>
<P>According to the Department of Justice, the percentage of students reporting they were injured with a weapon in 1999 was almost identical to what it was in 1976. Students today also report similar rates of being threatened in schools and having their belongings stolen.</P>
<P>In additional to behaving as well as the baby boom generation did in school, today's young people are better behaved on a variety of other indicators outside of school.</P>
<P>Youth today are less likely to commit homicides, get pregnant during their teen years, and take drugs or binge drink than youth during the late 1970s. Yet nearly two-thirds of Americans believe youth crime is on the increase.</P>
<P>As young people face the harsh winds of zero tolerance policies despite their good behavior, we need to take a careful look at the outcomes of such policies. When we do, what we see is scary.</P>
<P>According to the Centers for Disease Control, students kicked out of school are more likely to take drugs, engage in sex and use weapons than young people who remain in school. Students who have been suspended are three times as likely as non-suspended students to drop out of school permanently. Reams of studies have shown that high school graduation is positively associated with earnings and employment in adulthood.</P>
<P>No one can watch bloody bodies being wheeled out of schools on gurneys and not be deeply affected. But if we victimize students again by intolerant policies despite their good behavior, we will only serve to compound the problems our young people face in getting a good education and transitioning from adolescence into adulthood.</P>
<P>
