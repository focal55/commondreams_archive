The message was clear -- passage of the Bush Administration's
giant windfall-for-the-wealthy tax cut will reverse the Clinton-caused stock
market slide and recession that's wiping out the retirement plans of middle
income and working class Americans and turning the oil and energy cartel
loose in the United States to extract more oil and gas and build more
nuclear plants to produce an increasing "supply" of energy will ease
Clinton-caused energy crisis.  For a prime time hour Wednesday night the
General Electric Corporation, via their subsidiary MSNBC-TV,  presented
Vice-President Dick Cheney, being "interviewed" by his folksy former
Congressional sidekick from Wyoming, retired U.S. Senator Allen Simpson. 

<p>Much of the show consisted of down home descriptions of the
homespun and honest nature of their political activities, complete with
family photos and  wife-praising, when Cheney was Congressman and Simpson
was the Senator from their straight-shooting, "Cowboy" State of
wide-open-spaces and people you can trust. .  Reeking with rugged western
integrity, the chiseled-faced Simpson was Will Rogers-like with his
wise-cracking about how he came back to Wyoming from Washington every two
years to campaign for Cheney's reelection to Congress so Cheney wouldn't run
against him for Senate.  Simpson asked Cheney about the crooks and outlaws
that ran against him to set up Cheney's response about an opponent who
advocated legalization of marijuana and won only ten percent of the vote
with Cheney adding he didn't know that many people smoked the stuff in
Wyoming.  In a labored effort to emanate bi-partisanship Simpson queried
Cheney about his love for history and asked him who were his  favorite
Presidents.  Cheney mentioned George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Harry
Truman and then Simpson reminded him to add John Kennedy, and Cheney added
another liberal Democrat to his list of favorites.

<p>I am impressed and terrified by the cunningly calculating attempt by
the Bush Administration to present a big time player from the global energy
cartel like Dick Cheney as a good ol' boy from Wyoming who blames the price
of energy on a short "supply" because of our reliance on "foreign oil".
Cheney was CEO and holder of 45 million dollars worth of stock in
Halliburton, Inc. for five years before becoming George W. Bush's running
mate.  Halliburton's most famous subsidiary is Brown and Root, a heavy
construction and oil giant, that employs 20,000 people in more than 100
countries.  With it's sister companies and joint ventures, Brown and Root
builds offshore oil rigs, drills wells,  constructs nuclear reactors and has
a history of dealing directly with the U. S. military and providing cover
for CIA operations.  In 1998 with Cheney as CEO, Halliburton bought oil
industry equipment and drilling supplier Dresser Industries for $8.1
billion.  President Bush's grandfather, Prescott Bush, once served as
managing director of the company that owned Dresser. Other Halliburton
subsidiaries include NUMAR Corporation that provides nuclear magnetic
resonance to measure while drilling oil and Landmark Graphics Corporation
that supplies production information systems and services helping energy
companies worldwide to find, produce and manage oil and gas reservoirs.
Under Cheney's leadership Halliburton also enjoyed $3.8 billion in federal
contracts and taxpayer insured loans.

<p>Just after the record breaking fund raising efforts of the George W.
Bush campaign, spearheaded by many businessmen with financial interests in
the global energy cartel, the  OPEC group announced an increase in oil
prices.  With Bush the overwhelming favorite to win the Republican
nomination energy prices continued to increase and by mid-year 2000 the
price of energy began to take it's toll on business costs and the stock
market.  While the old line conventional wisdom would try to blame it all on
the over-priced technology sector most market analysts agree that the
economic downturn has been precipitated to a large degree by the price of
energy.  

<p>The other out-dated blame game employed by energy czar Cheney is
blaming short "supply" and OPEC when it's obvious that the energy cartel
uses OPEC as the instrument to "drum up" the world wide price of energy so
everyone can make more money.  Cheney's own  Halliburton-Brown and Root
energy axis has more than enough connections with leaders of OPEC members to
influence OPEC's pricing policies.   Through OPEC the fix is on once again
as the whole global energy apparatus rips us off and raises havoc with our
energy dependent world.  Now Cheney's energy business buddies have an excuse
to get much, much richer at our expense as they have created an excuse to
plunder and despoil the natural habitat of our country.   

<p>Making news from the Cheney "interview" with Simpson was
Cheney's disclaimer of support of the 1997  Kyoto global warming treaty
signed by President Clinton to limit industrial-nation emissions of carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause global warming.  Perhaps in
deference to his buddies at Brown and Root who make nuclear plants, Cheney
said his energy policy team would take another look at building some new
nuclear generating plants that have no "adverse consequences" on global
warming.  The General Electric Corporation whose MSNBC-TV presented the
prime time "interview" also happens to own GE Nuclear Energy whose web site
says they designed and help to operate 91 boiling water reactors in 11
countries that provide about 4 % of the world's energy needs and includes a
pitch for new customers world wide. There is an old saying out in Wyoming
that you "get what you pay for" and the energy  barons and their rich
friends who raised the big bucks for George W. Bush are poised to cash in
with a gigantic tax break for themselves and bigger profits for the energy
business.
