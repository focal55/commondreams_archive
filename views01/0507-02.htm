JUST when you thought sanity had returned, the Bush administration has resurrected the weird, wacky world of Pentagon spending.
<P>

   At the same time that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan began a worldwide crusade trying to drum up money to fight AIDS in Africa, which is decimating as much as one-fifth of the population in some countries, the Army has announced it will throw away millions of dollars' worth of black berets it ordered to replace headgear no intelligent person thought needed replacing in the first place.
<P>

   That's because the berets came from China, which held 24 Americans for 11 days and seized their spy plane that crash-landed on its territory after being buzzed by a Chinese fighter plane. The new batch of black berets will just have to be duplicated somewhere else.
<P>

   The United States will spend $325 billion on military defense next year. All other U.S. discretionary spending combined for next year (not counting Social Security, Medicare and interest on the national debt) will total $342 billion.
<P>

   Thus, more than a decade after the Cold War, just about half of all federal spending not devoted to entitlements goes to the military.
<P>

   That $325 billion compares with just over $7 billion the Russians are spending on their military, notes the Senate's foreign policy expert, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
<P>

   That $325 billion compares with $42 billion spent by the federal government on education (Bush's top domestic priority) for one year.
<P>

   And that $325 billion does not count anything extra for research on President Bush's costly goal of trying to develop a national missile defense system.
<P>

   It does not count the hundreds of millions of dollars that it will cost to dismantle thousands of nuclear warheads stockpiled by the United States and Russia, as Bush says he wants to do.
<P>

   It does not dramatically increase spending to provide more benefits to improve military morale, as Bush pledged to do.
<P>

   No other nation comes close to spending what the United States spends on its military, which the Pentagon says is not nearly enough.
<P>

   Somewhat wearily, Lugar notes that defense spending is like agriculture spending, with its subsidies for the mohair, sugar, peanut, indigo and tobacco industries; significant changes should be made, but overturning the status quo seems impossible.
<P>

   Lugar currently is chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and tilts regularly and unsuccessfully at the windmill that former President Reagan set spinning -- a campaign to dump millions of dollars of outmoded agricultural subsidies. Agriculture lobbyists band together to keep any subsidies from being cut, just as defense lobbyists march in lock-step on Capitol Hill.
<P>

   Before Bush proposes to spend a lot more than $325 billion on defense (and he will), he asked Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to do a ``complete review'' of the nation's current and long-term military needs, commitments to allies and defense-related industries. That review is supposed to be wrapped up this summer.
<P>

   You would be safe in assuming Rumsfeld's review will not propose a reduction in that $325 billion. You would probably be safe in predicting that in the next decade the nation will spend at least $3.5 trillion on defense although the nation's current enemies are not standing armies or rogue nations with arsenals of nuclear missiles but sneaky terrorists.
<P>

   It's been a few years since the $600-hammers-and-toilet-seats procurement scandal, but once again the Pentagon is not covering itself with glory even as it gets set to ask for hundreds of billions more over the next decade.
<P>

   The bumbling over berets was followed immediately by another strange incident. For a few interesting hours the other day, the Pentagon said all military contacts with China would cease even as the White House is desperately trying to minimize the diplomatic damage from the spy plane incident. Oops, said a hasty Pentagon statement released shortly thereafter:
<P>

   ``An internal Department of Defense staff memorandum dated April 30 misinterpreted the position of Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld regarding military-to-military contacts with the People's Republic of China. The secretary's guidance requires that all DoD programs, contacts and activities with the People's Republic of China will be reviewed and approved on a case-by-case basis.''
<P>

   Maybe after that black eye for his department, Rumsfeld will type up his review himself just to make sure the number of billions of dollars he will say must be added to defense spending is what he intended to seek.
