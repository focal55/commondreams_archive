Old habits die hard, especially when it comes to US foreign policy. On November 
10 George W. Bush appeared before the United Nations General Assembly and, in 
a speech praised by the <i>New York Times</i> for its "plain-spoken eloquence," 
admonished his audience that the responsibility to fight terrorism is "binding 
on every nation with a place in this chamber." Bush apparently felt no need to 
practice what he preached about international responsibilities, though. On the 
same day--indeed, at the very moment--he was lecturing UN members, his own Administration 
was shunning negotiations in Marrakech, Morocco, to finalize the Kyoto accord 
on global warming. 
<p> "How long can the Administration turn its back on issues the rest of the world 
cares about--from global warming to trade in small arms--and expect broad support 
on issues like the war on terrorism?" asked Philip Clapp, president of the National 
Environmental Trust. Bush's double standard is all the more grating, considering 
that the United States is the leading source of the greenhouse gas emissions that 
cause global warming. </p>
<p> Like terrorism, global warming is an issue in which every nation has a stake. 
Already the Earth's glaciers are melting and catastrophic storms are becoming 
more severe and more frequent--this, after a mere 1 degree Fahrenheit increase 
in temperatures over the past century. Scientists expect four to eleven degrees 
of additional warming by 2100, bringing more violent weather, flooded coastlines 
and social havoc. New research released in Marrakech by the UN Environmental Program 
warns that global crop yields could fall 30 percent over the twenty-first century. 
</p>
<p> The Kyoto accord addresses this danger by ordering industrial nations to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions 5.2 percent by 2012, compared with 1990 levels--a very 
modest target, considering that scientists say global emissions must eventually 
be cut 60 percent. Last summer in Bonn, 178 nations signed the accord; the meeting 
in Marrakech, where US officials observed but did not participate, hammered out 
rules for implementation. "Other countries have chosen their path, and our answer 
is still no," said a Bush Administration official. </p>
<p> Will Marrakech make much difference? The good news is that the world has put 
in place a binding framework requiring greenhouse gas reductions, and this framework 
will likely become law despite the US boycott. To come into force, the accord 
must be ratified by fifty-five countries, including a group responsible for at 
least 55 percent of the industrial world's emissions. Forty smaller nations have 
already ratified it, but with the United States holding out, the 55 percent standard 
can be reached only if the European Union, Russia and Japan all ratify. The EU 
has long been on board, and in Marrakech the Russians said they were finally satisfied. 
Japan's deputy chief cabinet secretary is pushing for a ratification vote in January, 
and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has signaled his support. So Kyoto could 
become law as early as next spring (although the United States, because it didn't 
sign, won't be bound by it). A further bright spot: Delegates at Marrakech authorized 
$410 million a year by 2005 for a "clean development mechanism" to subsidize the 
shift from carbon-based fuels in poor countries. </p>
<p> The bad news is that the Kyoto accord got so watered down in Marrakech that 
it may have very little practical effect during the next ten years, when progress 
is most needed. The original accord relied heavily on emissions trading, a dubious 
mechanism that allows countries whose emissions are less than the maximum permitted, 
like Russia, to sell their excess to countries that are over their quota, like 
Japan. Now this loophole has been not only codified but expanded. The chief culprit 
is Russia, which has 120 million tons of emissions to trade and which also demanded 
twice as much credit as previously agreed on for the role its vast forests can 
play in absorbing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Meanwhile, two studies 
published in <i>Nature </i>this past July suggest that forests are not nearly 
as effective in neutralizing emissions as was thought. </p>
<p> Some environmentalists argue that these loopholes can be fixed later, that 
the emissions targets will be gradually tightened and eventually produce meaningful 
effects. And it's true that since carbon will now have a price in the marketplace, 
thanks to emissions trading, corporations, governments and individuals may make 
better choices about the products they produce and consume. US firms might even 
obey the accord, despite Washington's stance, in order not to be left behind by 
foreign competitors. But wouldn't it be easier if the United States simply showed 
as much commitment to the battle against global warming as it demands from everyone 
else in the battle against terrorism? </p>
