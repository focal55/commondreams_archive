 AMERICAN PRESIDENT George W. Bush asks the world to make a choice between the U.S. and terrorism. Would that it were that simple.<P></P> The problem is that the United States has in the past supported what many people in the world regard as terror - terror equal to that suffered by New York and Washington.<P></P> From its bloody pacification of the Philippines early in the 20th century to its support of the murderous Pinochet regime in Chile, the U.S. has carried out actions that a majority of its own people, had they been paying attention, would almost certainly have abhorred.<P></P> Ironically, the U.S.-backed 1973 coup - against a democratically-elected government - that brought Augusto Pinochet to power in Chile occurred on Sept. 11 - the same day as the attacks on Washington and New York.<P></P> To point this out is not to be anti-American. It is to state facts. Indeed, it is to state facts usually raised by Americans, themselves, who, to their credit, are often their own harshest critics.<P></P> It is also a fact that the U.S. does much that would make any nation proud. Americans are generous by nature. Perhaps that is why they are so shocked to discover how much they are hated in parts of the world.<P></P> I raise all of this in an attempt to clarify. There are those who say this is not the time to examine the root causes of the terror attacks. They could not be more wrong. This is precisely the time, particularly for journalists.<P></P> If we do not understand what motivates people to fly jet planes into big buildings we have no chance - no chance - of stopping them. If we do not act to fix the situations that give rise to these murderous attacks, we can only fail.<P></P> This is the lesson from virtually every other incidence of terrorism in the world. The glimmer of hope that still flickers in Northern Ireland did not come as a result of Britain's draconian anti-terrorist laws. It came because, eventually, the British government decided to try for a political solution that could satisfy supporters of the Irish Republican Army.<P></P> Yet in these odd times, Canadians who even raise similar suggestions are shouted down as Quislings and traitors. <P></P> Luckily, the Bush administration is more clear-headed. It quickly understood that it could not win against terror while the Middle Eastern question continued to fester and is now putting the screws on Israel and the Palestinians to talk to each other.<P></P> 
Not so here. Here, Prime Minister Jean Chretien is attacked for not being sufficiently warlike. The fact that Bush didn't mention Canada in his speech to Congress last Thursday is treated by some as evidence of our failings. (Only in Canada could this be a story. What other nation is so obsessed with how it is viewed in the U.S.?)
<P></P> 
I'm not a fan of the Liberal government. But it seems to me that Chretien has been doing what he should. He expressed this country's sorrow. He said Canada would help fight terror. He, along with other NATO leaders, agreed in principle to come to America's aid.
<P></P> 
What more is it that his critics want him to do? Is Canada supposed to give Bush a blank check? Should we commit ourselves irrevocably to whatever the U.S. wants to do? Wouldn't it be better to find out first what it is the Americans have in mind and then decide whether we want to join in? That, presumably, was what yesterday's meeting between the two leaders was for.
<P></P> 
In the end, nations have their own interests. Those who want Canada to rush unthinkingly into whatever military adventure the U.S. is contemplating say this is what good neighbors do. They forget this has not always been the practice.
<P></P> The U.S. did not follow Canada automatically into war in 1914. Nor did it do so in 1939. In the war against Hitler, it waited two years - and then acted only because its own territory was attacked.<P></P> This was not from moral cowardice. Nor was it because the Americans didn't like us. They were merely exercising understandable caution. War is serious business, one not entered into just because a few politicians and journalists (none of whom will have to fight) have their blood up.<P></P> So, is Canada for terrorism? Clearly, the answer is no. If the choice Bush posed last week had been between support for and opposition to terrorism, there would be no question as to where we stand.<P></P> But are we for the U.S.? That is a trickier question. We were not during its Vietnam adventure. Nor were we in the 1980s when the U.S. supported state terrorism in El Salvador and Honduras. We are still not when it comes to Cuba.<P></P> As for this time - let's see. Let's see what Bush has in mind. If it is an invasion of Afghanistan he is contemplating, we may want to sit this one out. But let's talk rationally before we decide. Surely that is not asking too much.<P><i>Thomas Walkom's column appears on Tuesday.</i></p>
