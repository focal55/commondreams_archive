How long would it take you to stitch a shoulder seam? <p>
If you&#0039;re making a kid-size Nike sweatshirt in the Dominican Republic, it better not take you more than 30.35 seconds. That&#0039;s half a minute. For both shoulders.<p>
&quot;We found these documents in a garbage dump in the Dominican Republic,&quot; grins Charlie Kernaghan, America&#0039;s leading anti-sweatshop activist, as we chat at a Niketown in Manhattan. &quot;These documents&quot; are Nike&#0039;s SAM requirements - Standard Allotted Minutes. For every step of every item, Nike has calculated how much time it will allow, to the 1,000th of a second. The grand total from start to finish - raw cloth to stitched, labeled and bagged kiddie sweatshirt? It&#0039;s 6.6 minutes. <p>
Given that Dominican sweatshop wages are about 70 cents an hour, the labor on that shirt cost about 11 cents. The cost of it to you, at a department store, is $22.99. Go ahead and gulp. <p>
This gaping disparity explains why the fight against overseas sweatshops - particularly market-leader Nike&#0039;s - has become the biggest civil rights movement on American campuses. <p>
College students have been agitating their universities to stop allowing Nike to manufacture their official college apparel until Nike cleans up its act. This led to some reforms, including a Nike Web site - Nikebiz.com - that finally discloses where Nike&#0039;s contractors are based around the world. <p>
Over spring break, New York University student Katie Griffiths went down to a big Nike contractor (Nike doesn&#0039;t own any factories, it just hires them) in Puebla, Mexico. A few months ago the workers there had staged a walkout, initially spurred by rancid meat in the cafeteria. <p>
But the workers were protesting more than just maggots. They wanted the right to organize and a raise beyond their $4 or $5 a day. They were fired, en masse.<p>
Under pressure from the student groups, however, the young women were eventually hired back. (&quot;About 85 percent of all sweatshop workers are women my age,&quot; notes Griffiths, 19.) &quot;And the factory has a new catering contract,&quot; says Nike spokesman Vada Manager.<p>
&quot;Nike jumps from country to country in search of low wages,&quot; says Kernaghan. &quot;For example, they&#0039;ve got tens of thousands [of workers] in Cambodia where wages are 19 cents an hour. In China it&#0039;s 20 to 25 cents.&quot; <p>
Nike&#0039;s Manager contends these are great wages. But he also admits that a 60-hour work week is not uncommon. And labor is but a small fraction of his goods&#0039; cost - 4 percent, he estimates. But in fact the 11 cents it took to make that kiddie sweatshirt is less than 1 percent of the retail cost.<p>
Why couldn&#0039;t Nike pay 22 cents for that sweatshirt and double its workers&#0039; wages? Manager contends this would lead to disaster - for the workers! &quot;If you exponentially increase labor costs, that impacts on the cost of production, which then means the retail cost may increase, which then reduces the amount of [items] sold&quot; - and leads to worker layoffs. <p>
But I don&#0039;t think an extra 11 cents would keep anyone from buying a shirt, do you? <p>
The only way to get Nike to change is to demand it. A boycott isn&#0039;t the answer - it really could lead to layoffs, warns Kernaghan. But letters and e-mails to CEO Phil Knight, who is worth $4.1 billion, will let Nike know its swoosh is becoming synonymous with <i>sweatshop.</i><p>
