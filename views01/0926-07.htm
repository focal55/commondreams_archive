<i>"They have attacked America because we are freedom's home and 
defender; This crusade, this war on terrorism, is going to take a 
while, but we will rid the world of the evil-doers."</i> 
–President George W. Bush

<p>It’s been two, short weeks since the World Trade Center attack, 
and I’m absolutely terrified. The most powerful country in the world 
is wallowing in its own panic, and in so doing tearing at the roots of 
our liberty here at home, and planting the seeds for terrible violence 
throughout the world. Almost 7,000 innocent Americans are dead, 
the UN has pulled aid workers out of Afghanistan in fear of U.S. 
retaliation, hundreds of thousands of refugees there are on the 
move, and the World Food Program is warning that as many as 5 
million Afghanis could starve to death as a result. Are our lives 
really this fragile?

<p>Without any debate or even much discussion, Congress has given 
the President a $40 billion “down payment” to fight a war on 
terrorism, and granted him extraordinary and unprecedented 
powers to do it with. It seems clear that the government will soon 
repeal restrictions preventing us from conducting extrajudicial 
executions – assassinations – hiring known human rights abusers, 
and will grant the Justice Department sweeping powers to conduct 
wiretaps and massive surveillance. And we’ve only just started 
fighting this war. This “crusade” has barely just begun. Truth be 
told, I’m scared to death what tomorrow may bring. Are our lives 
really this fragile?

<p>Terror is as much of a threat to our humanity as it is to our lives 
and property. If we would kill, or allow to be killed, innocents to 
protect "our way of life," then what is it that we are protecting? If we 
would kill, or allow to be killed, innocents then we will be morally 
indistinguishable from that which we claim to be fighting: terror. We 
have our “reasons," yes, but then so do the people we are 
opposing. They are also responding to something. They also claim 
to be defending something. They also find justifications for their 
actions - rationalizations for the unjustifiable. 

<p>It is distressing to watch as we recklessly pretend that the men 
who killed themselves in order to strike so terribly at us on 
September 11th attacked us, as the President said, “because we 
are freedom’s home and defender.” It is distressing to imagine that 
we are unable to see that their pain is like our pain; unable to 
imagine that their actions here might have been in response to our 
actions there. These people are locked out of the political 
structures of their own nations in part because of our actions and 
support. They see us acting in ways that they define as 
"terrorism." Are the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians who’ve 
been killed over 11 years of bombings and blockade really this 
invisible to us? Are the daily humiliations and deaths of 
Palestinians struggling under a vicious, military occupation that we 
help fund and support really this invisible to us? Are our lives really 
this fragile?

<p>Our anger toward the terrorists who killed so many innocent 
Americans is reflected in our victims and would-be victims across 
the world with the oldest and clearest lesson in the history of the 
world: violence begets violence. 

<p>There are a set of beliefs operating here, from within our pain, that 
refuses to acknowledge reality. Without confronting these 
misconceptions it will be very difficult to move forward. We must 
not continue a cycle of violence where our feelings of pain cause us 
to lash out and create similar feelings in those whom we would 
deem responsible for our suffering. For in imposing unjustifiable 
suffering on others we break our own compact, and become 
ourselves like these terrorists. Today, as we move so recklessly 
toward war, what seeds are we planting for future catastrophes? 

<p>When Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) says, “We are coming after you. 
God may have mercy on you, but we won't,” he is speaking from 
pain and in panic. When Sen. Zell Miller (D-GA) says, “Bomb the 
hell out of them. If there's collateral damage, so be it. They 
certainly found our civilians to be expendable,” he’s speaking from 
pain and in panic. When Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul 
Wolfowitz says that we are going to “end states” that sponsor 
terrorism, and our entire government puts the world on notice that 
everyone must “choose sides,” that we no longer differentiate 
between terrorists and the countries they may live in, and that they 
are either “with us or against us” - we are speaking from out of our 
pain and our panic. Our lives really are this fragile.

<p>Arabs and Muslims desire no more - or less - than the things we 
desire: peace, security, a chance to build a brighter future for 
ourselves and our families. Though they will never secure peace 
through violence, or security through violence, these extremist 
movements  make inroads among all peoples when moderate ones 
fail to secure these basic forms of human dignity for their peoples. 
As we are witnessing right here, right now. Our lives really are this 
fragile.

<p>We must face our own pain, and the pain we have caused others, 
with understanding and compassion. We must face the hatred we 
have sown around the world, and the hatred we have sown in our 
own hearts, with understanding and compassion. We must meet 
violence, at home and abroad, inside ourselves and in the world 
around us, with love. Our lives really are this fragile.

<p>We are supposed to be a nation of law. We are supposed to stand 
for justice, for human rights and for civil liberties; not for blind or 
indiscriminate violence and vengeance, and not for panic. If we 
would stop terrorism, we must go after its root causes: poverty, 
injustice, oppression. A superficial attempt to go after the 
symptoms of this problem rather than its wellspring will surely fail, 
and to disregard the rule of law and claim that we can attack 
anyone anywhere on "evidence" we will subsequently refuse to 
release, to kill other's children to supposedly protect ours - all of 
this will set a terrible precedent. It will say to the world that the 
only law we acknowledge outside of our borders is a drumhead 
court's, a star chamber's. It will say that all we really respect is our 
own power, thereby demonstrating to others that power is all we 
will really respond to. But none of the causes in this world - 
including our self-“defense”- is worth a single, innocent life. Not 
one. That’s their logic, terrorist logic - that we must to kill to save 
the world. The truth is the exact opposite: as both the Torah and 
the Qu’ran teach, “To save one life is as if you have saved the 
world.”

<p>On September 16th Vice-President Cheney said, “I think this is 
going to be a struggle that the United States is going to be involved 
in for the foreseeable future. . . . It's going to require constant 
vigilance on our part…” He’s absolutely correct. And we must 
remember that constant vigilance is not just the price for 
maintaining our liberty and our humanity - it’s also the cost of 
destroying them. Our lives are really that fragile.
