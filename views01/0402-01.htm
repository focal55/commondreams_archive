WASHINGTON -- The United States' decision to abandon its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol has sent shock waves around the world, setting off the most serious international environmental policy crisis in years. The move by President George W. Bush to walk away from the historic climate agreement puts at risk a decade of efforts to protect the world from climate change.
<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>
The world cannot afford to wait another decade for a new climate protocol to be drafted. From the ice cap at the North Pole, which has lost 40 percent of its thickness in the last decade, to the coral reefs near the Equator, one-quarter of which have been killed by rising ocean temperatures and other stresses, the Earth is telling us that we are entering an era of dangerous climate change that is threatening human populations around the world. Already, economic damage from natural disasters has reached more than $600 billion over the last decade, as much as in the previous four decades combined.
<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>
Although Mr. Bush has argued that the Kyoto Protocol could damage the economy, not implementing the treaty would actually be more damaging. Outside the United States, many countries are moving rapidly to pursue a new generation of 21st-century energy technologies such as fuel cells, wind turbines and solar electric generators. In Europe, the market for wind power and other renewable energy technologies is growing at double digit rates, providing more than 10 percent of the electricity in some regions.
<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>
The attempt by the Bush administration, with its deep personal and financial ties to the fossil fuel industry, to turn the country back to oil and coal, the energy sources of an earlier era, would be a costly economic mistake. In the end, those countries that address climate change earliest will dominate the major new markets for the energy technology of the 21st century - and create millions of jobs in the process.
<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>
The Bush administration has put the other 150 countries that have joined it in signing the Kyoto Protocol in an unenviable position. The United States is the 500-pound gorilla of global greenhouse gas emissions. Not only does it account for nearly one-quarter of global carbon dioxide emissions but it is doing little to control those emissions.
<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>
Since 1990, the base year for the Kyoto Protocol, U.S. emissions have grown by an additional 13 percent, while Europe's have only increased 1 percent. The increase in U.S. emissions over the last 10 years equals the combined emissions increase from China, India and Africa, rapidly developing regions that between them have a population more than 10 times that of the United States.
<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>
Reducing America's insatiable appetite for fossil fuels is essential to stabilizing the earth's climate. Allowing the United States to delay further a treaty that is already years behind schedule could derail the efforts of scores of other countries to develop renewable energy technologies, improve energy efficiency and develop trading systems to reduce emissions economically.
<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>
The Kyoto Protocol is not perfect, largely because of loopholes insisted on by the previous U.S. administration. But a responsible U.S. government would have joined other governments in the now three-year effort to improve and complete that agreement, rather than insist on starting over because one of 150 governments had a change of heart.
<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>
Indeed, Kyoto is now all that is standing between us and a future of more severe storms and rising sea levels. It is time for Europe, Japan and other countries to call the U.S. bluff and adopt the protocol. In doing so, they could delete some of the problematic elements that were insisted on by America - and which caused the breakdown in climate talks in The Hague last autumn. These include the ability to buy &quot;hot air&quot; credits generated by the collapse of industrial emissions in Russia and the right to take credit for the carbon absorbed by trees. A simpler, clearer Kyoto Protocol would have greater political credibility and be easier to enforce.
<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>
For many decades, the world has relied on the United States to lead the way in international environmental agreements. But that hope is now gone. Unlike the Clinton administration, whose opposition to Kyoto was tentative and opaque, the Bush administration's opposition is crude, unambiguous and will not be reversed.
<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>
It is now time for countries such as Germany, France and Japan, that have long lamented U.S. obstructionism, to take on the mantle of leadership that has been dropped so unceremoniously by the new American government.
<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>
