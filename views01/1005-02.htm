During the first two days of this month, CNN's website displayed 
an odd little announcement. "There have been false reports that CNN has not 
used the word 'terrorist' to refer to those who attacked the World Trade 
Center and Pentagon," the notice said. "In fact, CNN has consistently and 
repeatedly referred to the attackers and hijackers as terrorists, and it 
will continue to do so."

         <p>The CNN disclaimer was accurate -- and, by conventional media 
standards, reassuring. But it bypassed a basic question that festers 
beneath America's overwhelming media coverage of recent weeks: Exactly what 
qualifies as "terrorism"?

         <p>For this country's mainstream journalists, that's a non-question 
about a no-brainer. More than ever, the proper function of the "terrorist" 
label seems obvious. "A group of people commandeered airliners and used 
them as guided missiles against thousands of people," says NBC News 
executive Bill Wheatley. "If that doesn't fit the definition of terrorism, 
what does?"

         <p>True enough. At the same time, it's notable that American news 
outlets routinely define terrorism the same way that U.S. government 
officials do. Usually, editors assume that reporters don't need any formal 
directive because the appropriate usage is simply understood.

         <p>The Wall Street Journal does provide some guidelines, telling its 
staff that the word terrorist "should be used carefully, and specifically, 
to describe those people and nongovernmental organizations that plan and 
execute acts of violence against civilian or noncombatant targets." In 
newsrooms across the United States, media professionals would agree.

         <p>But -- in sharp contrast -- Reuters has stuck to a distinctive 
approach for decades. "As part of a policy to avoid the use of emotive 
words," the global news service says, "we do not use terms like 'terrorist' 
and 'freedom fighter' unless they are in a direct quote or are otherwise 
attributable to a third party. We do not characterize the subjects of news 
stories but instead report their actions, identity and background so that 
readers can make their own decisions based on the facts."

         <p>Since mid-September, the Reuters management has taken a lot of 
heat for maintaining this policy -- and for reiterating it in an internal 
memo, which included the observation that "one man's terrorist is another 
man's freedom fighter." In a clarifying statement, released on Oct. 2, the 
top execs at Reuters explained: "Our policy is to avoid the use of 
emotional terms and not make value judgments concerning the facts we 
attempt to report accurately and fairly."

         <p>Reuters reports from 160 countries, and the "terrorist" label is 
highly contentious in quite a few of them. Behind the scenes, many 
governments have pressured Reuters to flatly describe their enemies as 
terrorists in news dispatches.

         <p>From the vantage point of government leaders in Ankara or 
Jerusalem or Moscow, for example, journalists shouldn't hesitate to 
describe their violent foes as terrorists. But why should reporters oblige 
by pinning that tag on Kurdish combatants in Turkey, or Palestinian 
militants in occupied territories, or rebels in Chechnya?

         <p>Unless we buy into the absurd pretense that governments don't 
engage in "terrorism," the circumscribed use of the term by U.S. media 
makes no sense. Turkish military forces have certainly terrorized and 
killed many civilians; the same is true of Israeli forces and Russian 
troops. As a result, plenty of Kurds, Palestinians and Chechens are grieving.

         <p>American reporters could plausibly expand their working definition 
of terrorism to include all organized acts of terror and murder committed 
against civilians. But such consistency would meet with fierce opposition 
in high Washington places.

         <p>During the 1980s, with a non-evasive standard for terrorism, news 
accounts would have routinely referred to the Nicaraguan contra guerrillas 
-- in addition to the Salvadoran and Guatemalan governments -- as 
U.S.-backed "terrorists." Today, for instance, such a standard would 
require news coverage of terrorism in the Middle East to include the 
Israeli assaults with bullets and missiles that take the lives of 
Palestinian children and other civilians.

         <p>Sadly, the evenhanded use of the "terrorist" label would mean 
sometimes affixing it directly on the U.S. government. During the past 
decade, from Iraq to Sudan to Yugoslavia, the Pentagon's missiles have 
destroyed the lives of civilians just as innocent as those who perished on 
Sept. 11. If journalists dare not call that "terrorism," then perhaps the 
word should be retired from the media lexicon.

         <p>It's entirely appropriate for news outlets to describe the Sept. 
11 hijackers as "terrorists" -- if those outlets are willing to use the 
"terrorist" label with integrity across the board. But as long as news 
organizations are not willing to do so, the Reuters policy is the only 
principled journalistic alternative.
