This time, they said, it would be different. It would be effective, it was unprecedented, not like any other war. <P>"The days of carpet-bombing are over," they told us. It would be a sophisticated, covert campaign, they insisted, and we breathed sighs of relief when it seemed cool heads in Washington had won the day after the September 11 atrocities.  <P>The massive display of four aircraft carriers and 400 strike aircraft, cruise missile submarines and surface ships, were there for show, a psychological demonstration of firepower, was the message.  <P>They deceived us. It was not long before we were told that military action was, after all, "inevitable". American public opinion demanded it. Never mind the military impossibility of defeating such an elusive "enemy" in the "war on terrorism", and the inevitability of "collateral damage" - civilian casualties.  <P>It was not long before American generals spoke of "errant munitions", meaning "smart" bombs going astray. They brought in heavily armed gunships, first used in the Vietnam war, to attack "engagement zones", a term they preferred to "kill boxes".  <P>An officer on board the US aircraft carrier, Carl Vinson, described the use of cluster bombs - dropped by American B-52 bombers based on the "British" Indian ocean territory of Diego Garcia. "A 2,000lb bomb," he said, "no matter where you drop it, is a significant emotional event for anyone within a square mile".  <P>Now, increasingly desperate military planners are resorting to B-52 bombers, based on Diego Garcia, carpet-bombing - a tactic straight out of Vietnam.  
<P>A day after Geoff Hoon, the defense secretary, painted an upbeat picture of the achievements of the air strikes, saying they had destroyed "all nine" of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida training camps, the Pentagon admitted that the Taliban was proving more resilient than they had expected. Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, chief of the defense staff, sent out a very different message from that of his political master. "It is not likely, in my personal view, that the Taliban will give up," he said.  
<P>He described the enemy, the al-Qaida network, as "more of an idea than something you can touch". It certainly will not give up as a result of carpet-bombing, or even well-publicized"covert" raids by special forces (based in "friendly" Gulf states which we are not supposed to name).  
<P>"I can only suggest that it is   like trying to eradicate cancer with a blowtorch," Sir Michael Howard, the historian, told a Guardian/Royal United Services Institute conference this week. Who will ever forget Bloody Sunday in Northern Ireland, he said, when a few bursts of small arms fire by the British army gave the IRA a propaganda victory from which the British government was never to recover?  <P>Ministers and their advisers talk about getting to the "root cause" of Islamist extremism, of "a battle for hearts and minds" - a term, Howard reminded us, first coined by the British during the Malayan "emergency" against communists in the 1950s and 60s, a campaign which lasted 15 years.  
<P>By root causes, the British government appears to mean poverty and hunger rather than action to establish a Palestinian state or tackle Arab grievances about Iraq and US troops in the Middle East. It is a supremely patronizing and arrogant response. It is also misleading. Al-Qaida draws many of its most militant supporters, including suicide bombers, from families of the elite, not the deprived.  
<P>With daily pictures on our screens of air strikes and civilian casualties, Hoon this week tried to play down the significance of military force at a press conference called primarily - according to the Ministry of Defense - for the benefit of the Arab and Muslim press.  
<P>The campaign against terrorism, he said, was first of all a "law enforcement" campaign. Second, said Hoon, it was a "humanitarian" campaign - Afghanistan must be prevented from being a "breeding ground for terrorism". Give them food, they will soon give up their animosity towards the west in general and the US in particular, seems to be the message. Only last, Hoon went on with no trace of irony, was this a military campaign. "Some parts of the world," he said, "are beyond the reach of Scotland Yard."  
<P>By all means bring in the cops, the spooks, the special forces - and the courts. B-52s, the crude weapon of the frustrated bully, should be banished to the scrapyard. This campaign, as ministers and their defense advisers are finally admitting, has shown up the poverty not only of military thinking but of the very utility of weapons of war.  
<P>In the end, the Taliban regime will fall and we will be told, as we were when Slobodan Milosevic ordered his forces out of Kosovo, that bombing succeeded. Don't believe it.
