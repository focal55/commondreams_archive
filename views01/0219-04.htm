            Israel has just elected a prime minister who, brought before the bar 
            of international justice, would surely be judged a war criminal in 
            the class of, say, Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander as firmly 
            associated with the Srebrenica massacre as General Sharon was with 
            that of Sabra and Shatila during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. 
            <P>Sharon calls Yasser Arafat "a murderer and a liar" but, in the 
              run-up to the elections, the liberal Israeli press copiously illustrated 
              the deceit and sanguinary brutality which have been the twin pillars 
              of his own career. One of his likely coalition partners, Avigdor 
              Lieberman, has spoken of burning Beirut and bombing Tehran. Sharon's 
              ideas on the furtherance of the peace process make a mockery of 
              it. If any Israeli leader ever had the makings of a western villain, 
              the destroyer of US interests in the region, it is surely he. 
            <P>Yet, within a week of the emergence of this would-be villain as 
              Israel's premier-elect, who do the Americans and British bomb? That 
              old, familiar, that Arab, villain, Saddam Hussein. Of course, his 
              crimes and atrocities are of an order that words can barely encompass. 
              Keeping him from committing more is one thing, however. The motives 
              and methods of those who, once again, have assigned themselves that 
              task, and the regional context in which they do so, is something 
              else. 
            <P>The Americans and British say Friday's raid, the first on such 
              a scale for more than two years, was necessitated by the upgrading 
              of Saddam's defences and the increased threat that posed to their 
              aircraft's routine forays over the "no-fly zones". Even if that 
              argument is true, it has few takers in the Arab world. 
            <P>For the Arabs, the raid is an escalation of the Anglo-American 
              campaign against Saddam, with a far greater political import than 
              a strictly military one. Coupled with the rise of Sharon, there 
              could hardly have been a more blatant, a more richly symbolic, display 
              of the double standards which, in their view, typify western, but 
              especially American, treatment of those two zones of perennial Middle 
              East crisis, the Arab-Israeli conflict on the one hand, Iraq and 
              the Gulf on the other. It bodes ill for both. 
            <P>Each crisis has its own origins and dynamics, but they are intrinsically 
              connected. Saddam pioneered "linkage" when, immediately after his 
              invasion of Kuwait in 1990, he offered to withdraw in return for 
              an immediate, unconditional Israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
              territories. 
            <P>The offer was greeted with outrage in the west. But in due course 
              "linkage" surreptitiously asserted itself. George Bush Sr promulgated 
              a "new world order" whose cornerstone, in the Middle East, was to 
              be a just and lasting Arab-Israeli settlement. 
            <P> The US's Arab allies understood that, to achieve it, the US would 
              back away from its historic pro-Israeli bias. "Bush," said President 
              Mubarak at the time, "agrees with me that the Israelis must be pushed 
              into a Palestine solution." Fairness and firmness in one crisis 
              zone were to work wonders in the other. 
            <P>But it was not to be. Both crises have festered and worsened. Saddam 
              grows stronger and more assertive. The Arab-Israeli peace process 
              has all but collapsed; violence and mutual hatred deepens. 
            <P>Pernicious as these two crises are on their own, they achieve an 
              even higher degree of malignancy through the intrinsic connection 
              between them. And, with the ascent of Sharon, both have as their 
              key players individuals who incarnate all that is most extreme, 
              dangerous and destructive in the region. 
            <P>This, then, is the moment that the US, under a new administration, 
              has chosen to embark on a more activist policy in one zone of crisis. 
              The raid may please the Iraqi opposition, or some of it, as well 
              as Gulf countries, or some of those ruling elites most threatened 
              by Saddam, but it is deeply unpopular in the wider Arab arena. The 
              Arabs - people especially, but governments too - have been growing 
              steadily more hostile to American-led "containment" of Iraq; key 
              Arab countries are making ever greater breaches in the UN sanctions. 
              Indeed, supporting Iraq has become a necessary yardstick of patriotism, 
              even for a devoutly pro-western ruler such as King Abdullah of Jordan. 
            <P>This is not for love of Saddam but, more than ever, because of 
              "linkage" and outrage at the way the world's only superpower penalises 
              Arabs for their misdemeanours but never its Israeli ally. "It is 
              clear what the US is now about," said an Iraqi exile in Beirut. 
              "It wants erring Arab regimes to correct their priorities, to re-establish 
              Saddam, not Sharon, as the real enemy. It may have some success 
              in the Gulf, but, in general, and unfortunately for us Iraqis who 
              have most reason to hate him, it is turning him into an Arab champion 
              again." 
            <P>There could always be a miracle: in resorting to a new activism 
              against Saddam, Bush could do the same against Sharon. But, judging 
              by the lack of official alarm with which the new man was greeted, 
              he will have to wreak a great deal of havoc before the miracle occurs 
              and America begins to think of fairness, and objectivity, as a sensible 
              way for saving the Middle East from the twin calamities that surely 
              await it.
