The ‘coup of one,’ as Trent Lott of Mississippi rather sourly described
the Senate revolution forced by James Jeffords of Vermont when he became
an Independent, could have large effect on the United Nations as well as
on Congress.
<p>

That’s because of the downfall of the UN’s arch-critic in the Senate,
the main force behind US arrears in dues to the world
organization--Jesse Helms the elderly right-wing Republican from North
Carolina. Helms will no longer be chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee. Joseph Biden of Delaware, not only a Democrat but a younger
and far less conservative legislator than Helms, has assumed the
chairmanship.
<p>

Biden will be less cantankerous than Helms surely would have been about
UN matters,  and also is likely--though a Democrat--to be more
sympathetic than Helms to Bush’s ambassadorial appointments and other
foreign policy actions.
<p>

Helms, moreover, is coming to the end of his fifth term and will be 81
years old if he seeks re-election in 2002--which, owing to age,
infirmity and a greater-than-usual possibility of defeat, is not at all
certain. Even if he should run and win, however, Senate Republican rules
will not allow him to be the ranking member of the Foreign Relations
Committee, if the Democrats, as expected, retain Senate control that
year. That distinction would go to Richard Lugar, a moderate Republican
from Indiana.
<p>

The Helms-Biden exchange is one of the two most important switches in
committee chairmanships caused by Jeffords, when he became an
Independent and handed control of the Senate to a 50-seat Democratic
majority. It’s equally or perhaps more important that Jeffords’
Democratic colleague from Vermont, Patrick Leahy, now becomes chairman
of the Judiciary Committee. Leahy will bring greater scrutiny to
judgeship nominations by President Bush, including nominees for the
Supreme Court.
<p>

In fact, the ‘coup of one’ set off by Jeffords is a sort of chain
reaction that affects the Republicans in several important ways. The
loss of the Senate also means that the importance of the slender
Republican majority in the House will be diminished. Whatever
legislation the House may approve still will have to pass a newly
Democratic Senate before becoming law. So it may not be factual but it
may be correct in practice to say that, owing to  Jeffords, Bush and his
party have lost effective control of Congress, not just real control of
the Senate.
<p>

That being so, Dick Armey and Tom DeLay, the powerful Texas Republican
conservatives who hold sway in the House, where Speaker Dennis Hastert
of Illinois seems little more than a figurehead, have been shorn of some
power. In the Senate, of course, such downgrading obviously has befallen
both majority leader Trent Lott and Vice President Richard Cheney, whose
constitutional authority to break ties had given the Republicans their
only claim to majority status.
<p>

Because of the Republican party’s sharply reduced power in both houses,
even Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld also faces a bleaker
legislative outlook than he did only a few days ago. That could
drastically affect one of Bush’s strongest campaign pledges, his promise
to build and deploy a national missile defense even at the cost of
withdrawal from the long-standing Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
<p>

So if six of the Republicans’ strongest conservative leaders--Lott,
Cheney, Helms, Armey, DeLay and Rumsfeld--have lost standing and
effectiveness, the entire right wing of the Republican party has been
hit hard. Since it has also appeared since his inauguration that Bush
was catering politically to that wing--if he is not actually controlled
by it- the course of his Administration is bound to become more
moderate. And the President’s actions and manner since the Jeffords
thunder-clap seem to reflect that prospect.
<p>

There has been no national outcry against this seismic shift in the
political terrain, and Vermont--my home state as well as Jeffords’s-
seems mostly to celebrate rather than condemn his defection. Trent
Lott’s complaint that the Democrats lack the ‘moral authority’ of an
elected majority therefore seems more petulant than logical. What moral
authority could be claimed by the former Republican ‘majority’--actually
an even 50-50 split with the Democrats that reflected Republican losses
in the 2000 elections?
<p>

What moral authority, for that matter, does even George W. Bush have,
after losing the national popular vote and carrying a disputed electoral
college only because of a one-vote victory in a basically conservative
Supreme Court?
<p>

Lott and other Republicans would do well to leave ‘moral authority’ out
of the question of who controls the Senate--or the Presidency. Seldom
have there been more graphic lessons than those provided, first by the
Supreme Court last November, next by James Jeffords this year, that
American politics is a power game, not a morality play. Victory goes,
not necessarily to virtue, but to him--more and more often to her--who
has the votes.
