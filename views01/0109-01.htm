In January last year, in his final State of the Union address, Bill Clinton made this boast: "We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs; the fastest economic growth in more than 30 years; the lowest unemployment in 30 years; the lowest poverty rates in 20 years; the lowest African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates on record; the first back-to back budget surpluses in 42 years... We have built a new economy. And our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the American spirit... the state of our Union is the strongest it has ever been."
<p>
How hollow those words now sound. For several weeks now, an avalanche of bad economic news has threatened to bring President Clinton's administration full circle: the worst manufacturing performance for 10 years, the flattest Christmas sales season since records began in the late Eighties; new lay-offs in the car-manufacturing and retail sectors announced almost daily. 
<p>
 The "dot.com revolution" is now openly referred to as the "dot.com meltdown" as new-tech companies chase each other out of business. The once-soaring market in high-technology shares is being openly dismissed as a "bubble". The very existence of a "new economy", subject to new rules, is being questioned, and the R-word &#150; for recession, that is &#150; is creeping back into public discourse. 
<p>
 As the new century begins in earnest, this abrupt change of mood has prompted some Americans to wake up, rub their eyes and look with bafflement across the Atlantic, where they find the European Union still together, the value of the euro rising against the dollar, and countries such as Sweden and France, which were written off by right-thinking Americans as hopelessly out of sync with the free market-that-must-be-obeyed, faring quite splendidly.
<p>
 The prevalent American reaction so far has been to turn over and go back to sleep. A few brave souls, however, have ventured to ask whether the so-called American model is quite so unimpeachable as the Clinton economic miracle and the collapse of Communism seemed to suggest. With the 20th century, the American century, now in the past, and Asia still too economically becalmed to claim the new century as its own, could it be &#150; they hazard &#150; that the 21st century will belong to Europe? The notion that the old continent might emerge as the new one has been embraced by the liberal US forecaster, Gerald Celente, who headlined the lead article in his <i>Trends Journal</i> last autumn "USA moving off-trend to Europe" and opined that "the old world powers are moving back into the driver's seat; Europe is setting the direction for lifestyles, thought-styles and esoteric trends."
<p>
 Grudgingly optimistic reports about Europe's future punctuated the year-end assessments of the mainstream US media, and even the distinctly right-of-centre <i>Wall Street Journal</i> was moved to ask, in the words of its correspondent in Frankfurt, "Could this be the decade of Europe?" and to answer "Maybe". From my perspective as a displaced European who pays periodic return visits, I would answer rather more affirmatively. And in case those still drowsy Americans need a nudge &#150; this is why. 
<p>
 As the year 2000 gave way to 2001, the very underpinnings of the American free-market model looked shakier than for quite some time. The state of California &#150; the seventh largest economy in the world &#150; is threatened with widespread power cuts because of an energy deregulation programme that has gone spectacularly wrong. The US energy secretary has intervened, and the state is being forced to increase subsidies and tighten regulation &#150; so undermining two of America's most cherished principles: state sovereignty and the untrammelled operation of the free market. 
<p>
 The price of energy nationwide has been rising. The reality is that the energy market is global, and if the US cannot supply its own needs, it will have to pay a world market price &#150; or cut back. Petrol is now 50 per cent more expensive at the pump than a year ago. Decades of cheap power have made the US less energy efficient than Europe at every level, from factory to domestic dishwasher. The US has little choice but to adjust, and Europe offers a model. 
<p>
As it does with land use and commercial development. The suburban backlash against unfettered development is only just beginning in the US. Traffic jams, school overcrowding and inadequate public transport, not to speak of rabid Nimbyism, are raising tensions between generations, income groups and &#150; yes &#150; social classes. Large tracts of countryside and farmland are being despoiled by housing developments and shopping centres planted with no consideration for the landscape or the need for infrastructure. Europe has no ready solutions, but it is further down the line in recognising the conflicts.
<p>
The comfortably off, cocooned in their cars and their secluded streets, protected by private "community" security services, need never encounter the debased conditions in which so many of their fellow-citizens live. America's much-vaunted social mobility is grinding to a halt. From discriminatory loan rates to schools funded by local property taxes, everything militates against the poor improving their lot. Pulling yourself up by your bootstraps in the United States today is no easier than it is in Europe; in some ways, given the flimsy social safety net, it is more difficult. 
<p>
 The most egregious, and perhaps least sustainable, inequity in the US is the private health insurance system. Genetic testing threatens "red-lining" for large numbers of people found to be predisposed to particular conditions; if equally large numbers of people succeed in keeping their test results private, the insurance system could be bankrupted. 
<p>
Insured Americans scorn the publicly funded European systems, but some central system, at state or federal level, will eventually become inevitable. Without it, US life expectancy and infant mortality rates will fall even further down the international pecking order.
<p>
Europe, of course, is no paragon. Some of its traits, such as its internal cultural and linguistic conflicts and the prejudice faced by immigrants, are shameful. But the fast-growing Hispanic and Asian presence in the US is not without its tensions either, and as white Anglo-Saxon dominance recedes, Europe may have worthwhile experience in cultural tolerance to impart as well. 
<p>
With its ethos of "working to live", not "living to work", its regard for the conveniences and pleasures that combine to offer "quality of life", its relative economic egalitarianism and its recognition that there are some services that government can provide more efficiently than stitched-up private markets (and for which people will pay taxes), the old continent has life in it yet. As the American model strains to withstand new pressures and new doubts, let Europe's century begin.
