This week saw the biggest row in Hollywood since ET quit the movie business claiming he was always being typecast as a lovable alien. "I am a serious actor! I can do Shakespeare, look: 'To be, or not beee goood', Damn! Damn!" The latest scandal to rock Tinseltown is over a product placement deal for the film American Pie 2. You may have been unfortunate enough to catch the original that is endlessly reshown on the Sky Godawful Movies Channel, which was famous for a scene in which an adolescent boy has sex with an apple pie. Obviously this is not something any normal person should ever attempt, as I said to the doctor at the burns clinic next door to McDonald's. 
<P>In the sequel, the teenagers actually graduate to having sex with each other and, to the film-makers' credit, the sex is safe. No condoms were featured in the original film,   which led to criticism that the boy could have been infected by one of the apple pies' previous lovers. This time round the money men at Universal Studios thought they'd spotted the chance for some lucrative product placement, and struck a deal with the manufacturers of Lifestyle condoms, which would feature prominently in the movie (presumably before they were put on, or that PG certificate would have been a real long-shot). The studio also undertook to promote the Lifestyle brand in the ads for American Pie 2, but instead of honoring the deal, Universal pulled out prematurely - which as we all know is no substitute for using a condom.  
<P>It turns out that American regulations prevent condoms featuring in any commercials that might be seen by a general audience. Car chases, shoot outs and robberies are fine, but mention contraception and you have crossed the   boundary of good taste - which is bizarre, because sex has always been used to sell films. Although at least in Last Tango in Paris they didn't feel the need to establish what brand of butter it was.  
<P>The controversy has highlighted the whole issue of product placement; the prominent featuring of brand names as a form of oblique advertising. Somehow you sense that the great films of the past would not have had quite the same impact if directors such as David Lean had depended on covert advertising. When Alec Guinness staggers out of that baking little cell in Bridge on   the River Kwai, he does not say: "Well, thank goodness I had my Right Guard double protection." "Why 'double' protection sir?" "Because it protects your noses and your clothes-es." "Yes and I should add, sir, that this prison camp is much better since it got taken over by Club Mark Warner." "Indeed, the men's morale has been greatly lifted by the pedalo race down the River Kwai."  
<P> Some might argue that the opening of Bergman's 1956 classic The Seventh Seal, in which Antonius Block encounters the figure of Death, might have been improved if, instead of embarking on a game of chess, they had played with the free plastic toys now being given out with McDonald's Happy Meals. "If your little clockwork turtle goes across the table quicker than mine I shall release you." "And if I lose?" "Then..." says Death,   "you'll have to let me finish your chocolate McMilkshake."  
<P>Or what about the moment in Casablanca when Ilsa walks into Rick's place? All the agony of Bogart's broken heart is written on his face when suddenly the silence is broken by a waitress saying to Ilsa: "Hello, have you been to a Harvester before?" And only Sam knows who this beautiful woman is, but he acts normally, saying: "Do help yourself to as much as you'd like from the salad cart."  
<P>The trouble is that some films are easier to get sponsors for than others. Few were surprised when P&amp;O ferries decided not to have their name splashed all over Titanic. Of course art needs financial backing; this has been going on ever since the cigar manufacturers persuaded Shakespeare to rename his latest hero Hamlet, but product placement can only diminish the integrity and quality of a film. Furthermore, if a studio has been   paid millions to show the hero drinking Budweiser, then the editor is duty bound to leave in that scene, however bad it is.  
<P>Now you go to the cinema and you are jolted out of your enjoyment of the film every time a global brand is shoved in your face; every time the star pointedly pulls on his Gap sweatshirt and Nike trainers or the camera lingers on his bottle of Miller Draft or his new Nokia communicator. But there's a reason why the corporations have to promote their wares so crassly within the body of the main feature. It's because before the film you have to sit through a dozen arty, pretentious commercials and at the end of each one you turn to your friends and say: "What was that an advert for?" And they reply: "I haven't the faintest idea."
