These days we are being bombarded by essays, editorials, columns and voicespeak assuring us that free trade is the miracle analgesic of our time, promising prosperity for all, inviting us to take a number and be patient. There is hardly a retired foreign service boffin who has not been heard to offer calming reassurance and to scold the deranged protesters.
<P></P>
The Prime Minister, speaking of the protesters, has characterized their contrary views as "blah, blah, blah." My morning paper, the national edition, is making a heroic effort to explain the economic wonders of globalization, the road to which is being paved by FTA, NAFTA, FTAA and the eager multinationals.
<P></P>
In its latest peroration, my morning paper declared: "Mexico has toughened its environmental regulations since Canada and the United States and Mexico formed the free-trade zone in 1994." Well, I'm far from expert in these matters. But I did once travel through Texas on a train, and I have a little "blah, blah, blah" to add to the blessings free trade is trying to bring to the Mexican environment.
<P></P>
South of the border, down Mexico way, in a small town in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi, a California firm - Metalclad - a commercial purveyor of hazardous wastes, bought an abandoned dump site nearby. It proposed to expand on the dumpsite and to haul toxic waste material and other hazardous stuff and dump it in San Luis Potosi. The people in the neighbourhood of the dump site protested. The municipality, using powers delegated to it by the state, rezoned the site and forbid Metalclad to extend its land holdings.
<P></P>
Concerned about the potential hazards of the reopened dump to the local water supply, the state conducted an environmental impact study. As a result, it rezoned the property and forbid any extension of Metalclad's land holdings.
<P></P>
<center>
</center>
Metalclad, under Chapter 11 of the NAFTA, then sued the Mexican government for damage to its profit margins and balance sheet as a result of being treated unequally by the people of San Luis Potosi. A trade panel, convened in Washington, agreed with the company. The Mexican government has since appealed, and, if I may add a little more "blah, blah, blah," good luck to them.
<P></P>
There is no better example for the rising public anger, concern and unease over globalization, free trade, and over the NAFTA, than the illustration provided in the matter of Metalclad vs. the people of Mexico, and beyond. Nothing has done greater damage to the environment, potable water and to public health than the devastating combination of new industrial border towns and dirt cheap Mexican labour. Globalization's apologists say this is about "development." There is overwhelming evidence it is really about exploitation of the poor and the powerless.
<P></P>
In the small town in San Luis Potosi, there was once a dump. Then there was no dump. NAFTA (which includes us) says there has to be a dump, whether the people in the community want a dump, whether the municipality wants a dump or the state wants a dump; NAFTA says you gotta have a dump. Is the Prime Minister really puzzled about the fact that a lot of people who haven't read the treaty, and had never heard of Chapter 11 until yesterday, are saying that if this is what free trade is about, then it's nothing they want to root for, believe in, or, for that matter, vote for. In fact, to answer our own question: In truth, the government of Canada is madly lukewarm about Chapter 11.
<P></P>
The Americans are devoted to the doctrine of equal treatment; it's an NRA, John Wayne, James Madison, General Dynamics, Bill Gates, Knute Rockne, General Motors kind of thing: If it's not part of the constitution, it should be (as it applies to business and good corporate health).
<P></P>
The political establishment knows Canada's society, its health-care system, even its parliamentary democracy, are endangered by Chapter 11. (After Ethyl corporation sued when the government banned its gasoline additive as a health hazard, the government settled "out of court" to prevent a public spectacle of a corporation overruling the nation's Parliament.)
<P></P>
<center>
</center>
The hard truth is this: Chapter 11 was not enshrined in the NAFTA in order to make a better world for the people of Canada, any more than for the people of San Luis Potosi but, instead, for the corporate folk who own the newspapers, magazines and the electronic media, as well as many of the politicans, along with a few economists. All are now on parade in full marching regalia, and in full voice, singing for their supper and for a Chapter 11 for all people of all nations.
