            It's perfectly all right for the U.S. to slap the rest of the world 

            in the face if the rest of the world is wrong, or just to defend its 

            own vital national interests. But it should be done for <i>national 

            </i>interests, not private ones, and it should be done in ways that 

            cause the least possible offence. That is not what's happening now. 

            <P></P>

            Consider only the past month. In the second week of July, the Bush 

            administration told Congress that its ballistic missile defence project 

            would "bump up against" the constraints of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic 

            Missile treaty "within months." Never mind that it's a stupid idea; 

            just look how it's being done. The ABM treaty allows either party 

            to withdraw unilaterally on six months' notice, but no such notice 

            has been given. The U.S., it appears, is just going to breach the 

            treaty illegally. 

            <P></P>

            In the third week of July, a U.N. conference aimed at curbing the 

            global trade in small arms was effectively wrecked by U.S. negotiators. 

            The United States, which produces more than half of the world's small 

            arms, took a lone stand in blocking any restrictions on private gun 

            ownership and vetoed an African-backed proposal to ban arms sales 

            to "non-state actors" (i.e. the guerrilla groups that are ravaging 

            so many African countries). "The U.S. should be ashamed," said South 

            African envoy Jean Du Preez. 

            <P></P>

            In the same week, 160 countries meeting at Bonn agreed on the final 

            terms of the Kyoto treaty to combat global warming despite fierce 

            U.S. opposition (and the lead American negotiator was booed by the 

            assembled diplomats at the close). 

            <P></P>

            A subtler obstructionism might have achieved the U.S. government's 

            goal of stalling the treaty for a couple of years, until U.S. industry 

            was ready to compete in the non-fossil fuel energy markets that will 

            expand rapidly to enable the treaty's signatories to meet their emission 

            reduction targets. Instead, the Bush administration's clumsy defiance 

            of world opinion annoyed everybody else so much they confounded Washington's 

            expectations: They went ahead and signed the treaty anyway. 

            <P></P>

            So the new energy markets will open up sooner rather than later, and 

            non-U.S. energy companies will reap the new global opportunities. 

            Moreover, the international emissions trading exchange that would 

            naturally have been based in the U.S. will probably be located in 

            London instead. 

            <P></P>

            Late in July, it was the turn of the 1972 treaty outlawing germ warfare. 

            For six years, 56 countries have been negotiating a supplementary 

            treaty that would create verification rules and international inspectors 

            to enforce what was previously just a pious pledge not to produce 

            biological weapons. 

            <P></P>

            Fifty-five of those countries had agreed on a 200-page draft protocol 

            — and suddenly, on July 25, the U.S. declared that it could not agree 

            since U.S. pharmaceutical plants would be open to inspection under 

            the treaty. Everybody else's plants would be open, too, and this kind 

            of inspection was foreseen from the beginning of the negotiations, 

            but suddenly U.S. concerns for commercial secrecy outweighed everything 

            else. 

            <P></P>

            And so it goes. Early this month Thomas Novotny, the lead U.S. negotiator 

            for the past decade on the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, 

            suddenly resigned his post. He is not returning calls, but colleagues 

            say that it was over frustration at the sudden U.S. switch from a 

            policy that sought to restrict cigarette advertising and marketing 

            to one that basically echoes the tobacco industry's positions. 

            <P></P>

            In part, this dismal record is merely an intensification of a trend 

            toward U.S. hostility to international law that was already marked 

            under the last administration. It was not Bush who refused to sign 

            the treaty banning anti-personnel mines, or tried to strip the International 

            Criminal Court of any real powers, or began the U.S. campaign to sabotage 

            the Kyoto accord. It was that hero of internationalism, Bill Clinton. 

            <P></P>

            The notion that international treaties and international law are by 

            their very nature disadvantageous for the United States, which as 

            the richest and most powerful country can simply enforce its wishes 

            unless treaties and laws get in the way, has spread far beyond the 

            ideologues of the far right who first articulated it in the early 

            '90s. It now has a major impact on the Pentagon's thinking, and is 

            an unexceptionable concept in Republican circles. 

            <P></P>

            Much of America's current wrecking of international treaties would 

            be happening whoever the president was. What is puzzling is the maladroit 

            tactics with which it is being done. Official Washington is full of 

            clever operators whose specialty is getting what the boss wants while 

            spreading the blame and muddying the waters so that the naked self-interest 

            at the bottom of it all is not easily visible. But their skills are 

            not being used. 

            <P></P>

            On the contrary, it's as if every bureaucratic or industrial interest 

            group with access to the Bush administration gets to make policy for 

            its own bit of the picture. Nobody is trying to cover their tracks, 

            or transfer the blame, or minimize the fallout from unpopular U.S. 

            actions like the attack on the Kyoto treaty. Nobody is even co-ordinating 

            the tactics, let alone imposing a common strategic vision. 

            <P></P>

            It strengthens the suspicion that George W. Bush is largely a non-executive 

            president and that the real decisions are being made at a lower level 

            — a level where co-ordination is difficult, special interests loom 

            large and nobody worries much about the cumulative effect of all these 

            separate actions. 

            <P>
