The European Union and the larger, less constraining Council of Europe both make rejecting the death penalty a condition of membership. It has been proposed that the United States, which has observer status at the Council of Europe, be excluded for continuing capital punishment.
<p>Of all the things that various European activists hold against the United States, it is the execution of Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, that has brought most demonstrators out this week to denounce George W. Bush, widely known here for having endorsed a record number of executions during his six years as governor of Texas.
<p>And yet it is just 20 years since the guillotine, and thus the death penalty, was banned in France. It was at the ardent insistence of the then justice minister, Robert Badinter. The newly elected Socialist president, François Mitterrand, went along, although he knew that the decision would not be popular at the time. Mr. Mitterrand said he believed people would come to change their minds, and indeed they have throughout Western Europe and probably in the east as well. Of course, the disgust for state killing is not unanimous, and there has been not the slightest expression of sympathy for the remorseless McVeigh.
<p>There is, however, a powerful public sense that it is uncivilized, unacceptable, a profound and undeniable violation of the most basic human right, to put a person to death. Americans are asked how they can tolerate it not only by critics and political opponents but by warm admirers of their country in practically every other context, who are truly perplexed by what they see as such a contradiction in values. The elaborate antiseptic, impersonal, supposedly virtually painless execution by lethal injection, in deference to the U.S. Constitution's ban on &quot;cruel and unusual punishment,&quot; has been explained at length to the public here. That only serves to intensify the impression of surrealistic horror, of maniacal ritual. There has been an undeniable progression in recent years of the number of people deeply convinced that the death penalty is wrong. The country of Madame Lafarge, who sat knitting triumphantly smug at the foot of the guillotine which lopped off one aristocratic head after the other during the Terror phase of the French Revolution, is now appalled at the idea that anyone can condone official killing.
<p>The arguments for and against are known, but the more the various types of justification are repeated, the more they sound empty of anything but bloody-mindedness.
<p>In the current issue of The New York Review of Books, Gary Wills points out that the facts strongly refute the idea that the death penalty works as a deterrent to other murders. European states have no death penalty and a much lower murder rate than the United States, he observes, adding that they do have gun control laws.
<p>Mr. Wills recounts some of the truly gory, revolting techniques of execution in old Europe, which so long took for granted the right of the powerful to kill. As he analyzes the rationales put forward, they crumble and disappear in the changing premises of modern society. Most European commentators don't bother with such detail. They consider the iniquity obvious.
<p>This striking evolution of attitudes is really remarkable in just a generation or two - the first generations in centuries when Europeans have been free of major war. It is not the same set of people, or at least not people consciously making the connection, who oppose capital punishment and support &quot;humanitarian intervention&quot; with military force to protect civilians under attack. But the argument that national sovereignty must no longer preclude sending force to prevent states from massacring their own people is gaining currency in European think tanks. Bosnia and Kosovo are examples, Rwanda a shameful reminder of failure to act.
<p>Nicole Gnesotto, director of the Western European Union's institute, writes in a recent study that the European Union has a &quot;historical responsibility&quot; to declare morality &quot;a basis of policy,&quot; because &quot;human rights are more important than states' rights.&quot; There is not yet a formal consensus on that, as there is on the death penalty, but it is the way minds are moving. If there is a new ideology brewing to replace the discredited ones, it is in that direction.
<p>It is natural that the United States, which considers itself the prime promoter of moral policy, should be expected to share these views.
