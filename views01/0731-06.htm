Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi took on Charles Manson in court and O.J. 
Simpson in print. But these days, his target may be a little tougher: the 
impeachment of the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P>Bugliosi, author of "The Betrayal of America: How the Supreme Court 
Undermined the Constitution and Chose Our President" -- comes to Oakland's 
Grand Lake Theater at 7 p.m. Thursday to make his legal argument that the five 
members of the Supreme Court who stopped the Florida recount last fall are 
guilty of "one of the biggest and most serious crimes in the history of the 
United States."
<P>The justices "intentionally set out to hand the election to George W. Bush,
" Bugliosi told The Chronicle last week. "And like typical criminals, they 
left their fingerprints everywhere."
<P>If his book's standing as a New York Times paperback best-seller is any 
indication, Bugliosi's accusations aren't disappearing into the ozone.
<P>Nearly 200 days into the presidency of George W. Bush, a faint but 
persistent drumbeat of protest sounds regarding his election.
<P>Perhaps nowhere in the country is the drumbeat stronger than in the 
Democratic strongholds of the Bay Area, where a core of impassioned activists 
continues to raise questions and revisit the precise day and time that changed 
history: Saturday, Dec. 9, at 2 p.m., when the Supreme Court delivered its 
emergency order to stop the Florida recount in the case of Bush vs. Gore.
.
<P>NOT OVER IT
<P>"'Most Americans who voted for (Al) Gore or (Ralph) Nader have not gotten 
over it," said John Vance, who founded Berkeley's A First Amendment Center, a 
community organization focused on opposing Bush's election. "And they'll never 
get over it."
<P>These days, Vance all but devotes his life to the idea that Bush's election 
was a fraud. Along Telegraph Avenue and at community meetings, he can be seen 
peddling anti-Bush bumper stickers and his "Hail to the Thief" memorabilia. 
His organization, along with Voter March West and Global Exchange, is among a 
handful of groups co-sponsoring Bugliosi's Bay Area appearance.
<P>Activists like Vance are buoyed -- and angered -- by a recent New York 
Times investigation of absentee military ballots in the Florida election. The 
six-month investigation found that "hundreds of absentee ballots from overseas 
which failed to comply with Florida election laws were accepted, the vast 
majority in counties carried by George W. Bush."
<P>However, an expert on voting patterns cited in the story said there was 
only a slight chance that discarding the questionable ballots would have made 
Gore the winner.
<P>
<P>Harvard professor, best-selling author and controversial lawyer Alan 
Dershowitz has weighed in with his newly released "Supreme Injustice: How the 
High Court Hijacked Election 2000."
<P>In it, Dershowitz examines the "equal protection" and "irreparable harm" 
arguments on which the court based its opinion. His conclusion: The court 
majority delivered the most egregious decision since Dred Scott, one which 
undermines the court's very credibility.
<P>Those on the other side don't lack for advocates and authors, either.
<P>Washington Times writer Bill Sammon, in his "At Any Cost: How Al Gore Tried 
to Steal the Election," argues that thousands of GOP voters in Florida decided 
not to vote after networks mistakenly called the state for Gore before the 
polls closed.
<P>Judge Richard A. Posner, of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, has 
mounted a defense of the Supreme Court in "Breaking the Deadlock: The 2000 
Election and the Courts."
<P>And presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer -- responding to the Times' 
investigations, the activists and the authors -- says the election is over, 
and the overwhelming number of Americans have "moved on."
<P>But Riva Enteen, vice president of the 5,000-member National Lawyers Guild, 
says she gets a daily stream of enraged e-mails and phone calls from 
progressives still steamed about the outcome.
<P>"It's not dying down," she said. "There appears to be a sentiment that this 
is an outrage we can't forget."

<P>LEGAL ACTION POSSIBLE
<P>The Lawyers Guild is considering using Bugliosi's book as a legal 
foundation for asking the U.S. House of Representatives to initiate 
impeachment proceedings against the Supreme Court majority in the case. 
Already, a majority of the progressive association's board has recommended the 
move -- and it will be voted on by the entire legal group in October, she said.
<P>What will come of all this?
<P>Vance, while acknowledging that impeaching Supreme Court justices is a long 
shot, argues that the debate -- as contentious and passionate as it sometimes 
gets -- is at the heart of what America is about.
<P>"People say, 'What are you still doing out here?' But we live in a society 
where there's always going to be controversy and some disagreement."
<P>"It's healthy," Vance said. "That's what keeps us strong as a people."
