When it comes to international trade relations, the planet’s most powerful 
man is taking the moral high ground.  I mean President George W. Bush.  In a 
June 26 New York Times article about the prospects for trade relations 
between developed and developing nations, the president mentioned free trade 
as a “moral imperative.”  The context was talks following the November 
meeting in Qatar of the World Trade Organization, the unelected world body 
that governs the terms of global trade.

<p>Meanwhile, the Bush administration is continuing the Clinton 
administration’s policy that prevents Iraq from trading freely with other 
nations.  This has tragically hampered Iraq’s legal and moral right to 
self-determination.

<p>Under the current U.N. sanctions against Iraq that began on August 6, 1990, 
the Bush administration is trying to end Iraq’s border trade, Lauren Cannon 
writes. She’s with Voices in the Wilderness, a Chicago-based group working 
to end the sanctions, having just returned from Iraq on a humanitarian 
delegation.

<p>Supposedly, Iraqi revenue from border trade is funding weapons making.  
Based on this allegation, the Bush administration is preventing Iraq from 
raising funds to rebuild its infrastructure such as water treatment plants.

<p>“Because of the direct targeting of the water treatment plants during the 
Gulf War (documented in the recently de-classified DIA papers), Iraq has a 
greatly reduced capacity to treat solid waste,” Cannon writes.  “We learned 
from UNICEF on June 20 that they have tracked a six-fold increase in normal 
water pollution over this decade of sanctions, and that a full six million 
people are at risk in Iraq for lack of clean water.

<p>“Dr. Carel DeRooy, Director of Health and Nutrition for UNICEF, stated that 
$1 billion is needed to repair the water treatment facilities in the central 
and south of Iraq (a conservative estimate by many accounts).”

<p>Iraq is a nation of 23 million people. According to UNICEF, 500,000 Iraqi 
children would be alive today if 1990 conditions in Iraq had continued 
through 1998.  The sanctions have claimed the lives of over one million 
innocent Iraqis, whose deaths would be more newsworthy in the U.S. if they 
had white skin.

<p>The U.S., with over 12 times as many people as Iraq, is the world’s biggest 
economy.  In addition, the U.S. is the leading importer of oil.  The U.S. 
military presence in the Middle East is directly related to its oil 
dependence and car-centered economy.

<p>For the U.S., trade relations are based in big part on its domination of the 
global oil market and competition with Japan and the European Union.  Oil is 
the essential energy source for economic activity around the world.  Energy 
sources such as wind and solar power are simply no alternative to oil, the 
International Energy Agency reported in 1998.

<p>On one hand, Iraq has the world’s second largest estimated crude oil 
reserves after Saudi Arabia.  On the other hand, keeping Iraq flat on its 
back with cruel economic sanctions neuters that nation’s ability to alter 
the U.S.-led balance of power in the region.  That power over Japanese and 
European competitors is flowing from control over Middle East oil, “a 
stupendous source of strategic power, and one of the greatest material 
prizes in world history,” according to the U.S. State Department in 1945.  
Today, U.S. policymakers speak instead about the need for “stability” in the 
Middle East.  Old wine in new bottles.

<p>Currently, a British proposal to modify the sanctions against Iraq is being 
deliberated at the U.N.  However the proposed change to so-called “smart 
sanctions” is more about spinning a new image of economic barbarism than 
offering concrete relief to the Iraqi people, according to Father Simon 
Harak.  “Sanctions should be lifted, not smartened,” Cannon adds.

<p>If his moral sense about free trade meant anything other than helping U.S. 
corporations gain market share and boost profits, Bush would allow Iraq to 
rebuild its infrastructure.  To do this, Iraq needs to have normal economic 
relations with the rest of the world.  Then, every fourth Iraqi child 
wouldn’t be underweight, with one in 10 being felled by disease and hunger.  
And Iraqi hospitals would be filled with basic medicine and equipment, as 
they were before the Gulf War, when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was a U.S. 
ally.

<p>To mislead public opinion about U.S. foreign policy, Bush uses the term 
“free trade” in part to direct attention away from the barbaric reality of 
U.S. Iraq policy.  While the president moralizes about the need for global 
“free trade,” his administration is working to prevent Iraq from trading 
freely.
