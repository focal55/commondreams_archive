There are two quite different ideas of globalization. One vision is in the mind of the World Bank and its friends, preparing for their September conference and aiming to produce a free flow of trade around the planet. It may be called the bankers' vision. 
<P>The other is in the mind of its opponents, the people who are ready to shout outside those very conferences to prevent this. 
<P>The bankers' vision shows the globe as essentially hollow. What is real is merely a network of trade routes - lines on the planet's surface, a pattern of wires much like those toy spheres on the surface of which you can push colored beads around. The aim of these visionaries is to make their beads (sellable products and money) move round their network as fast and as freely as possible.  
<P>This is why President Bush does not feel at all embarrassed in explaining that his country cannot cooperate with others to resist global warming because such efforts might clash with its commercial interests. It strikes him as quite natural to insist that he need take no notice of the steerage passengers who are reporting that the ship is sinking. It is not sinking at his end.  
<P>In contrast, the people outside the conferences have got the idea that the terrestrial globe is solid. They think of it as a real planet, populated by plants, animals and people who are complex items and have grown up on its surface in extremely complex ways. 
<P>They do not believe that these people can survive unless they adapt themselves -<-> </->and their trading habits - more carefully to the workings of the whole system.  
<P>What is striking about the bankers' vision is its abstractness. What it treats as reality is simply the subject matter of economics - exchange. When economics was first recognized as a science, that abstractness was seen as a virtue. Elegant simplicity does have its place in thought. But when you are dealing with highly complex subject matter, it can mislead.  
<P>Economics, like physics, can deal only with certain limited aspects of human life. Exclusive obsession with exchange leads to a kind of economic fundamentalism - a belief that increase in trade will always lead to improvement in other quarters. 
<P>This is trickle down - the idea that the mere making of money will eventually benefit the people who really need it. As we know, this does not happen. The increasing inequalities between rich and poor make it an urgent matter that we should stop pretending that it does.  
<P>Until recently, most educated people in the west had a vision of the world that was not much less abstract than that of the bankers. Their picture did go beyond trade to include the whole of human life. But it still grotesquely exaggerated human power.
<P>It still did not grasp the vastness of the system on which we are so vulnerably perched. It saw all non-human life and the rest of the planet merely as territory to be occupied, dangers to be overcome, a set of resources to be used.  
<P>This is the dream from which the current environmental disasters are now awaking us. What we need, if we are to deal effectively with this painful waking, is the idea of Gaia - of the earth and all the life upon it as a self-sustaining natural system. 
<P>This is not just some strange Californian fancy but a central concept for our age, a tool that we need for many of our current problems.
<P>Besides facilitating new applications of science and technology, it can counteract the corrosive social atomism that colors much of our scientific and political thought. Once fully grasped, it makes a difference to how we see the earth and how we understand life and ourselves.   
<P>The difficulty about grasping this concept lies in fitting it into the fragmented framework of our thought about the earth and our own place on it. Our moral, psychological and political ideas have all been armed against looking for an enclosing context that will relate the various parts of a problem. When we think about ourselves, we tend to do so in isolation. 
<P>We get trapped in the narrow, atomistic, 17th-century image of social life that grounds today's crude and arid individualism. In that context, trade and the competition that goes with it, can seem to be the only real form of interaction between these separate social atoms. But a more realistic view of the cooperative earth can give us a more realistic view of ourselves as its inhabitants.  
<P>Human beings grow in a context. We are closely akin to a whole continuum of other life forms, out of which we have evolved. We are not pure intellects, sent from a remote intellectual sphere to exploit and colonize the planet. 
<P>We belong here and we could not possibly live anywhere else. It's time that we paid some attention to our home.  
<P><i>Mary Midgley is a philosopher. Her pamphlet, </i>Gaia: The Next Big Idea<i>, was published by Demos in May.
