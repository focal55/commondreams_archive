The vast Internet is many things to many people. Accustomed to 
their own routes through cyberspace, individuals may assume that what they 
see is fairly typical. But in society as a whole, what are the Web's 
dominant traffic patterns?

<p>While some view it as an expansive bastion of decentralized 
communication and democratic discourse, the Internet now functions quite 
differently overall. In total, the World Wide Web is scarcely more 
civic-minded than your local bank.

<p>Consider the flat-out judgment rendered by America's leading organ 
of capitalism a few weeks ago. The Wall Street Journal tilts toward the 
delusional on its ideology-laden editorial pages, but its news reporting is 
-- out of investor necessity -- right on the money. And the paper was on 
target with a July 23 piece by reporter Thomas E. Weber, who scrutinized 
the evolving role of the Web.

<p>Back in the summer of 1993, "cyberspace had remained practically 
free of advertisements, but marketers were beginning to eye the medium." 
Eight years later, Weber wrote, "it's difficult to remember that quaint, 
commercial-free Internet. Marketers didn't just eye the medium -- they 
conquered it." He added: "The Internet has been transformed largely into a 
place of commerce."

<p>But the Internet remains, for many, an object of illusion.

<p>As if looking backward through the wrong end of a telescope, some 
observers are dazzled by the virtues of their personal treks online. But 
whatever cyber-stars are in the eyes of certain individuals, the business 
calculations of hard-nosed number crunchers are focused elsewhere. And the 
documented trends are enough to make the most avaricious media tycoon grin.

<p>Websites operated by just four corporations account for 50.4 
percent of the time that U.S. users of the Web are now spending online, the 
authoritative Jupiter Media Metrix research firm reported in early summer. 
At the top of the heap were AOL Time Warner's sites, with 32 percent of all 
minutes spent online in the nation, followed by Microsoft (7.5 percent) and 
Yahoo (7.2 percent).

<p>Jupiter senior analyst Aram Sinnreich said the figures "show an 
irrefutable trend toward online media consolidation and indicate that the 
playing field is anything but even." He cited the data as refutation of the 
still-popular notion that "severe market dominance is impossible on the 
Internet."

<p>The most heavily trafficked sites are overwhelmingly devoted to 
commercial activities in one form or another, such as online shopping, 
financial services, investment, corporate-screened entertainment, travel 
deals and market research. Meanwhile, even on many nonprofit sites, banner 
ads are bigger than ever. And intrusive pop-up advertisements are spreading.

<p>To make matters appreciably worse, the owners of some key search 
engines are avidly prostituting their services. (The most powerful 
search-scam offenders include AltaVista, AOL, Microsoft and Lycos. For 
details, visit www.commercialalert.org.) These days, if you use one of the 
Internet's main search engines to find whatever, the chances are good that 
the top results came from dollars rather than relevance or quality.

<p>"Search engine optimization is the number one strategy for 
generating qualified traffic to your site," said a recent sales pitch 
offering prominence in search-engine listings. "Eighty-five percent of all 
traffic is generated via search queries and over 90 percent of that traffic 
is driven to the top 30 results. If you're not in the top 30, you're not in 
a position to compete!"

<p>But faith in the democratic character of the Internet is 
resilient; a myth that will not die. And the more that huge outfits ravage 
cyberspace, the more useful the mythology becomes, laying a thick fog over 
the realities of mega-media domination.

<p>The spectacular dot-com plunge has caused many corporate managers 
to sharpen their cost-cutting knives, endangering just about any media 
content that doesn't seem to directly correlate with boosting revenue.

<p>Before the Los Angeles Times cancelled his long-running and 
insightful column "Digital Nation" in mid-July, scholar Gary Chapman gained 
many readers as he tracked digital trends. Four months ago, he was citing 
informed predictions that Web browsers will become outdated within five 
years, giving way to "widespread use of interactive TV networks managed by 
large media companies."

<p>The dot-com flameouts have sped up the Net's commercialization -- 
as quests for cash-flow, market share and multimedia synergy become more 
voracious.

<p>"The idea that anyone with an e-commerce Web site could sell 
anything under the sun seems completely dead now," Chapman noted last 
spring. "The alternative seems to be a move toward closed networks, not 
unlike America Online, in which the user experience is guided, shaped and 
far more controlled -- something advertisers and online retailers are 
demanding. In other words, there is a growing sense in the high-tech 
industry that consumer networks of the future will begin to look more like 
television -- indeed, some believe interactive digital TV is the true wave 
of the future."

<p>For a time, the Internet seemed to elude the profit-driven matrix 
squeezing media and public life. Some illusions die hard. But hopefully we 
can move forward with new resolve to fight against corporate power -- and 
for truly democratic media.
