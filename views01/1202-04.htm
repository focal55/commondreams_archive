WASHINGTON  &#151; It is often said that the war against terrorism has brought us together, minimizing our social and political differences. 
<P>
Yeah, right. 
<P>
Just try voicing reservations about the war in mixed company. Don't be surprised to find your patriotism questioned. 
<P>
That's what has happened to 117 campus speakers and anti-war protestors who have had some of their statements compiled by an organization called the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, which calls the statements unpatriotic. The list is included in a report ACTA plans to distribute to 3,000 campuses. 
<P>
This politically bipartisan but culturally conservative-leaning organization is one of several national groups founded in recent years to defend academic freedom and the teaching of traditional liberal arts in an era of rising multicultural studies on campus. 
<P>
The council attracts more attention than most advocacy groups because it was co-founded in 1995 by Lynne Cheney, wife of Vice President Dick Cheney, and Sen. Joseph Lieberman. D-Conn., Al Gore's running mate in 2000. 
<P>
The urgent tone of the report, which is posted on the ACTA's Web site (www.goacta.org/), is captured in its title: "Defending Civilization: How Our Universities are Failing America and What Can Be Done About It." 
<P>
Yet, the actual threat described in the report sounds pretty lame, especially at a time when antiwar fervor has been almost nonexistent even on the most traditionally liberal campuses. 
<P>
One speaker, for example, made the list for telling a Harvard Law School audience: that Americans should "build bridges and relationships, not simply bombs and walls." Although this quote and most others are not attributed by name in the report, the speaker was the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who can always be depended upon to say something that outrages conservatives and, for that matter, quite a few moderates. 
<P>
A professor of Middle Eastern history at Stanford University is quoted for saying: "If Osama bin Laden is confirmed to be behind the attacks, the United States should bring him before an international tribunal on charges of crimes against humanity." 
<P>
A New York University professor of communications is quoted as telling a reporter that "there is a lot of skepticism about the administration's policy of going to war." 
<P>
An anthropology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is quoted as telling a peace rally: "Imagine the real suffering and grief of people in other countries. The best way to begin a war on terrorism might be to look in the mirror." 
<P>
Liberals often are accused of imposing "politically correct" standards for what is offensive. Cultural conservatives, it turns out, have their thought police, too. 
<P>
One can and should argue the merits of these and other statements on the list. But ACTA does itself a disservice by using such hyperventilated language to disagree with ideas, even if it finds the ideas objectionable. 
<P>
Oddly for a group devoted to scholarship, the council makes the anti-intellectual error of equating one's patriotism with one's agreement with government policies. You can be a patriot and still disagree with actions or policies that a particular administration has embraced. In a democracy, dissent is often the sincerest form of patriotic flattery. 
<P>
Besides, for an organization that vows to "safeguard the free exchange of ideas on campus," as the ACTA mission statement says, their report reveals a remarkably feeble faith in the power of good ideas to drive out bad ones. 
<P>
For example, if someone has a way for us to punish the perpetrators of the 9-11 tragedy and end terrorism without fighting a war, I'd like to hear it. Otherwise, the emptiness of the antiwar argument collapses under the weight of its own rhetoric. 
<P>
Groups like the council perform a worthy service when they work to make campuses safe for the expression of opposing views. That's healthy. As an African American, for example, I have long criticized the "PC" excesses that try to shield women and minorities from offense rather than encouraging an open dialogue. We need more candid discussions across racial and gender lines, not less. 
<P>
However, judging by their knee-jerk response to antiwar dissent, I think the authors of the council's report could use a little more multicultural exposure, too. 
<P>
The roots of the terrorism that erupted in tragedy on 9-11 are to be found in the ignorance and resentment that has welled up over the years in what foreign policy experts call the Arab and Muslim "street." Everyday citizens in the Arab and Islamic worlds who resent the lack of economic, cultural and democratic reforms in their own countries see America as part of the problem more than the solution. It is from the pools of such ignorance and resentment that terrorists like bin Laden find support. 
<P>
So Jackson actually is right when he asserts that America cannot win its war against terrorism with bombs and bullets alone. Americans need to reach out and see how we look to the Arab and Islamic worlds, even while we're trying to teach them a more balanced and complete view of who we are. 
<P>
As a speaker from the Islamic Academy of Las Vegas said at a rally, "Ignorance breeds hate." That quote made the council's list, too, for some reason. I don't know why. Maybe the authors like ignorance.
