The apples are ripening, the leaves are tinged with red and a word, normalcy, has been imported to describe this late September and the bizarre split we are living between the everyday and the fearful anticipation of what is about to happen. Not since the 1950s has the west had to live with such pervasive anxiety, and we know the reverberations will roll out for months, years to come, affecting every aspect of our lives. Do you flinch when you hear an airplane overhead? Do you find yourself following its drone, heart in your mouth, for fear of an explosion? Do we want to live in densely populated cities? Do you still enjoy those views from high-rise buildings? Who wants to take a flight or go on holiday? We have only begun to glimpse so far, as the denial wears off, the psychological impact of the terrorist attack - the woman in New York who committed suicide at the weekend and the millions who toss and turn at night, their minds full of nightmare images of the people we watched die. 
<P>This cannot be dismissed as touchy-feely women's stuff while the boys do the real job of analyzing the guns and bombs. Because the point of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center was not just to kill people, but to destabilize, perhaps ultimately destroy, a way of life and to spread terror through western urban capitalist democracy. If war is at all a suitable word to use now, its primary battleground is people's hearts and minds, be they in the western or Muslim worlds. Psychology, not weaponry, will decide it.  
<P>The fact that our personal safety is threatened in Britain brings this conflict closer than any since the second world war, but our fear is that all of us could be drawn in even more deeply into a conflict between cultures and over values of a kind not seen perhaps since the 17th century. Samuel Huntington predicted in his rightly-criticized book, The Clash of Civilizations, this kind of "societal cold war" over culture instead of ideology; he characterized many Muslims' view of the west as one of revulsion and resentment against a "materialistic, corrupt, decadent and immoral" western hegemony that claims the universality of its values. From what we know of Bin Laden and his associates, it is from this sort of alienation that he is able to recruit followers and attract donations. Their fight is not over territory but over righteousness: the infidel American troops in the holy places, but also the just distribution of resources and the role of women.  
<P>Another reason for this conflict to hit home: women are center stage. Moroccan writer Fatima Mernissi points out in her book Islam and Democracy how the hijab is a metaphor and measure of the entire social order; to the Muslim world nothing expresses more powerfully and more seductively what it sees as the anarchic individualism of the west than the independence of its women. (And it is its very seductiveness that contributes to the siege mentality of much of the Islamic world.) In contrast, to most westerners, using women as a tool for social order is horrifying, as the release at the weekend of the extraordinary Iranian film, The Circle, starkly demonstrated.  
<P>Women are already and will be as much victims of this conflict as men. Twentieth-century warfare saw to that, as the proportion of non-combatants killed rose from 20% at its start to 80% at its end. Now women, unwittingly, find themselves one of the causes of the conflict. Yet, we are not its chief protagonists - decisions are being made for and about us. The consistent gender divide in the polls on military action indicates that at times of crisis like this women are less moved by anger and more concerned with weighing the long-term consequences.  
<P>So, as a beneficiary of all the freedoms western women have won in the last century, I find myself signing up for the purple rhetoric about this being a unique moment in western history when the struggle for our civilization is at stake, but radically departing company on how best to defend that civilization And I also find myself increasingly alarmed that we are in danger of losing sight of the very principles and values in the west that we are rightly entitled to describe as civilized.
<P>First, the greatest contribution Jesus Christ made to humanity's ethical understanding was that the instinct to revenge, retaliate and fight back should be restrained. Despite Christianity's waning influence, it was precisely this ethical principle that we so admired in the greatest political leaders in the last century: Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King and Gandhi. Their leaderships all illustrated that the most effective way to fight (though it requires huge patience) is through moral example of magnanimity and restraint, and the huge political courage they both require.  
<P>Ironically, the very arguments used in Northern Ireland, the Middle East and South Africa, have now been tossed aside without a second's thought. And make no mistake, the build-up of military hardware around Afghanistan is about visible revenge. It is designed to generate the television images that will assuage American emotion, it is not about justified self-defense, because as the British know all too well, you cannot end terrorism with violence - we did not bomb republican Belfast after Warrington. Nor do the strategies of deterrence used in the two most recent wars, in the Gulf and the former Yugoslavia, have any weight this time from what we know about the mentality of the men around Bin Laden. What is going virtually unchallenged here is the legitimacy of revenge: Bin Laden may be destroying our civilization faster than we realize it.  
<P>While the huge support in opinion polls for military action indicates a collective amnesia of our moral tradition, the hypocrisy it exposes in the west's claim to moral superiority is not lost on the Muslim world. Violence is a powerful form of communication, as Mohamed Atta and his colleagues understood: we all knew from their choice of targets what they were saying about US economic and military domination. So what will be the message of the US-led coalition, made up of the most powerful nations on earth, in attacking one of the poorest, a country of ruins, refugees, a legacy of a cold-war playground?  
<P>Bush, in his carefully crafted speech on Thursday, said he had no quarrel with Islam, only with terrorists, but these were nuances that went unheard in the towns of Pakistan, Algeria and Egypt where they watch what the US does, not what it says. This is what keeps me awake at night: the tragic possibilities of one of the 20th century's most lethal inheritances - the way in which the Abrahamic faiths have been pitted, one against the other. The very same God is being invoked on all sides.  
<P>Second, there is a danger that, as Yeats put it, the center cannot hold; that the ground on which stand efforts for tolerance, mutual understanding and respect, is eroded by the Us and Them mentality. Already there have been attacks on Muslims and, mistakenly, on Sikhs. Will our aspirations to multiculturalism - which is precisely about respecting difference - become collateral damage? It is hard enough at the best of times, so wide is the gulf in beliefs on individual human rights such as freedom of expression, as Mernissi points out, but how much harder when the cycle of violence is turning? A crisis for liberalism looms because its prosaic lubricant - the tolerance born of indifference, not enough people cared - was destroyed on September 11.</p>
