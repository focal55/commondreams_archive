THERE are many contenders for biggest political
opportunist since the September 11 atrocities. Politicians ramming through
life-changing laws while telling voters they are still mourning; corporations
diving for public cash; pundits accusing their opponents of treason.
<p>
Yet amid the chorus of draconian proposals and McCarthyite threats, one voice
of opportunism still stands out. That voice belongs to Robyn Mazer, who is
using September 11 to call for an international crackdown on counterfeit
T-shirts.
<p>
Not surprisingly, Ms Mazer is a trade lawyer in Washington DC. Even less
surprising, she specializes in trade laws that protect America's single largest
export - copyright.
<p>
That is music, movies, logos, seed patents, software and much more. Trade
related intellectual property rights (Trips) are among the most controversial
side-agreements in the run-up to next month's World Trade Organization meeting
in Qatar.
<p>
It is the battleground for disputes ranging from Brazil's right to disseminate
free generic Aids drugs, to China's huge market in knock-off Britney Spears
CDs.
<p>
American multinationals are desperate to gain access to these large markets for
their products - but they want protection. Many poor countries, meanwhile, say
Trips cost millions to police, while strangleholds on intellectual property
drive up costs for local industries and consumers.
<p>
What does any of this trade wrangling have to do with terrorism? Nothing,
absolutely nothing. Unless, of course, you ask Ms Mazer, who wrote an article
last week in the Washington Post headlined -  From T-shirts to terrorism: That
fake Nike swoosh may be helping fund bin Laden's network.
<p>
She wrote: "Recent developments suggest that many of the governments suspected
of supporting al Qaeda are also promoting, being corrupted by, or at the very
least ignoring highly lucrative trafficking in counterfeit and pirated products
capable of generating huge money flows to terrorists."
<p>
"Suggest", "suspected of", "at the very least", "capable of", that is a lot of
hedging for one sentence, especially from someone who used to work in the US
department of justice. But the conclusion is unambiguous: You either enforce
Trips, or you are with the terrorists.
<p>
Welcome to the brave new world of trade negotiations, where every arcane clause
is infused with the self-righteousness of a holy war.
<p>
Ms Mazer's political opportunism raises some interesting contradictions.
<p>
Robert Zoellick, US trade representative, has been using September 11 for
another opportunistic goal - to secure "fast track" trade negotiating power for
George W Bush, the president.
<p>
According to Mr Zoellick, trade "promotes the values at the heart of this
protracted struggle".
<p>
What do new trade deals have to do with fighting terrorism? Well, the
terrorists, we are told again and again, hate America precisely because they
hate consumerism: McDonald's and Nike and capitalism - you know, freedom. To
trade is therefore to defy their ascetic crusade, to spread the very products
they loathe.
<p>
But wait a minute. What about all those fakes Ms Mazer says are bankrolling
terror?
<p>
In Afghanistan, she claims, you can buy "T-shirts bearing counterfeit Nike
logos and glorifying bin Laden as 'The great mujahid of Islam'".
<p>
It seems we are facing a much more complicated scenario than the facile
dichotomy of a consumerist McWorld versus an anti-consumer Jihad.
<p>
In fact, if Ms Mazer is correct, not only are the two worlds thoroughly
enmeshed, the imagery of McWorld is being used to finance Jihad.
<p>
Maybe a little complexity is not so bad. Part of the disorientation many
Americans now face has to do with the inflated and over-simplified place
consumerism plays in the American narrative.
<p>
To buy is to be. To buy is to love. To buy is to vote. People outside the US
who want Nikes - even counterfeit Nikes - must want to be American, must love
America, must in some way be voting for everything America stands for.
<p>
This has been the fairy tale since 1989, when the same media companies that are
bringing us America's War on Terrorism proclaimed that their television
satellites would topple dictatorships the world over.
<p>
Consumerism would lead, inevitably, to freedom. But all these easy narratives
are breaking down.
<p>
Authoritarianism co-exists with consumerism, desire for American products is
mixed with rage at inequality.
<p>
Nothing exposes these contradictions more clearly than the trade wars raging
over "fake" goods. Pirating thrives in the deep craters of global inequality,
when demand for consumer goods is decades ahead of purchasing power.
<p>
It thrives in China, where goods made in export-only sweatshops are sold for
more than factory workers make in a month. In Africa, where the price of Aids
drugs is a cruel joke. In Brazil, where CD pirates are feted as musical Robin
Hoods.
<p>
Complexity is lousy for opportunism. But does help us get closer to the truth,
even if it means sorting through a lot of fakes.
