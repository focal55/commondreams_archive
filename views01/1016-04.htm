Anti-U.S. sentiment, protests and anger are spreading across Pakistan
even among anti-Taliban moderates and pro-western, English-speaking
liberals.  They wonder why the U.S. continues to bomb a poor country like
their next-door-neighbor-to-the-west, Afghanistan.  Today, as U.S. Secretary
of State Colin Powell arrived to calm their fears, their
long-time-enemy-to-the-east and fellow nuclear power, India began to attack
at least 11 Pakistani border posts.  President Bush bristled  that India and
Pakistan should "stand down during our activities in Afghanistan."  The
United States' biggest oil supplier, Saudi Arabia, spoke out through their
Interior Minister, who said the kingdom was "not at all happy" that the U.S.
"is killing innocent people."  10 of the 19 hijackers who carried out the
September 11 attacks were Saudi nationals and their government has refused
to freeze Osama bin Laden's assets.  Heavily armed with sophisticated U.S.
weaponry, many Saudis admire bin Laden and view the high-tech attacks on one
of the poorest countries in the world as arrogant and insensitive.  As the
peril spirals in the  "War Against Terrorism", intriguing symbols emerge as
"targets"and an ulterior motive for U. S. policy against Afghanistan is
reported.

<p>The "terrorized" American public is distraught and dazzled from
attacks on a series of symbolic targets in the United States that began with
airliners crashing into buildings embodying the essence of U.S. economic and
military power. It has continued with anthrax attacks on jingoistic U.S.
media outlets that the "terrorists" would perceive to be the purveyors of
western decadence and distortion.  Newly published  reports from India and
the U.S. indicate we might have been distracted from considering an even
more sinister scenario of U.S. intentions to "build-a-nation" from the ruins
of Afghanistan as a conduit for Caspian Basin oil and nearby natural gas.

<p>NBC Evening News anchor wanna-be Brian Williams was in obvious denial
on NBC News Saturday night as he characterized the targeted attack of
anthrax on NBC employees as, "It couldn't be more random."  NBC News is a
cheerleader for the "War Against Terrorism"and  is owned by General Electric
Corporation, a major U.S. weapons vendor for decades whose GE Theater on
television was hosted by Ronald Reagan.  General Electric launched the
political career of Reagan by sending him on a speaking tour across the
country, laying the ground-work for his presidency whose hallmark was a
giant U.S. military build-up benefiting his sponsoring corporation.  The
only other successful and documented anthrax attack was diabolically
directed against American Media, Inc., our nation's leading supplier of
supermarket sleaze, whose tabloids appearing now at the checkout counters
contain headlines and captions like: "Faces of Evil, Take a  good look at
the fiendish faces of terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden and stare into
the eyes of pure evil" in the National Enquirer; "Bin Laden's Evil Scheme to
Hook America On 'Superdrug'," Terror lord planned to flood America with
killer heroin" in Globe; and "Bin Laden's son, the 10 year old Heir Apparent
of Hatred," in Star.   But bio-terror is not as big a story as
terror-for-oil.

<p>On October 13, in a story titled "America, Oil and Afghanistan"in the
online edition of India's National Newspaper, The Hindu, Sitaram Yechury
reported a quote from U. S. News and World Report of Vice-President Cheney,
in 1998 when he was CEO of Halliburton, a major player in the global energy
industry.  Cheney told energy industry executives, "I cannot think of a time
when we have had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically
significant as the Caspian."  Yechury says that the Caspian region oil
reserves may be large enough to offset Persian gulf oil "within the next 15
to 20 years," and that Turkmenistan on Afghanistan's northern border has the
world's third largest natural gas reserves.  Yechury reports that Jon
Flanders in an article, "The Afghanistan Pipeline Connection" quotes Michael
Klare, author of "Resource Wars" as saying that "We (the U.S.)  view oil as
a security consideration and we have to protect it by any means necessary,
regardless of other considerations, other values."  Yechury reported that
the U.S. Government Energy Information fact sheet on Afghanistan dated
December 2000 says, "Afghanistan's significance from an energy standpoint
stems from its geographic position as potential transit route for oil and
gas exports from Central Asia to the Arabian Sea.  This potential includes
proposed multi-billion dollar oil and gas export lines through Afghanistan."

<p>Setting up this shocking scenario of the implicit U.S. attempt to control
the government of Afghanistan to insure oil and natural gas pipelines
through that country from the oil and gas rich Caspian Basin was a story in
Sunday's N. Y. Times by Joseph Kahn.  Kahn reported that "President Bush,
whose foreign policy views during the campaign could be summed up as 'no
more nation building,' declared last week that the United States would form
a new government in Afghanistan and feed its 'poor souls.'"
