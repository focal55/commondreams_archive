      paralysing traffic through Baltimore and sabotaging up the main
      eastern transport and cyber-artery of the United States, could
      have been carrying spent nuclear fuel rods. The clean-up wouldn't
      take weeks. It would take centuries. New Department of Energy
      regs allow for rail cars to carry lethal nuclear fuel.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The nuclear industry is on
      full emergency alert after the Baltimore debacle. It knows that
      years of lobbying and propaganda about the &quot;safe&quot; transportation
      of nuclear waste could go down the tubes. Answering such fears
      Harry Reid of Nevada, number two Democrat in the US Senate and
      prime opponent of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste plan, has
      pounced on the Baltimore disaster.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a Senate floor speech Thursday
      Reid said the crash in a Baltimore tunnel near Camden Yards baseball
      park should slow the &quot;mad clamor by the nuclear power industry
      to send nuclear waste somewhere. They don't care
      where it goes, but they have focused on Nevada for the present
      time. And I think everyone needs to recognize that transporting
      dangerous materials is very difficult,&quot; he said. &quot;The
      leaking hydrochloric acid in Baltimore is nothing compared to
      the high-level radioactive waste proposed for the Yucca Mountain
      site 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. A speck the size of a
      pinpoint would kill a person. And we're talking about transporting
      some 70,000 tons of it across America.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reid told his fellow senators
      that an estimated 60 million people would be within 1 mile of
      the truck and rail routes proposed to ship waste to Yucca Mountain.
      &quot;What we should do with nuclear waste is leave it where
      it is,&quot; he said.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US Energy Department's high-level nuclear waste transportation
      route maps were released in January, 2000 as part of the Draft
      Environmental Impact Statement for a Geologic Repository at Yucca
      Mountain. These maps have been reviewed by the Nuclear Information
      &amp; Research Service. The irradiated nuclear fuel from Constellation
      Energy Group's (formerly Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric's) Calvert
      Cliffs nuclear plant located on the western shore of the Chesapeake
      Bay in Calvert County, Maryland could be carried by heavy haul
      truck to the nearest CSX railhead at Chalk Point (about 67 miles
      from Baltimore), then transported by train through Baltimore.
      The DOE route map for Maryland can be viewed on the Internet
      at: <A HREF="http://www.ymp.gov/timeline/eis/routes/routemaps.htm" target="new">http://www.ymp.gov/timeline/eis/routes/routemaps.htm</A></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The DOE map does not estimate
      how many containers of high-level nuclear waste would travel
      through Baltimore on the CSX. In a 1995 report, the State of
      Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects identified the same railway
      through Baltimore as a potential high-level nuclear waste transport
      route from Calvert Cliffs' twin reactors. The 1995 Nevada report
      identified the rail route as belonging to Conrail: Conrail then
      merged with CSX in 1997. The Nevada study, &quot;High-Level Nuclear
      Waste Shipping Route Maps to Yucca Mountain and Shipment Number
      Estimates,&quot; reported that 180 rail casks from Calvert Cliffs
      could travel the CSX line through Baltimore and numerous States
      westward on its way to Yucca Mountain, Nevada. This map can be
      viewed on the Internet at <A HREF="http://www.state.nv.us/nucwaste/states/maryland.htm" target="new">http://www.state.nv.us/nucwaste/states/maryland.htm</A></font></P>
<P><font color="#990000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">evin Kamps, nuclear waste specialist
      at Nuclear Information &amp; Resource Service estimates that
      &quot;Each of the 180 rail containers of atomic waste from Calvert
      Cliffs could hold one hundred times the long-lasting radiation
      released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb. Irradiated nuclear fuel,
      even decades after removal from the reactor, can deliver a lethal
      dose of radiation in a few minutes time&quot;, Kamps tells us.
      &quot;The only thing standing between people and deadly radiation
      is the nuclear waste transport container, which can be breached
      and release radiation in a severe accident.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Baltimore Sun has reported
      that the fire in the train tunnel reached temperatures as high
      as 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The fire, apparently fed by flammable
      chemicals in the train cargo, burned out of control all day long,
      overnight, and well into the next day. &quot;The inadequate U.S.
      Nuclear Regulatory Commission design criteria for high-level
      nuclear waste containers only calls for casks to be able to withstand
      a 1,475 degree fire for 30 minutes&quot;, Kamps reports. &quot;Obviously,
      this real life accident in Baltimore surpassed the NRC's design
      criteria for containers that would hold deadly atomic waste.
      These outdated NRC criteria dates back to 1947, and haven't been
      updated since, despite combustibles on the roads and rails today
      that burn at much higher temperatures.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Baltimore Sun quoted a
      firefighter as saying all he could see inside the tunnel was
      the glowing metal of train tanker cars. &quot;It was a deep orange,
      like a horseshoe just pulled out of the oven.&quot;</font></P>
<P>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
If it had been nuclear waste,
      that firefighter wouldn't be able to look inside the tunnel.
      If he did, it wouldn't be long before he was dead. Here at CounterPunch
      we're willing to bet that somewhere in the &quot;Terror Attack&quot;
      scenarios stacked up in FEMA and other government agencies is
      one involving tunnels up and down the east coast. Now they've
      got a real-life lesson smouldering right under their noses, not
      so far from where the British bombarded Ft. McHenry outside Baltimore
      in the war of 1812, thus provoking the composition of the Star
      Spangled Banner. Stormed at with shot and shell? How about &quot;glowing
      with nuclear waste&quot;.
