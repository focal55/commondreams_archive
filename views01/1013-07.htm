President Bush told us that this war would be like one we’d never seen; so 
far it looks a lot like all the other wars. I don’t mean just our maneuvers 
and operations: send in the bombs, break the rocks up smaller and smaller, 
then the special forces to slit the throats of the few goats left alive 
before the infantry rolls in to manage an uneasy peace, occupation or 
otherwise. I mean that the basic premise is the same as it ever was: Send in 
our killers to kill their killers.

<p>Sticks, rocks, spears, swords, bows, guns, bombs; the same military pageant 
we’ve seen put on time after time, by nation after nation in book after book 
and film after film. It’s not hard to imagine one of our F-18s 
fighter-bombers taking off from its carrier for another sortie over the low 
hills. It’s not hard to imagine because our TVs and movies have shown us, 
and our newspapers are centerfolds of just what war-making technology the 
enemy can expect.

<p>Imagine the soldier or group of soldiers who eventually find bin Laden 
trembling in a cave, or stuffed into a car trunk trying to flee across the 
border. Would it be like nabbing Hitler (finally!)? What then? Bring him 
back to the States in chains? Place him in stocks at Ground Zero and pelt 
him with rotten produce? Death by a thousand cuts? No, if he’s taken alive 
we should try him in open court, accord him his due process, not because he 
deserves it; he doesn’t deserve any such thing. We should accord him due 
process because it is part of who we are; we’ll not do it for him, we’ll do 
it for ourselves.

<p>Our president keeps throwing around the word “evil.” They are evil, he says, 
we are good. Such easy distinctions are a panacea for small minds. Has the 
United States ever been guilty of comparable evil to that perpetrated on 
September 11? In a constitutional republic, such questions can never be 
inappropriate, despite what government mouthpieces might suggest. This is 
not a time to shy away from difficult issues, but to confront them head on: 
Has the government of the United States ever supported, directly or 
indirectly, such terror? The answer would have to be yes. It may have been 
done for a variety of reasons and even with the best of intentions, but this 
fact remains: innocent men, women, children have suffered and been murdered, 
families have been destroyed and mothers and fathers wept because of our 
policies.

<p>Over the last weeks in my country there has been an outpouring of grief 
unlike anything I’ve ever seen; in our papers, our magazines, our television 
shows. It is painful to recognize that, in the past, our government has been 
the cause of such grief in others. This is not to suggest, of course, that 
we should forego our pursuit of the terrorists and their networks, only to 
provide some much needed context as our media and politicians continue in 
what seems to be permanent high dudgeon.

<p>Do we have other options? Could Osama bin Laden have possibly expected 
anything other than a military response? From what I have read and seen, bin 
Laden is not a man who wants peace. Bin Laden wants war, which is exactly 
what we are determined to give him. Would it disappoint him if we tried 
something else?

<p>Gandhi was once asked if non-violence could work against a man like Hitler. 
He was not sure; there would be loss, he replied, there would be suffering. 
But, he continued, is there not loss and suffering under the current method?

<p>Passive resistance is an inaccurate term to describe the methods of Gandhi 
and  Martin Luther King, Jr. Their goal was to use nonviolence to confront 
the perpetrators of violence with the perpetrator’s  own inhumanity, to show 
him a picture of himself that he could not bear. Could this work with bin 
Laden? Perhaps not; he believes God is rooting for him. But an innovative 
non-military strategy could work to win the essential support of the Islamic 
world, perhaps shrink the pool of volunteers from which bin Laden draws his 
willing agents. Unfortunately, with every bomb that’s dropped on 
Afghanistan, that pool becomes larger. After thousands of years of human 
existence, we’re still using sticks and stones to settle our disputes. It’s 
time for something new.
