A war that is supposed to help feed the desperate people of Afghanistan 
will in fact help starve them.

<p>A war supposedly brought on by Taliban intransigence was actually provoked 
by our own government.

<p>A war that the majority of the American people believe is about their 
grief, anger and desire for revenge is really about the cold-blooded 
calculations of a small elite seeking to extend its power.

<p>And a war that is supposed to make us safer has put us in far greater 
danger by increasing the likelihood of further terrorist attacks.

<p>Let’s take those points in order.

<p>Our undeclared war on Afghanistan is the culmination of a decade of U.S. 
aggression with a humanitarian façade.

<p>Once the natural sympathies of the American people were touched by the 
plight of the long-suffering Afghan people, public opinion swung toward 
helping them. In response to this, the administration concocted the most 
shameless and cynical cover story for military strikes in recent memory. 
The idea, leaked last Thursday, went like this:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The Afghan people are starving, so we need to do food drops. (Never mind 
that all those experienced in humanitarian aid programs are opposed to food 
drops because they are dangerous and wasteful, and, most important, 
preclude setting up the on-the-ground distribution networks necessary to 
making aid effective.)
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>We need to destroy the Taliban’s air defenses before doing food drops.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The transport planes may be endangered by the Stinger anti-aircraft 
missiles that the United States supplied the mujaheddin in the 1980s when 
they were fighting the Soviet Union, and some of which ended up in the 
Taliban’s hands.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>We have to destroy the Taliban’s air defense. Because so much of it is 
mobile, we have to bomb all over.

</li>
</ul>
<p>The bombing will seriously hinder existing aid efforts. The World Food 
Program operates a bakery in Kabul on which thousands of families depend, 
as well as many other programs. A number of United Nations organizations 
have been mounting a major new coordinated humanitarian campaign. These 
efforts were not endangered by the Taliban before, but the chaos and 
violence created by this bombing -- combined with a projected assault by 
the Northern Alliance -- will likely force UN personnel to withdraw, with 
disastrous effects for the Afghan people.

<p>To add insult to injury, in the first day the United States dropped only 
37,500 packaged meals, far below the daily needs of even a single large 
refugee camp. With 7.5 million people on the brink of death and existing 
programs disrupted, this is a drop in the bucket compared to the damage 
caused by this new war.

<p>Those who starve or freeze will not be the only innocents to die. It should 
finally be clear to all that “surgical strikes” are a myth. In the Gulf 
War, only 7 percent of the munitions used were “smart,” and those missed 
the target roughly half the time. One of those surgical strikes destroyed 
the Amiriyah bomb shelter, killing somewhere from 400 to 1,500 women and 
children. In Operation Infinite Reach, the 1998 attacks on Afghanistan, 
some of the cruise missiles went astray and hit Pakistan. Military 
officials have already admitted that not all of the ordnance being used is 
“smart,” and even the current generation of smart weapons hit their target 
only 70 to 80 percent of the time.

<p>Contrary to U.S. propaganda, civilian targets are always on the list. There 
are already reports that Mullah Omar, the leader of the Taliban, was 
targeted for assassination, and the Defense Ministry in Kabul -- surely no 
more military a target than the Pentagon -- and located in the middle of 
the city, has been destroyed.

<p>This is standard U.S. practice. In the Gulf War, virtually every power 
station in Iraq was destroyed, with untold effects on civilians. A 
correspondent for al-Jazeera TV reported that power went out in Kabul when 
the bombing started, although it was restored in some places within hours. 
Targeting of any pitiful remnants of civilian infrastructure in Afghanistan 
would be consistent with past U.S. policy.

<p>George Bush said we are not at war with the Afghan people -- just as we 
were not at war with the Iraqi people or the Serbian people. The hundreds 
of thousands of Afghans who fled the cities knew better.

<p>Military analysts suggest that the timing of the strikes had to do with the 
weather. Another possible interpretation is that the Taliban’s 
recently-expressed willingness to negotiate posed too great a danger that 
peace might break out. The Orwellian use of the term “diplomacy” to 
describe the consistent U.S. policy of no negotiations -- accept our 
peremptory demands or else -- helps to mask the fact that the 
administration always intended to launch this war.

<p>The same tactic was used against Serbia; at the Rambouillet negotiations in 
March 1999, demands were pitched just high enough that the Serbian 
government could not go along.

<p>In this case, the Taliban’s offer to detain bin Laden and try him before an 
Islamic court, while unacceptable, was a serious initial negotiating 
position and would have merited a serious counteroffer -- unless one had 
already decided to go to war.

<p>The administration has many reasons for this war.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The policy of imperial credibility, carried to such destructive extremes 
in Vietnam. In perhaps the last five years of direct U.S. involvement 
there, the goal was not to “win,” but to inflict such a price on Vietnam 
that other nations would not think of crossing the United States.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The oil and natural gas of central Asia, the next Middle East. 
Afghanistan’s location between the Caspian basin and huge markets in Japan, 
China and the Indian subcontinent gives it critical importance. A 
U.S-controlled client state in Afghanistan, presumably under the exiled 
octogenarian former king, Zahir Shah, would give U.S. corporations great 
leverage over those resources. Just as in the Middle East, the United 
States does not seek to own all those resources, but it wants to dictate 
the manner in which the wells and pipelines are developed and used.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The potential to push a radical right-wing domestic agenda. War makes it 
easier to expand police powers, restrict civil liberties, and increase the 
military budget.

</li>
</ul>
<p>This war is about the extension of U.S. power. It has little to do with 
bringing the terrorists to justice, or with vengeance. Judging from initial 
polls, the war has been popular as the administration trades on people’s 
desire for revenge -- but we should hardly confuse the emotional reaction 
of the public with the motivation of the administration. Governments do not 
feel emotions.

<p>This war will not make us more secure. For weeks, many in the antiwar 
movement -- and some careful commentators in more mainstream circles -- 
have been saying that military action was playing into the hands of Osama 
bin Laden, who may have been hoping for such an attack to spark the flames 
of anti-American feeling in the Muslim world. Bin Laden’s pre-taped speech, 
broadcast on al-Jazeera television after the bombing started, vindicates 
that analysis.

<p>“Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists,” Bush said on Sept. 
20. Bin Laden’s appeal to the ummah, the whole Islamic world, echoed this 
logic: “The world is divided into two sides -- the side of faith and the 
side of infidelity.”

<p>The American jihad may yet be matched by a widely expanded Islamic one, 
something unlikely had we not bombed. Remember, we have seen only the 
opening shots of what many officials are calling a long-term, multi-front 
war in which the secretary of defense has told us there will be no “silver 
bullet.” The administration has clearly been preparing the American people 
to accept an extended conflict.

<p>Bin Laden’s world is Bush’s, in some strangely distorted mirror. A world 
divided as they seem to want would have no place in it for those of us who 
want peace with justice.

<p>All is not yet lost. The first step is for us to send a message, not just 
to our government but to the whole world, saying, “This action done in our 
name was not done by our will. We are against the killing of innocents 
anywhere in the world.”

<p>The next step is for us to build a movement that can change our 
government’s barbaric and self-destructive policy.

<p>If we don’t act now to build a new world, we may just be left with no world.
