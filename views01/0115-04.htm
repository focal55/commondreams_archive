The 
              fierce farm crisis that is ravaging Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and 
              other agricultural states garnered scant attention during the 2000 
              presidential campaign that yielded a George W. Bush presidency, 
              so it came as no surprise that Bush&#146;s designation of California 
              agribusiness operative Ann Veneman for the post of secretary of 
              agriculture mustered far less comment than the nomination of Attorney 
              General-designee John Ashcroft or Interior Secretary-designee Gale 
              Norton.</font>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;Yet, 
              because of the broad authority she would be handed as agriculture 
              secretary and because of her extreme politics, Veneman could well 
              turn out to be Bush&#146;s most dangerous pick. Veneman&#146;s track 
              record suggests that, if confirmed, she will use her position as 
              head of a powerful agency with responsibility for implementing federal 
              farm policy, protecting food safety and managing public lands to 
              advance what farm activist Mark Ritchie describes as &quot;strictly 
              pro-agribusiness, pro-pesticide company, pro-pharmaceutical company 
              positions.&quot;</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;While 
              the Clinton administration practiced malignant neglect as farm income 
              plummeted to record lows in the late 1990s, a Bush Department of 
              Agriculture under Veneman&#146;s leadership would in the view of 
              savvy farm activists mount a full frontal assault on the future 
              of family farming, food safety standards and the undeveloped wilderness.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;Veneman 
              has served as a key member of the Reagan and Bush administration 
              farm teams, as director of the California Department of Food and 
              Agriculture during the gubernatorial administration of agribusiness 
              favorite Pete Wilson, as an agribusiness lawyer and as a member 
              of the national steering committee of Farmers and Ranchers for Bush. 
              In those positions she has rarely missed an opportunity to promote 
              a free-trade regimen that advances the interests of international 
              food production and processing conglomerates, to encourage policies 
              that lead to the displacement of family farms with huge factory 
              farms, to open public lands for mineral extraction and timbering, 
              to support genetic modification of food and to defend biotech experimentation 
              with agriculture. Indeed, Veneman is a biotech absolutist who served 
              on the board of Calgene, the corporation that launched the first 
              genetically engineered food in 1994. Veneman told a forum last year, 
              &quot;We simply will not be able to feed the world without biotechnology.&quot;</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;Most 
              Americans still imagine farms as family-run ventures where a measure 
              of environmental stewardship is practiced, but that sort of farming 
              is rapidly being displaced as family farmers find they no longer 
              can compete in a global market dominated by corporate agribusiness 
              monopolies. Veneman has for the better part of two decades served 
              as the point person for a so-called &quot;modern&quot; vision of 
              farming that has more to do with global-positioning satellites and 
              genetic engineering of the food supply than the tending of fields 
              and the care of animals. With Veneman&#146;s encouragement, California 
              developed a conglomerated, big-farm, chemically enhanced version 
              of food production that Iowa Farmers Union President John Whitaker 
              describes as &quot;an entirely different face of agriculture&quot; 
              from that practiced or desired by most working farmers in places 
              like Iowa and Wisconsin.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;&quot;I 
              don&#146;t want to see that face transferred to Iowa,&quot; says 
              Whitaker. But if Veneman gets the reins of the Department of Agriculture 
              as the Congress is preparing to rewrite the dismally flawed Freedom 
              to Farm Act &#151; which U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., aptly 
              dubbed the &quot;Freedom to Fail Act&quot; &#151; the transfer may 
              be unavoidable. While it is true that members of the House will 
              drive the process, this will be the first time since the 1950s that 
              a Republican Congress and a Republican agriculture secretary will 
              be working in unison to implement &quot;reforms&quot; that are likely 
              to further tip the balance in favor of agribusiness conglomerates.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;But 
              a Secretary Veneman would not merely be hustling to deliver for 
              Bush&#146;s corporate contributors on domestic farm policy and land 
              use issues; she&#146;d also be working for them on the international 
              stage. A militant free trader with decades-old ties to the masters 
              of the new global economy, Veneman helped negotiate the Uruguay 
              round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which cleared 
              the way for development of the World Trade Organization.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;In 
              addition, she was actively involved in negotiating the U.S.-Canada 
              Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
              So determined is Veneman to advance the free-trade agenda that Bush 
              transition team aides briefly considered her as a candidate for 
              the position of U.S. trade representative before handing the keys 
              to the Department of Agriculture, with its 100,000-member staff 
              and $100 billion budget, to the woman who has already proven her 
              willingness to sacrifice the interests of American farmers on the 
              altar of trade liberalization. Even as family farmers from Wisconsin 
              and Minnesota were marching in the streets of Seattle to protest 
              WTO interference with agricultural supports and food safety standards, 
              Veneman was in Seattle to tell the WTO to move more aggressively 
              to remove so-called &quot;technical barriers to trade.&quot;</font></P>
<P align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;(Veneman) 
              has taken the most shrill, ideologically driven positions on trade 
              and agriculture,&quot; says Ritchie, the president of the Minneapolis-based 
              Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. &quot;She seems to be 
              coming in with the notion that her job is to be as extreme as possible 
              in parroting the agribusiness line. The problem is that that line 
              is completely out of sync with what farmers want, what consumers 
              want, and what we know to be scientifically, ecologically and economically 
              right.&quot;
