The autumn started with a huge national jolt of shock, fear, grief
and anger. Winter has begun with many worries here at home and grim
satisfaction about warfare abroad. A line from "King Lear," early in Act
4, is hauntingly appropriate:

     <p>"'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind."

     <p>Shakespeare's observation fits the current era, and not only with
reference to the murderous qualities of Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda
network. Few media outlets -- and certainly none of the major national
brands -- are willing to scrutinize the unhinged aspects of the adulated
leadership in the White House.

     <p>Deep introspection for any society is difficult. Precious little
danger of that, in the here and now. After more than 100 days of big-type
rhetorical questions, the media answers are largely self-satisfied. "Why
do they hate us?" Because we're great, though sometimes clumsy on the
world stage. "How can the violence in the Middle East be stopped?" By
continuing to back Israel, no matter what.

     <p>Since Sept. 11, many journalists have commented that the United
States is unaccustomed to the role of victim. Left unsaid is how
accustomed we are to being victimizers while preening ourselves as a
nation of worldly do-gooders. The 3,000 human beings who lost their lives
at the World Trade Center are casting an enormous shadow -- as they
should. But what about the uncounted people killed, one way or another, by
U.S. policies?

     <p>The list of countries that the Pentagon has attacked in recent
decades is long. The list of governments using American-supplied weapons
to repress and massacre is even longer.

     <p>And there's quieter slaughter, on a grand scale. During every hour,
more than 1,000 children in the world die from preventable diseases. Basic
nutrition, medical care and sanitation would save their lives. A fraction
of the Pentagon budget would suffice.

     <p>But we still live in a society with the kind of priorities that
Martin Luther King Jr. described a third of a century ago -- spending
"military funds with alacrity and generosity" but providing anti-poverty
funds "with miserliness." If he were alive now, his voice would still cry
out against "the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth."

     <p>King would have good reason to reiterate words from his speech on
April 4, 1967, when he denounced "capitalists of the West investing huge
sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits
out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries."

     <p>Today, advocates for humanitarian causes might see the United States
as a place where "madmen lead the blind." But that's kind of a harsh way
to describe the situation. Our lack of vision is in the context of a media
system that mostly keeps us in the dark.

     <p>In American media's echo chamber, much of the genuine anguish from
Sept. 11 has segued into a lot of braying about national greatness. Like
many other pundits now in their glory days on cable TV networks, Chris
Matthews knows how to dodge difficult truths. "Patriotism is more
important than politics," he proclaimed the other day. What "unites us" is
"democracy, freedom, human rights, the right to pursue happiness."

     <p>And what about the "right to pursue happiness" for the kids dying
from lack of food or clean water or medicine, while Matthews and thousands
of other journalists fawn over the U.S. military?

     <p>Anyone watching TV news since early October has seen lots of idolatry
lavished on the latest Pentagon weapons. Uncle Sam's immense military
power and Washington's role as the number-one arms dealer on the planet
add up to a colossal drain of resources -- and a powerful means of
enforcing the bonds between the U.S. government and scores of regimes that
combine repression with oligarchy, amid rampant poverty.

     <p>Winners get to write history, and that starts with the news. While
victory in Afghanistan gets presented as ample justification for going to
war in the first place, the message that overwhelming might makes right is
ever-present, even if no one quite says so out loud. And when human flesh
goes up in flames and human bodies shatter -- but not on our TV screens --
did it ever really happen?

     <p>Several decades ago, peace activist A.J. Muste observed: "The problem
after a war is with the victor. He thinks he has just proved that war and
violence pay. Who will now teach him a lesson?"

<p><i>Norman Solomon's latest book is "The Habits of Highly Deceptive Media."
His syndicated column focuses on media and politics.
