AS JOHN ''STONEWALL'' Ashcroft marched past the crisped bodies of the Democratic  slaughter in the Senate to plant his flag as attorney general, I swear I heard  him hum, ''I am now in Dee Cee, hooray! Hooray! In Dee Cee Land, no laws will stand, when I am done in Dee Cee.''
<P>
<P>With the Ashcroft confirmation, the antebellum America of George W. Bush  is complete. They may have left the land of cotton, but the old times are not forgotten. With the constellation of Confederate sympathizers Bush has around  him, the people of color in his Cabinet are just isolated black holes. Just as the Confederate flag is being downsized at Southern state houses, Bush has  unofficially hoisted the  Stars and Bars high above the nation's capital.
<P>
<P>Think this is crazy? We have a president who in the year 2000 campaigned at the most officially bigoted university in America. Bush said he would defend ''our conservative philosophy'' last winter at Bob Jones University in South Carolina, which until last year banned interracial dating, still bans visits from gay and lesbian alumni and considers Catholicism a cult.
<P>
<P>At Bush's inauguration, the oath of office was administered by Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Rehnquist was the lone dissenting vote in an 8-1 decision in 1983 to deny tax-exempt status to Bob Jones. Rehnquist is known for singing ''Dixie'' at the 4th Circuit Judicial Conference. Rehnquist voted to end the Florida recount and hand Bush the presidency. In Dee Cee Land, democracy will never stand. Hooray, hooray.
<P>
<P>Then Bush nominated Ashcroft. The former Missouri senator will run the Justice Department despite his opposition to school desegregation, abortion even in the case of rape and incest, opposing a gay ambassador for homophobic reasons, praising Confederate war heroes and picking up an honorary degree from, you got it, Bob Jones. 
<P>
<P>Ashcroft survived his nomination process because Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott kept all 50 Republican senators in a lockstep military obedience, forcing  Democrats like Zell Miller and Russ Feingold to conclude that it was better to serve Bush cocktails in the big house than plan a rebellion from the field. It does not take much to see that when these Democrats waved the white flag of bipartisanship, they were also surrendering to white sheets.
<P>
<P>It was Lott who urged President Reagan in the early 1980s to make Bob Jones tax-exempt. Lott had significant ties to the Council of  Conservative Citizens. The CCC is descended from the Southern white citizens  councils that bitterly resisted black civil rights.
<P>
<P>When news surfaced in 1998 of his involvement with the group, Lott  claimed ''no firsthand knowledge'' of it. Later it was found out that he gave  three speeches before the group, in the 1990s, saying that the council stands ''for the right principles and the right philosophy.''
<P>
<P>In 1997, he was  photographed in his Senate office, smiling with the national leaders of the CCC. Once Lott was exposed, he had to go through the public ritual of distancing  himself from the CCC. But there is no mistaking what Lott meant by the ''right  principles and the right philosophy.''
<P>
<P>The CCC's current Web page links you  directly to its ''On-Line Market for Southern Patriots and Euro-Folk.''  You can  order your choice of flags of the Ku Klux Klan and a sew-on patch that depicts a hooded Klansman, a burning cross, and the phrase:  ''Department of the Interior: Bureau of Negro Control.''
<P>
<P>As for Interior, Secretary Gale Norton, too, has Confederate epilepsy. She said  so much was lost for states' rights during the Civil War. She said it was an  unfortunate coincidence that the ''bad facts'' of slavery gave states' rights a bad  name. Someone forgot to tell Norton that states' rights remained a primary form  of ''Negro Control'' for a century after the Civil War.
<P>
<P>It was not as if the Confederate flag was not already visible in some corners  on Capitol Hill, from Jesse Helms, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee  to Bob Barr, who led the charge to impeach President Clinton. Barr also spoke  before the CCC. You have John McCain, who, like Bush was just another  Confederate chicken on the campaign trail. In South Carolina, McCain's chief  strategist was Richard Quinn, editor of the very Southern Partisan magazine, the Negro Control magazine that Ashcroft made his pro-Confederacy statements in.
<P>
<P>Until Bush took over, no one worried about Confederate epilepsy being a communicable disease. Now, before anyone realized it, the South has risen again, with delerious troops who cannot wait to bayonet civil rights, abortion rights, gay and lesbian rights, and environmentalists. They've won the second round of the Civil War. There is no more need to look away, look away. They are singing, ''Lookie here! Lookie here! DeeCee Land!''
