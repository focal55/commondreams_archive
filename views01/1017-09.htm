<i>“We are going to unleash Hell on them.”</i><br>
Senator Bob Torrecelli, in a press interview at Ground Zero on 9-12

<p>The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, and so began 22 
years of devastating war. 10 years of occupation and war have 
been followed by 12 years of civil war - including 5 years of 
reactionary “government” by the thugs of the Taliban. Before 9-11, 
these factors, on top of the worst drought in decades, had already 
created one of the worst humanitarian situations in the world within 
Afghanistan. Now, with the disruption of relief efforts caused by 
ongoing U.S. military actions, and given the imminent arrival of 
winter, we are facing an unfolding catastrophe of unthinkable 
proportions. Without exaggeration, this is the worst humanitarian 
crisis the world has seen since the end of World War II. Dire 
warnings abound from UN and NGO agencies on the scene in the 
region. On September 19th, Dominic Nutt, an emergency officer 
with the relief organization Christian Aid, was quoted in the 
Guardian as saying, “It's as if a mass grave has been dug behind 
millions of people. We can drag them back from it or push them in. 
We could be looking at millions of deaths.” 

<p>America’s role in this disaster is a matter of open record, and our 
responsibilities here are very clear. When communist leader 
Babrak Karmal took power in Afghanistan after a coup in 1978, the 
United States chose to get involved. The U.S. intervened by 
providing money, arms, intelligence and training to groups of 
Mujahadeen, or “Islamic” fighters. Many, including Osama bin 
Laden, came to Afghanistan from other countries in the Muslim 
world. As with U.S. counterinsurgency programs in Vietnam, Cuba, 
and Nicaragua, among other countries, this aid was intended to 
destabilize Afghanistan’s government, and prevent any successful 
challenge to U.S. economic hegemony from developing in the 
Global South. Former National Security Advisor Zbignew 
Brzezinski has said that the U.S. also hoped that aid to the 
Mujahadeen would help incite the USSR to invade Afghanistan, 
drawing them into a “trap.” After the Soviet’s did invade, our support 
for the Mujahadeen grew into the largest U.S. covert action 
program since World War II, as we funneled billions of dollars of 
military aid, including thousands of tons of weaponry, into the 
country throughout the 1980s.

<p>In a 1998 interview with the French journal Le Nouvel Observateur, 
Brzezinski insisted on the righteousness of this support, saying, 
“What is most important to the history of the world? The Taliban or 
the collapse of the Soviet empire? Some stirred-up Moslems or the 
liberation of Central Europe and the end of the cold war?” Yet the 
Soviet invasion, lasting from 1979-1989, resulted in the destruction 
of half the villages of Afghanistan, over 1 million civilian deaths, and 
over 6 million refugees. Since 1980, Afghanistan has had the 
world’s largest, recorded, refugee population. Today, over 3.5 
million Afghanis remain refugees, and over 1 million are still 
internally displaced within Afghanistan. What has been more 
important to the history of those people? 

<p>After the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, the U.S. lost interest in 
Afghanistan, but the weapons we supplied, and the people we 
trained, were still around. In addition to bin Laden, our friends in the 
1980s included Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, currently in exile in Iran, 
then a leading heroin druglord and head of the most fanatical 
Mujahadeen faction. As “Prime Minister,” Hekmatyar destroyed 
most of Kabul in 1993 with a food blockade and sustained rocket 
attacks aimed at toppling his rivals. At least 50 thousand civilians 
were killed. In 1994, the Taliban, or “Students,” emerged as a law 
and order movement led by rural clerics, including current leader 
Mohammad Omar. From 1994-1996 the U.S. sided with the 
Taliban, and provided indirect aid through Pakistan and Saudi 
Arabia. This helped the Taliban to consolidate control over 90% of 
the country and establish one of the most repressive governments 
in recent world history. Remnants of the losing factions of 
Mujahadeen and other opponents of the Taliban formed the 
Northern Alliance, a loose coalition of warlords, many of them with 
human rights records fully as disgusting as Hekmatyar and the 
Taliban. Human Rights Watch and the Revolutionary Association of 
the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) report that leaders in the 
Northern Alliance - including Abdul Rashid Dostum, head of the 
Junbish militia; Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, head of Ittihad-i Islami; Haji 
Muhammad Muhaqqiq, a senior commander in Hizb-i Wahdat; and 
Abdul Malik Pahlawan, a former senior Junbish commander - have 
all engaged in ethnic cleansing, lootings, mass rapes, and 
summary executions.

<p>Right now we are faced with the disgusting absurdity of the world’s 
greatest superpower waging war against one of the world’s poorest 
and most suffering nations, and in so doing befriending (or re-
friending) thugs morally indistinguishable from those they are 
opposing. Expediency has never been more cynical, nor its moral 
exigency ever so immediate. Far from “Enduring Freedom,” 
Afghanistan is enduring a tremendous humanitarian disaster 
stemming in no small part from former U.S. actions and inactions. 
Decades of war have left much of the country in absolute, and 
dangerous, ruin. The Soviets laid hundreds of thousands of anti-
personnel mines, and unexploded shells literally litter the 
countryside - still killing dozens every month. Childhood mortality 
is already the fourth worst in the world, and life expectancy for 
adults is only 43 years. As many as 7 million people may be on 
the brink of imminent starvation. Even before firing a single shot, 
U.S.-Taliban belligerencies had already disrupted critical aid 
programs, sending perhaps hundreds of thousands of new refugees 
fleeing to the borders. U.S. bombings, accidental or otherwise, of 
international demining and aid offices in Kabul threaten to end all 
international efforts to help the Afghani people. Additionally, on 
Sept. 16, the New York Times reported that "Washington has also 
demanded [from Pakistan] a cutoff of fuel supplies, ...and the 
elimination of truck convoys that provide much of the food and other 
supplies to Afghanistan's civilian population." Seen in this light, 
criticism of U.S. “humanitarian food drops,” by organizations such 
as the Nobel Peace Prize winning Doctors Without Borders, 
makes much more sense. In a statement released on October 8th, 
Doctors Without Borders said the U.S. operation wasn’t “in any 
way a humanitarian aid operation, but more a military propaganda 
operation, destined to make international opinion accept the U.S.-
led military operation."

<p>The United States hasn’t learned anything from over 20 years of 
U.S. and Soviet failures in Afghanistan. The issues aren’t about 
geopolitics or the art of realpolitik; these artifices only matter in 
terms of the real people they help or hurt. The propaganda value of 
pretend efforts to relieve civilian suffering is totally lost on everyone 
outside of America’s borders - because the propaganda is so 
manifestly false. Will anyone other than CNN’s Christiane 
Amanpour honestly believe that cutting off all international food aid 
for 7 million starving people in Afghanistan through threats and war 
doesn’t deliberately put those people in direct danger of mass 
destruction? Is there any chance the rest of the world will ever be 
convinced that U.S. plans to airdrop 2 million rations represent a 
realistic attempt to deal with this catastrophe? Even if every one of 
those rations reached a human being, they only represent enough 
food for less than one third of the people for one day out of an 
entire winter. 

<p>What new outrages will be born from the hell we are unleashing on Afghanistan? 
Unless the United States immediately ends this military campaign, and joins in 
a truly massive, international attempt to plan, stock, and immediately enact a 
widespread and viable relief operation throughout Afghanistan, truly sickening 
numbers of human beings are going to die. 

<p>If we let this catastrophe happen, what will we say to the survivors when they 
come after us, as they must? Will we make up excuses that ring hollow even in 
our own ears as we test them out today? Or will we look to the ruin of 
Afghanistan that we have already helped create, and to the ruin of 
the World Trade Towers born from that creation, and say with 
absolute certainty - Abyssus Abyssum invocat: Hell calls Hell.
