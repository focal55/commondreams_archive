A few months ago, I stood on the galleried balcony of the town hall in the lovely city of Arequipa, in southern Peru, listening to the mayor, Juan Guillen, enthuse about the place he loved. 
<P>The town hall occupied one side of the historic plaza and, from where we stood, we looked directly across at the 17th-century cathedral. It seemed huge. It had been built lengthways on to the square and occupied the whole of one side, as though to demonstrate that no mere civic power could challenge the dominance of the church.  
<P>To my right were the historic buildings of the Jesuits and beyond the cathedral, just out of view, the warren of cloisters and narrow streets that made up the extraordinary Convent of Santa Clara.  
<P>All of these buildings, like the rest of the colonial heart of the city, are faced in a grey stone that derives from the lava of Peru's largest active volcano, Misti, that towers, ominously, over Arequipa.  
<P>Just off the nearby coast is a tectonic fault and the occasional rattling of my coffee cup was a reminder that Arequipa had always lived on borrowed time. Last weekend, the trembling undertone became a full-blown earthquake - measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale.  
<P>Now the great spire of that cathedral lies in ruins, the cobbled streets of Arequipa are broken and torn and the residents of this city, named by Unesco last year as a cultural site of world importance, are attending to their dead and wounded and assessing the damage.  
<P>Even in Peru itself, the earthquake has been overshadowed in the newspapers by the return of the fugitive former strongman - and, as it happens, one of Arequipa's more notorious sons - Vladimiro Montesinos. Montesinos, once the Rasputin of the disgraced ex-president Alberto Fujimori, is accused of stealing more than $264m from his fellow citizens. With his accounts frozen, he reportedly could no longer pay the expenses of his hideout in Venezuela and, unsentimental to a fault, his "friends" and protectors turned him in. Now he is likely to spend the rest of his life in jail.  
<P>It is a cruel coincidence that Arequipa should be devastated by an earthquake at the moment of Montesinos's final downfall. Of all the cities in Peru, it was Arequipa that put up the strongest resistance to the Fujimori-Montesinos regime which, in its 10 years of power, turned the Peruvian state into a private fiefdom where greed and corruption were the only rules. While others stayed silent, or associated themselves with the Fujimori regime in the hope of sharing its illicit profits, Juan Guillen stood courageously on the side of democracy and human rights  
<P>The citizens of Arequipa backed their popular mayor. When Fujimori turned up to inaugurate a sport stadium, built with the city's own painfully accumulated funds, they blew whistles and drowned him out. When he went for an illegal third term, they booed him out of his own election rally and ran him out of their town.  
<P>Mayor Guillen was proud of his city's stand against a regime he saw, correctly, as a government of gangsters, but Arequipa paid a price: the central government encouraged industries to move to the capital and Montesinos's men appropriated local tax revenues, beggaring the local administration and trying to make of Guillen an example of the futility of defiance.  
<P>Arequipa, though, never cared much for opinion in Lima. Arequipa followed its own rules in an intellectual world dominated by the politics of large, quarrelsome families and a running ideological battle between conservative Catholicism and various shades of communism, two faiths which Arequipenos seem to embrace with equal passion.  
<P>In sympathy with his citizens' intellectual engagement, the mayor had removed the tar from the city's streets. "It looks better," he explained, "and besides, people here need to be able to dig up the cobbles to build barricades. It's a local tradition."  
<P>Despite the shortage of cash, the quietly spoken mayor was committed to restoring the colonial heart of Arequipa - an enchanting world of 17th- and 18th-century courtyard houses set behind high walls smothered in jasmine and bougainvillea. Now the earthquake has left at least 97 in the region dead, more than 46,400 homeless and a third of Arequipa's historic buildings damaged.  
<P>As he inspected the wreckage of the cathedral, Mayor Guillen promised that his city would rise again. The cathedral spire, he said, would be rebuilt, the damaged houses restored, the broken streets repaired. Where the money was to come from, he did not say and I doubt that he knows. There is not much left in Peru's piggy bank after a series of incompetent or kleptomaniac governments and, in the aftermath of the earthquake, thousands of people are freezing in the mountains of southern Peru for lack of tents and blankets.  
<P>There is, though, more than $150m in bank accounts once controlled by Montesinos. Once he has been tried and jailed, perhaps the Peruvian government will think it only just to donate some of his ill-gotten gains to poor Arequipa, the city that can justly claim to have recognized its native son for the criminal that he is.
