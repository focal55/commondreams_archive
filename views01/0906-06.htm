So Israel and the U.S. walked out of the U.N. World Conference Against Racism. 
The big news is that the rest of the world stayed put. The U.S. walked out of 
the last two U.N. Conferences on Racism for the same reason -- criticism of Israel. What's changed in the new millennium is that the fear of talking about Israel and Palestine is finally -- perhaps -- giving way to a sense of urgency that the crisis in the Middle East must be addressed.
<p>

"We're very troubled by the whole Zionism as racism formulation, but we think 
our responsibility is to stay and have the conversation," Karen Narasaki, 
President of the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, told 
the New York Times correspondent. Hers was one of the nongovernmental 
organizations that stayed in Durban while the remaining diplomats worked.
<p>

On no topic is it harder to stay and "have the conversation" than the Middle 
East. Go public against Israel and one's e-mail box automatically fills with invective: 
"Bitch, whore, racist, terrorist-lover, anti-Semitic pig." The temptation to 
run, or stay silent is strong. But no matter what Colin Powell et al. decide, 
silence just doesn't seem quite strong enough to the rest of the world these days.
<p>

In Durban, most of the world's delegations did not walk out. They stayed and 
worked on new language. Many NGOs waited and watched. On the ground in the 
Middle East, the European Union's foreign policy chief says he is making 
"headway" towards renewed Israeli-Palestinian talks. He was jostled and booed 
by Israelis in Jerusalem when he visited the scene of a suicide bomb attack, 
but that didn't silence him. The EU's Javier Solana flew on from there to meet with the 
King of Jordan, now he's headed to Egypt.
<p>

In the U.S., in what must have been a historic week, both the 
Washington Post and the New York Times ran pieces that broke ranks with 
traditional one-note coverage of the conflict:  Muhammad Tull's "And They 
Wonder Why We're Angry," described a middle-aged Palestinian man crying and 
eventually having a heart attack at an Israeli checkpoint. "What ways are 
left for Palestinians to change the world we live in?" asked Tull who manages 
a USAID-funded rural development program in the West Bank.
<p>

Israeli journalist Amira Hass, writing in the New York Times, reminded 
readers of the inequities that continued, despite huge Palestinian hopes, 
even after the signing of the Oslo Accords. "Anger has accumulated in every 
Palestinian heart," Hass wrote, "over the scarce water, over each demolished 
Palestinian house... A small match can cause this anger to explode, and in 
this past year, it has."
<p>

The Hartford Courant ran an outspoken editorial about the Israeli 
government's killing of Palestinian leaders: "Assassination Isn't 
Self-Defense," (August 30) and in a move that will no doubt flood their pages 
with fury, USA Today ran a cover story on Israeli settler-vigilantes who "vow 
to expel Muslim filth." (Sept. 4.)
<p>

Newspaper editors appear to be taking some new risks to spark real, 
difficult, and complicated conversations. What about activists? From the U.S. and 
Europe, civilian peace missions continue to travel to the conflict zone to act 
as human shields. A delegation from Colorado was in Beit Jala when Israeli 
forces shelled the town a month ago. Last week, the human shields were there 
again. You didn't see a face or a name, but the striking photograph of an 
Israeli tank in Beit Jala which appeared on the front of the New York Time's Week in 
Review this Sunday, featured the two hands of "a foreign demonstrator" -- 
palms up toward the gun-barrel of the tank signaling "stop." 
<p>

And at the very moment that Israeli and U.S. delegates walked out of the U.N. 
anti-racism conference to protest racism, in Israel itself some 150 Jews and Arabs were rallying together to <a href="http://www.gush-shalom.org" target="_new">call for justice</a> in the case of 13 Arab citizens shot by Israeli soldiers last fall.
<p>

In the U.S., where conversations about Israel and Palestine are sometimes even 
harder to conduct than in Jerusalem, poet and holocaust-survivor Irena Klepfisz  
published a call for an end to the occupation in July's issue of the 
Progressive magazine. "I am committed to Jewish survival. I don't want the 
Jews in Israel to die. I want them to be safe. I think they're on the wrong 
road to safety," said Klepfisz, not long after she helped to found a new 
group Jewish Unity for a Just Peace.
<p>

Poet and African American Studies professor June Jordan also raised her voice in support of an end to the occupation in a recent interview with David Barsamian on 
Alternative Radio. In her interview, Jordan describes the anti-Semitism that 
emerged in her classroom at the University of California at Berkeley: "It's alive. It's virulent. The source is this continuing catastrophe in the Middle East," she said. "This is 
a cauldron. It has consequences for all of us...I don't think we have much 
time."
<p>

Jordan has proposed a course of action: give international teams five days to 
arrive in the Occupied Territories to act as neutral observers and human 
shields, then summon international, armed intervention, and simultaneously 
organize massive, non-violent protest by thousands of Palestinians at every 
checkpoint. She calls it "the Holding of the Ground" (You can hear the whole 
interview at <a href="http://www.freespeech.org" TARGET=
"_new">FreeSpeech TV</a>.
<p>

Columnist Thomas Friedman, who couldn't be further from Jordan politically, 
has also called for armed intervention right now, in this case, a NATO 
mission to the West Bank. "If Israel remains in the West Bank and Gaza it 
will undermine Jewish democracy," writes Friedman.
<p>

Notwithstanding Powell and co.,  a vast array of people feel urgent enough 
about the need for immediate action that walking away nor 
intimidation will keep them quiet. World leaders who won't lead, may just 
have to follow. "Yes, this has been going on a long time," says Jordan, "but 
that doesn't mean it isn't an emergency."</p>
