AS AN American Jew, I am heartsick at the bombings of Israeli families in 
West Jerusalem and Haifa. And I am horrified at the escalation in 
assassinations of Palestinians by the Israeli military, including the killing 
of two young brothers in Nablus, and a 7-year-old girl, Sabreen, who was 
killed in her Hebron home when it was shelled by the army. Upon seeing her 
granddaughter die, Sabreen's grandmother died of a heart attack.
<P>I am also outraged at the Israeli tanks rolling into West Bank towns, at 
the army's seizure of the Palestinian epicenter in East Jerusalem, Orient 
House, and of reports of soldiers' kicking nonviolent Palestinian protesters 
in the face, chest and groin.
<P>I just returned from a trip to Israel and Palestine. I went to support 
actions by the Israeli peace movement, and I wanted to let my Palestinian 
friends know that neither I nor the American people had forgotten them. I had 
not been there since 1993, and I needed to see for myself the changing face of 
the occupation.
<P>The faces of those I saw will not leave my mind.
<P>I remember the bright spirit of Manal, 27, who spent four years as a 
Palestinian political prisoner. Though she is now "free," she said Gaza feels 
like one large prison. For three hours in the boiling sun, she kept me 
laughing as we waited in an endless line of cars trying to get through an 
Israeli checkpoint.
<P>In Rafah refugee camp, Manal showed me where, only hours before, Israeli 
tanks and bulldozers had demolished 18 Palestinian homes, leaving more than 
100 people homeless in the middle of the night. In one remaining house, I saw 
eight fist-sized holes where artillery shells had ripped through the 
children's bedroom. When I left, Manal slipped a bracelet off her wrist and 
pressed it into my hand, asking me not to forget her.
<P>I think of my friend, Terry, who directs the Israeli women's peace 
organization, Bat Shalom. Recently, she went with other women to monitor any 
human rights abuses by Israeli soldiers interrogating Palestinians at a 
checkpoint outside Jerusalem.
<P>"I was scared," she admitted. But she explained that she wanted "to be able 
to look our children in the eyes, without shame, and tell them that injustice 
was committed in our name, and we did our best to stop it."
<P>I remember Wafa, a woman in Dheisheh refugee camp near Bethlehem, where 10,
000 people lived together; their camp was shelled last week by the Israeli 
military and is surrounded by Israeli settlements. She said: "I don't want to 
push the Jews into the sea. All I want is a safe place for my children to live.
"
<P>I think of Hava, a 70-year-old Polish Holocaust survivor who advocates for 
Palestinian women prisoners, who has been beaten by Israeli 
counterdemonstrators at peace vigils; and of Rabbi Arik Ascherman, director of 
Rabbis for Human Rights, who lies down in front of Israeli bulldozers to try 
to stop them from demolishing Palestinian homes. A Zionist, he said he has 
moved "from protest to resistance."
<P>I also remember the open, inquisitive faces of the children I met at the 
Palestinian Counseling Center, where therapists help them process the 
emotional trauma of losing a brother or father to Israeli bullets. When I 
asked them what they wanted, they chorused: "Peace!," "To not be occupied," 
"No violence from Israel or America" and "To make a new future for the 
children."
<P>And I think of 29-year-old Israeli activist Netta Golan, whose open-
heartedness deeply touched me. She has been chaining herself to Palestinian 
farmers' olive trees in an effort to keep the Israeli army from uprooting them.
<P>These trees are like family to Palestinians and were planted by their 
grandparents; the trees take 50 years to mature and provide desperately needed 
income.
<P>The Israeli army and settlers have destroyed more than 150,000 of these 
trees, and now 50 percent of Palestinians live below the poverty line. When I 
met Netta, her arm was in a cast after being broken by Israeli police during a 
nonviolent demonstration. As we walked home one night, after interrupting 
Ariel Sharon's speech at the Maccabia Games to protest his policies, we 
confided how scared we had felt.
<P>"It's so good that you can feel the fear," she said, "and then not let it 
stop you from doing what you think is right."
<P>I also spoke with the highly respected Dr. Hayder Abd al-Shafi, chief 
Palestinian negotiator in Madrid in 1993. He opposes the bombings inside 
Israel, and wants an "equitable" peace.
<P>"The American people are fair-minded," he told me. "They have a natural 
readiness to support what's right, but they don't know."
<P>As Americans, I believe we must stop turning our faces away. Like the open 
hearts of both Israeli activists who put their bodies on the line, trying to 
stop their government's human rights abuses -- and of Palestinians who hold a 
vision of peace despite the brutality, terror and daily humiliation of 
occupation -- we also need to move from discomfort to protest to resistance, 
and in the words of Dr. al-Shafi, to "support what's right."
<P>We must call on our government to bring an international peacekeeping force 
into this region immediately, to end the occupation, and to pressure for peace 
that gives both peoples the land, resources, security and dignity they deserve.
