<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fall of Enron sounds the death knell for one
      of the great rackets of the past decade: green seals of approval,
      whereby some outfit like the Natural Resources Defense Council
      or the Environmental Defense Fund would issue testimonials to
      the enviro-conscience and selfless devotion to the public weal
      of corporations like Enron.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These green seals of approval were part
      of the neoliberal pitch, that fuddy-duddy regulation should yield
      to modern, &quot;market-oriented solutions&quot; to environmental
      problems, which essentially means bribing corporations in the
      hope they'll stop their polluting malpractices. Indeed, NRDC
      and EDF were always the prime salesfolk of neoliberal remedies
      for environmental problems. In fact, NRDC was socked into the
      Enron lobby machine so deep you couldn't see the soles of its
      feet. Here's what happened. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1997 high-flying Enron found itself
      in a pitched battle in Oregon, where it planned to acquire Portland
      General Electric, Oregon's largest public utility. Warning that
      Enron's motives were of a highly predatory nature, the staff
      of the state's Public Utility Commission (PUC) opposed the merger.
      They warned that an Enron takeover would mean less ability to
      protect the environment, increased insecurity for PGE's workers
      and, in all likelihood, soaring prices. Other critics argued
      that Enron's actual plan was to cannibalize PGE, in particular
      its hydropower, which Enron would sell into California's energy
      market. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But at the very moment when such protests
      threatened to balk Enron of its prize, into town rode NRDC's
      top energy commissar, Ralph Cavanagh, Heinz environmental genius
      award pinned to his armor and flaunting ties to the Energy Foundation,
      a San Francisco-based outfit providing financial wattage for
      many citizen and environmental groups that work on utility and
      enviro issues. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cavanagh lost no time whipping the refractory
      Oregon greens into line. In concert with Enron, the NRDC man
      put together a memo of understanding, pledging that the company
      would lend financial support to some of these groups' pet projects.
      </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Cavanagh still had some arduous politicking
      ahead. An OK for the merger had to come from the PUC, whose staff
      was adamantly opposed. So, on Valentine's Day, 1997, Cavanagh
      showed up at a hearing in Salem, Oregon, to plead Enron's case.
      </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Addressing the three PUC commissioners,
      Cavanagh averred that this was &quot;the first time I've ever
      spoken in support of a utility merger.&quot; If so, it was the
      quickest transition from virginity to seasoned service in the
      history of intellectual prostitution. Cavanagh flaunted the delights
      of an Enron embrace: &quot;What we've put before you with this
      company is, we believe, a robust assortment of public benefits
      for the citizens of Oregon which would not emerge, Mr. Chairman,
      without the merger.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With a warble in his throat, Cavanagh
      moved into rhetorical high gear: &quot;The Oregonian asks the
      question, 'Can you trust Enron?' On stewardship issues and public
      benefit issues I've dealt with this company for a decade, often
      in the most contentious circumstances, and the answer is, yes.&quot;
      </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cavanagh won the day for the Houston-based
      energy giant. The PUC approved the merger, and it wasn't long
      before the darkest suspicions of Enron's plans were vindicated.
      The company raised rates, tried to soak the ratepayers with the
      cost of its failed Trojan nuclear reactor and moved to put some
      of PGE's most valuable assets on the block. Enron's motive had
      indeed been to get access to the hydropower of the Northwest,
      the cheapest in the country, and sell it into the California
      market, the priciest and-in part because of Cavanagh's campaigning
      for deregulation-a ripe energy prize awaiting exploitation. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then, after two years, the company Cavanagh
      had hailed as being &quot;engaged and motivated&quot; put PGE
      up on the auction block. Pending sale of PGE, Enron has been
      using it as collateral for loans approved by a federal bankruptcy
      judge.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Enron is best known as George W. Bush's
      prime financial backer in his presidential quest. But it was
      a bipartisan purveyor of patronage: to its right, conservative
      Texas Senator Phil Gramm; to its left, liberal Texas Democrat
      Sheila Jackson-Lee (who had Enron's CEO Ken Lay as her finance
      chairman in a Democratic primary fight preluding her first successful
      Congressional bid; her Democratic opponent was Craig Washington,
      an anti-NAFTA maverick Democrat the Houston establishment didn't
      care for). </font></P>
<P>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today some House Republicans want to
      treat the Enron collapse as a criminal matter, while Democrats
      have been talking in vaguer terms about cleaning up accounting
      rules and plugging holes in the regulatory system. The inability
      of Enron's employees to sell company stock from their 401(k)s
      while high-ups absconded with millions may doom Bush's promised
      onslaught on Social Security. There are many morals in Enron's
      collapse, and the role of that green seal of approval should
      not be forgotten.
