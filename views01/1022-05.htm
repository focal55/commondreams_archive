Five days before the bombing of Afghanistan began&#151;in announcing the reopening 
  of Washington to air traffic&#151;George W. Bush declared, &#147;This Thursday, 
  ticket counters and airplanes will fly out of Ronald Reagan airport.&#148;
<p>It was of this president with the addled tongue whom Al Gore spoke when, deploying 
  the drawl he turns on when trying to seem folksy, he hollered to Iowa&#146;s 
  Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner that &#147;George Bush is <i>mah</i> commander-in-chief!&#148; 
  (If Gore&#146;s beard gets any longer, Bush can infiltrate <i>him</i> into Afghanistan.) 
  Gore&#146;s frothy nationalism symbolized the degree to which the Democratic 
  leadership has abdicated its responsibility as watchdog on a president who is, 
  to much of the world, out of control.</p>
<p>As far as the miltarization of the campaign against terrorism is concerned, 
  the Democrats are in the tank. Spineless fear of voter revenge at the polls 
  next year&#151;in the wake of the Afghanistan bombing, Bush&#146;s Gallup poll 
  popularity at 92 percent broke yet another record&#151;has cowed the Democrats 
  into silence on conduct of the war.</p>
<p>Oh, there has been rear-guard congressional action that has blunted some of 
  the unconstitutionalities in Attorney General John Ashcroft&#146;s anti-terrorism 
  legislation, but it still shreds civil liberties protections to an unprecedented 
  degree. Democrats have been banking their hopes on inclusion of &#147;sunset&#148; 
  provisions in the rights-reducing bills that would require Congress to review 
  them in two years. But once these rights are voted away, we won&#146;t get them 
  back. Not only will Democrats from marginal seats be even more reluctant than 
  usual to stand up for civil liberties, but it will be almost certainly a Republican 
  Congress, not a Democratic one, that reconsiders their evisceration.</p>
<p>The <i>New York Times</i> trotted out old Arthur Schlesinger Jr. to preach 
  that the Democrats will win in 2002 because &#147;during our recent wars the 
  party in opposition has always gained seats in mid-term congressional elections.&#148; 
  But of the five examples cited by Schlesinger, in four of them it was a <i>Democrat</i> 
  in the White House with Republicans acting like a <i>real</i> opposition&#151;the 
  vicious attacks on Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman and Johnson are notorious&#151;that 
  constantly criticized U.S. policy and conduct of those wars. Now, no negative 
  word about Bush passes the lips of the Democratic leadership, the conduct of 
  the war is taboo for all, and the few tepid criticisms of anti-terrorist policies 
  here at home are left to safe-seaters like Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy (unopposed 
  by the GOP last time he ran) and Michigan Rep. John Conyers (who could rival 
  Strom Thurmond&#146;s re-election longevity if he wished).</p>
<p>In the 1990 election Schlesinger mentions, when Bush <i>pere</i> was in power, 
  Democrats gained only one Senate seat and just eight House seats, most due to 
  GOP retirements and local factors, not the Gulf War. And just two years later, 
  after redistricting, the Democrats hemorrhaged in both chambers. Schlesinger&#146;s 
  argument most certainly doesn&#146;t fit next year&#146;s circumstances.</p>
<p>Here&#146;s why: Recruitment of heavyweight Democratic challengers to take 
  on GOP incumbents, already lousy before September 11, has since become a &#147;disaster,&#148; 
  says Russ Hemenway, veteran director of the National Committee for an Effective 
  Congress (NCEC). &#147;No one wants to run unless they&#146;re going to be in 
  the majority,&#148; he reports&#151;and that won&#146;t happen.</p>
<p>Only two Republican senators were rated seriously vulnerable by NCEC before 
  the hijackings. But after September 11, Oregon&#146;s popular Democratic governor, 
  John Kitzhaber, decided not to make his expected Senate run, leaving incumbent 
  Gordon Smith nearly certain of victory against the admirable but lackluster 
  likely opponent, Rep. Peter DeFazio. And while New Hampshire&#146;s conservative 
  Democratic governor, Jeane Shaheen, is maintaining her Senate candidacy, Dubya 
  is putting enormous personal pressure on Bush loyalist GOP Rep. John Sununu 
  (son of Daddy&#146;s chief of staff) to challenge Sen. Bob Smith in a primary. 
  A not-too-bright nutcase with a ridiculous coiffure who alienated Republicans 
  by briefly embarking on an independent presidential candidacy, Smith will be 
  trounced by the popular young Sununu&#151;who&#146;ll go on to win handily over 
  Shaheen.</p>
<p>Democrats haven&#146;t a prayer of retaking the seats being vacated by Phil 
  Gramm in Texas; by Strom Thurmond in South Carolina, where Rep. Lindsey Graham 
  (the attractive young conservative who gained fame and statewide popularity 
  in Clinton&#146;s impeachment) will romp to victory; or by Jesse Helms in North 
  Carolina, where Elizabeth Dole will have no trouble taking the seat against 
  any of the Democratic challengers (especially the rich patrician stiff and ex-Clinton 
  Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles). The war has also moved two GOP incumbents against 
  whom Democrats might previously have had an outside shot&#151;Colorado&#146;s 
  Wayne Allard, the weaker of the two, and Maine&#146;s Susan Collins&#151;into 
  the &#147;likely Republican&#148; column.</p>
<p>By contrast, there are at least seven highly vulnerable Democratic incumbents. 
  And while Dick Cheney has been running Bush&#146;s war from his undisclosed 
  bunker, Dubya has been spending hours on the phone recruiting GOPers. Besides 
  New Hampshire, Bush has turned up the heat under New Jersey&#146;s extremely 
  popular former governor, Tom Kean, a moderate, to take on scandal-plagued Robert 
  Torricelli. Bush has already persuaded South Dakota Rep. John Thune&#151;that 
  state&#146;s lone congressman&#151;to abandon a planned gubernatorial race and 
  challenge the invisible and unpopular incumbent Democratic junior senator, Tim 
  Johnson. And it was Bush who persuaded St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman to run against 
  Minnesota&#146;s in-trouble Paul Wellstone.</p>
<p>Missouri&#146;s Jean Carnahan (appointed to her seat after her dead husband 
  won the election) stands a good chance of falling against ex-Rep. Jim Talent, 
  who almost snatched the governorship two years ago. Iowa&#146;s Tom Harkin is 
  in the battle of his life against popular Rep. Greg Ganske, and Montana&#146;s 
  Max Baucus and Lousiana&#146;s Mary Landrieu are also in deep trouble. Barring 
  a miracle, Democrats will lose their one-vote Senate majority.</p>
<p>Things are even worse on the House side, Hemenway says, where redistricting 
  means that &#147;hardly a single Republican House incumbent will be defeated.&#148; 
  At the same time, Democrats will sustain major losses from gerrymandering. In 
  Texas, a Democratic judge just upheld a redistricting plan that will cost the 
  Democrats at least seven seats, according to NCEC (but Texas Democrats fear 
  the losses could rise to nine, including senior party figures like Rep. Martin 
  Frost.)</p>
<p>
  In Michigan, the Democrats are in disarray because maps drawn in a process dominated 
  by the Chamber of Commerce have put Democratic incumbents in districts where 
  they&#146;ll be pitted in primaries against each other&#151;like veteran John 
  Dingell, who might well lose his primary to Democratic Rep. Lynn Rivers. NCEC 
  forecasts a loss of three seats in the state, but local Democrats think collateral 
  damage from war and redistricting could cost them as many as five.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, the new congressional lines will mean a loss of at least four 
  Democratic seats. It could get even dicier for other Democratic incumbents: 
  Some of the final lines in other states are not known; others are already in 
  court. By contrast, redistricting controlled by Democrats will at this point 
  give them only one new seat in California and a likely pickup of four in Georgia. 
  What all this means is that the Republicans will add at least nine&#151;and 
  perhaps as many as 14&#151;to their House majority.</p>
<p>Democrats&#146; chances in 2002 are further undermined by the fact that the 
  war has sucked the oxygen out of the party&#146;s attempts to get traction on 
  other issues. Moreover, the Democrats have already caved in to the idea of further 
  tax cuts&#151;$60 to $75 billion worth. Although the notion of cutting taxes 
  in the middle of an open-ended war is pure folly&#151;even an <i>echt</i> Reaganite 
  like George Will has denounced the notion as &#147;economics as psychotherapy&#148; 
  and doomed to failure&#151;the Democrats have become supply-siders and are only 
  squabbling about to whom the cuts should go, instead of opposing them altogether.</p>
<p>Another harbinger of the looming Democratic disaster in 2002 can be found in 
  New Jersey&#146;s gubernatorial contest. There, the Republican nominee&#151;Jersey 
  City Mayor Bret Schundler, an ideological conservative policy wonk&#151;had 
  been assumed to be a dead mackerel against Democrat Jim McGreevey. But since 
  the war began, three different polls show Schundler picking up strength&#151;anywhere 
  from five to seven points&#151;despite a gaffe-strewn performance. Schundler&#146;s 
  sudden jump is directly attributable to the war, says Nick Acocella, the savvy 
  editor of the insider electronic newsletter <i>New Jersey Politifax</i>. One 
  of the Democrats&#146; major issues against Schundler was his pro-handgun position&#151;however, 
  gun stores all over the country have reported a dramatic increase in sales of 
  200 to 300 percent as paranoia about terrorism increases. While Schundler will 
  still lose, the gun issue is off the table in New Jersey this year as it will 
  be across the country in 2002, depriving Democrats of a key hot button against 
  Republicans.</p>
<p>And what if there&#146;s another terrorist attack, either here or in Europe? 
  Let&#146;s face it: Many of the &#147;homeland security&#148; measures put in 
  place&#151;like stationing National Guard troops in airports&#151;are feel-better 
  palliatives as ineffectual as those taken by the Hollywood studios, who have 
  moved cop cars used in movies off their lots and parked them&#151;empty&#151;in 
  front of the studio gates. One more terrorist incident will only drive security 
  hysteria here at home to a fever pitch, sharply accentuating the already-evident 
  lurch to the right.</p>
<p>In the meantime, watch out for those flying ticket counters.</p>
