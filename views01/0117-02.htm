GEORGE W. BUSH was seen browsing in the children's section of the Martin  Luther King Jr. holiday. He went to an elementary school in Houston to say that King fought for those who were ''put down and held back.'' Bush said King ''inspired  millions of Americans to face their own consciences.''
<P>
<P>By staying in the children's section, Bush does not have to face his own  conscience. Bush is clearly untroubled by the hypocrisy in praising King at the  same time he is appointing an attorney general and a secretary of the interior who glorify the states' rights of the slave-holding Confederacy. He has yet to  show any feeling for the black men and women of Florida who honored King's legacy by voting in record numbers in the presidential election, yet after the election machinery of Florida was done, those same  black men and women left the polls feeling like three-fifths of a voter.
<P>
<P>During federal hearings last week on voting irregularities in Florida  that happened most often in predominantly black districts, the Rev. Willie Whiting  of Tallahassee said he went to the polls and was told his name was stripped from the registration rolls because he had a felony conviction. After the kind of persistent persuasion that makes a minister a minister, he was allowed to vote.
<P>
<P>Asked how he felt, Whiting said, ''I was slingshotted into slavery.''   That story reaffirmed the noxious possibility that Bush was slingshotted by racism into the presidency. Remember how Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Secretary  of State Katherine Harris kept telling us with snide certainty in November and early December that all the legal votes had been counted? Now that George W. is dressing for his inauguration, an inauguration where there will probably  be more black people cleaning the debris than in top hats, Jack 'em up Jeb and  Katherine the Grate now admit to an acute case of incompetence.
<P>
<P>Jeb, despite bragging how he would deliver Florida for his brother, now says, mystifyingly, that he bore no reponsibility to investigate how black districts were left without technology to handle the sea of voters. Bush knew there would be a high turnout, yet he vetoed $100,000 for a  voter education campaign.
<P>
<P>Harris was even more bumbling, or obfuscating, before the US Civil Rights Commission. She said she was unaware of state voter guides that stressed the importance to newly registered voters of a single vote. Far removed from the days when she was the assertive queen of certification, she now complains that she  had no personnel to monitor the elections. Her fellow Republicans had slashed  her office from 70 people to 39 prior to her arrival.   She was so unable to answer questions about voting procedures that she kept  referring them to the state elections chairman. In another biting piece of  testimony, Linda Howell, an election supervisor for Madison County, said even she was listed as a felon.
<P>
<P>Commission member Abigail Thernstrom, a Republican and an ardent foe of affirmative action, dutifully wrote off the complaints as isolated incidents. Another commission member, Christopher Edley, a Democrat who has been a top adviser to President  Clinton on racial issues, said, ''There's been some fairly systematic, implicit  disenfranchisement of voters.''
<P>
<P>None of this matters in the short term. Bush will be president, and the Civil  Rights Commission has no power to do anything with the information it has. Even if  the commission came up with strong findings of disenfranchisement, they no doubt would be squashed by John Ashcroft, the attorney general nominee, who is more busy conducting seances with the far right to connect with the ghost of Robert  E. Lee.
<P>
<P>But it should not be missed how Bush praises King when his presidency may  well have depended on black folks being put down and held back. Bush said King's  example ''fired others to face police dogs and hoses and violence.'' Yet he may well be our president precisely because unannounced police checkpoints near polling stations helped hose down the black vote.
<P>
<P>Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said Bush's appearance at the school was an ''important part of reaching out.'' It was actually retrenchment. It is not a  good sign that Bush, when offered the platform of King's holiday, a holiday  which in part celebrates the black struggle to vote, remains in utter denial  about his part in inflaming the racial divide.
<P>
<P>Black men and women say they were slingshotted into slavery. Bush was slingshotted over them. The only way Bush  can celebrate the King holiday without looking black men and women in the eye is to stay in the  children's section. When Bush stands before black children, he always has the comfort of looking down.
