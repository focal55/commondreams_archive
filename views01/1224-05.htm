The political mood in this country is getting uglier as the open-ended long 
  war drags on. Frustrated at not seeing Osama bin Laden&#146;s head &#147;brought 
  home on a stick,&#148; as one CNN commentator growled, Americans are turning 
  on their fellow citizens and the Constitution.
<p>In Florida, West Virginia, Indiana and elsewhere, students have been expelled 
  from high schools for expressing anti-war views. The arrests of Jewish Defense 
  League members in Los Angeles on charges of plotting to blow up a mosque&#151;and 
  the offices of a Republican congressman of Lebanese descent&#151;remind us that 
  terrorism is not the exclusive province of &#147;rag-heads&#148; (the newly 
  popular schoolyard epithet of choice). Those of us who have written critically 
  of the war have become accustomed to receiving death threats of unimaginative 
  obscenity.</p>
<p>The most reliable national poll&#151;conducted for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 
  by Democrat Peter Hart and Republican Bob Teeter&#151;shows big majorities support 
  military tribunals for terrorist suspects, blanket roundups of legal residents 
  of Arab descent for questioning, government monitoring of e-mails, detention 
  of some 600 suspects without charging or naming them, and wiretapping of detainees&#146; 
  conversations with their lawyers. Even that odious religious primitive John 
  Ashcroft is popular, with a 57 percent approval rating (and only 13 percent 
  critical). That&#146;s not surprising when one considers the failure of the 
  Senate Democrats to lay a glove on Ashcroft when he appeared before the Senate 
  Judiciary Committee; their spineless, powderpuff questioning was so ineffectual 
  the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> chortled that it was a &#147;rout&#148; for the Holy 
  Roller.</p>
<p>Poll-driven congressional Democrats have taken to heart the strategy memo written 
  by former Clinton strategists Stan Greenberg, the pollster, and James Carville, 
  the pit bull, which instructed them to breathe no word of criticism on the conduct 
  of the war, either at home or abroad, and instead to concentrate their fire 
  on the economy. But even in that they have failed to make a coherent case with 
  populist appeal. As Russ Hemenway, veteran director of the National Committee 
  for an Effective Congress, puts it, &#147;Ordinary people can&#146;t understand 
  what they&#146;re talking about. They have no theme. They should be hammering 
  on trickle-down economics and corporate welfare.&#148;</p>
<p>But with the party&#146;s vice presidential candidate last year, Sen. Joe Lieberman, 
  having endorsed the Bush approach to the economy&#151;tax cuts for business 
  over help for the unemployed&#151;and the chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial 
  Campaign Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, and many other Democrats supporting the 
  $30 billion Boeing-boondoggle bailout, why be surprised that the Democratic 
  leadership&#146;s attempts at compromise have fallen flat?</p>
<p>The CNN/Gallup poll confirms the Democrats&#146; failure to effectively develop 
  a truly alternative anti-recession program: It now shows 44 percent favor the 
  GOP&#146;s approach to only 35 percent for the Democrats&#146; (a Republican 
  gain from November, when the numbers were even). Indeed, a plurality now believes 
  that the recession is just a normal part of the business cycle: 49 percent oppose 
  any direct government action on the economy, as opposed to 47 percent in favor. 
  In other words, half the country thinks the &#147;economic stimulus&#148; package 
  is irrelevant.</p>
<p>That, Hemenway says, is helping to make Democratic prospects for next year&#146;s 
  congressional elections &#147;simply dreadful.&#148; And if, as he forecasts, 
  the Democrats lose the Senate next year and fail to gain in the House, the Republican 
  rollback of civil liberties will continue unchecked.</p>
<p>But not all the predations on our civil liberties are coming from Washington. 
  One of the most unsettling reflections of the malignant national mood can be 
  found in the supposedly liberal city of San Francisco, where two dissident AIDS 
  activists have been arrested as &#147;terrorists.&#148; Michael Petrelis and 
  David Pasquarelli are hardly figures who inspire universal affection in the 
  gay and AIDS communities. Petrelis is a sometimes-useful gadfly whose guerrilla-theater 
  tactics, often targeting what he considers the AIDS and gay establishments, 
  can range from silly to offensive to downright counterproductive. Pasquarelli 
  is an HIV denier (meaning that he believes HIV is not the cause of AIDS) against 
  whom restraining orders have been issued to prohibit him from harassing individuals 
  at the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, Project Inform and the city health department.</p>
<p>The duo are currently in jail, charged with making harassing phone calls to 
  editors and reporters at the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> demanding, among other 
  things, more attention to the threat to the AIDS community contained in the 
  model quarantine law Bush is pushing for states in the wake of the bioterrorism 
  scare. (The proposed law, a version of which is now working its way through 
  the California legislature, authorizes a quarantine for &#147;any infectious 
  disease that can be transmitted from person to person,&#148; a definition so 
  broad that it includes HIV. The city&#146;s AIDS czar has already suggested 
  quarantine for &#147;promiscuous&#148; HIV-infected men).</p>
<p>The indictment of Petrelis and Pasquarelli accuses them of stalking, terrorist 
  threats and conspiracy on 27 counts&#151;half of which are felonies&#151;carrying 
  a potential total penalty of 78 years in prison. A probable cause hearing on 
  the indictments is not scheduled until January 23&#151;and meanwhile, the two 
  ailing men are languishing behind bars, where they are being held on bail of 
  $500,000 each. Both men have AIDS, are in fragile health and have complained 
  of the inadequacy of medical attention in jail. Petrelis has esophageal candidiasis 
  (&#147;thrush&#148;), a particularly painful affliction, and on December 8 a 
  judge ordered him to be rushed to the prison medical unit for treatment (a serious 
  skin condition now covers 60 percent of his body).</p>
<p>One can object to both Petrelis&#146; and Pasquarelli&#146;s politics and actions, 
  but what is being done to them is deeply disturbing. The prohibitively high 
  bail for these activist marginals amounts to preventive detention. While admitting 
  to making obscene late-night phone calls, both men vehemently deny having made 
  a bomb threat, as the indictments charge. Those who have no sympathy for the 
  pair should recall the case of ACT UP&#146;s Kate Sorenson, who was arrested 
  in protests at the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, then 
  held on $1 million bail on felony charges, but eventually acquitted. Or the 
  takeover of GlaxoSmithKline&#146;s New York offices last February by ACT UP 
  activists protesting inflated drug prices, against whom felony charges are still 
  pending.</p>
<p>The punishing of nonviolent civil&#151;or even uncivil&#151;disobedience with 
  felony charges, instead of the usual misdemeanors, constitutes an attempt to 
  repress political dissent. And while late-night obscene phone calls are a repugnant 
  and juvenile form of political protest, the accusations of &#147;terrorism&#148; 
  against Petrelis and Pasquarelli by San Francisco&#146;s putatively progressive 
  District Attorney Terance Hallinan&#151;who, with his radical past, should know 
  better&#151;can only be viewed as blatant political pandering to his hometown 
  newspaper. And it makes it difficult for the duo to get a fair trial. (As the 
  magazine went to press, <i>In These Times</i> learned that Rep. Nancy Pelosi of San 
  Francisco, the House Democratic Whip, had written to the Justice Department 
  requesting that Petrelis and Pasquarelli be investigated under the USA PATRIOT 
  Act for &#147;terrorism.&#148; New felony charges also have been added to Pasquarelli&#146;s 
  indictment by Hallinan, who had had his bail increased by another $100,000.)</p>
<p>An open letter initiated by Queer Watch&#146;s William K. Dobbs, a New York-based 
  gay civil liberties lawyer, demanding bail reduction for Petrelis and Pasquarelli 
  has already been signed by 125 prominent AIDS and gay activists, writers, lawyers 
  and academics&#151;few of whom agree with the imprisoned pair&#146;s views. 
  Judy Greenspan, an HIV advocate for California Prison Focus, has been on the 
  receiving end of some of their phone calls, but says, &#147;I don&#146;t believe 
  in prosecuting them on felony charges, and I certainly don&#146;t support the 
  use of the word terrorist.&#148;</p>
<p>Scott Tucker, a well-known progressive gay activist and writer who co-founded 
  ACT UP/Philadelphia, says that &#147;Petrelis has a wide reputation for being 
  erratic and abrasive, but he has also asked some of the rude questions which 
  have crossed the minds of others who have kept quiet.&#148; But Tucker adds: 
  &#147;Many Americans are wondering what it means for the courts to do their 
  thing under the shadow of Ashcroft and the USA PATRIOT Act; the implication 
  of this case goes far beyond these two defendants. Since 9/11, the definition 
  of terrorism has drifted far from ground zero. That should concern all activists 
  and civil libertarians.&#148;</p>
