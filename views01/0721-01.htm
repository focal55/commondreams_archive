In front of me a young man lies dead under a white  sheet. His body is surrounded by 80 police officers in  gasmasks, with riot shields, truncheons and guns. Not  one looks more than 20 years old - the age, it is said,  of the dead man. 
<P>They shift nervously. No one knows  exactly what happened. A doctor says the man has  two head wounds. One looks like the wound from a  stone, she says. The other, in his cheek, could be that  of a bullet. 
<P>He has already become the unknown protester. One  demonstrator says he heard a gunshot. Another says  he saw the body driven over by a police van. All that is  certain is that it happened at the height of one of the  worst riots that Europe has known in decades.
<P>The youth lies dead and Genoa is burning, a city in  which Tony Blair and his fellow leaders of the G8 group  of the world's richest countries are meeting behind 13ft  steel barricades protected by 18,000 police officers.
<P>There is a temporary silence as an ambulance comes  to take away the body, and both sides contemplate  what has happened. But just 200 yards away, on a  side street, eight officers have cornered another young  man fleeing from them. They pile in with truncheons  and he takes 20 blows to his head and body.  Amazingly, he gets up, bloodied, staggering and  disoriented. A minute later he collapses. The volunteer  medic teams rush over to him.
<P>The helicopters buzz 75ft overhead, and back in the  square the shocked crowd is furious. They chant  "assassins, assassins" at the police.
<P>This was one of most beautiful cities in Europe. Now  stones and rubbish litter the streets. Shops, banks,  super markets, post offices, garages and other  businesses are destroyed. All around is desolation,  fury and destruction.
<P>Fires still burn round Brignole rail station. Police vans,  armored personnel carriers, water cannon and  protesters rush through the town. Teargas is fired in  one direction as the stones fly in another. Nobody  knows quite what has happened or where trouble will  flare next. The only certain thing is that there have  been many injuries - 93 by the official tally. Behind me  a park of 20 cars has been torched. The air swells with  smoke, teargas and anger.
<P>The accusations of overzealous policing and violent  demonstrators now fly. Questions are also asked  about whether city-based G8 summits like this can  ever be held again. But this is a complex situation. Not  all protesters or all police have been intent on wreaking  havoc.
<P>Up to 2,000 anarchists pulled the trigger for the  violence. They are mainly German, with some Italians,  French and other Europeans. Some are British  members of the Animal Liberation Front, scrawling  "ALF" on the walls.
<P>Of the 35,000 to 40,000 demonstrators here, all but  that small minority of anarchists have signed up to the  principle of peaceful protest. At meeting points  protesters are searched to ensure no one is carrying  sticks or stones. But the activists say the way the  police reacted to the anarchists and ambushed  peaceful marchers has inflamed thousands.
<P>The Genoa Social Forum, with its 700 groups from  across the world committed to non-violence, negotiated  with the police and is devastated. "This is  unacceptable," says a spokesman. "We have been  provoked by a level of state and anarchist violence that  was unimaginable. The G8 and the government must  be blamed, but we must accept our share of  responsibility."
<P>In Via Tolemead, confrontation becomes inevitable the  moment the police rush forward to grab the plastic  barricades of one of the marchers. The crowd behind  surges forward and three people fall. The police beat a  man. The protesters surge forward and gain 20 yards.  Suddenly the police are in retreat. A spokesman for  the protesters comes forward to negotiate: "We had  agreed this route," he says. The police retreat again.
<P>But now some of the anarchists have started stoning  the police from a side street. A van of carabinieri stalls  and the anarchists launch themselves on it, as if on a  wounded animal. In minutes they have broken all its  windows. The five policemen inside open the doors and  run for it. The van is torched, to cheers.
<P>All day there has been mayhem. Sticks, stones,  teargas, fireworks, flares, bottles and truncheons have  been thrown back and forth. Barricades of wood and  metal have been set alight under a bridge. It is now  7.30pm. In the distance protesters and the police are  beating their drums under a pall of smoke. The battle  for the city has lasted eight hours and may go on  sporadically all night.
<P>In one square, the anarchists still rule. A dozen have  broken into a small supermarket, ransacked shelves  and are handing out ice-cream and wine. They are  dangerously drunk.
<P>One, a German, snatches my notebook, spits in my  face, raises his stick. He looks no more than 20. His  comrades strut around behind black flags and drums,  smashing and burning everything, turning on anyone in  their path.
