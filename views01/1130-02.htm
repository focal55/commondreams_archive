Tomorrow a nationwide Stop Esso protest will picket over 300 Esso petrol stations across the country. Organized by Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, thousands will be out on the forecourts intent on inflicting lasting damage on Esso's brand image. Esso is the ugliest oil bully, most vigorous in undermining the Kyoto agreement, and the fiercest advocate of keeping the US out of it. 
<P>As the biggest oil donor to George Bush's election campaign, its $11m annual lobbying budget has purchased vast "scientific evidence" to deny that climate change is caused by fossil fuel burning. At the intergovernmental panel on climate change meeting last month, Esso was the only company in the world lobbying for the removal of any reference to the human causes of global warming.  <P>If Esso can be made to feel the heat, the Stop Esso protesters hope that other oil companies will also take fright. Wiser companies are starting to redefine themselves not as oil companies, but as energy companies. But unlike the others, Esso last year made the biggest profit in history - $17.7bn - yet it spent not one cent on renewable energy. The aim of the protesters is to punish the Esso brand, as Nestl&#233; or Nike have been made to suffer: protesters hope that motorists directed away from Esso to the nearest alternative station will stay away from Esso indefinitely.  <P>This week's collapse of Enron, another mighty fossil fuel bully, with its shares freefalling from $90 to zero, acts as a good reminder to investors that socially bad companies often go to the bad financially, too.  <P>There is no better time to apply pressure on the government to invest heavily in renewables. Downing Street has called for a review of long-term energy policy, which will report before Christmas. The spade work has been done, and facts assembled, and it is in the final process of redrafting: this is where politics enter. The factual findings are already published and lead to one ineluctable conclusion: converting as fast as possible to renewable energy is essential.  <P>I spoke to several committee members and one said: "The facts show that all roads lead to Rome. The danger is that the treasury, the department of trade and industry and Downing Street may be in the process of moving Rome."  <P>Currently Britain has 2.5% renewable electricity, with a commitment to reach 10% by 2010. The report ought - unless   heavily doctored - to recommend reaching 20% by 2020 and 30% by 2030, (and 100% by 2050, if they were brave). Firm future targets would encourage long-term investment now in a legal certainty. This kind of energy shift has been made before: in 1950, 90% of power stations were coal-fired, and most are now gas-fired.  <P>The report's other crunch question is the future of nuclear energy: currently it supplies 25% of our energy, so as old Magnox reactors are decommissioned, will they be replaced? It looks as if the nuclear option is ending - but Brian Wilson, the energy minister with a couple of reactors in his constituency, is suspected of lobbying hard for more nuclear as a "clean" energy source.  
<P>Nuclear claims were severely weakened by the announcement this week that BNFL, the state-owned company, is to split into two: the colossal losses of the past, and the &#163;35bn for keeping old nuclear waste safe for 30,000 years, has been left to the tax payer, while a few small potentially profitable remnants of the industry form a separate company for possible privatization. What may signal the death knell of the industry is that the two great projects destined to make money, the Mox and Thorp reprocessing plants at Sellafield, have been placed into the wastebin of deficit liabilities, as expensive no-hopers. Plutonium recycling has proved a costly chimera, not a money-spinner.  
<P>The committee's remit has included energy security. This originally meant protecting national supplies so easily cut off by a handful of hauliers blockading refineries last year: the government was shocked by the vulnerability of our just-in-time society. After September 11, the security question leapt to the top of the committee's agenda, weakening the case for new nuclear plants. As the French bring in missiles to protect their nuclear plants, the prospect of suicidal maniacs crashing into Sellafield suddenly seems less than hypothetical: it would cause devastation 50 times worse than Chernobyl.  <P> But energy security means more than physical safety or reliable supplies. As Dan Plesch of the Royal United Services Institutes wrote in these pages, the west's dependency on unstable oil-producing countries now imperils all its foreign policy as never before. How can Islamic fundamentalist rage be calmed while US troops in the Gulf prop up a corrupt tyranny in Saudi Arabia for fear of losing essential oil supplies? The US thirst for oil destroys any chance of its foreign policy being seen as well-intentioned, even when it is. (I met Serbs demonstrating outside Downing Street who swore the US was bombing Kosovo because of secret oil supplies there.)  <P>War protesters see the US intervention in Afghanistan as oil-driven, despite the murderous provocation and a pressing need to root out the al-Qaida   threat. Oil dependency not only warps US foreign policy and its perception, it is corrupting US democracy with oil money buying a presidential election and oil interests commanding a government in which half the cabinet are oil men. An America - and a Europe - less oil-driven would be free from a corrosive addiction.  <P>There is some sign that even this US government is beginning to perceive the danger: renewables - wind, solar and biofuels - are safe from foreign or domestic disruption, offering a far cheaper freedom from external threat than NMD.  <P>But as oil prices are low, grotesque consumption continues. British cars now average 35mpg, while US cars average 20mpg: sports utility vehicle four-wheel-drive monsters do just 9mpg. President Bush stays firmly out of the Kyoto agreement, promising to do something which will amount to little more than planting a few fragile forests   in Brazil. The hope is that once profitable trading in carbon emissions begins in earnest in a couple of years, with countries selling their unused Kyoto quotas, the US will want to join in.  
<P>The political, economic and climate argument now for renewables is overwhelming. The urgent need is for new planning laws to stop local Nimbys preventing wind power development, and the ministry of defense's absurd objections to off-shore wind turbines interfering with low flying pilot practice. The real costs of nuclear power have always been underestimated: Sizewell B's power came in at three times the cost promised, without counting waste disposal.  
<P>This is the right time to demonstrate against oil and for renewables, the right time to let the nuclear era pass away. And Esso is a good symbol of all that has to change.
