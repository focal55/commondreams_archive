Slide over, Big Oil.  A new corporate clique is calling the president’s
foreign-policy shots.  

<p>President George W. Bush’s decided to make the Taliban government of
Afghanistan a prime target in the war on terrorism after senior advisor
Karl Rove met with executives of the Bic and Norelco corporations, say
sources at the two companies and the White House gymnasium.

<p>On the afternoon of September 19, razor executives told Rove they would
donate at least $20 million to Republican congressional candidates in
2002 -- and not one dime to Democrats -- if the White House would oust
the Taliban regime.  Rove countered that if the companies would double
their donations, the White House would not only topple the Taliban but
grant Norelco and Bic exclusive access to the Afghan market for the next
five years.  A flurry of phone calls ensued, and within an hour the deal
was sealed.  

<p>Prior to the meeting, which took place at the swank Georgetown home of
Norelco’s chief lobbyist, the Bush administration’s war on terrorism had
focused on bin Laden and al-Qaida.  There had been scant interest even
among Pentagon hawks in an all-out war to unseat the unshaven Afghan
regime.

<p>After the meeting, Rove returned to the White House and met with the
president in the basement gym.  According to an assistant to the
president’s personal trainer, while Bush squatted, crunched and curled,
Rove suggested revisions to the major address scheduled for the
following night.  Bush grunted his assent, and on September 20 he hit
the Taliban with a laundry list of non-negotiable demands he knew they
would not accept, then punctuated the list with an ultimatum:  “act
immediately” or “share in their [bin Laden and al-Qaida’s] fate.”

<p>As Bush spoke those words, the toothy smiles of razor executives lit up
the Georgetown night.

<p>The razor and shaving-accessories industry is a newcomer to
international power politics.  Long a force on the domestic scene, it
has always donated generously but evenhandedly, splitting contributions
between clean-shaven Democrats and Republicans.  

<p>The industry’s clout is such that neither major party has dared to
nominate a bearded man for president in more than a century, and it’s no
coincidence that the only Bush administration official on the chopping
block is whiskered Surgeon General David Satcher.  Nor was there
anything spontaneous about the torrent of ridicule that greeted Al Gore
when he emerged from hibernation with a furry face.  “We activated our
media assets and orchestrated that campaign from start to finish,”
boasted an industry insider.

<p>Norelco and Bic plan to resume their bipartisan ways in 2004, but
officials say the Afghan payoff is worth the risk of ruffling Democratic
feathers.

<p>“With a shave-starved population of 25 million, we’re talking annual
sales worth 150 million dollars,” said a Norelco executive.  “Plus,
we’ll have a leg up when domestic and foreign rivals join the
competition in 2006.  Afghans may be fickle when it comes to political
alliances, but market research suggests they’ll stick with any razor
that delivers a clean, smooth shave.”

<p>Edward Bernays III, marketing director for Lady Bic, has recruited a
number of exiled Afghan trend-setters to return home and wear in public
the new line of “mini-burqas” designed for Bic by Calvin Klein. 

<p>“We’ve kept the classic loose fit,” said Klein.  “But we’ve raised the
hemline a daring six inches above the ankle and made the hood detachable
for those special occasions when peripheral vision is a must.”

<p>“Skin is in,” said Bernays, who hopes to do for Lady Bic what his
grandfather did for Big Tobacco.

<p>In 1929, the original Edward Bernays hired fashion models to march --
and smoke -- in New York’s Easter Parade while wearing banners hailing
the cigarette as a “torch of liberty.”  Photos of the bold beauties
spread like wildfire, and soon ladies across the land took up smoking so
they, too, could strike a liberated pose.

<p>Charlotte Beers, the former advertising executive hired by President
Bush to sell the U.S. government as if it were a brand to foreigners who
don’t fully appreciate our policies and way of life, believes Afghans
can learn much about democracy from America’s razor exports.

<p>“Freedom to choose is what America -- and the new Afghanistan -- is all
about,” she said.  “Do I select an electric Norelco with pop-up trimmer
or a hand-powered Lady Bic triple-trac?  Do I cast my presidential vote
for a Pashtun warlord or a Tajik warlord?  It’s all good!”
