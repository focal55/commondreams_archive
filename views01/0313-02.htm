I can think of no other way to say this, so here goes: White people need to tear off our blinders.<BR>
<BR>
  Two more children are dead, 13 are injured, and another &quot;nice&quot; community is scratching its blonde scalp, utterly perplexed as to how a school shooting like the one in Santee, Calif., could happen. After all, as the mayor of the town said on CNN: &quot;We're a solid town, a good town, with good kids, a good churchgoing town, an All-American town.&quot; Perhaps that's the problem.<BR>
<BR>
  I said this after Columbine and I'll say it again: White people live in a state of self-delusion. We think danger is black, brown and poor, and if we can just move far enough away from &quot;those people&quot; in the cities, and find an &quot;all-American town,&quot; we'll be safe, because &quot;things like this just don't happen here.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
  Well, that is just plain wrong. &quot;Here&quot; is about the only place these kinds of things do happen. Oh sure, there's violence in urban schools. But mass murder, wholesale slaughter, take-a-gun-and-see-how-many-you can-kill kinda craziness seems unique to the &quot;safe&quot; places: white suburbs and rural communities.<BR>
<BR>
  And yet the FBI insists there is no &quot;profile&quot; of a school shooter. Come again? White boy after white boy uses classmates for target practice, and yet there is no profile? Imagine if all these killers had been black: Would we hesitate to put a racial label on the perpetrators? Doubtful.<BR>
<BR>
  Indeed, if any black child -- especially in the white suburbs of Littleton or Santee -- had discussed murdering fellow students, as happened at Columbine and Santana High, you can bet somebody would have turned them in and the cops would have beat a path to their door. But when whites discuss murderous intentions, our assumptions of what danger looks like lead us to ignore them.<BR>
<BR>
  How long will it take for us to realize that this false sense of security -- fed by media representations of crime and violence that portray both as the province of those who are anything but white like us -- is getting people killed?<BR>
<BR>
  Better listen up, white folks: Our children are no better than anyone else's, and sometimes they're worse. For example, according to the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes on Drug Abuse, it is our children who are most likely to use drugs. Whites in high school are seven times more likely than blacks to have used cocaine, eight times more likely to have smoked crack, and there are more white high schoolers who have used crystal methamphetamine than black students who smoke cigarettes.<BR>
<BR>
  Additionally, white youth are 34 percent more likely to sell drugs than their black counterparts, twice as likely to binge drink and nearly twice as likely to drive drunk. And white males are twice as likely as black males to bring a weapon to school.<BR>
<BR>
  In the case of Santee, the town's whiteness is so taken for granted that the mayor, in that CNN interview, thought nothing of saying that on the one hand the town was 82 percent white, but on the other hand that &quot;this is America.&quot; Well that isn't America, and it especially isn't California, where whites are only half the population. This is a town that is removed from America, and yet its mayor thinks they are the normal ones -- so much so that when asked about racial diversity, he said there weren't many of different &quot;ethni-tis-tities.&quot; Not a word. Not even close.<BR>
<BR>
  I'd like to think that after these shootings folks might abandon racial stereotypes of deviance and dysfunction. But I know better. Because the ones hitting snooze on this particular alarm are my own people -- and I know their blindness like the back of my hand.<BR><BR>
