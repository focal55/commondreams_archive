The prevailing wisdom--that America is fiercely in favor of
executions--is dead wrong. You'd never know it from the views expressed
by most political figures and media pundits, but many Americans are
uncomfortable with the notion of the state as killer, and this number
increases with every death row inmate released when new evidence
establishes his innocence. Most Americans now prefer another method to
punish the wrongdoer and protect society: life without parole.
<p>After talking with scholars, judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys,
prison officials and murder victim families, we have concluded that even
as America executes prisoners at an appallingly high rate, the death
penalty's days are numbered. The public still embraces the death penalty
in theory, but looks at it with an increasingly critical eye. That's one
reason California, for example, has had several hundred prisoners on
death row for a decade or more but has executed only a few since 1980.
<p>The past year has been a turning point, with the continuing rise in
the number of executions forcing the public, the media and religious
figures to confront the issue. Perhaps the most significant moment came
when Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a conservative Republican, halted
executions in that state, the first such moratorium in the country. It is
officials like Ryan--tough-minded but troubled about state killing--who
will bring an end to executions in this country. Ryan's move met with
little public or political opposition, a measure of how much the support
for executions has dropped. Related actions have occurred in many states,
including New Hampshire, where the House voted to abolish the death
penalty, a decision later overturned by the governor's veto.
<p>Although polls are drifting in the anti-death penalty direction,
lawmakers and candidates continue to embrace the death penalty, convinced
it would be political suicide to act otherwise. But they are increasingly
reluctant to carry on their own shoulders the moral and psychological
burden of state killing. A recent Gallup poll found support for capital
punishment at its lowest level in 19 years, down to 66% today. Support
plummets when tough alternative sentencing, such as life without parole,
is an option.
<p>Until recently, in most states, there was no such thing as true "life
without parole." Even convicted murderers often emerged from prison
eventually. The public knew this. In recent years, however, more than
two-thirds of the states, including California, have enacted procedures
for sentencing some murderers to life without parole with no chance that
they will ever get out. Many recent polls have shown that support for the
death penalty drops to about 50% when those polled were asked to choose
between execution or life without parole for convicted killers.
<p>The growing support for life without parole signals the beginning of
the end for capital punishment in our society. The number of those
opposed or ambivalent about executions will grow so large that the U.S.
Supreme Court, or dozens of state legislatures, will move against
executions.
<p>Even if opposition to the death penalty does not reach majority
levels, that doesn't mean that executions can't be outlawed in America.
Capital punishment had majority support in many Western nations, such as
France, England and Canada, at the time they abolished the death penalty,
and yet there was no widespread protest.
<p>Some of the trends that led other countries to abolition are occurring
in America, including the growing number of legislators who are speaking
against the death penalty, and outrage over the possible execution of
innocent people, especially as DNA evidence has come into play. Evolving
support for life without parole as a preferred alternative to executions
could change the way judges, lawmakers and the media respond to this
issue on every important level, especially if new cases of innocent
prisoners on death row come to light. This will foster the growing
realization that, since the justice system can never be 100% right, it
must not be allowed to administer a punishment that's 100% irreversible.
America would then join most of the modern industrial world, which has
abandoned capital punishment as a savage relic of a less enlightened age.
