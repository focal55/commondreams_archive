<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thanks to commondreams.org and to the previous writers who have covered important points.  Permit me to add a couple of smaller, personal events from the election season, microcosms of larger forces.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, my ten-year-old had an assignment for school that involved analyzing
presidential debate number two.  As he tried to take notes, the candidates'
non-answers and disappearing differences made him want to scream from
boredom.  By contrast, Nader's excessively academic answers (in other
forums, of course) were far more accessible to him.  Ten is an
impressionable age; the loss of respect for the major parties will linger.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Second, at a small rally at Oakland University in Rochester, MI, I watched
as students and staff had their Green Party fliers confiscated and discarded
on their way in to a large rally featuring Tipper Gore.  Large posterboard
signs reading &quot;Tipper Rocks&quot; were permissible, but deviation from that
message was not.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are other examples, too numerous to mention, but my point is that
arrogance and dismissal by the Democrats is radicalizing people, especially young people.  The response of first resort, to scream at them, is unlikely
to win them back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Katha Pollit probably should get her apology from Nader, but she is just about the only Nader critic who deserves one.  And she, of course, ended up giving him her qualified support.  All the other Nader critics that I've seen, without exception, were vicious and never once admitted that there might be serious reasons for voting against Gore as well as Bush.  One crucial issue was the Iraqi sanctions.  At one point are progressives going to realize that Democrats are often as bad as Republicans when it comes to human rights violations overseas?  Ford and Carter helped the Indonesians commit genocide in East Timor in the late 70's.  Reagan, with some Democratic help, supported death squads and terrorists in Central America.  Clinton continued Bush Sr's policy of &quot;punishing&quot; Saddam by killing hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children.  And we Naderites are supposed to feel guilty?  Democrats will start living up to their supposed ideal of compassion when they realize they'll  lose elections if they don't.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thanks so much for posting J. Lee Polnachek's article from the
Jan. 2001 issue of ``The Women's Review of Books''. Polnachek
articulates clearly and persuasively many of my own objections to the
Clinton/Gore posture on women's issues and is particularly lucid on
the question of the middle-class feminist's single-minded devotion to
that sacred cow: Row vs. Wade.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Polnachek asks whether it's worth it: supporting the Clinton/Gore
juggernaut (and its presumed support of Roe v. Wade) to the exclusion of
other progressive candidates (Nader and LaDuke) who address a much broader
spectrum of issues, all with an equally weighty and direct impact on women. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's great that she raises this question---it needs to be
raised----and gives it its thoughtful due.  This is one article I'll
be sending to all my women friends: maybe they'll think twice before
embracing knee-jerk centrism (read middle-class righteousness) of the
Democratic party---and all the nastiness that that entails!</font></p>

 <br>
First, please be so kind as to point me to one article describing a &quot;principled decision to disagree&quot; that does not resort to ad hominem attacks on either Nader or his supporters.  No kidding, I would really like to see one.<br>
 <br>
I have the utmost respect for my fellow feminists who decided it was more important to oppose Bush than to support Nader (as does Polcholnak... or did you conveniently skip over that part of her article?).  But during the campaign, when I went looking for open-minded political debate, what I got was personal attacks on either my motives or my intelligence, or both.  <br>
 <br>
Is dissent now verboten in the hallowed halls of the Left?  Is that what progressivism means these days?  If so, you can keep it.<br>
 <br>
To get respect from your opponents, Ms. Coodley, you have to show a little.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I most certainly did call Ralph Nader!  I am astonished that he would
misrepresent my interview  as a phone call initiated by him, and use me
as an example of a critic who didn't want to hear what he had to say. <i>(Editors Note: see <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views/121900-104.htm">Ralph Nader Lashes Back</a> by Lenora Todaro featured on Common Dreams yesterday from this week's <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/">Village Voice</a>)</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ralph Nader and I had a long conversation, which I reported quite
favorably in my Nation column. True, I was not impressed with his grasp
of women's issues. I mean, come on, drycleaning prices? Nor was I
persuaded by  his notion that Republicans would never dare to do
anything against legal abortion because pro-choicers are the majority --
the Republicans (helped by anti-choice Democrats, to be sure) have ALREADY made abortion hard to get in many states. I was surprised that Nader, who is such a policy maven, knew so little about abortion rights
and access state by state.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nonetheless, in my column I said I was going to vote for him if New
York was safe for Gore.  and that's what I did.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is very sad that Nader, a true American hero, would stoop to 
misrepresentations in order to paint himself  as the victim of
journalists.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I hope he will apologize to me on your Website. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American presidential campaigns are always loaded with nostalgia and nonsense as a part of the show,
so it's hard to read anything into what Bush said during the campaign. But his most devoted
campaigners, who saved him through the primaries and other battlefields, are living in other times
than ours. So he has a problem. And he is very much a part of it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With six years' experience of politics in a cosy corner of the USA - Texas - where Democrats are as
populist-conservative as Haider in Austria, Bush will face a lot of different realities in the White
House. If he has the guts to rethink, he might survive in the White House for eight years, but if he
is fighting yesterday's world he will soon go back to ol' Texas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am open to surprises. This new administration might bring a lot of new thinking and a new realism
into world politics, if they open up to the world in many areas as a partner for peace, justice and
welfare to the poor. But if Washington is drumming the drums of fear to keep the nation behind the
show in the White House, then we are back in yesterday's future.</font></p>

As a professor of women's history, I am deeply offended by the attacks on feminists like myself who developed an analysis that this Nader's candidacy  was the wrong person at the wrong time with a deeply wrong-headed attack aimed at the Democratic Party rather than the growing power of the right wing in this country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To the Editor:<br>
    Conservative justices on the Supreme Court have achieved a favored
result by wielding a clause, Equal Protection, they often disfavor.
Because Broward and Palm Beach counties used slightly different
interpretations of the &quot;intent of the voter &quot; standard in counting
punch-card ballots, this was deemed a violation of Equal Protection,
although it involved a small disparity. A much starker Equal Protection
problem is raised by the fact that, as the Times found in a study of
most of Florida&#146;s counties, punch-card ballots were five times as likely
to be counted as non-votes for president as ballots counted by modern,
more expensive optical scanners. That disparity involves tens of
thousands of Florida ballots.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    By working mightily to close the lid on this year&#146;s presidential
election, Supreme Court conservatives may have inadvertently opened a
can of worms in the form of future election challenges. It will be
interesting to see if their commitment to Equal Protection persists.</font></p>

repeatedly to describe the Republican coup.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rape is not stealing an election. Rape is forcible sexual intercourse, with 
violent intent. It is a physical act, not a judicial or legislative one. It 
uses sexual violation as a way of asserting power over another person. 
There may have been violent intent in the case of the election, and 
certainly there was the intent of a seizure of power. But let's call that 
what it is, and not cheapen a word that refers to a very specific form of 
assault--one that is, for starters, more one-on-one and personal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What happened was appalling on its own terms. America needs language that expresses the act we all witnessed and revulsion we all feel to have power 
used in this way. We don't have to mis-name it. We don't have to sexualize 
it. We don't have to take away from the experiences of the many 
people--mostly women--who've experienced rapes. Stealing an election is not rape. I doubt that anyone who had ever experienced sexual assault would 
experience it as the same as a judicial/political coup. And those who have 
been lucky enough not to experience sexual assault ought not to use that 
word so lightly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This was not a rape. It was a coup. It was the stealing of an election. We 
need to name these power games for what they are, and if that means 
reclaiming or naming anew the full range of ways that power gets misused, 
so be it. These things happen in part because we don't have language to 
express it, or the means to point to it. We use similes and metaphors, and 
before we know it, we forget just what it was that actually happened. Let's 
not do that here. Let's temper our anger and name it coolly and clearly. A 
coup. Theft of the election. Affirmative action and workfare for a rich, 
white, middle-aged, smirking lightweight, posing as a candidate and acting 
out the ultimate Entitlement Fantasy in the U.S.--being given the 
presidency for Xmas by his Big Oil Poppy and their network of friends.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why Differing Criteria Used in Hand Recounts Does Not
Constitute Unequal Protection</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Punch-card ballots are sometimes rejected by counting machines because
chads are incompletely punched out (and perhaps for other reasons).
Manual recounts are then needed to get a more accurate tally including
more (though perhaps still not all) of the votes that voters intended to
cast.  In this process decisions must be made as to what characteristics
of a ballot will indicate valid votes and which will not.  Suppose that
in county A an indented chad on a particular ballot is counted as a
vote, while in a neighboring county B an exactly similar indented chad
on an exactly similar ballot is  construed as a non-vote.  Seven members
of the United States Supreme Court and others are concerned that this
might result in unequal protection of the right to vote, a violation of
the Constitution.  Their reasoning seems to be that some persons in
county A who do not fully punch their ballots would have a greater
ensurance of having their vote counted than such persons in county B.
It is true that the latter are exposed to a certain possibility of not
having their vote counted.  But it must be remembered that an indented
chad is not a clear indication of an intent to vote, since the person
might have pushed the stylus part of the way down and then realized
he/she was making a mistake, or changed her/his mind; it is less clear
than, say, a chad broken out at one corner or two corners.  Therefore
there is also a possiblity of the opposite kind of mistaken judgment of
intent occuring in county A, namely, that said ballot will be counted as
containing a vote for a candidate when the intent to do so was not
there.  This would be, one would think, an equally serious failing in
the accuracy of the count from the standpoint of voting rights.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The degree of probability of either error&#151;counting an intended non-vote
as a vote and vice versa&#151;is not precisely kown.  All that can be said is
that each procedure of interpretation falls somewhere within a certain
range of plausible procedures, assuming that the count is being carried
out by reasonable people.  The comparative degrees of voter protection
afforded by the two procedures cannot be quantified.  Therefore they
cannot be said to be either equal or unequal.  Voters in each county are
exposed to EQUALLY RANDOM and EQUALLY UNKNOWN degrees of probability
that their actions in the voting booth will be mistakenly construed in
one of these two ways.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By contrast, it hardly needs stating that an unequal protection of
voting rights exists when in one county a manual count of ballots
rejected by the machine FAILS TO BE CARRIED OUT while in another county
a more accurate balloting system, such as optical scanners, is used
which renders a hand count unnecessary.</font></p>
