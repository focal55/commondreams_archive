- July 22 - The two federal agencies responsible for food regulation may have 
intentionally withheld from lawmakers critical consumer research that is compellingly 
contrary to several provisions in the recently passed farm bill about the labeling 
of irradiated food, Public Citizen has learned.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On May 8, Congress passed the farm bill, which included several industry provisions 
that weakened the labeling of irradiated food and opened the door for manufacturers 
to mislabel it as &quot;pasteurized.&quot; Yet research commissioned by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) &#8211; 
and withheld from lawmakers while they were crafting the bill &#8211; shows that 
consumers do not want irradiated food termed &quot;pasteurized.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is outrageous that government agencies responsible for public health 
and the safety of the food supply would withhold information so relevant to a 
law before it was passed,&quot; said Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen&#8217;s 
Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program. &quot;This is a glaring omission 
at best and deceptive at worse. We suspect that the agencies held onto the research 
because they didn&#8217;t like the results. The lawmakers may not have put these 
harmful provisions in the law had they seen this research.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The provisions were slipped into the bill as a &quot;technical amendment&quot; 
late in the process by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who took $192,138 in agribusiness 
PAC contributions in the last two election cycles (1999-2000 and 2001-2002).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since 2001, the USDA and the FDA have each commissioned research into consumers&#8217; 
opinions on labeling. In the FY 2002 Agriculture-FDA Appropriations bill, Congress 
instructed the FDA to report by Feb. 1, 2002, the findings from its consumer focus 
groups and how the agency planned to implement the findings. Although the FDA 
conducted the research in 2001, it didn&#8217;t provide Congress with the information 
until last Thursday, July 18, more than five months after the original deadline.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The FDA research involved six focus groups composed of seven to 10 consumers 
each. They unanimously rejected &quot;pasteurization&quot; as a replacement for 
&quot;irradiation,&quot; using phrases such as &quot;sneaky,&quot; &quot;deceptive,&quot; 
and &quot;trying to fool us&quot; to describe such an attempt to change terminology. 
&quot;Most of the participants viewed alternate terms such as &#8216;cold pasteurization&#8217; 
and &#8216;electronic pasteurization&#8217; as misleading,&quot; the report said. 
&quot;Everyone agreed that irradiated foods should be labeled honestly. They indicated 
that the current FDA-required statement is a straightforward way for labeling 
irradiated foods.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Additionally, Public Citizen recently obtained portions of the USDA&#8217;s 
report on consumer attitudes on labeling, after requesting information about the 
focus group results under the Freedom of Information Act in early April. The report, 
which was compiled by an outside consulting firm, is dated March 22, 2002, yet 
the USDA apparently has never released the report to the public or lawmakers (a 
congressional source involved in the writing of the farm bill said she never knew 
of it). The report found that consumers &quot;consider it misleading to label 
irradiated meat and poultry products as &#8216;pasteurized.&#8217; &quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The focus groups rejected the euphemism because they &quot;consider irradiation 
and pasteurization to be two different processes,&quot; the report said. The USDA 
consumer research was conducted in six focus group sessions, composed of household 
grocery shoppers and &quot;food preparers.&quot; Between the FDA and USDA focus 
groups, consumers were queried in six different cities representing all regions 
of the country.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When you are creating rules that directly affect consumers, it&#8217;s 
vital that consumers be heard,&quot; said Hauter. &quot;We find it hard to believe 
that USDA didn&#8217;t know Congress was debating the very issue their new report 
addressed &#8211; it was even in The New York Times. Why would these agencies 
bother to ask consumers what they think if they aren&#8217;t going to inform decision-makers 
about the results?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When government agencies consistently find that consumers reject the 
use of &#8216;pasteurization&#8217; to describe irradiation, government policies 
should reflect that,&quot; said Tony Corbo, legislative representative for Public 
Citizen. &quot;Consumers have repeatedly denounced this terminology, and for the 
government to ignore its own research is utter hypocrisy.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What&#8217;s even more alarming about USDA&#8217;s failure to publicize 
this research is how far they&#8217;ve gone to keep it from getting out,&quot; 
Corbo added. &quot;At a June 5 meeting of the USDA&#8217;s Advisory Committee 
on Meat and Poultry Inspection, Undersecretary for Food Safety Elsa Murano denied 
that this research had ever been conducted. Meanwhile the report had been done 
since March.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Irradiation uses gamma rays, X-rays or accelerated electrons that alter the 
molecular structure of food in an attempt to kill pathogens and insects. The process 
destroys nutrients, may change the taste, smell and appearance of food, and produces 
new chemical compounds, some of which have been found to promote cancer and cause 
genetic and cellular damage in rats and human cells. from pasteurization, which 
uses rapid heating and cooling to partially sterilize liquid products, namely 
milk. </font></p>
