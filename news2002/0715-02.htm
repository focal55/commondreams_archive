- July 15 - The U.S. Forest Service released a report on July 10, 2002 claiming 
conservation groups have obstructed Forest Service projects that would have protected 
homes and communities from wildfire. The Forest Service report is a poor attempt 
to shift blame. The Agency bears responsibility for its mismanagement and delays 
in protecting communities, and its rhetoric will neither protect homes nor prevent 
future fire dangers to communities. </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Conservationists Don't Block 
Fire Prevention Work: When the 2002 fire season began, the Forest Service, conservative 
politicians and the timber industry were swift to blame conservationists for obstructing 
fire prevention efforts. These claims were quickly proven false, however, by an 
August 31, 2001 General Accounting Office Report that demonstrated that over 99 
percent of fuel reduction projects proposed by the Forest Service for fiscal year 
2001 went through without appeal, and none were litigated. The Forest Service 
proposed implementing 1,671 hazardous fuel reduction projects for that year. Of 
those, only 20 (about one percent) had been appealed by ANY interested party, 
including recreation groups, conservationists, industry interests or individuals.1 
During the past two years, The Wilderness Society has filed only three administrative 
appeals or lawsuits challenging Forest Service thinning or salvage logging projects. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Forest Service vs. GAO: 
The August 2001 GAO report looked at projects that would directly benefit communities 
at risk from forest fires. To counter the clear and convincing numbers from the 
GAO report, the Forest Service issued a different report that utilized Enron-inspired 
accounting. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Removes Prescribed Burn 
Projects: The Forest Service fails to consider nearly all prescribed burn projects, 
despite the fact that both the National Fire Plan and the Western Governors Association 
have endorsed pre-planned fires as a vital tool to reduce wildfire risk. Conservationists 
also strongly support prescribed burning. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Includes Projects Not 
Designed to Reduce Fire Risk: The Forest Service includes all &quot;thinning&quot; 
projects, even those not designed to reduce fire risk or protect communities. 
Conservationists believe that our limited resources must be focused on the areas 
closest to communities to protect them from wildfire -- not on projects out in 
the backcountry - far from homes. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An April 1999 GAO review 
of fire threats to western forests found that &quot;most of the trees that need 
to be removed to reduce accumulated fuels are small in diameter and have little 
or no commercial value.&quot; The GAO reported, however, that &quot;forest officials 
told us they tend to (1) focus on areas with high-value commercial timber rather 
than on areas with high fire hazards or (2) include more large, commercially valuable 
trees in a timber sale than are necessary to reduce accumulated fuels.&quot; (2) 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Forest Service Does Not 
Include Projects &quot;Not Subject to Appeal:&quot; The Forest Service report 
does not consider any project &quot;not subject to appeal&quot; -- even though 
such projects are still subject to legal challenge. As the August 2001 GAO report 
demonstrates, NONE of the projects that GAO investigated during FY 2001 were litigated. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Forest Service's real 
record: Recent reports by the GAO and USFS Inspector General show that the Forest 
Service's record on fire prevention is plagued by mismanagement and delay: </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- The Forest Service is 
not focusing its work on protecting at-risk communities. During fiscal year 2002 
just over a third of the acres where the Forest Service planned to reduce hazardous 
fuels will be in and around communities. In 2003, the agency's plan is for only 
55 percent of acres mitigated to be in &quot;wildland-urban areas.&quot; (3) Instead 
of protecting communities, the Forest Service continues to favor projects far 
from homes or towns. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Federal agencies still 
have not identified communities facing a high fire risk. A January 2002 GAO report 
notes that federal agencies have failed to identify and prioritize high-risk communities 
and &quot;therefore, it is not possible to determine if the $796 million appropriated 
for hazardous fuel reduction in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 is targeted to the 
communities and other areas at highest risk of severe wildfires.&quot;(4) </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- The Forest Service is 
misspending fire fighting funds: A USFS Inspector General's report from November 
2001 found that the Bitterroot Forest in Montana, for example, had misspent roughly 
$2.5 million of funding designated by Congress to implement the National Fire 
Plan. The funding instead went for projects such as commercial timber sales and 
permits to harvest mushrooms. (5) </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Federal agencies lack 
a coordinated management plan, required seven years ago: A March 2002 GAO report 
notes that &quot;over half of all federal land management units (1,384) still 
do not have fire management plans that meet the requirements of the 1995 fire 
management policy.&quot; (6) The report further observes that these management 
units have not identified high-risk areas, specifically communities in the wildland-urban 
interface that are the most threatened by fire. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Federal Agencies Have 
No Standard to Measure Results: The March 2002 GAO report also notes that &quot;although 
the Forest Service and Interior have received substantial additional funding, 
they have not yet developed performance measures to determine the extent that 
these additional resources have resulted in more effective fire fighting as envisioned 
under the National Fire Plan.&quot; (7) </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What are appeals? The appeals 
process allows interested citizens to challenge Forest Service management policies 
and projects without having to go to court. Appeals are less expensive and faster 
than lawsuits and result in only a minor delay -- 65 days when denied. As U.S. 
District Judge Donald Molloy has explained, the appeals process serves a very 
legitimate function: &quot;Ultimately its force is to allow the democratic process 
of participation in governmental decisions the full breadth and scope to which 
citizens are entitled in a participatory democracy.&quot; (8) </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Wilderness Society and 
appeals: During the past two years, The Wilderness Society has filed only three 
administrative appeals or lawsuits challenging Forest Service thinning or salvage 
logging projects: (1) Bitterroot Burned Area Recovery (BAR) Project, Bitterroot 
National Forest, Montana. Lawsuit filed in December 2001 in response to effort 
by USDA Undersecretary Mark Rey's attempt to bypass the administrative appeals 
process for the BAR project. The Montana U.S. District Court ruled that Rey violated 
the law. The case was settled in February 2002. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2) Upper South Platte Recovery 
Project, Pike San Isabel National Forest, Colorado. Administrative appeal filed 
in September 2001 due to lack of information about impacts to roadless areas. 
Conservationists did not challenge the majority of the project. A tentative settlement 
was reached in December. The Forest Service issued a new project decision in February, 
which was appealed by both conservationists and the timber industry. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(3) Bark Beetle Project, 
Pike-San Isabel National Forest, Colorado. Administrative appeal filed in May 
2002 to contest logging of large trees in a roadless area. The Forest Service 
acknowledges that this is not designed as a fuel-reduction project. </font></p>
