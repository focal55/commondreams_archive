- June 28 - Last week, the Federal Election Commission weakened the soft money 
ban that Congress enacted last April as part of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance 
reform law. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Commission's action came in a rulemaking session to implement the provisions 
of the soft money ban in the new law. Instead, the Commission rejected numerous 
parts of the draft regulations proposed by its own general counsel, and in multiple 
ways adopted dramatically weaker rules that threaten to open major loopholes in 
the soft money ban. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Congress banned outright the use of soft money contributions to influence 
federal elections, and the Commission opened the back door for state parties to 
do it. That hurts the republic in two ways - it undermines the intent of Congress 
to stop influence buying by corporations, unions, and the wealthy; and it substitutes 
the judgment of unelected commissioners for the will of Congress and the President,&quot; 
Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger said. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a joint statement released by the Congressional sponsors of the law, Senators 
John McCain (R-AZ), Russell Feingold (D-WI), and Representatives Chris Shays (R-CT), 
and Marty Meehan (D-MA). &quot;The Federal Election Commission has taken upon 
itself the task of rewriting the newly passed McCain-Feingold/Shays Meehan law. 
This is not a role given to the FEC by Congress, or by the Constitution. Congress 
spent seven years debating complex and difficult policy issues before reaching 
the judgments contained in the bill. The FEC's job is to implement those judgments, 
not revisit them - to enforce the law, not undermine it.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Commission attacked the campaign finance law from several angles. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, it greatly expanded the ability of state parties to spend soft money 
on activities that influence federal elections. Congress tried to close this loophole 
by requiring state parties to spend federally regulated money on &quot;federal 
election activities,&quot; including certain voter registration activities, get-out-the-vote 
activities in connection with a federal election, and voter identification activities. 
Spending by state parties on all of these areas has been a major avenue for the 
flow of soft money into federal campaigns. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Commission substantially weakened this portion of the law by narrowly defining 
what activities are included in the term &quot;federal election activities.&quot; 
For instance, the FEC general counsel had recommended that all such activities 
that occur after January 1 of a federal election year be considered &quot;federal 
election activities.&quot; The Commissioners changed this to include only activities 
that occur after the filing deadline for a state's primary election. In some states, 
the deadline is as late as mid-August, which means that all state party activities 
prior to that date can be funded with soft money, as under the current corrupt 
system. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Similarly, the general counsel had recommended that voter registration activities 
include both &quot;encouraging&quot; and &quot;assisting&quot; voters to register. 
The Commission narrowed this to include only activities that &quot;assist&quot; 
voters to register, thus excluding much of what state parties do in voter registration 
drives. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Commission did the same with &quot;get out the vote&quot; activities, eliminating 
those state party efforts that &quot;encourage&quot; voters to vote and including 
only those that &quot;assist&quot; them to vote. It also narrowed the category 
of &quot;voter identification&quot; activities. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, the Commission opened the door to federal officeholders and candidates 
soliciting soft money once again. A key provision of the law was aimed at shutting 
down solicitations of soft money by federal officials. The Commission, by its 
narrow definition of the term &quot;to solicit,&quot; has almost certainly created 
a loophole that will be easy to exploit. The FEC's general counsel had recommended 
that the Commission define the term to include a &quot;request, suggestion or 
recommendation&quot; that a donation be made. Instead, a majority of commissioners 
adopted a much narrower definition that requires a direct and explict &quot;ask&quot; 
for donations. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Proponents of reform fear that federal officials will be able to stay in the 
business of soliciting soft money by simply avoiding use of the term &quot;ask&quot; 
when they request or suggest that large soft money donations be made. The Washington 
Post noted that this change &quot;potentially opens up a loophole, one in which 
solicitations can be made eliptically enough to be outside the law yet clearly 
enough to convey the request to a potential donor.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Third, the Commission's regulations fail to implement the law's provisions 
that shut down so-called &quot;leadership PACs&quot; as vehicles for the raising 
and spending of soft money by Members of Congress. Such PAC's have been allowed 
for years under the Commission's loose definition of &quot;affiliation.&quot; 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The law addressed this problem by banning Members of Congress from raising 
or spending soft money, and extended this ban to any entity &quot;directly or 
indirectly established, financed, maintained or controlled&quot; by the Member. 
The Commission's rules simply defined this new term to mean the same thing as 
the old &quot;affiliation&quot; standard, thus continuing the fiction that a Member's 
&quot;leadership PAC&quot; is not affiliated with, or established by, the Member. 
This potentially allows Members to continue to control soft money through their 
&quot;leadership PACs.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fourth, the Commission created another loophole by allowing Members to solicit 
soft money at state party fundraising events - precisely where soft money is raised. 
The law is intended to ban all solicitation of soft money by Members, but to allow 
them to &quot;appear, speak and be a featured guest&quot; at a state party event. 
Contrary to the advice of its general counsel, the Commission simply created a 
blanket exemption for Members to solicit soft money if they do so at a state party 
fundraiser. One Commissioner called this a &quot;total carve out&quot; from the 
statute. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overall, the New York Times concluded that the FEC's &quot;rules and exemptions 
are nothing less than an abuse of power by unelected bureaucrats pushing a corrupt 
agenda of favoring special interest money over the voices and votes of citizens.&quot; 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The congressional sponsors of the legislation - Senator John McCain (R-AZ), 
Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI), Representative Christopher Shays (R-CT) and Representative 
Martin Meehan (D-MA) - have announced that they intend to seek congressional invalidation 
of the new regulations under the Congressional Review Act, a law that provides 
special procedures for Congress to review agency regulations. They have also said 
that they intend to challenge the new FEC rules in court. The Americans for Reform 
coalition that helped pass McCain-Feingold are gearing up grassroots efforts to 
ensure that the campaign finance law does not get rewritten out of existence.
