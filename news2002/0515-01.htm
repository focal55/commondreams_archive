- May 15 - The majority of anti-choice 
voters strongly agree that students should receive sex education 
that includes abstinence and contraception throughout their school 
years, according to a 2002 poll of registered voters, commissioned 
by the Othmer Institute at Planned Parenthood of NYC. Ninety 
percent of all respondents agreed that students should receive 
age-appropriate and medically accurate sex education that begins in 
the early grades and continues through twelfth grade. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite such findings, the House of Representatives is poised to 
pass legislation that trades medical accuracy and effective 
programs for conservative ideology. A provision of the proposed 
House welfare reauthorization bill would provide federal funding 
for medically incomplete abstinence programs. The legislation is 
part of a larger effort by the Bush Administration to increase 
federal funding for such programs by 35 percent. Typically called 
abstinence-only, these programs only discuss contraception as it 
relates to failure rates. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the majority of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents 
prefer sex education programs to abstinence-only programs, the 
House Commerce Committee voted largely along party lines to shoot 
down amendments that would have required abstinence programs to be 
medically accurate and states to use programs that have been shown 
to work. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Such votes are driven by narrow ideology, rather than what 
Americans want and need to be healthy,&quot; said Gloria Feldt, 
President, Planned Parenthood Federation of America. &quot;How else 
could you explain President Bush mandating a national curriculum 
that the majority of voters don't support? Despite the President's 
on-the-record claims to spend money on what works, he is 
aggressively advocating for programs deemed ineffective by health 
care experts. In so doing, he is putting our children in grave 
danger.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll also uncovered that almost half of all voters believe 
that abstinence-only programs present all the facts on birth 
control and disease prevention. Critics claim that this confusion 
has allowed the Bush Administration to advocate for a program that 
is so far out of step with voter opinion. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans overwhelmingly support sex education-education that 
includes information about abstinence and contraception,&quot; said 
Leslie Kantor, Vice President of Education for the Othmer Institute 
at Planned Parenthood of NYC. &quot;In fact, voters find the idea of 
teaching sex education without contraception and disease prevention 
so ludicrous that they can't believe the federal government is 
funding it.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll also found that the majority of voters believe 
decisions about the content of sex education programs should be 
made at the local and state levels. Yet, the House Commerce 
Committee vetoed an amendment that would have given states more 
flexibility in how best to spend the money. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, the Bush Administration is about to face an 
unlikely foe in this matter, which is often framed as a debate 
between morality and public health. Religious leaders are preparing 
to release an open letter supporting comprehensive sex education. 
The letter, developed at a colloquium of theologians sponsored by 
the Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing, 
provides compelling religious reasons for supporting comprehensive 
sex education. In addition, more than 2,100 clergy, theologians and 
other religious leaders have endorsed a Religious Declaration, 
which calls in part for lifelong, age-appropriate sexuality education in schools, seminaries, and community settings. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There currently is no federal program dedicated to supporting 
effective sex education that emphasizes the benefits of abstinence 
while also teaching about contraception and pregnancy and disease 
prevention, despite the proven effectiveness of such programs. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll was conducted by Lake Snell Perry &amp; Associates and 
commissioned by the Othmer Institute at Planned Parenthood of NYC. 
The survey reached 800 active and attentive voters nationwide (400 
men and 400 women). Active and attentive voters were defined as 
individuals who said they were likely to vote in the 2002 elections 
for Congress; who had voted in all or most of the elections in 
which they had been eligible to vote; who read the newspaper daily; 
who participate in a volunteer, community or civic, or political 
organization at least once a month; who pay attention to politics 
and government; and who would write a letter to their member of 
Congress on an issue that concerned them. The survey was conducted 
between February 13 and 18, 2002. The margin of error is 
3.5 percent. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Othmer Institute is dedicated to promoting the advancement 
of reproductive freedom and healthy sexuality through innovative 
programs and ideas. The Institute's objective is to bring new 
energy into the public discourse and create a forum for meaningful 
change, building a national center of civic dialogue where morally 
complex issues can be debated freely.
