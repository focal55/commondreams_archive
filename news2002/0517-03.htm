- May 17 - </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PETITION DROP AND PRESS CONFERENCE TUESDAY</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ACORN members and allies in Community &amp; Labor United for Baltimore (CLUB) plan to visit the Mayor's office on Tuesday, May 21, to drop off their first 10,000 signatures on a petition to place on the ballot an initiative that would amend the City Charter to replace six 3-member City Council districts (plus one at-large member) with 14 single-member districts, reducing each City Council Member's constituents from 108,000 to 46,500, and reducing the number of City Council Members from 18 to 14 (the council president would still be elected city-wide).  Leaders of CLUB will hold a press conference in front of City Hall at 11:30 a.m.<br>
 <br>
What: Press conference upon delivery to Mayor Martin O'Malley's office of the first 10,000 signatures on the petition to amend the Baltimore City Charter to create 14 single-member City Council districts.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When: Tuesday, May 21, at 11:30 a.m. <br>
Where: In front of City Hall, 100 N. Holiday St., in downtown Baltimore.<br>
Visuals: A Single-Member Super Hero is expected to make an appearance!<br>
 <br>
RALLY OF SUPPORTERS WEDNESDAY<br>
On Wednesday, May 22, at 5 p.m. the City Council's Judiciary and Legislative Investigations committees will hold hearings on two bills that would reduce the number of council members without creating single-member districts.  CLUB will hold a rally at 4 p.m. in front of City Hall in favor of single-member districts.  Leaders of CLUB will then testify at the hearings in opposition of the council&#146;s measures, which do not address the issues of member accountability, increased opportunities for non-incumbents and low-to-moderate-income candidates, or greater neighborhood representation. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHY WE SUPPORT 14 SINGLE-MEMBER CITY COUNCIL DISTRICTS:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1. Increased accountability</b><br>
Accountability is diffused with more than one member representing a district.  Pinpointing responsibility on one individual makes possible a more informed decision at election time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>2. Better handling of services to constituents</b><br>
Handling of citizen requests for services under the present three-member districts is haphazard at best. There appears to be no division of work among the three members and often one handles a disproportionate amount of the incoming calls for service. Under a single member district structure, the citizen will know whom to go to. Each member will be more focused and aware of issues in his/her district and thus can serve as a better advocate for residents. Failure of the member to be responsive will be a factor in the member&#146;s reelection. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>3. Council members closer to the neighborhoods</b><br>
Based on 2000 Census figures, the population per district under the present six-district configuration is 108,000.  If the proposed 14 districts were adopted the population would be 46.500 per district.  The representative of the smaller district is bound to be much more familiar with the people and problems of his/her district and could be a power in revitalizing neighborhoods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>4. Savings to the city of over $500,000</b><br>
Each council member receives a salary of $48,000. However, the cost of clerical assistance, office supplies, etc. plus the salary of $48,000 amounts to $140,000 per council member according to the fiscal year 2001 City budget. A reduction of four council members at the budgeted amount totals $560,000. (The $140,000 does not include certain retirement and health benefits.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>5. More opportunities for non-incumbents</b><br>
With single member smaller districts, the cost of campaigning for a council seat should be reduced. This should open up opportunities for low-income people to run for a council seat. By campaigning against a single incumbent rather than a team of three, which often occurs today, chances for non-incumbents to win are increased.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>6. No major city in the U.S. has multiple council members per district</b><br>
According to a tabulation of 103 largest cities made by the National League of Cities and furnished to the City Council President&#146;s Commission on Council Representation, the only city having more than one council member per district was Baltimore. None of the counties in Maryland have more than one council member per district.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>7. Single member districts supported by courts and congressional action</b><br>
Single member districts for the U. S. Congress were required by a 1967 act enacted to forestall southern states from resorting to all at-large districts to dilute the newly enfranchised African-American voting rights under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. (Only Hawaii and New Mexico were affected; all other states had converted to single member districts.) In 1973 the Supreme Court upheld a district court ruling requiring two large Texas counties to establish single member districts to replace existing multi-member districts. Over time Federal judges have ordered single member districts for local elections to facilitate equal representation, on the rationale that the 14th Amendment requires some kind of equivalency between voters and representatives on characteristics important to those voters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>8. More efficient working of the City Council</b><br>
With four fewer members than the present council, it should be possible for the council to act more efficiently in the conduct of its council sessions and in the functioning of its committee system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>9. Population decline supports reduction in council size</b><br>
Baltimore City population has declined from a peak of 950,000 in 1950 Census to 651,000 in the 2000 Census.  When the current council structure was established in 1922, the city population was 734,000 (1920 Census).</font></p>
