- July 15 - <i>&quot;The only thing that burns hotter than a wildfire in the West 
is the demagoguery of some politicians trying to take advantage of it.&quot;</i> 
- former U.S. Rep. Pat Williams (Mont.), The New York Times (June 23, 2002) </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Severe drought across the West has caused an above average 
number of forest fires. As the blame-game continues, the U.S. 
Forest Service clearly must improve its performance if it is to 
achieve the goal of the National Fire Plan -- prioritizing our 
limited resources to protect lives and homes. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Claims that Conservation Groups Delayed Fire Reduction Efforts 
Are Flat-Out Wrong: 
An August 2001 GAO report looks at projects that would directly 
benefit communities at risk from forest fires. It found that over 
99 percent of fuel reduction projects proposed by the Forest 
Service for fiscal year 2001 went through without appeal. In 
detail, the Forest Service proposed implementing 1,671 hazardous 
fuel reduction projects for that year. Of these projects, only 20 
(about one percent) had been appealed by ANY interested party, 
including recreation groups, conservationists, industry interests 
or individuals (1). To counter the clear and convincing numbers 
from the GAO report, the Forest Service issued a different report 
that utilized Enron-inspired accounting. For more on the Forest 
Service's attempt to shift the blame, see 
http://www.wildfirecentral.org &quot;Forest Service Continues to Blow 
Smoke.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Conservationists Worked with the Western Governors Association 
to Produce a Long-Term Strategy Document for Dealing with the 
Wildfire Threat: 
The Western Governor's Fire Plan, developed in May of this year, 
represents a broad, bi-partisan agreement to place the first 
priority for fire policy on protecting endangered communities 
through science-based thinning, prescribed burns, and homeowner 
education. A broad range of representatives joined the Western 
Governors to endorse the plan, including The Wilderness Society, 
the Western Fire Ecology Center, Natural Resources Defense Council, 
the Idaho Conservation League, federal fire-fighting agencies, and 
professional foresters. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Forest Service Is Not Prioritizing Its Current Activities to 
Best Protect Communities: 
Recently, in testimony before the U.S. Congress, the Chief of 
the Forest Service, Dale Bosworth, stated that the most effective 
means of reducing the risk of fire to western communities is 
through careful thinning of small diameter trees near homes and 
towns (2). And yet, according to the Forest Service's most recent 
budget overview, during fiscal year 2002 just over a third of the 
acres where the Forest Service planned to reduce hazardous fuels 
will be in and around communities. In 2003, the agency's plan is 
for only 55 percent of acres mitigated to be in &quot;wildland-urban 
areas&quot; (3). </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Forest Service Still Has Not Identified High Risk Communities: 
A January 2002 GAO report noted that federal agencies have 
failed to identify and prioritize high-risk communities and 
&quot;therefore, it is not possible to determine if the $796 million 
appropriated for hazardous fuel reduction in fiscal years 2001 and 
2002 is targeted to the communities and other areas at highest risk 
of severe wildfires&quot; (4). </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Forest Service Uses Fire to Justify More Logging: 
An April 1999 GAO review of fire threats to western forests 
found that &quot;most of the trees that need to be removed to reduce 
accumulated fuels are small in diameter and have little or no 
commercial value.&quot; The same report found, however, that &quot;forest 
officials told us they tend to (1) focus on areas with high-value 
commercial timber rather than on areas with high fire hazards or 
(2) include more large, commercially valuable trees in a timber 
sale than are necessary to reduce accumulated fuels&quot; (5). </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Forest Service Is Misspending Fire Fighting Funds: 
In October 2000, Congress provided the Forest Service with 
additional funding to implement the National Fire Plan. A USFS 
Inspector General's report from November 2001 found that the 
Bitterroot Forest in Montana, for example, had misspent roughly 
$2.5 million of that funding for projects such as commercial timber 
sales and permits to harvest mushrooms (6). </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Federal Agencies Lack a Coordinated Management Plan, Required 
Seven Years Ago: 
A March 2002 GAO report notes that &quot;over half of all federal 
land management units (1,384) still do not have fire management 
plans that meet the requirements of the 1995 fire management 
policy&quot; (7). The report further observes that these management 
units have not identified high risk areas, specifically communities 
in the wildland-urban interface that are the most threatened by 
fire. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Federal Agencies Have No Standard to Measure Results: 
The March 2002 GAO report also notes that &quot;although the Forest 
Service and Interior have received substantial additional funding, 
they have not yet developed performance measures to determine the 
extent that these additional resources have resulted in more 
effective fire fighting as envisioned under the National Fire Plan&quot; 
(8). </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Drought Remains the Main Factor in the Intensity of a Wildfire 
Season: 
This is one of the driest years ever in parts of the West. As 
the Washington Post noted earlier this month: &quot;In a typical year, 
15 percent of the country might be experiencing drought. Now, more 
than 40 percent of the country is suffering&quot; (9). The Post article 
also reports on the link between drought and the largest fires so 
far this year: &quot;This spring was the driest in 107 years of 
data-gathering in Colorado, and the second-driest in Arizona and 
Southern California.&quot; </font></p>
