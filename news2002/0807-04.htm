<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - August 7 - The 
U.S. State Department has asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit against the 
Exxon Mobil Corporation for its alleged complicity in human rights violations 
in Indonesia, raising questions about the Bush administration's commitment to 
corporate responsibility, Human Rights Watch said today.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The civil suit, filed on 
June 11, 2001 in the District of Columbia, alleges that the Indonesian military 
provided &quot;security services&quot; for Exxon Mobil's joint venture in Indonesia's 
conflict-ridden Aceh province, and that the Indonesian military committed &quot;genocide, 
murder, torture, crimes against humanity, sexual violence and kidnapping&quot; 
while providing security for the company from 1999 to 2001. The plaintiff's claim 
that Exxon Mobil was aware of widespread abuses committed by the military but 
had failed to take any action to prevent them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the wake of business 
scandals involving Enron and WorldCom, among others, U.S. President George Bush 
has called for &quot;a new ethic of personal responsibility in the business world,&quot; 
arguing that Americans need &quot;confidence in the character and conduct of all 
of our business leaders.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Corporate responsibility shouldn't stop at the water's edge,&quot; said 
Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;If the Bush administration 
is serious about promoting ethical business practices, it shouldn't be trying 
to stop this court case from going forward.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch is not 
a party to the lawsuit and takes no position on claims regarding Exxon Mobil in 
Indonesia, but is deeply concerned that the State Department would request that 
the case be dismissed rather than taking a neutral position and allow the legal 
proceeding to run its course.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Background </b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The case was filed by the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF), a U.S. non-governmental 
organization, on behalf of eleven anonymous plaintiffs against Exxon Mobil in 
a U.S. Federal Court in the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs allege that Exxon 
Mobil violated the U.S. Alien Tort Claims Act, the Torture Victims Protection 
Act, international human rights law, and the statutory and common law of the District 
of Columbia. The suit held that Exxon Mobil was liable for the alleged abuses 
because it provided &quot;logistical and material&quot; support to the military. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Exxon Mobil vigorously denied the allegations and said the lawsuit &quot;recently 
filed by the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF) containing these allegations 
is without merit and designed to bring publicity to their organization.&quot; 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The company later petitioned U.S. District Court Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer, 
the presiding judge in the case, to solicit an opinion from the State Department 
whether this suit would have an adverse effect on U.S. foreign policy. On May 
10, Judge Oberdorfer sent a letter to the State Department requesting &quot;out 
of an abundance of caution, in the tense times in which we are living&#8230;whether 
the Department of State has an opinion (non-binding) as to whether adjudication 
of this case at this time would impact adversely on interests of the United States&quot; 
and seeks specifics about &quot;the nature and significance of that impact.&quot; 
The letter stated that the plaintiffs alleged that &quot;Exxon Mobil Corporation 
and various of its subsidiaries and affiliates ('Exxon') are legally responsible 
for human rights violations suffered by plaintiffs at the hands of an Indonesian 
Army unit engaged by Exxon to provide security for its Arun Project in Aceh, Indonesia.&quot; 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The State Department argued that the Indonesian government would view judicial 
scrutiny of the company's conduct as a referendum on the human rights record of 
the Indonesian armed forces, which would dissuade it from cooperating with the 
United States in counter terrorism. However, the State Department itself routinely 
criticizes the human rights record of the Indonesian military in its Country Reports 
on Human Rights Practices while maintaining diplomatic relations. Indeed, in its 
letter to Judge Oberdorfer, it condemned &quot;human rights abuses by elements 
of the Indonesian armed forces in locations such as Aceh.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The State Department could have issued a neutral opinion on the suit, but instead 
sided with Exxon Mobil and sent a response to Judge Oberdorfer on July 29, 2002 
arguing that the case should be dismissed. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The State Department also argued that the litigation's &quot;potential effects 
on Indonesia's economy could&#8230;adversely affect important United States interests&quot; 
and could impede further cooperation with U.S. companies. It said that continued 
business with U.S. companies would expose the Indonesian government and local 
companies to the highest business standards as another justification for dismissing 
the lawsuit, even though the suit could determine whether Exxon Mobil did follow 
acceptable business practices. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The administration can't simultaneously argue that U.S. companies impart 
the best business practices in Indonesia while trying to dismiss a case that could 
determine whether a U.S. company actually followed those practices,&quot; said 
Roth. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The State Department claimed 
that the suit may actually hurt progress on human rights in Indonesia. Indonesian 
human rights groups, however, fear that the State Department's letter will bolster 
and legitimize the Indonesian military's resistance to judicial scrutiny of abuses, 
especially in conjunction with the U.S. government's recent decision to resume 
limited military cooperation with Indonesia. Human Rights Watch has strongly criticized 
the resumption of U.S. military assistance because it could undermine efforts 
to strengthen civilian and judicial oversight of the military without clear conditions 
on human rights. (For more information see &quot;The Indonesian Military and Ongoing 
Abuses,&quot; a Human Rights Watch backgrounder, July 2002 available at: <a href="http://www.hrw.org//backgrounder/asia/indo-bck0702.htm" target="_new">www.hrw.org//backgrounder/asia/indo-bck0702.htm</a>). 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">State Department Undercuts Indonesian Peace, Judiciary </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The State Department's efforts to influence the case also undercuts credibility 
of U.S. efforts to promote an independent judiciary in Indonesia that is free 
of political interference. Ironically, when a suit by the Karaha Bodas Company, 
a joint-venture of two U.S. firms, against the Indonesia state energy firm, Pertamina, 
came up in talks with his counterpart last week in Jakarta, Colin Powell reportedly 
explained that the U.S. government does not interfere with ongoing court cases. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two weeks before the State Department sent its opinion to Judge Oberdorfer, 
Indonesia's Ambassador to the U.S., Soemadi DM Brotodiningrat, sent a strongly 
worded letter objecting to the lawsuit to Richard L. Armitage, the U.S. Deputy 
Secretary of State. Chillingly, the Ambassador noted that the lawsuit &quot;will 
definitely compromise the serious efforts of the Indonesian government to guarantee 
the safety of foreign investments, including in particular those from the United 
States.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ambassador's letter also warned that the suit would have an adverse impact 
on peace talks in Aceh that are &quot;at an extremely sensitive and delicate stage.&quot; 
However, the Indonesian security forces have increased military operations, proposed 
martial law, and arrested Acehnese peace negotiators since those negotiations 
began. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Instead of condemning the Indonesian government's threats against American 
investors and the Aceh peace process, the State Department has apparently buckled 
to them,&quot; Roth said. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In late June 2002, Exxon Mobil notified the State Department that it had joined 
the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights program that began in 2000 
and has been adopted by both the Clinton and Bush administrations. The program 
was developed by the State Department in conjunction with the British Foreign 
and Commonwealth Office, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, multinational 
oil and mining companies, and human rights organizations, including Human Rights 
Watch. According to the State Department, the program is designed to &quot;guide 
Companies in maintaining the safety and security of their operations within an 
operating framework that ensures respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.&quot; 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is the height of hypocrisy for the State Department to publicly promote 
human rights principles for the oil and gas industry and then tell a judge that 
scrutiny of an oil company's human rights record runs counter to foreign policy,&quot; 
said Roth. &quot;Apparently, principles only matter when they don't matter.&quot;
