- June 28 - At their quarterly meeting, the American Friends Service Committee 
(AFSC) Board of Directors approved a multi-year, three million dollar initiative 
designed to foster peace, reconciliation and economic development on the African 
continent.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The AFSC Africa Initiative explores new avenues for collaboration and cooperation 
to help lift the voice of Africans onto a global forum. The Initiative is designed 
to identify and directly address the most pressing and widespread challenges affecting 
the basic human rights of African people. Programs will focus on education and 
policy initiatives in the US and fostering systems of collaboration and empowerment 
in Central and Southern Africa - with targeted focus in East and West Africa.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Grounded in the principles of the Religious Society of Friends, AFSC works 
without regard to politics or religious affiliation, recognizing that all people 
have the basic, inalienable right to self-determination and human dignity.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AFSC employs peace makers from key areas of conflict throughout the world, 
including Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and other 
areas of Southern, Central and Eastern Africa. In its peacebuilding efforts in 
Africa, as in all its activities, AFSC seeks no easy answers, nor does it offer 
a predetermined or presupposed solution. Instead, the group offers a safe, impartial 
forum in which people of all races, creeds, religions, ethnicities, tribes, gender 
affiliations, abilities, social and economic backgrounds can come together to 
find common ground. AFSC works to allow regions in conflict to forge their own 
destinies and find the solutions that are uniquely right for their communities. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The AFSC Africa Initiative provides a forum for the diverse people of the African 
continent to rebuild a culture of peace and justice that fosters sustainable development. 
It supports:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; the rights of African people to utilize the continents resources for 
its own sustenance and development</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; holding the US government, corporations and multi-lateral institutions 
accountable and challenging exploitive methodology, policies and practices</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; cultivating a well-informed, diverse constituency that ensures justice 
and equity on the continent and helps shape US policy toward Africa</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A key programmatic thrust will be advocacy campaigns supporting the cancellation 
of Africa&#8217;s financial debt owed to the World Bank and International Monetary 
Fund (IMF), which has now reached crisis proportions. Additionally, the fight 
against HIV/AIDS and other critical health problems will be pivotal areas of concentration. 
Vital social and economic justice projects, including the case for reparations, 
eliminating child slavery and arms control are also integral parts of the venture. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">US-based projects include: The Africa: Peace with Justice Tour, which works 
to promote organized citizen action that will influence US. policy toward the 
nations of Africa. The next tour is scheduled for mid-October and will visit various 
locations in St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit and Dayton, Ohio in the Midwest. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AFSC regional offices in the South, the Great Lakes region, New England, the 
Pacific Northwest, the Pacific Mountain region and the Midwest will create local 
initiatives and long-term opportunities to impact US policy and decision making, 
while offering bridge-building opportunities - particularly among women and youth 
- in the US and Africa. Efforts will include a &#8216;people-to-people&#8217; 
cultural exchange for US and African youth, which is scheduled for September 2002.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Founded in 1917 to provide conscientious objectors with an opportunity to aid 
civilian victims during World War I, AFSC is grounded in Quaker beliefs respecting 
the dignity and worth of every person. In 1947, the AFSC and the British Friends 
Service Council received the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the Religious Society 
of Friends, for humanitarian service, work for reconciliation, and the spirit 
in which these were carried out. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AFSC has programs in the United States, and in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin 
America, and the Middle East that focus on issues related to economic justice, 
peace-building and demilitarization, social justice, and youth. The group has 
worked in varying capacities in the countries of Africa since the 1950s.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to the national center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and international 
offices throughout the world, AFSC has regional offices in Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, 
Maryland; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Des Moines, Iowa; New York 
City, New York; Pasadena and San Francisco, California; and Seattle, Washington.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The American Friends Service Committee is a Quaker organization that includes 
people of various faiths who are committed to social justice, peace and humanitarian 
service. Its work is based on the belief in the worth of every person and faith 
in the power of love to overcome violence and injustice.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Here are some of the realities of Africa:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; According to the UN, 33 of the world's 40 poorest countries are in 
Africa. Africa is the only continent on earth where both the number and proportion 
of people who are hungry is increasing. You cannot get poorer if you try.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; In 2000 life expectancy in Afghanistan was 43 years. Life expectancy 
in 9 African countries - Botswana, Burundi, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra 
Leone, Uganda Zambia, and Zimbabwe - falls well below that. It is within this 
climate that women and youth fight for basic human rights.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; Africa's colonial, post-colonial and neocolonial history is simple: 
extraction. Whether it&#8217;s human cargo shipped off to the global West - enslaved 
- to fuel 15th and 16th Century European emergence from feudalism, or minerals 
to fuel the industrial revolution, Africa&#8217;s voice is simply not heard.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; The first tragic stories of AIDS did not come from Africa. However, 
its finale, played out in massive destruction of African lives, will be staged 
in Africa. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; Oil and diamonds circulate through Angola&#8217;s shipping port without 
money touching its soil or benefiting its people. The world remains helpless in 
affecting its 40-year war. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; Seven African countries go to war in Congo - Africa&#8217;s first World 
War and only those who arm the warring factions seem to care. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ordinary people of the world remain largely oblivious of the facts and realities 
of Africa. Western media ignored their governments historic roles in the unrest 
and stood by as nearly a million people in Rwanda were massacred within three 
months.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">US public policy does not serve Africa. Even sympathetic government responses 
are largely focused on trade beneficial to the US or that offer US government-prescribed 
solutions. Often these solutions are based on misinformation, misunderstanding 
and misguided assumptions about Africa, Africans and people of African descent.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AFSC&#8217;s Africa Initiative seeks to stand with Africa and its people, fighting 
for the basic rights to self-determination, economic justice, equity and human 
dignity.</font></p>
