- April 30 - An ad hoc coalition of
people of faith and leaders in the religious community today called
on President George Bush to release the full $34 million appropriated
for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for Fiscal Year 2002.
In a letter to the president, 136 religious leaders from 31 countries
said, "As a UN agency, UNFPA is vital to the reproductive health
needs of women, men and their families by providing life-saving
services such as family planning, and HIV/AIDS prevention, counseling
and services to people living in developing countries around the
world. As people of faith, we understand that women and men must
have access to information and services so they can act morally and
responsibly in their sexual behavior. Highly respected religious
leaders have supported modern family planning as a moral good."
<p>The letter, which was signed by Buddhists, Christians, Muslims,
Hindus and Jews, went on to note that, "We believe that UNFPA has
been unequivocally committed to providing informed and voluntary
family planning. The agency has used, and continues to use, its
stature as a UN agency to help governments, like China, to move more
and more towards respect for the rights of women and men to decide
for themselves on the number and spacing of their children and to
move away from draconian practices."
<p>"In the Catholic tradition, caring for the poor and marginalized
is a key social teaching. Too often, this value is neglected when
conservative Catholic leaders lobby to cut off family planning
services or funding. The Catholic leaders who have signed this letter
to President Bush know that you can be Catholic and support family
planning and they know that women's and children's lives are saved
when voluntary family planning is available," said Frances Kissling,
president of Catholics for a Free Choice in Washington, D.C.
<p>"For Muslim women, family planning is key to their empowerment,
and their ability to live responsible Muslim lives," said Zainah
Anwar, executive director, Sisters In Islam, Malaysia.
<p>"I understand President Bush's concern about abortion, but every
dollar spent on family planning means less illegal, unsafe abortion.
Denying UNFPA funding causes more harm than good, in that it means
less contraception, producing more unwanted pregnancies and therefore
more abortions," said the Rev. Dr. James Martin-Schramm, associate
professor of Religion at Luther College in Decorah, IA.

<br>LETTER FOLLOWS
<p>President George W. Bush
<br>The White House
<br>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
<br>Washington, DC 20500
<p>Dear President Bush,
<p>As people of faith and leaders in the religious community, we are
deeply concerned that you are considering defunding the United
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). We urge you to release the full
appropriation of $34 million for the UNFPA in the Fiscal Year 2002
Budget. Religious leaders actively supported the founding of the UN
and continue to believe that the UN and its agencies are critical
vehicles for world peace and justice. We recognize the importance of
the United Nations in providing the world with humanitarian
assistance, especially to those living in developing countries. As
a
UN agency, UNFPA is vital to the reproductive health needs of women,
men and their families by providing life-saving services such as
family planning, and HIV/AIDS prevention, counseling and services to
people living in developing countries around the world.
<p>As people of faith, we understand that women and men must have
access to information and services so they can act morally and
responsibly in their sexual behavior. Highly respected religious
leaders have supported modern family planning as a moral good.
<p>The Dalai Lama has said that "family planning is crucial,
especially in the developing world." Anglican Bishop Desmund Tutu
stated, "Planned parenthood is an obligation of those who are
Christians. Our church thinks we should use scientific methods that
assist in planning families."
<p>As people of faith we oppose any coercive measures in reproductive
health. We believe that UNFPA has been unequivocally committed to
providing informed and voluntary family planning. The agency has
used, and continues to use, its stature as a UN agency to help
governments, like China, to move more and more towards respect for
the rights of women and men to decide for themselves on the number
and spacing of their children and to move away from draconian
practices. The agency deserves and needs your support.
<p>Again, we respectfully urge you to respond with compassion and
provide $34 million for the UNFPA to help them promote the health and
well-being of women and families around the world.
<p>Sincerely,
