- September 5 - Serious human rights violations have occurred as a consequence 
of the UK authorities' response to the 11 September attacks in the USA, states 
Amnesty International's report &quot;Rights denied: the UK's response to 11 September 
2001&quot; released today.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report denounces the treatment and conditions of detention of those detained 
in the aftermath of the events of 11 September. Detainees have been subjected 
to &quot;small-group isolation&quot;; and continue to be held in 22-hour-a-day 
lock-up. They have not received adequate health care and their right to religious 
exercise was limited. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The regime under which 
detainees are held can lead to a serious physical and mental deterioration of 
their health which, in turn, could undermine their capacity to prepare their defense,&quot; 
said Livio Zilli, Amnesty International's researcher on the UK.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Detainees were denied prompt access to a solicitor. Upon their arrest and detention 
at Belmarsh Prison all of them were refused permission to make telephone calls 
to solicitors, whether they had pre-existing solicitors or not. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The detainees' contact with relatives and the outside world has been severely 
impeded. Social visits with relatives are tape-recorded and have a prison officer 
present despite, in some instances, a glass screen separating the detainee from 
visitors. Detainees stated that they were strip-searched before and after every 
visit. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Initially, detainees were only allowed to communicate with family members in 
English or through an interpreter. On one occasion, a detainee complained that 
his visit could not proceed unless English only was spoken because his interpreter 
was not being admitted to the unit as she was refusing to remove her headscarf. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As of 17 July 2002, none of those detained under the Anti-terrorism, Crime 
and Security Act 2001 (ATCSA) had been interviewed by the UK authorities. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The government has effectively created a shadow justice system devoid 
of the crucial components and safeguards present in the criminal justice system,&quot; 
said Livio Zilli. Amnesty International is today presenting a Memorandum to the 
UK Government urging it to address these deficiencies.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The case of the Algerian Lotfi Raissi is a powerful illustration that 
in the search for 'suspected terrorists' innocent people can get caught up -- 
violating their rights and those of their relatives to liberty and livelihood,&quot; 
said Livio Zilli.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lotfi Raissi was arrested and detained for five months in Belmarsh high security 
prison, after the US authorities sought his extradition on the basis of suspicions 
concerning his involvement in the 11 September attacks. The extradition proceedings 
were brought to an end seven months later after the presiding judge ruled that 
he had received no evidence to support the US claims. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The US authorities' reasons for seeking Lotfi Raissi's extradition included 
the fact that his identity and profession fit a certain profile: an Algerian man 
and a Muslim, a pilot and a flight instructor in the USA,&quot; said Livio Zilli.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amnesty International received confirmation from the UK authorities in May, 
that seven UK nationals were being detained in Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba. The 
authorities also confirmed that the men had twice been &quot;visited&quot; by 
UK officials, including some from MI5 and that they had been interviewed in relation 
to issues relevant to the UK's national security. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The UK authorities have failed to make representations to protect the rights 
of their nationals being held in Guant&aacute;namo, where they are denied prisoner 
of war status. In particular, Amnesty International is concerned that detainees, 
including UK nationals, have been denied access to legal counsel during questioning 
by US and UK intelligence officers. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The defense of human 
rights begins at home. The UK authorities' real commitment to human rights is 
now being put to the test,&quot; Livio Zilli concluded.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eleven people have been detained without charge or trial, for an unspecified 
and potentially unlimited period of time, following their certification by the 
Secretary of State as &quot;suspected international terrorists&quot; under the 
ATCSA. The certification is based on secret information, which has not been disclosed 
to the detainees and which cannot be effectively challenged by them or by lawyers 
of their choice. At least another 25 people have been reportedly arrested under 
the Terrorism Act 2000, some of whom have been released without charge. The UK 
authorities have also detained a number of individuals on extradition warrants 
received from other governments, including the French and the US authorities.</font></p>
