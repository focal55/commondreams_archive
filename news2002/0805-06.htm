- August 5 - Candidates and other members of the Green Party of the United States 
reacted angrily to the recent 64-34 vote in the Democrat-controlled Senate to 
grant the President Bush 'Fast Track' authority to make trade deals with minimal 
congressional involvement. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Votes from Democrats in the House and Senate helped put Fast Track over 
the top, giving Bush free rein to expand free trade pacts like NAFTA and allow 
corporations greater power to violate environmental, labor, and human rights protections,&quot; 
said Joseph A. Fortunato, Green candidate for the 8th Congressional District in 
New Jersey. &quot;Green candidates are making this a campaign issue.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The GOP and a core of Democrats have surrendered unprecedented power 
to President Bush and to corporations,&quot; added Dr. Jonathan Farley, Tennessee 
Green Party candidate for Congress. &quot;So what's the response from the New 
Democrats in the Democratic Leadership Council? Retreat!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, Green candidates are running for seats in Congress united behind 
a 'Green Commitment' to &quot;meet the needs of our families, our communities, 
our nation and our planet.&quot; The Commitment, which rejects the compromising 
influence of corporate PAC money and affirms various social and environmental 
justice positions, was first announced publicly on July 19 at the party's national 
2002 Midterm Convention in Philadelphia. The text of the Green Commitment is appended 
below.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The issues covered in the Green Commitment are issues trivialized by 
both the Democrats and the Republicans,&quot; said Elizabeth Shanklin, Green candidate 
for the House in New York's 18th Congressional District.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Carl Mayer, running in New Jersey's 12th District, agreed, noting that &quot;The 
Democrats and Republicans represent Wall Street, and the Green Party represents 
Main Street.&quot; The Green congressional candidates are among 407 total U.S. 
Green candidates in 2002, 120 more than the 287 who ran in 2000.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sen. Joe Lieberman (D.-Conn.), speaking at a convention of the Democratic Leadership 
Council (DLC) in New York on July 28, regretted Al Gore's already feeble defense 
of working people in 2000, and warned Democrats not to risk the support of business 
by making corporate crime a campaign issue.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There was once a rumor that the Democrats were the party of working people, 
but Sen. Lieberman has proven it unfounded,&quot; said Vivian Houghton, Green 
Party of Delaware candidate for Delaware Attorney General. &quot;Sen. Lieberman 
confirms all suspicions that his party, under the influence of the DLC, has little 
regard for workers across the U.S., as well as small investors and anyone with 
a retirement plan. Lieberman has declared that the 'economic class conflict' of 
holding corporations accountable is off-limits for Dems.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The effect of the Democrats' march to the right is that they've given 
Republicans an excuse for greater extremism,&quot; said Steve Greenfield, Green 
candidate for the 22nd District in New York. &quot;The result is that Richard 
Nixon looks like a flaming liberal next to Clinton, Gore, Lieberman, and Democratic 
Party chair Terry McAuliffe. That's a historical imperative for Green candidates 
to run and win, and for a pledge like the Green Commitment.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> THE GREEN COMMITMENT</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Announced Friday, July 
19, 2002 at the 2002 Midterm Convention of the Green Party of the United States, 
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today the Green Party candidates for the United States Congress announce the 
Green Commitment to America to meet the needs of our families, our communities, 
our nation and our planet. We promise to work for a clean economy, a safe environment, 
and a strong democracy. We will not accept contributions from corporate PACs. 
We will run our campaigns with integrity, and will unwaveringly promote issues 
supported by the American people but trivialized by the other parties:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*** Security through peace and justice. Crimes against humanity must be dealt 
with swiftly and justly, in accord with international law and without violating 
or curtailing civil rights. Peace will be attained through diplomacy, commitment 
to human rights, and by reducing the gulf between the rich and the poor. The Patriot 
Act must go, and a Department of Peace must be created. We will end weapons sales 
to repressive governments, and will demand compliance with UN resolutions as a 
starting point for peace negotiations.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*** Health care coverage for all Americans. That so many Americans remain uninsured 
is intolerable in the most medically and economically advanced nation in the world. 
An uninsured person is far more likely to die than someone with health care coverage, 
at any age. The Greens' single payer universal health care plan will not only 
provide care for all: it will save money and save lives. Provide full funding 
for, and guarantee access to, all reproductive health and family planning services.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*** Restoration of democracy. Allow a voice for all people, understanding that 
corporations are not people! Provide public campaign financing and access of third 
parties to government, by revising election laws and implementing Instant Runoff 
Voting and Proportional Representation. Enforce the Voting Rights Act; end election 
fraud.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*** Energy independence. Turn the tide of global warming and assure a safe, 
uninterrupted supply of energy by drastically reducing fossil fuel use and supporting 
production of decentralized, renewable energy sources. Fund the rapid shutdown 
of nuclear power plants; include funds for retraining displaced workers. Jump-start 
the renewables market through investment policies. Restore conservation measures, 
including meaningful automobile fuel efficiency standards.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*** Corporate reform. Mandate corporate accountability. End corporate personhood. 
Get a fair share of taxes from corporations and stop corporate flight to off-shore 
tax havens. End corporate welfare as we know it. Eliminate trade treaties like 
GATT, NAFTA, and FTAA: they are abominations that undermine national sovereignty. 
Implement new treaties that protect communities, business, labor, the environment, 
and national sovereignty. Require rigorous clinical safety and environmental impact 
testing of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*** Fair trade, fair labor. Abolish slave labor and the corporate practice 
of paying sub-poverty level wages. Refuse trade where sweatshop or prison labor 
is involved. Protect workers' right to organize; repeal Taft-Hartley. Reform the 
tax code to promote sustainable productivity. Tax unearned wealth before income. 
Develop jobs programs and an inviolable social safety net to protect people during 
low points in the economic cycle.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*** Preventive social spending and policies. End the failed War on Drugs and 
fund prevention and treatment. Fund public education for all, including vocational 
and post-secondary schooling. Provide equal opportunity for minorities and women. 
Abolish the death penalty. Make restitution to historically oppressed groups by 
providing funding for infrastructure in minority neighborhoods and by committing 
to eradicating institutionalized racism. Bring back the Equal Rights Amendment. 
Protect a woman's right to control her own body.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*** Preventive foreign spending and policies. No trillion dollar first-strike 
space weapons; no more nonfunctioning helicopters. Drastically reduce the military 
budget, eliminating all expenditures for offensive weapons. Allocate a portion 
of the savings to relieve debt in developing countries. Commit our funds to humanitarian, 
not military aid.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*** Support for small businesses and family farms. Rewrite corporate charters. 
Promote local development in order to ensure long-term economic health. Replace 
petrochemical-based fertilizers with organics, to protect our water supply from 
toxic runoffs. Ban use of genetically modified agricultural products. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Survival of the planet. Sign the Kyoto protocol, and adhere to it. Strengthen 
and enforce environmental regulations. Restore the Clean Air Act standards on 
coal-generating emissions. Fund studies to identify, and eliminate, the environmental 
causes of cancer. Fully fund the Toxic Waste Superfund through renewed corporate 
taxation. Ensure the health of the planet for survival's sake, and to ensure the 
health of human beings today. Outlaw patenting of genetically engineered life 
forms. Include pollution remediation costs in production costs (&quot;eco-taxing&quot;), 
and phase out non-sustainable production. Repeal the Price-Anderson Act. </font></p>
