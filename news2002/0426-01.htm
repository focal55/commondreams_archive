- April 26 - <i>Following is an
open letter from National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association
President Robert Dodge:
</i>
<p>Dear Fellow Journalist:
<p>The continuing scandal surrounding sexual abuse of children and
youths by Catholic priests is a complex story that troubles our
readers and viewers. And it has presented numerous challenges for
journalists. Much reporting has risen to the occasion and delivered
sophisticated and informed coverage on this complex, evolving
story.
<p>Unfortunately, much coverage still falls far short. At the
National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association, we are concerned
about the integrity of this reporting because our mission within
the news industry is to foster fair and accurate coverage of the
gay and lesbian community. Reports in recent weeks have included
some of the most unfair and distorted portrayals of gay men in
decades, lacking balance and alternative voices.
<p>Recent reports about the American cardinals meeting with Pope
John Paul II, for example, once again quote Catholic Church
officials who cast gay men as emotionally disturbed, link our
community with pedophilia, and fail to include other credible
sources with opposing opinions.
<p>As journalists and leaders of NLGJA, we acknowledge our job to
report assertions by Catholic officials that the presence of gay
clergy has resulted in sexual abuse cases, as well as stated
beliefs that link pedophilia and gay men. However, if similar
statements were made about other minority and stigmatized groups,
reporters and editors would feel obliged to find sources to
challenge those allegations. NLGJA urges that the same professional
standards be applied to stories concerning gays and lesbians.
<p>Coverage of the cardinals' meeting offered a number of examples
of how we in the news media can do better.
<p>First, stories quote Bishop Wilton Gregory stating that gay men
are not "psychologically, emotionally, spiritually, intellectually"
fit to be priests. Should journalists let statements like that
about gay men stand unchallenged when they would not do so if
similar remarks were made about another minority group? Why was the
cardinal not challenged on this point, or attempts made to seek
credible sources and data to question that statement?
<p>Second, Cardinal Adam Maida said that behavioral scientists tell
the Church this is "a homosexual-type problem." Who are these
behavioral scientists? What are their credentials? If your
reporters quoted a source that linked low academic test scores to
race, all of us would expect them to ask these obligatory follow-up
questions.
<p>Additional reporting may have revealed that the Catholic Church
does not have a problem with pedophiles. Instead, it may be one of
ephebophiles, or individuals exclusively attracted to adolescents.
More reporting might have turned up Dr. Fred S. Berlin, associate
professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University. In a statement
that offered substantial balance and context, Dr. Berlin recently
educated The New York Times readers that: "...We should make it
clear that homosexuals are no more risk to children than
heterosexuals. In terms of the bigger picture, there are every bit
as many heterosexual men giving into sexual temptation with female
adolescents."
<p>When news organizations cover instances of sexual abuse by
heterosexual adults against children of the opposite sex, they are
not cast as stories about sexual orientation. They are accurately
reported as crimes against children. Without including balancing
comment in the Catholic Church story, news organizations allow
themselves to be spun by church officials who appear more
interested in deflecting responsibility for these crimes.
<p>News coverage about the sex abuse scandal in the Catholic Church
has done more to link gay men with pedophilia than any story in
decades. Without balance, expert inquiry and opposing views, such
charges can create long-lasting and inaccurate ideas that will
damage the lives of gay and lesbian people for decades. As
journalists we owe it to our readers and viewers to uphold a basic
practice of our profession: Get all sides of the story.
<p>Sincerely,
<p>Robert Dodge
NLGJA President
