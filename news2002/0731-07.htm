WV - July 31 - Seven citizen groups working on coal mining issues turned down 
an invitation to meet here for a half hour Thursday with Department of Interior 
(DOI) Secretary Gale Norton. The Office of Surface Mining (OSM), a bureau of DOI, 
intends to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the passage of the federal Surface 
Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) Thursday.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;We respectfully decline to let our organizations be used in what would 
be mostly a public relations gimmick so the Bush administration can pretend it 
has cooperated with environmental groups,&#8221; said Frank Young, president of 
the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy. &#8220;SMCRA was enacted in 1977 and 
since then state and federal agencies have failed to implement the law.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wednesday, representatives of the Coal River Mountain Watch, Ohio Valley Environmental 
Coalition, West Virginia Citizen Action Group, West Virginia Environmental Council, 
West Virginia Highlands Conservancy and West Virginia Rivers Coalition and the 
national group Citizens Coal Council signed and faxed a four and a half page letter 
to Norton explaining why they would not meet with her in Charleston Thursday. 
They did invite her to instead come to the southern coalfields for a longer meeting 
with residents affected by mountaintop removal / valley fill coal mining.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;As a life long resident of the Appalachian coalfields, from a family 
with 6 generations here, I am insulted by Norton&#8217;s offer of a 30 minute 
meeting. We are talking about our lives, our property and our children&#8217;s 
future,&#8221; said Julia Bonds, director of Coal River Mountain Watch. &#8220;Given 
the past, recent and, no doubt, future flooding that we can link to mountaintop 
removal, we certainly deserve better. It would take me an hour just to drive to 
Charleston. If she really wants to learn about the horrifying effects of mountaintop 
removal, she really should come to us&#8212;and give us a little more notice before 
she expects us to meet with her.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;A thirty-minute meeting is an insult to my family,&#8221; said Bill 
Price of Clear Fork in Raleigh County. &#8220;Where was Ms. Norton last year when 
the floodwaters were at the front steps of my house? Where was Ms. Norton two 
weeks ago when the town of Lyburn was devastated by a valley fill slide and sediment 
pond overflow? As far as I am concerned, if she can&#8217;t meet us here and see 
what is happening to us, she might as well stay in DC and explain how she can 
have a Cabinet position charged with enforcing SMCRA, when she is on record as 
saying that SMCRA is unconstitutional.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The groups&#8217; letter said, &#8220;It has been well publicized that, prior 
to your appointment to head the DOI, you maintained that SMCRA was unconstitutional. 
Many of our members have suffered immense hardship for over two decades because 
SMCRA has gone essentially un-enforced&#8230;</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Now, the DOI, under your leadership, is bent upon weakening SMCRA. 
It is frankly a distasteful proposition to us to help you commemorate 25 years 
of slack enforcement of SMCRA, especially given your push to gut portions of SMCRA 
and your previous public stance on the Act itself.&#8221; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the groups faxed their letter, OSM officials called offering to extend 
the meeting to two and a half hours. Officials also told the groups that they 
had not meant to tie the meeting to the SMCRA anniversary.</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Whether or not Ms. Norton planned to promote her requested visit with 
us as part of OSM&#8217;s commemoration of SMCRA, meeting with her on this day, 
and for such a short time period, is completely unacceptable to all of us,&#8221; 
said Vivian Stockman, outreach coordinator with the Huntington, W. Va.-based Ohio 
Valley Environmental Coalition. &#8220;We sincerely want to meet with her, but 
we want to meet in the coalfields where we can show her first hand the destructive 
effects of her policies.&#8221; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The West Virginia Highlands Conservancy and, no doubt, all the groups 
who declined to visit with Ms. Norton Thursday stand ready to engage in good faith 
discussions with federal or state officials on coal issues, but only if the objective 
is constructive movement toward implementing the law, not political staging,&#8221; 
Young said. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The groups&#8217; letter contained a long list of grievances with the coal 
industry&#8217;s &#8220;excesses&#8221; and government regulators&#8217; failure 
to enforce coal-mining laws.</font></p>

1849 C. Street N.W.<br>
Washington, DC 20240</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Secretary Norton:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We appreciate your offer, conveyed to us via Roger Calhoun, director of the 
Charleston field office of the federal Office of Surface Mining (OSM), to meet 
with West Virginia citizens&#8217; groups that are active on coal mining issues. 
The offer, as we understood it, was that you would meet with us on Thursday, August 
1 at 9 a.m. for 30 minutes at a facility in Coonskin Park in Charleston. We understood 
that you would also fly over mountaintop removal sites with representatives from 
the Army Corps of Engineers, presumably from the Huntington District.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We must decline to meet with you at this time for the reasons cited below. 
However, we do extend to you an invitation to meet with coalfield residents, in 
the coalfields, as soon as can be arranged. We would expect that meeting, complete 
with ground tours of impacted areas, would take, at the very minimum, half a day. 
After his tour of a mountaintop removal equipment manufacturer&#8217;s facilities 
near Charleston, we extended to the President an invitation to visit the southern 
coalfields, but our request was turned down, because, we were told, the president 
was too busy. He did however visit West Virginia again on July 4th, but not the 
coalfields. Perhaps, given your interest in meeting with us, you can visit with 
coalfield resident leaders, in the coalfields, on behalf of the President.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, we cannot meet with you in Charleston on August 1. Thirty minutes is simply 
not enough time for us to explain to you the day-to-day perils of living in the 
shadow of mountaintop removal operations. Additionally, we cannot meet with you 
on that day because the OSM, which you administer as Secretary of the Department 
of Interior (DOI), has chosen August 1 as the day it will commemorate the 25th 
anniversary of the federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has been well publicized that, prior to your appointment to head the DOI, 
you maintained that SMCRA was unconstitutional. Many of our members have suffered 
immense hardship for over two decades because SMCRA has gone essentially un-enforced. 
Still, SMCRA and other laws that ought to rein in the excesses of the coal mining 
industry have afforded citizens the opportunity to attempt to force regulators 
to regulate, and to attempt to force the coal industry to obey laws written to 
protect the health and safety of people everywhere.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, the DOI, under your leadership, is bent upon weakening SMCRA. It is frankly 
a distasteful proposition to us to help you commemorate 25 years of slack enforcement 
of SMCRA, especially given your push to gut portions of SMCRA and your previous 
public stance on the Act itself. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For instance, the Bush administration proposes to remove the buffer from the 
buffer zone rule of SMCRA, a rule that currently says that no land within 100 
feet of a perennial stream or an intermittent stream shall be disturbed by surface 
mining activities. If you should decide to meet with us in the coalfields, you 
will see that this law is not well enforced, to state it politely. Yet, you would 
codify the outlaw behavior of the coal industry by eliminating this protection 
for both citizens and our life support system, that is, the environment.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A citizen lawsuit brought about because of the lax enforcement of coal mining 
laws forced state and federal agencies to undertake an Environmental Impact Statement 
(EIS) on mountaintop removal. Thanks to a Freedom of Information request from 
the Charleston Gazette, citizens have access to the draft of this endlessly delayed 
EIS. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you should know, in West Virginia alone, at least 1,000 miles of our biologically 
crucial headwater streams have been forever obliterated by valley fills. Already, 
nearly 400,000 acres of the world&#8217;s most diverse temperate hardwood forests 
have been permitted for strip mining operations. Our communities and mountain 
lifestyles are in danger of extinction. The draft EIS shows that regulators expect 
mountaintop removal to destroy nearly 230,000 additional acres of our mountains 
and valleys. The study points out that many more miles of streams will be buried 
by valley fills, that streams not already buried could be seriously polluted, 
and that wildlife such as fish and songbirds in our biologically diverse area 
will likely be lost.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to conclusions in the draft EIS, &#8220;Mountaintop (removal) mining 
operations in the Appalachian coalfields involve fundamental changes to the region&#8217;s 
landscape and terrestrial wildlife habitats. With the increasing size of these 
operations, a single permit may involve changing thousands of acres of hardwood 
forest into grassland.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;While the original forest habitat was crossed by flowing streams and 
was comprised of steep slopes with microhabitats determined by slope, aspect and 
moisture regimes, the reclaimed mines are often limited in topographic relief, 
devoid of flowing water, and most commonly dominated by erosion-controlling, herbaceous 
communities.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We add that the converted herbaceous communities usually include non-native 
grasses that have further detrimental effects on ecosystems. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You have ignored the warnings of one of your agencies, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, which state that &#8220;tremendous destruction of aquatic and terrestrial 
habitat&#8221; is already occurring as a result of mountaintop removal. Instead 
of following the true intent of the EIS, which was to seriously study and document 
the numerous social and environmental impacts of mountaintop removal, you have 
promoted the notion that the EIS should be used as a vehicle to centralize and 
streamline the permitting process.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The draft EIS shows us that OSM under DOI envisions one-stop shopping for SMCRA 
and Clean Water Act laws. We implore you to visit, on the ground, the result of 
the current permitting process. Southern West Virginia and eastern Kentucky have 
become the nation&#8217;s energy sacrifice zones. Why then would you speed up 
the permitting process?</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The EIS studies suggest that variances for post mining land use (PMLU) requirements 
(variances from the requirements to return the land to a condition capable of 
supporting its prior use) are not happening as was envisioned. Apparently there 
are in place mechanisms that would ensure that PMLU occurs as envisioned. Unfortunately, 
OSM recommends deleting these actions from further consideration in the draft 
EIS!</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps you could explain this pretzel logic to us upon your visit to the coalfields.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, your participation in the administration&#8217;s push for a Clean 
Water Act rule change on the definition of &#8220;fill&#8221; is of grave concern 
to us. With this rule change, the administration is rewarding the outlaw behavior 
of the coal industry, and is attempting to legalize what are currently illegal 
valley fills at mountaintop removal operations. You essentially maintain that 
massive valley fills have minimal impact on the environment, including human communities. 
We, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, beg to differ. Take just the latest 
valley fill disaster on July 19, 2002. According to the West Virginia Department 
of Environmental Protection (DEP), this particular valley fill is about 900 feet 
high and 2,000 feet long.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An early morning thunderstorm (3 to 3 1/2 inches during a three-hour period) 
brought disaster to the little community of Winding Shoals Hollow at Lyburn in 
Logan Co., WV. Huge, rain-saturated chunks of a giant valley fill at Bandmill 
Coal Corp., owned by Massey Energy, cleaved away from the valley fill and crashed 
into a sediment pond below. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The falling debris completely filled the sediment pond, causing it to overflow 
and send a tidal wave of sediment-laden water churning down Winding Shoals Hollow, 
destroying two homes, damaging about ten others and hurtling 8-10 vehicles downstream. 
No one was killed, though there were some narrow escapes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is just one incident. In earlier floods in 2001 and 2002 people were killed 
and more homes, bridges, roads and schools were destroyed. The DEP (plus, as shown 
in a study within the draft EIS, both OSM and the Army Corps of Engineers) has 
concluded that mountaintop removal / valley fill coal mining has increased rainwater 
runoff, thereby exacerbating flooding. Minimal impact these valley fills are not. 
The rule change the administration has enacted is completely contrary to the intent 
of the Clean Water Act.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You also envision delegating MORE regulatory authority to the states. Incredibly, 
now that the &#8220;fill&#8221; rule change is finalized, you want to turn over 
to the states this aspect of permitting mountaintop removal operations. Surely 
you know that for West Virginia, where politicians have longed been controlled 
by the coal industry, this would mean a warp-speed increase to the ecocide that 
is mountaintop removal. Lax as it has been, the federal government has offered 
us some enforcement help. Sadly and regrettably, you would strip us of even this 
flimsy safeguard for our property and our lives.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The list of grievances with the failure of SMCRA and other laws and your push 
to further weaken these laws goes on and on and includes the following:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush Administration capitulation and ties to fossil fuel industries, including 
the appointment of Stephen Griles to the DOI; <br>
The failure of state government to adequately rein in the excesses of the coal 
industry; <br>
Blasting damages to homes and wells from mountaintop removal operations; <br>
Failure to control coal and rock dust, which threatens human health; <br>
Declining mining employment versus record levels of coal extraction; <br>
Increased flooding due to increased runoff from mountaintop removal operations 
and the toll on lives and property associated with increased flooding; <br>
Dangerously incorrect and inadequate mapping of underground mines which, as we 
have just seen, have serious implications in terms of miners&#8217; safety as 
well as in terms of the safety of the 136 coal sludge impoundments across West 
Virginia; <br>
OSM&#8217;s approval of West Virginia&#8217;s inadequate bonding system; <br>
Mountaintop removal&#8217;s destruction to hardwood and herbaceous understory 
ecosystems, resulting in future loses of revenue and societal enjoyment; <br>
Current and future impacts to the entire hydrologic cycle&#8212;from surface water 
to groundwater loss and ruination, including sedimentation and runoff control 
issues, the failure to address cumulative hydrological impacts of strip mining 
activities, and the associated loss of current and future revenues related to 
use and enjoyment of waters; <br>
The DOI&#8217;s ecocidal denial of water&#8217;s incredible value to our very 
lives; <br>
The coal industry&#8217;s failure to carry on contemporaneous &#8220;reclamation;&#8221; 
<br>
The coal industry&#8217;s failure to &#8220;develop&#8221; at least 98 percent 
of strip-mined areas.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, if you do in fact flyover mountaintop removal operations, you 
apparently will do so with the Army Corps of Engineers as your guide. The Corps 
is the very same agency that has publicly stated it &#8220;oozed&#8221; into issuing 
404 permits for valley fills. The Corps is the agency that suggests razing the 
most biologically diverse temperate forests on earth, blowing up mountains and 
then dumping the rubble into streams has only a &#8220;minimal&#8221; adverse 
impact on the environment. We suggest you need a different guide and also, we 
request that a representative chosen by our organizations would accompany you 
on your flyover.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As residents of the West Virginia coalfields who are greatly harmed by mountaintop 
removal / valley fill coal mining, and as representatives of organizations working 
in these areas, we invite you to visit us in the affected areas. We implore you 
to see first-hand the devastation from mountaintop removal &#8212; including the 
aftermath of recent catastrophic floods in West Virginia and the massive coal 
slurry impoundment spill in Kentucky in 2000. To arrange a visit please contact 
any of the undersigned through the OVEC office at 304-522-0246. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We feel confident that in view of the scope of the risks to coalfield residents 
and the scale of the destruction at hand, it would be insufficient for you to 
allow only a half hour to meet with us in Charleston, especially on the day the 
DOI will commemorate the 25th anniversary SMCRA.</font></p>
