- September 15 - I want to thank you for the traditional Iraqi hospitality
that our delegation has received since coming to Baghdad.</p>
<P>We are all aware of the grave crisis presently facing our
two countries, the United States and Iraq. I am concerned about the effects
that a new war would have on both our countries. For that reason I come as an
advocate of peace through dialogue.</p>
<P>Ours is a humanitarian mission. I come, not as the Secretary
of State, and not as a weapons inspector, but as a member of Congress concerned
with peace. Basically, I want America and Iraq to give peace a chance.</p>
<P>A few days ago, the former head of the United Nations
oil-for-food program, Denis Halliday, commented on the independent American
delegation of which I am a part. Mr. Halliday is a former UN Assistant
Secretary General. On September 12, he said: "Any dialogue between the
U.S. and Iraq is good and, with current and former lawmakers, it is even
better." Mr. Halliday added: "Open-minded dialogue would prove war to
be unnecessary."</p>
<P>Instead of assuming that war must come, let us find ways to
discover how to prove that war is unnecessary.</p>
<P>A key to this terrible box that we're now locked in -- is
dialogue.</p>
<P>I would also like to quote Edward Peck, an American diplomat
who is a former chief of mission to Iraq. Mr. Peck pointed out: "You lose
nothing when you talk, but the failure to do so in this case may cost us
dear(ly)."</p>
<P>Mr. Peck encouraged this delegation from the United States,
which includes: former United States Senator James Abourezk; James Jennings,
president of Conscience International; and Norman Solomon, executive director
of the Institute for Public Accuracy.</p>
<P>We are here to try and help open doors. Doors to genuine
dialogue.</p>
<P>It is time and, in my opinion, far past time that American
and Iraqi officials talk to each other without threats.</p>
<P>We want to open doors to possibilities that will protect
life instead of maiming and killing.</p>
<P>Doors that will give peace a chance.</p>
<P>We've had far too much heated rhetoric between our two
countries. Another war in this region would be greatly damaging. Any new war
would be a war against public health, and also against the environment.</p>
<P>Iraq is the cradle of civilization. We do not wish to see
civilization strangled in its cradle.</p>
<P>Iraq was once the Garden of Eden. Humanity must not turn the
Garden of Eden into Hell.</p>
<P>The evidence from the last war is quite compelling:</p>
<P>-- degradation of the infrastructure;<BR>
-- a wrecked economy;<BR>
-- shocking escalation of infant mortality and communicable disease, and many other negative health indicators for the entire population.</p>
<P>We do not wish to see this devastation repeated.</p>
<P>In this context, I am reminded of what Dwight Eisenhower,
the great U.S. general and president, once said: "Every gun and rocket
that is fired, every warship launched, signifies, in a final sense, a theft
from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.
The world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its
laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children."</p>
<P>Our delegation does not want to see a new war in Iraq. We do
not subscribe to the "Clash of Civilizations" thesis which foresees
nothing but war between the predominantly Islamic countries and the West.</p>
<P>I hope that my colleagues in the United States Congress will
perceive that peaceful dialogue is a more fruitful avenue than the awful road
of perpetual warfare.</p>
<P>I must say, however, that I believe the first step to
restoring a relationship of mutual friendship and respect must be for Iraq to
fully comply with United Nations mandates by allowing the return of weapons
inspectors. That step would at least give pause to the crisis that threatens to
engulf us.</p>
<P>Then, over the next weeks and months, the participation of
the international community may have an opportunity to succeed in defusing the
crisis altogether. Perhaps this could be done by finding a combination of
specific nations not directly involved in the dispute to serve as "honest
brokers." Perhaps, for instance, Canada and South Africa.</p>
<P>But time is now terribly short to reverse the momentum
toward war. To make that reversal possible, Iraq must cooperate by giving UN
weapons inspectors unfettered access. And in that process, "honest
brokers" and the UN as an institution must proceed differently than UNSCOM
did, so that next time there will be no abuses, and there will be no misuse of
UN inspectors for espionage (as belatedly admitted by U.S. officials themselves
and authoritatively reported by <I>The New York Times</I> and other media outlets in
early January of 1999). If this work proceeds properly, Iraq will be able to
see a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<P>Then the sanctions, which have done so much damage to your
economy, infrastructure, and health can once and for all be lifted.</p>
<P>The Middle East, and Iraq in particular, is a place of
enduring cultural richness. It is the home of the world's oldest civilizations.
Iraq has bequeathed to the world three great religious traditions Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam. This is our heritage, and the world's heritage.</p>
<P>The Christian scriptures say "Blessed are the
peacemakers." They do not say "Blessed are the warmongers." I
happen to believe that the vast majority of the American people do not want to
wage war, but would rather wage peace.</p>
<P>Our delegation is here on behalf of peace. We believe that a
new war is not only unnecessary, but wrong.</p>
<P>I must again emphasize, however, that in my view and in the
view of many of my colleagues, the way to avoid war and to secure peace is to
allow UN inspectors into Iraq. The matter is urgent, and I therefore urge your
government to implement all relevant Security Council resolutions without
delay.</p>
<P>Speaking personally, I will encourage my colleagues in the Congress to enter 
into dialogue with the Iraq National Assembly for the future benefit of both our 
nations.<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></p>
