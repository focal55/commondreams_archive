<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 29 - American taxpayers may be 
stuck paying $850 billion in taxes normally paid by the 
super-wealthy if a measure currently before the U.S. Senate becomes 
law, according to a warning issued by Americans for a Fair Estate 
Tax (AFET), a non-partisan coalition of nonprofit organizations 
concerned about repeal of the estate tax. The threat comes from a 
tax plan by Sens. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) to 
permanently mandate that multi-million-dollar estates would never 
have to pay any taxes. The Senate is expected to vote on the issue 
in June. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Senate should reject the Gramm-Kyl tax plan to permanently 
repeal the estate tax,&quot; said Gary D. Bass of OMB Watch and chair of 
AFET. &quot;We cannot afford to sacrifice Medicare, Social Security, 
education, homeland security and other key national priorities just 
to permanently mandate a special gift to a few multi-million-dollar 
estates at the expense of 98 percent of American taxpayers.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFET last week issued a letter to several thousand of its member 
organizations' constituents, advising them of the danger of the 
Gramm-Kyl estate tax plan. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Instead of this large handout to a small handful of 
multi-millionaires at the expense of most Americans, we favor 
common-sense estate tax reform that would protect family farms, 
small businesses and average taxpayers -- without a costly repeal 
that would leave most Americans holding the bag,&quot; said Chuck 
Collins, co-founder of AFET member organization Responsible Wealth, 
the group of small business owners and affluent individuals who 
organized last year's pro-reform statement, signed by Bill Gates 
Sr., Warren Buffett and 1,100 other people personally affected by 
the estate tax. &quot;Repeal of the estate tax is simply unfair and not 
the best way to advance America's priorities.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Permanent repeal of the estate tax means less revenue for the 
country -- $100 billion in the next 10 years and $750 billion in 
the following decade. It would force the government to either raise 
taxes on middle-income taxpayers or cut vital services, such as 
Social Security or prescription drugs for the elderly, just to pay 
for a special windfall for the wealthiest few. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The estate tax is applied when individuals leave behind estates 
worth at least $1 million ($2 million for couples) at the time of 
their death. There is no tax on the first $1 million per 
individual, and amounts in excess of $1 million are taxed at 
various rates, starting at 37 percent. As a result of last summer's 
tax legislation, the amount that is exempted from taxation rises to 
$3.5 million ($7 million for couples) and the highest taxable rate 
drops from 55 percent to 45 percent by 2009. In 2010 the estate tax 
is repealed, but is again instituted in 2011. The Gramm-Kyl plan 
would permanently repeal the estate tax. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Repeal of the tax also would have a major harmful impact on 
America's foundations and charities. Estates are allowed to 
transfer unlimited amounts of money to charitable groups, thereby 
helping to reduce the size of the estate that is taxed. In 1999, 
this tax incentive for charitable giving resulted in $14.8 billion 
in contributions to foundations, universities, museums, churches 
and many other charities. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Even beyond the heavy burden it would place on most taxpayers, 
the Gramm-Kyl tax plan would drain billions of dollars from 
foundations and hard-hit charities that are already struggling to 
serve the most vulnerable Americans,&quot; said Rick Cohen of the 
National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy and AFET. &quot;The 
Gramm-Kyl tax plan is as unfair as it is unwise. It would hurt 
America's charities even as the president and Congress are looking 
to promote charity.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The estate tax was already scaled back last summer as part of 
President Bush's sweeping tax package. The Gramm-Kyl tax proposal 
would be far more costly for most American taxpayers as it would 
permanently repeal the tax rather than simply reforming it. Senate 
Majority Leader Tom Daschle has agreed to a vote in the Senate on 
the Gramm-Kyl proposal by June 28. The House will vote on permanent 
repeal of the estate tax for a second time on either June 5 or 6 to 
send a message to the Senate. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of AFET's effort to reform rather than repeal the estate 
tax, Responsible Wealth sponsored an ad in the May 20 edition of 
Roll Call and the May 22 edition of The New York Times. Entitled 
&quot;Much Ado About a Very Few,&quot; the ad highlights just how few estates 
would benefit from the costly Gramm-Kyl tax plan -- 24 in Maine, 
for example. Overall, 5,854 multi-millionaires would get a break 
while the remaining taxpayers would have to pick up the tab if the 
measure passes. The ad is available at 
<a href="http://www.responsiblewealth.org" target="_new">http://www.responsiblewealth.org</a>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AFET letter was signed by representatives of a wide range of 
public interest organizations, including AFSCME, American Arts 
Alliance, American Association of University Women, Americans for 
Democratic Action, Campaign for America's Future, Children's 
Defense Fund, Coalition on Human Needs, Evangelical Lutheran Church 
in America -- Lutheran Office for Governmental Affairs, Independent 
Sector, Minnesota Council of Nonprofits, National Committee for 
Responsive Philanthropy, National Council of Nonprofit 
Associations, National Women's Law Center, NETWORK (National 
Catholic Social Justice Lobby), OMB Watch, Responsible Wealth, 
United for a Fair Economy, and United Church of Christ Justice and 
Witness Ministries. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Americans for a Fair Estate Tax (AFET) is a broad-based 
non-partisan coalition of nonprofit groups, including civic, labor, 
social justice, faith-based, and environmental organizations, as 
well as organizations providing human services. AFET advocates that 
instead of repealing the tax on multi-million-dollar estates, 
Congress should reform the estate tax to ensure that family farms 
and small businesses are not unfairly taxed while keeping 98 
percent of taxpayers exempt and safeguarding Medicare, Social 
Security, education, charities and other key national priorities 
that would be threatened by a complete repeal. More information
