JAPAN - June 14 - An armed British nuclear transport ship, Pacific Pintail, was 
met by protests from local Japanese anti-nuclear activists and Greenpeace as it 
arrived today at the nuclear reactor port of Takahama, Fukui Prefecture on the 
Sea of Japan coast. </font>

A container to be used to transport the controversial load of rejected nuclear 
fuel back to Britian is unloaded from transport ship Pacific Pintail in Takahama 
in Fukui prefecture, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) west of Tokyo Friday, June 
14, 2002. The transport ship pulled into the Japanese port earlier in the day 
to pick up the plutonium- and uranium-based mixed oxide fuel at the Takahama Nuclear 
Power plant and then ferry it back to its maker in Britain. (AP Photo/Kyodo News)

</table></font>The ship, under guard from Japanese coastguard vessels entered the port area 
at 09:00AM. The vessel is delivering an empty transport container to the reactor 
site, where it is due to be loaded within the next few weeks with rejected plutonium 
MOX shipped to Japan by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) in 1999. After being loaded 
into the container (cask) it is planned to ship it back to the UK along one of 
three secret routes. (1) </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Pacific Pintail left the UK on April 26th, together with another armed 
nuclear freighter, the Pacific Teal. Both vessels passed through the Caribbean 
Sea, Panama Canal and across the Pacific on their voyage to Japan. Governments 
in the Caribbean condemned the planned shipment because of the lack of any notification 
by the shipping states, Japan and Britain, as well as the threat of terrorist 
attack and catastrophic accident. In the last week former security experts, including 
a former senior UK Government Minister from the Defense Department, have labeled 
the shipment as vulnerable to armed attack. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last week the 34 Governments of the Organization of American States (OAS) supported 
and adopted a resolution that called for an assessment of the security threats 
posed by nuclear transports through the Caribbean Sea (2). Chile called in the 
British and Japanese ambassadors on Thursday 6th June to convey its concerns about 
the shipment. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Government of Antigua and Barbuda at the OAS meeting made an impassioned 
plea in reference to the planned plutonium MOX shipment from Japan to the UK and 
called for an end to nuclear shipments, &quot;Our small states are fearful that 
a deliberate act of terror aimed at those ships may bring an end to our very existence. 
This is not fanciful or farfetched fiction.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Friday 14 June 2002, the Vice President of the Fiji Senate made a statement 
on behalf of the Fiji Government. &quot;The Fiji Government is firmly opposed 
to all shipments of MOX fuel through its EEZ and has always made this clear to 
the shipping states&quot;. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the Pintail arrived in Takahama, the Teal is expected to head straight 
for a Japanese commercial port, probably Kobe. The Pintail is expected to join 
it there, where during the next few days or weeks the ships will take on provisions, 
as well as anti-terrorist police from the UK. The security police are expected 
to arrive from the UK just prior to the ships$B!G(B departure from Japan. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This plutonium MOX should never have been shipped to Japan in the first 
place. Since BNFL lied to their Japanese customers over the quality of this MOX, 
countries should be under no illusion now that the bland assurances issued by 
BNFL, and the British and Japanese Governments, that this shipment is safe and 
secure are anything but irresponsibly complacent and lacking in credibility. In 
fact, these shipments present a global threat to the environment through risk 
of accident or deliberate attack. The fact that BNFL and the Japanese are trying 
to make this transport under the cover of the soccer World Cup only exposes further 
their contempt for public safety. This shipment must be abandoned,&quot; said 
Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace International. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In an attempt to stop the plutonium shipment, Greenpeace is preparing a legal 
challenge against the UK Government. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Greenpeace yesterday announced 
at a press conference in Takahama that the Arctic Sunrise, one of the Greenpeace 
ships, would shortly arrive in Japan to join the protests against this MOX shipment. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Notes to editors: <br>
(1) The eight MOX assemblies containing 255 kilograms of weapons usable plutonium, 
as well as uranium, was rejected by Japan after it was admitted by BNFL that they 
had deliberately falsified vital quality control data for the fuel. The resultant 
scandal in Japan led to the suspension of plans to load commercial MOX for the 
first time in Japanese reactors. In 2001, encouraged by the BNFL scandal citizens 
in the village of Kashiwazaki-kariwa voted to block loading of a batch of French/Belgian 
MOX fuel delivered also in 1999. In total Japan has shipped over 2,300 kilograms 
of direct use weapons plutonium from Europe in the last 17 years. Not one gram 
has been loaded into a nuclear reactor and remains stockpiled at nuclear facilities 
throughout Japan. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>(2) The Thirty-four member states of the OAS met at the XXXII General Assembly 
in Bridgetown, Barbados June 2nd-4th, 2002. The OAS consists of: Antigua and Barbuda-Argentina-Bahamas-Barbados-Belize-Bolivia-Brazil-Canada-Chile-Colombia-Costa
