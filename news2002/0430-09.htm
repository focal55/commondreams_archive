- April 30 -  The tobacco industry
contributed more than $4.3 million in soft money and political
action committee (PAC) contributions to federal candidates,
political parties and political committees so far this election
cycle -- from January 1, 2001, to April 1, 2002 -- according to a
quarterly report issued today by the National Center for
Tobacco-Free Kids Action Fund and Common Cause.
<p>The report also details how political contributions continue to
correlate with lawmakers support of legislation supported by Philip
Morris and opposed by the public health community that would
provide for weak regulation of tobacco products by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA).
<p>The report details the following tobacco industry contributions
so far in the 2001-2002 election cycle:
<p>-- Soft money and PAC contributions to federal candidates,
political parties and political committees totaled $4,311,473 since
January 1, 2001.
<p>-- Tobacco companies, along with tobacco company executives and
employees, donated more than $2.6 million in soft money to the
Democratic and Republican parties so far this cycle. Nearly 50
percent of these soft money donations came from Philip Morris.
<p>-- Tobacco company PACs donated over $1.1 million directly to
federal candidates, with 77 percent ($864,139) of the total
donations going to Republican candidates.
<p>-- Tobacco PACs have donated more than $560,000 to non-candidate
committees, including Democratic and Republican party committees
and leadership PACs established by individual members of Congress.
<p>The tobacco industry has contributed more than $20 million since
1997, including $13.2 million in soft money and $7.1 million in PAC
contributions. Since 1999, the four largest cigarette companies
have spent more than $44 million on lobbying the U.S. Congress.
<p>"The tobacco companies are continuing their decades-long effort
to use political muscle to avoid effective public policies that
protect the public health," said Matthew L. Myers, President of the
National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids Action Fund. "Today's report
tells us why there has been no action on tobacco this election
cycle, despite the fact that thousands of kids start smoking every
day and 440,000 Americans die every year from tobacco use."
<p>Demonstrating how the tobacco industry's contributions are used
to thwart public health policy, the report details contributions to
the sponsors and cosponsors of ineffective FDA legislation
supported by Philip Morris.
<p>The 17 House members who are sponsoring the Philip Morris-backed
bill, H.R 2180, have received, on average, more than 19 times as
much money from the tobacco industry as the 117 sponsors of a
public health community-supported FDA bill, H.R.1097 ($10,357 vs.
$537).
<p>"It's no accident that this critical public health issue --
protecting children from a fatal illness -- is a low priority in
Congress. The tobacco industry's $4.3 million in contributions
protects their billions in profits at a major cost to public
health, and underlines the need for a ban on unlimited corporate
political contributions," said Scott Harshbarger, president of
Common Cause. "With passage of McCain-Feingold, we hope this issue
can be resolved on the merits, in favor of America's children."
<p>Campaign Contributions by Tobacco Interests is the latest issue
of a quarterly report that updates Buying Influence, Selling Death,
a major report on tobacco industry political influence that was
issued by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and Common Cause in
March 2001. All the contributions cited in this reported are
based on data released by the FEC as of March 31, 2002. The next
quarterly report will be released in July 2002.
<p>Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the
U.S., killing more than 440,000 Americans every year and causing
more than $155 billion in health care costs and lost productivity.
Ninety percent of smokers begin at or before age 18.
<p>This quarterly report's development and distribution are meant
to provide information and analysis on the tobacco industry's
extraordinary and improper political influence, especially in
regard to the U.S. Congress and the Federal Government. Toward
this end, this report offers a range of information, including data
on direct and indirect tobacco industry contributions to Members of
Congress, other elected officials, and other candidates for elected
office. Nothing in this report is meant in any way to endorse,
support, or oppose the election of any candidate or to indicate any
support or opposition to any candidate's election by any of the
sponsoring organizations.
