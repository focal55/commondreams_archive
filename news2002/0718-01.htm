<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AUSTIN, 
TEXAS - July 18 - Dell Computer Corporation must match its outstanding corporate 
performance with industry leadership to solve the growing problem of discarded 
computers and consumer electronics threatening public health and the environment, 
according to environmental advocates, company shareholders, workers and others 
addressing the company at Thursday's annual meeting at the Austin Convention Center.</font> 
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Dell Computer is a profit 
and market share leader among PC manufacturers, yet it is an environmental laggard 
relative to most of its global competitors,&quot; says Robin Schneider, Executive 
Director of Texas Campaign for the Environment. &quot;Our members are calling 
on Dell to take leadership in bringing about a sustainable solution to the problem 
of discarded computers and consumer electronics, so-called e-wastes. To safeguard 
public health, brand owners and manufacturers must take full responsibility for 
the life-cycle of their products, from clean production to take back at the end 
of their useful life and responsible recycling,&quot; continues Schneider.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Texas Campaign for the Environment 
organized events outside Dell's annual meeting to educate shareholders, media, 
and the general public about the e-waste problem and the importance of Dell Computer 
Corporation to an industry-wide solution. TCE is a lead organization in the national 
Computer TakeBack Campaign, co-coordinated by GrassRoots Recycling Network and 
Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, pushing for producer responsibility for computers 
and consumer electronics through industry initiatives and state legislation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> E-wastes are among the fastest 
growing waste streams in the industrialized world, owing to growing sales and 
rapid pace of product obsolescence. Tens of millions of computers alone become 
obsolete in the US every year, with fewer than ten percent recycled. Because they 
contain lead, mercury, cadmium, flame retardant plastics and other materials, 
discarded electronics pose substantial threats to human health and the environment.</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As a Dell shareholder, I 
believe the company must match its outstanding performance as a company with industry 
leadership for environmental protection,&quot; says Noah Hahn. &quot;The environmental 
threats posed by improperly discarded electronics are a huge potential liability 
for the company. On the other hand, expanding the company's asset recovery service 
to reclaim used computers from individuals and small businesses could be a source 
of new revenue,&quot; continues Hahn.</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The American Friends Service 
Committee is deeply concerned when US corporations do nothing to stop the flow 
of toxic wastes that harms innocent people who have little knowledge of the dangers 
of electronic waste,&quot; said Josefina Castillo, Program Coordinator for American 
Friends Service Committee, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma Office. &quot;Men, women 
and children in China and other developing countries are now at the receiving 
end of US waste. They do not have the information, equipment or the funds to properly 
recycle and dispose of this waste. Dell should show that its corporate success 
will not be at the expense of the health of poorer peoples of the world,&quot; 
she added.<br>
<br>
&quot;I live near two of the largest landfills in Central Texas and I am very 
concerned about both the high volume of electronic waste that is building up and 
the heavy metals that will contaminate Austin's groundwater from old electronics,&quot; 
said Trek English of the Northeast Action Group. &quot;In Europe and in Japan, 
Dell takes back used computers and equipment from all customers; I think American 
consumers deserve the same level of service and protection. Dell Computer operates 
in a global marketplace and standardizes their operations to maximize efficiency. 
Their policies and practices in the European market should be standard in the 
American market,&quot; continues Ms. English.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The European Union has issued two 
directives relating to e-wastes; one requiring producer responsibility for take 
back of used equipment and the second requiring scheduled phase-out of hazardous 
materials (e.g., lead,<br>
mercury) from electronics. Dell's entire product line is being re-designed to 
meet the EU's strict requirements.</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Computer TakeBack Campaign 
is targeting Dell because of its industry leadership, market share growth, and 
because the company is integral to an industry-wide solution,&quot; says David 
Wood, program director with GrassRoots Recycling Network and organizing director 
of the Computer TakeBack Campaign. &quot;An effective electronics producer responsibility 
program must apply equally to all brand owners. Some PC manufacturers interested 
in exploring take back solutions are hesitant and concerned about being put at 
a competitive disadvantage by Dell's unique sales model.&quot;</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The proposed plan by Dell 
to use Unicor prison labor for the recycling of personal computers is not an acceptable 
solution. Prison labor is not protected by occupational health and safety regulations. 
Furthermore, the cheaper rates paid to prison labor, undercut an opportunity for 
a vibrant recycling industry that results in economic development, jobs that pay 
workers a decent wage and provide the necessary safe working conditions,&quot; 
said Leslie Byster, Communications Director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition.</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The US, at present, lacks 
the necessary infrastructure to safely recycle all the discarded computers and 
electronics in our homes, schools, and offices,&quot; says TCE's Schneider. &quot;As 
a result, substantial quantities of products destined for 'recycling' are actually 
being shipped overseas to China and other countries for processing under horrific 
conditions. We need to ban the export of these wastes; we need companies to ensure 
that their recycling operations do not feed overseas waste markets; and we need 
producer responsibility in order to develop the required domestic recycling system. 
Dell's leadership is key to making this happen,&quot; continues Schneider.</font></p>
