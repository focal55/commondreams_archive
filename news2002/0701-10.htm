<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - July 1 - Human 
genetic engineering could be the next major battleground for the global conservation 
movement, according to a series of reports in the latest issue of World Watch 
magazine, published by the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based research 
organization. While previous struggles have involved protecting ecosystems and 
human societies from the unpredicted consequences of new technologies, this fight 
over high-risk applications of human genetic engineering is a struggle over who 
will decide what it means to be human. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Many countries have 
already banned reproductive cloning, and the U.N. is working on a global treaty 
to ban it, but even more powerful and much more dangerous are the related technologies 
to modify the genes we pass on to our children,&quot; says Ed Ayres, Editor of 
World Watch magazine. The contributors to this special issue call on the U.N. 
and national governments to ban the technology known as inheritable genetic modification. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many uses of human genetic 
technology could be beneficial to society, but as political scientist Francis 
Fukuyama writes in the magazine, our understanding of the relationship between 
our genes and whatever improvements we might seek for our children (and their 
descendants) is dangerously deficient. Fukuyama warns that &quot;the victim of 
a failed experiment will not be an ecosystem, but a human child whose parents, 
seeking to give her greater intelligence, will saddle her with a greater propensity 
for cancer, or prolonged debility in old age, or some other completely unanticipated 
side effect that may emerge only after the experimenters have passed from the 
scene.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human genetic engineering 
has ramifications that reach far beyond the life of a single child. Several contributors 
highlight the disastrous results of the last serious effort to engineer genetic 
perfection. In the early part of the 20th century, scientists and politicians 
in the United States relied on the alleged science of eugenics to justify the 
forced sterilization of tens of thousands of people who were judged to be &quot;feebleminded,&quot; 
&quot;mentally defective,&quot; or &quot;epileptics.&quot; Hitler passed his own 
sterilization law soon after taking office in 1933, heading down the path toward 
the Holocaust. </font> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The U.S. biotechnology industry-which dominates the global industry-has become 
an increasingly powerful economic and political force, with revenues growing fivefold 
between 1989 ($5 billion) and 2000 ($25 billion). Aided by the equally rapid revolution 
in computing, laboratories that once took two months to sequence 150 nucleotides 
can now process over 30 million in a day, and at a small fraction of the earlier 
cost. The number of patents pending for human DNA sequences has gone from 4,000 
in 1991, to 500,000 in 1998, to several million today.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We are publishing this special issue because we don't want to lose the 
opportunity to decide openly and democratically how this rapidly developing technology 
is used, &quot; says Ayres. &quot;This isn't a fight about saving whales, or the 
last rain forests, or even the health of people living today. The question is 
whether we can save ourselves from ourselves, to know and respect what we do not 
know, and to put the breaks on potentially dangerous forms of human genetic engineering.&quot; 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Excerpts from the authors of the &quot;Beyond Cloning&quot; issue of World 
Watch</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> * Invigorating Racism: &quot;There are precedents for breeding that are politically 
manipulated. You only have to think of the Nazi German ideal, the blond blue-eyed 
German.&quot; -Nadine Gordimer, Nobel Prize recipient in literature for 1991. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> * Heightening Discrimination: &quot;What is called a deficiency-mental, physical, 
or other-is socially defined. For example, the perverse world order of globalization 
dictated by commerce, greed, and profits regularly treats women, children, and 
poor people as inferiors. Without strong democracy and true transparency, this 
kind of discrimination can be used to justify human genetic manipulation, manifested 
in eugenics programs.&quot; -Vandana Shiva, director of the Research Foundation 
for Science, Technology, and Ecology, and author of Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking 
of the Global Food Supply. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> * Oh Brave New World: &quot;Our new understanding of genomics and the neurosciences 
is almost making possible a generation of HyPE [human performance enhancement 
drugs] that could be used in more sinister ways, e.g., to control dissent.&quot;-Pat 
Mooney, author of Shattering: Food, Politics, and the Loss of Genetic Diversity, 
and executive director of ETC Group.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> * Turning Babies into Commodities: &quot;The story of an 'enhanced' humanity 
panders to some of the least attractive tendencies of our time: techno-scientific 
curiosity unbounded by care for social consequence, economic culture in which 
we cannot draw lines of any kind, hopes for our children wrought into consumerism, 
and deep denial of our own mortality.&quot;-Tom Anthanasiou, author of Divided 
Planet: The Ecology of Rich and Poor and Marcy Darnovsky, Associate Executive 
Director of the Center for Genetics and Society.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> * Widening Economic and other Inequalities: &quot;Genetic engineering ... 
will artificially confer heritable advantages only on those who can afford to 
buy them.&quot; -Judith Levine, author of My Enemy, My Love: Women, Men, and the 
Dilemma of Gender.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> * The Law of Unintended Consequences: &quot;...the attempt to master human 
nature through biotechnology will be even more dangerous and consequential than 
the efforts of industrial societies to master non-human nature through earlier 
generations of technologies.&quot; -Francis Fukuyama, Bernard Schwartz Professor 
of International Political Economy at The John Hopkins University School of Advanced 
International Studies, author of The End of History and Our Posthuman Future: 
Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> * Destroying the Basis of Democracy: &quot;The new eugenic technologies are 
being actively promoted by influential scientists, writers, and others who see 
themselves ushering in a new epoch for human life on earth. They speak with enthusiasm 
of a 'post-human' future in which the health, appearance, personality, cognitive 
ability, sensory capacity, and lifespan of our children have all been genetically 
modified. They anticipate, with scant concern, the inevitable segregation of humanity 
into genetic sub-species, the 'GenRich' and the 'Naturals.'&quot; -Richard Hayes, 
executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> * Creating a New Terror Weapon: &quot;It is this potential for genocide based 
on genetic differences, which I have termed 'genetic genocide,' that makes species-altering 
genetic engineering a potential weapon of mass destruction, and makes the unaccountable 
genetic engineer a potential bioterrorist.&quot; -George J. Annas, Chair, Department 
of Health, Law, Bioethics and Human Rights, Boston University School of Public 
Health.</font></p>
