<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- June 13 - It has come to the attention of American Rivers that the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers, with the apparent blessing of the White House, has revealed 
today its intentions to avoid its obligations to alter the operations of its Missouri 
River dams. According to &quot;talking points&quot; circulated to journalists, 
the Corps of Engineers will seek to strong-arm the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
to withdraw or modify a Endangered Species Act &quot;biological opinion&quot; 
that called for modifications to a river management scheme that is slowly sterilizing 
America's longest river. </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This action flies in the face of the Administration's repeated pledges 
to rely on sound science in environmental decision-making,&quot; said Rebecca 
R. Wodder, president of American Rivers. &quot;Once again, the White House has 
catered to a influential industry and disregarded an overwhelming body of science, 
economics, and legal precedent.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Biologists for the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service have given the Corps a 
2003 deadline to alter dam operations to prevent the extinction of three species 
and to begin restoring the river. Specifically, they called on the Corps to begin 
releasing a &quot;spring rise&quot; of at least 49,500 cubic feet per second to 
raise river levels for two weeks in May and to begin dropping river flows to 21,000 
cubic feet per second in late July and early August. To balance ecological and 
human needs along the river, the Service's river experts only called for a spring 
rise during normal water years, once every three years on average - and not in 
years of drought or flood. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, Corps officials began circulating &quot;talking points&quot; to members 
of the media indicating that rather than make the needed changes, the agency intended 
to seek a rewrite of the Fish and Wildlife Service's &quot;biological opinion.&quot; 
In a meeting with conservation leaders just last week, White House environmental 
advisors had indicated that the Corps would be acting at their direction on the 
Missouri River. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;With the apparent blessing of the White House, the Corps is setting a 
course to violate the Endangered Species Act, and abdicating their responsibility 
for river management to the courts,&quot; said Rebecca R. Wodder, President of 
American Rivers. &quot;If you read between the lines, what the White House is 
really saying is that it is willing to break the law and let native fish and wildlife 
go extinct on behalf of an influential industry,&quot; she said. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Corps' action today fulfills a prophecy of the National Academy of Sciences, 
which noted in its January report that although the &quot;smallest benefits among 
authorized purposes along the mainstem (of the Missouri River) come from irrigation 
and navigation,&quot; the barge companies and agribusinesses in a small portion 
of the floodplain &quot;wield great political influence and may resist changes 
to traditional management policies.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">American Rivers will offer additional reaction as further details become available. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What the White House and the Corps ignored Today's action ignores four facts 
about the Missouri River flow issue: </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- The science is solid. Two years of study went into the Science Academy report, 
which concluded that &quot;degradation of the Missouri River ecosystem will continue 
unless the river's natural water flow is significantly restored.&quot; It said 
that just restoring riverside habitat, in the absence of dam reforms, will be 
insufficient to halt the river's decline. In addition, natural resource professionals 
working for all of the states along the river concur with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service's water flow recommendations. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- The law is clear. Unless the Corps adopts the Fish and Wildlife Service's 
flow targets by spring 2003, the agency will be in violation of the Endangered 
Species Act. The Corps has been on notice since 1990 that its current plan jeopardizes 
the continued existence of at least three native river species. By attempting 
to pressure the Fish and Wildlife Service into withdrawing or modifying its requirements, 
today's action sets the stage for further efforts in Congress to give out legal 
exemptions to politically influential economic interests. Today's action undermines 
the fair and consistent implementation of the Endangered Species Act, a cornerstone 
of U.S. environmental protection for 30 years. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- The economy would benefit. The Science Academy concluded that Missouri River 
dam reforms will &quot;enhance the valuable fishery resources...increase waterfowl 
populations...increase the abundance of largemouth bass...attract more anglers 
to the region...and result in marked increases in user-days for recreational fishing, 
commercial fishing, and hunting&quot; and therefore may be &quot;justifiable solely 
on the grounds that it represents an economic improvement&quot; over current dam 
operations. Already, these activities amount to an $87 million industry each year 
in South Dakota alone. That is in sharp contrast to the barge industry, which 
has dwindled to less than $7 million a year overall. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- The public supports change. Out of 55,000 comments submitted to the Corps 
during a public comment period that ended Feb. 28, over 54,000 supported the restoration 
of more natural flows to the Missouri. Since January, eight Missouri River basin 
newspapers have editorialized numerous times in favor of restoring more natural 
flows to the Missouri. Six of the eight governors in the Missouri River basin 
have formally recommended experimenting with flow changes to restore the river.
