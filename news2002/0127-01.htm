- January 27 - Sept. 11 victim's families returning
from a 9-day visit to Afghanistan will hold a press
conference on Monday, January 28 at 10 a.m. at 777
United Nations Plaza, 12th Floor (corner of 1st and
44th, entrance on 44th). </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They will speak about their cathartic meetings with
Afghans who lost family members in the recent U.S.
bombing campaign and their visits with hospital
workers, relief agency officials, and internally
displaced refugees. They will also call for the
establishment of a compensation fund for Afghan
victims of the U.S .bombing campaign, similar to the
fund that was set up for Americans whose family
members were killed in the attacks of Sept. 11. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We&#146;ve met with people who have lost loved ones to the
U.S. bombing  We have looked at pictures of their
families, they have looked at pictures of ours, we
have talked with them, we feel the same grief,&quot; said
Kelly 
Campbell, whose brother-in-law Craig Amundson was
killed in the Pentagon attack, in an interview from
Afghanistan with Agence France Presse. &quot;The United
States government needs to take responsibility
for the direct effect on these people's lives,&quot; she
added. &quot;We owe it to them to do what we can to help
them rebuild their homes and give their children
health care and an education so they can get on with
their 
lives.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Monetary compensation can never erase the sorrow of
loss. But establishing a compensation fund would
represent a significant step toward building the bonds
of friendship that are the true foundations of peace,&quot;
said Medea Benjamin, founding director of Global
Exchange, the group that organized the trip. &quot;Whether
one supported the bombing or not, shouldn&#146;t our hearts </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and helping hands go out to those people who were
every bit as innocent as the victims of the September
11 attack?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The delegation to Afghanistan included four Americans
whose family members were victims of the Sept. 11
attacks:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rita Lasar is a 70-year-old retired small
businesswoman from New York City. Rita lost her
brother, Abe Zelmanowitz, at the World Trade Center.
Abe was on the 27th floor of 1 World Trade Center when
the first plane 
hit. Although he could have gotten out of the
building, he chose instead to stay with his friend, a quadriplegic who could not get out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kelly Campbell is a 29-year-old environmental campaign coordinator in Oakland California. Her brother-in-law, 28 year-old Craig Amundson, was killed in the Pentagon attack, leaving behind a young wife and two small children. Kelly is traveling on behalf of Craig&#146;s widow, Amber Amundson, who has been an outspoken voice for reconciliation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eva Rupp is a 28-year-old woman who works in
Washington, DC at the Department of Commerces National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Eva is the
step-sister of Deora Bodley, and the two of them were
close from the time Deora was five.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Derrill Bodley is a 56-year-old professor of music at Sacramento City College and the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California. Derrill lost his daughter, Deora, on United Airlines Flight 93, which 
crashed in Pennsylvania.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before he left for Afghanistan, Derrill Bodley said:
&quot;For me, this trip is about respect and love for all
human beings by all human beings, regardless of where
they come from. I&#146;m going on this journey to show my 
concern for those innocent Afghans who have died or
are suffering now. By embracing our common humanity
and sharing our sorrow perhaps we will be able to
avoid other loss in the future.&quot; While in Afghanistan,
Bodley met and cried with a man who had also lost his 
daughter in the aftermath of Sept. 11a man whose
5-year-old daughter was killed by a U.S. bomb.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also participating in the press conference will be
Masuda Sultan, a young Afghan-American woman who lost
19 members of her extended family when the US bombed 
their farm outside Kandahar just over a month ago.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although a full accounting of civilians killed during
the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan has not yet occurred,
two studies of civilian casualties put the number at
between 1,000 and 4,000 people. The studies were 
conducted by the Center for Defense Alternatives
(<a href="http://www.comw.org/pda/" target="_new">http://www.comw.org/pda/</a>) and by a University of New
Hampshire Economics Professor (<a href="http://pubpages.unh.edu/%7Emwherold" target="_new">http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mwherold</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The victims-to-victims delegation was organized by
Global Exchange, an international human rights
organization whose motto is &quot;building people-to-people
ties.&quot; Global Exchange say the journey had a profound
impact in both countries by showing that individual
Afghans and Americans suffer alike. Afghans saw that
U.S. citizens do care about their well being. The U.S.
visitors gained a deeper understanding of Afghans as
real people. And people around the world who learned
of the exchange through the extensive press coverage
it 
received witnessed the common humanity of all persons.
The press conference of the delegation participants is co-sponsored by the American Friends Service Committee.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Visuals: Footage from the trip to Afghanistan will be
screened at the conference.
