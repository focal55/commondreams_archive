- June 6 - Young women and girls face 
widespread sex discrimination in high school vocational and 
technical education programs across the country. Pervasive sex 
segregation, sexual harassment in the classroom, discrimination in 
counseling and recruiting, and other gender-based bias are creating 
serious barriers to their future earning power, according to a 
nationwide investigation released today by the National Women's Law 
Center (NWLC). NWLC examined problems in depth in Arizona, 
California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Washington 
State. (View state information at <a href="http://www.nwlc.org" target="_new">http://www.nwlc.org</a> or call 
202-588-5180.) </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a result of these findings, NWLC today issued a report and 
filed 12 Petitions for Compliance Review -- one in each regional 
office of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. 
The petitions request Title IX investigations of -- and demand 
remedies for -- sex discrimination in vocational and technical 
education across the country. Title IX is the law, passed 30 years 
ago this month, that bars sex discrimination in all aspects of 
federally funded education. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thirty years after Title IX, boys are still being steered toward 
courses that lead to traditionally male, and higher paying, careers 
in technology and the trades, while girls are clustered in programs 
that lead to lower paying jobs in cosmetology, child care and the 
like. National patterns of sex segregation, based on data in the 
12 states, shows that 96 percent of cosmetology students are 
female, as are 87 percent of those enrolled in child care courses, 
and 86 percent of those enrolled in health aide preparation 
courses. Meanwhile, boys comprise over 90 percent of the students 
enrolled in carpentry, automotive, and plumbing. The pattern of 
sex segregation is even worse in some states. For example, in 
Florida, 99 percent of the students in cosmetology are female, 
while 100 percent of the students taking plumbing are male. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pervasive sex segregation of female students into 
traditionally female programs severely compromises their future 
earning power. For example, cosmetologists earn a median hourly 
salary of $8.49 and child care workers earn a median hourly salary 
of $7.43. In contrast, students in the predominantly male, 
higher-wage careers can earn median hourly salaries of almost $20 
as plumbers, electricians or mechanical drafters. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beyond the data showing stark patterns of sex segregation, NWLC 
obtained additional information that underscores the sex 
discrimination that girls face in vocational education. This 
includes teachers who help male students get summer jobs but do not 
help female students; guidance counselors who steer female students 
into cosmetology based on their lower expectations for them; and 
schools that fail to protect girls from sexual harassment. 
Moreover, half of the states across the country have not met their 
legal duty to designate a Title IX coordinator to carry out the 
states' responsibilities under the law. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Young women enrolled in traditionally female programs often 
receive inferior educations. Today's actions follow NWLC's 
finding last year that New York City's vocational schools were 
highly sex segregated and that the predominantly female schools, 
unlike the male schools, offered almost no advanced math or science 
courses. Special technology programs, like Cisco Networking 
Academies, which lead to industry certification in computer 
networking and jobs that pay between $42,000 and over $100,000 per 
year, were placed in the predominantly male schools, but were not 
available in the schools attended by young women. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;High school vocational and technical education programs can 
provide a path to economic independence for many young women and 
girls. Thirty years after Title IX, it is unconscionable that 
their dreams and futures are still being shortchanged,&quot; said Marcia 
D. Greenberger, NWLC co-president. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Girls in vocational and technical programs suffer 
discriminatory practices that discourage them from progressing and 
succeeding. These girls have to tolerate instructors who really 
don't take them seriously and deny them the experience of any real 
training. Instead, they are given the attendance book or other 
administrative duties while the boys are being trained with the 
tools,&quot; said Geri Harston, a Chicago electrician and recruiter for 
the nation's second largest electrical apprenticeship program. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Melissa Barbier, director of girls' programs at the Chicago 
Women in Trades, said, &quot;I've seen first hand the obstacles girls 
must overcome to enter the trades. But I've also seen the positive 
results when schools make the effort to provide an encouraging 
environment for girls in the nontraditional trades, and when they 
inform girls about the financial benefits and consequences of their 
career choices.&quot; </font></p>
