- June 12 - Commercial Alert announced today that the Seattle School Board won 
the National Ad Slam Contest, which awards a $5,000 prize to a school or school 
district for the best and most creative effort to expel advertising and commercialism 
from school during the 2001-2 school year.</FONT> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The prize honors the work of the 
Citizens' Campaign for Commercial-Free Schools, which led the effort against commercialism 
in the Seattle public schools. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last November, in response to Citizens' 
Campaign organizing and advocacy, the Seattle School Board set a new policy on 
advertising and commercial activities that will remove Channel One, a televised 
in-school marketing program, from all Seattle public schools by the 2004-5 school 
year. The new policy also prohibits advertising on school property (with exceptions 
for school newspapers, yearbooks and library materials) and restricts the display 
of corporate logos.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The award goes to the citizen 
heroes at the Citizens' Campaign for protecting captive audiences of impressionable 
schoolchildren from the marketing of junk food, violent entertainment, soda pop 
and video games,&quot; said Gary Ruskin, executive director of Commercial Alert. 
&quot;They are making sure that Seattle schoolchildren are not for sale.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Seattle victory shows that 
a broad-based coalition of parents, youth, teachers, workers, elected officials 
and community leaders can successfully fight the corporatization of public schools,&quot; 
said Brita Butler-Wall, executive director of the Citizens' Campaign for Commercial-Free 
Schools.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I'm thrilled about the collaboration 
between the Seattle School District and the Citizens' Campaign for Commercial-Free 
Schools that resulted in a policy protecting our students from inappropriate commercial 
activity,&quot; said Nancy Waldman, president of the Seattle School Board.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This award is really about 
health,&quot; said Gary Goldbaum, MD, MPH, Chronic Disease &amp; Injury Control 
Officer, Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County. &quot;Through its commitment 
to providing a healthier environment, Seattle Public Schools is promoting not 
only a better learning environment, but also a healthier population of young people 
who will be healthier citizens.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Schools getting $5,000 for switching 
off the ads <br>
by Kathy Mulady</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An anti-commercialism group in Oregon 
will award the Seattle School Board $5,000 for tuning out Channel One and dumping 
other in-school advertising.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last November, board members voted 
to phase out Channel One, a 12-minute, daily school news program that includes 
two minutes of advertising. The board also adopted a policy aimed to remove blatant 
advertising from soft drink machines, sports fields, gyms and school buses. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The award will be presented to school 
board members tomorrow by Commercial Alert. It is the first award to be given 
by the Portland-based group, which was organized in part to fight advertising 
in public schools. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader is chairman of its board of directors. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Channel One, which reaches about 
8 million students, is one of the organization's main targets.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We view Channel One as the 
most egregious form of in-school commercialism in the country,&quot; said Gary 
Ruskin, executive director of Commercial Alert. &quot;Corporations see the gold 
and are sprinting into the schools to try to market to these students. Kids are 
in school to learn, not to shop.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Channel One, which has been used 
in some Seattle public schools since 1991, is shown in classrooms in about half 
the district's high schools and middle schools. It offers about 10 minutes of 
news and current-events programming and two minutes of commercials. In exchange, 
the schools receive free televisions, VCRs and cable connections.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Schools will phase out the Channel 
One program, ending it in 2004.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nancy Waldman, president of the school 
board, said she doesn't know if the schools will be asked to return the equipment. 
However, the board is planning a levy in 2004 to replace some that is expected 
to be lost. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The school board hasn't decided what 
it will do with the $5,000. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Board member Dick Lilly wasn't on 
the board when the anti-advertising plan was approved, but supports the no-ads 
policy.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The district made a huge mistake 
when they first allowed it,&quot; he said. &quot;It dilutes the curriculum. That's 
what's pernicious about it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Commercial Alert says the school 
news program is fraught with commercials for &quot;junk food, overpriced sneakers 
and video games.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Channel One describes the advertisements 
as mainly for skin cleanser, clothes, military recruiting and anti-drug messages. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We have tremendous support 
among educators; 12,000 schools nationwide have renewed their contract with us 
in the last three years,&quot; said Jeff Ballabon, a spokesman for Primedia, the 
parent company of Channel One.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Waldman said she was initially skeptical 
about the need to remove advertising from schools, viewing it more as an opportunity 
to teach students to be savvy, wary consumers.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Parents' groups and especially the 
Citizens Campaign for Commercial-Free Schools, which nominated the school board 
for the award, convinced her otherwise. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The more I thought about it, 
the more I realized that people entrust their kids to us. Corporations making 
money on a captive audience is morally wrong,&quot; Waldman said. &quot;School 
should be a safe haven from advertising for these kids.&quot;</font></p>
