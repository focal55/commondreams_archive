- June 28 - In the immediate aftermath of an appeals court ruling that the Pledge 
of Allegiance was unconstitutional, nearly all the commentary in the country's 
leading newspapers criticized the decision. But some of the more alarmist arguments 
used to defend the phrase &quot;under God&quot; actually tended to support the 
judges' finding that including it in the Pledge is an impermissible government 
establishment of religion.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of the 10 largest-circulation 
dailies in the country, six had run editorials on the ruling as of June 28; all 
six attacked the decision. Editorialists called it &quot;a fundamentally silly 
ruling&quot; (L.A. Times (6/27/02) or an &quot;addled opinion&quot; (Wall Street 
Journal, 6/27/02). The New York Times (6/27/02) said it &quot;lacks common sense,&quot; 
while the Washington Post (6/27/02) compared it to a &quot;parody.&quot; The appeals 
court &quot;went way overboard,&quot; in the opinion of Long Island Newsday; for 
the New York Daily News (6/27/02), &quot;the sooner this decision is overturned, 
the better.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Signed columns in the top papers 
had little more balance. Jeffrey Rosen in the New York Times (6/28/02) criticized 
the ruling's &quot;polarizing vision.&quot; In the Washington Post (6/27/02), 
Marc Fisher criticized &quot;a court steeped in the arrogance of political correctness.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A column by the Chicago Tribune's 
John Kass (6/27/02) ran under the headline, &quot;Ruling on Pledge Is a Slap in 
Face to All Americans.&quot; Marc Howard Wilson (Chicago Tribune, 6/28/02) called 
it &quot;typical San Francisco lunacy&quot; and &quot;misguided grandstanding.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a twist, the L.A. Times (6/28/02) 
ran a feature by staff writer Martin Miller, who described himself as an atheist 
but attacked the non-believer whose lawsuit prompted the decision as &quot;sullen, 
cantankerous and litigious...intolerant, pushy and self-righteous.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Compared to these harsh 
attacks on the ruling, supporters were muted. The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne 
(6/28/02) mustered half a cheer for the decision in an op-ed headlined &quot;Wrong 
for the Right Reasons.&quot; The Chicago Tribune's Eric Zorn (6/27/02) noted that 
he had criticized mandatory recitations of the Pledge in the past, and invited 
readers to view those columns on his website.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Susan Jacoby in Newsday 
(6/28/02) narrowly endorsed the opinion as &quot;entirely correct in constitutional 
terms,&quot; although she wished that the Pledge were &quot;a more substantive 
issue.&quot; Libertarian conservative James Pinkerton (L.A. Times, 6/28/02) produced 
the most robust defense of the appeals court justices, praising their &quot;historical 
wisdom&quot; (although calling their ruling &quot;poorly thought out&quot;).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though support for the court ruling 
was limited in the leading U.S. papers, the criticisms of the decision in some 
ways backed up the court's reasoning. Several critics adopted the position of 
the appeals court's dissenter, saying that &quot;under God&quot; is not an establishment 
of religion because it is a &quot;rote civic exercise&quot; (New York Times, 6/27/02), 
a &quot;harmless civic recitation&quot; (Newsday, 6/28/02) with &quot;such a minimal 
religious effect&quot; (New York Times, 6/28/02). &quot;God's name is just a frill, 
a space-filler in the unthinking torrent of much daily conversation,&quot; claimed 
Fisher in the Washington Post (6/27/02).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But at the same time, many 
opponents of the decision warned that it could provoke a powerful, emotional response 
from believers. The New York Times</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
(6/27/02) warned that it was &quot;inviting a political backlash,&quot; whose 
effects Rosen spelled out in the paper the next day: &quot;That ruling will almost 
certainly galvanize Republicans to push for the appointment of conservative judges 
who will seek to place religion in the center of public life.&quot; The Washington 
Post (6/27/02) noted that the ruling &quot; can only serve to generate unnecessary 
political battles and create a fundraising bonanza for the many groups who will 
rush to its defense.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those are fairly serious consequences 
for the cessation of a &quot;rote civic exercise.&quot; Indeed, the vitriolic 
attacks against the decision, and the warnings of what Christians and other monotheists 
might do if the Pledge were not maintained as is, bolstered the appeals court's 
finding that including &quot;under God&quot; was &quot;not a mere acknowledgment 
that many Americans believe in a deity&quot; or &quot;merely descriptive of the 
undeniable historical significance of religion in the founding of the republic,&quot; 
but rather &quot;an impermissible government endorsement of religion&quot; that 
&quot;sends a message to unbelievers 'that they are outsiders, not full members 
of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they 
are insiders, favored members of the political community.'&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Granted, some of the defenders stood 
up for the Pledge because of, rather than despite, its religious content. &quot;The 
sentiment that this is a land blessed has been accepted since Pilgrim days,&quot; 
asserted the Daily News (6/27/02). The Tribune's Kass (6/27/02) wondered whether 
his children will be &quot;jailed for having any dangerous and heretical beliefs, 
like a belief in God.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most disingenuous assertions 
in support of the Pledge status quo related to the purpose of adding &quot;under 
God&quot;-- an important constitutional question, since church/state separation 
questions typically hinge on the secular intent of governmental action.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The pledge, taken as a whole, 
was not intended to be a coercive prayer, but was designed to promote patriotism, 
and as such is consistent with the neutrality principle,&quot; wrote Rosen (New 
York Times, 6/28/02). Editorialized the Daily News (6/17/02): &quot;The two words, 
viewed in the context of the entire pledge, have nothing whatsoever to do with 
avowing fealty to God.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet if one can believe President 
Dwight Eisenhower, who signed the bill that added &quot;under God&quot; to the 
Pledge, that is precisely what altering the oath was meant to accomplish. &quot;In 
this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's 
heritage and future,&quot; Eisenhower announced at the time (Columbus Dispatch, 
6/28/02). &quot;From this day forward, the millions of our schoolchildren will 
daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and every rural schoolhouse, 
the dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty.&quot;</font></p>
