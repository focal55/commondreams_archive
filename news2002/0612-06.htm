- June 12 - Arms control and missile 
experts criticized the U.S. withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic 
Missile (ABM) Treaty, which becomes effective tomorrow, June 13. 
President George W. Bush announced his intention to withdraw from 
the 1972 pact with Russia last December claiming that the treaty 
hinders the U.S. ability to develop ways to protect the country 
from long-range ballistic missile attack. Yet arms control experts 
say that scrapping the treaty will not accelerate deployment of 
workable missile defenses and that more effective, less costly 
steps should be pursued to address the threat from global missile 
proliferation. In addition, they argue that missile defenses are 
ineffective against more likely and more immediate threats to U.S. 
security, which demand greater attention. </FONT>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty does not increase the 
likelihood that the United States will soon deploy effective and 
reliable missile defenses because the technology remains unproven 
and unreliable,&quot; said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the 
independent Arms Control Association. &quot;The sole U.S. anti-ballistic 
missile system now being tested to counter long-range ballistic 
missiles is very rudimentary, comprised mostly of surrogate and 
prototype components that have not been tested in real-world 
scenarios. Testing for this system could have continued without 
violating the ABM Treaty for several more years,&quot; Kimball noted. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bush administration is constructing a new, ground-based 
strategic missile defense site at Fort Greely, Alaska, where five 
missile interceptors are to be put in place by 2004. While the 
Pentagon claims the interceptors will be for testing purposes, it 
also contends they could be used in an emergency if needed. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Pentagon has not even produced let alone realistically 
tested the missiles, nor has it built an effective radar to track 
and discriminate potential targets and guide the interceptor 
missiles,&quot; said John Rhinelander, who served as the U.S. legal 
adviser to the SALT I delegation, which negotiated the ABM Treaty. 
Rhinelander described the Bush administration's proposed Fort 
Greely missile defense site as a &quot;Potemkin village,&quot; explaining, 
&quot;There is no there there. It is merely a facade without 
substance.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Philip Coyle, the former director of the Pentagon's office of 
operational test and evaluation, wrote in a May 2002 article in 
Arms Control Today, &quot;Despite the Bush administration's push for 
missile defense, the only system likely to be ready by 2008 is a 
ground-based theater missile defense intended to counter 
short-range targets.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other independent experts suggest that the Bush administration's 
obsession with missile defense is misplaced -- an assertion 
supported by a December 2001 U.S. intelligence community report, 
which finds that &quot;U.S. territory is more likely to be attacked with 
(chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) materials from 
non-missile delivery means -- most likely from terrorists -- than 
by missiles, primarily because non-missile delivery means are less 
costly, easier to acquire, and more reliable and accurate.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Richard Garwin, a physicist who served on the 1998 
Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United 
States (also known as the Rumsfeld Commission), notes, &quot;Fifteen 
million standard cargo containers enter the United States every 
year with a minute chance of being inspected. Why should a nation 
with a few ICBMs risk their being destroyed pre-emptively when 
other means are available for delivery?&quot; In the case of a 
possible biological weapons attack, Garwin said, &quot;The least likely 
and probably least effective attack method would be by a long-range 
ballistic missile.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The highest hurdle to a foreign country or a terrorist group 
attacking the United States with a nuclear weapon is getting the 
necessary elements, which underscores the pressing need for the 
United States to help Russia secure, and eventually destroy, its 
huge stockpiles of warheads and weapons-usable 
materials,&quot; Kimball said. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly called the 
U.S. ABM decision a mistake, has largely muted the Kremlin's 
reaction to the treaty withdrawal because of his desire to secure 
a legally binding nuclear reductions agreement with the United 
States, which took place May 24, and Moscow's general interest in 
improving U.S.-Russian relations. But the longer-range consequences 
of the U.S. action on future U.S.-Russian relations are difficult 
to predict. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Spurgeon Keeny, a former deputy director of the U.S. Arms 
Control and Disarmament Agency, believes that, &quot;Russia will move 
more slowly in reducing its strategic forces until it sees the 
direction of U.S. missile defense deployment and military doctrine. 
More ambitious U.S. missile defense plans coupled with concepts of 
pre-emption will produce calls in Russia for maintenance and 
strengthening of its strategic arsenal, which is the only 
force capable of threatening U.S. survival.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;President Bush's unilateral withdrawal from the ABM Treaty sets 
a dangerous precedent,&quot; cautioned John Steinbruner, director of the 
Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland. &quot;If the 
United States chooses to abrogate formal international agreements 
in defiance of the legitimate objections of the other parties, they 
are encouraged to act in the same manner,&quot; suggested Steinbruner. 
&quot;The most fundamental interest of the United States is to establish 
and defend the rule of law. Military power is a supplement not a 
substitute for legal protection.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The U.S. withdrawal reveals the Bush administration's arrogant 
disdain for world opinion and its own commitments under the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). This will make it more difficult for 
the United States to exercise leadership in organizing the 
international community to implement nonproliferation measures, and 
it provides a dangerous precedent for non-nuclear-weapon states to 
reject their NPT commitments to forgo nuclear weapons,&quot; Keeny 
asserted. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The United States must pursue a more balanced approach to the 
missile proliferation challenge,&quot; advised Kimball. &quot;Strategic 
missile defenses must still be proven to be operationally effective 
and their deployment may still lead other states to pursue 
destabilizing offensive countermeasures. Efforts must be redoubled 
to address missile proliferation at its source, such as 
resuming talks with North Korea on a verifiable and permanent 
freeze on its missile production, testing, and exports.&quot; </font></p>
