- May 8 - "Follow 
              the money and you will find what we truly care about and stand for 
              as a nation," said Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president 
              of the Children's Defense Fund. "Budgets represent moral and social 
              choices&#151;not just economic ones. It is time to make better choices 
              to protect our children."</font>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
              a new report, <i><a href="http://www.childrensdefense.org/pdf/minigreenbook.pdf" target="_new">The 
              State of Children in America's Union: A 2002 Action Guide to Leave 
              No Child Behind</a>® </i>(PDF: 2268K)<i>,</i> 
              the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) assesses the state of children 
              in our nation; how well the Bush administration has kept its promises 
              to Leave No Child Behind®&#151;CDF's trademarked mission 
              statement; and calls on the President and Congress to increase funding 
              for quality child care to help more families work and 2 million 
              more children get ready for school. </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"CDF's 
              proposed $20 billion child care funding increase is a step towards 
              providing child care for all eligible children at a time when the 
              federal Child Care and Development Block Grant, which Congress must 
              reauthorize this year along with the 1996 welfare law, is reaching 
              only one in seven eligible children," CDF President Marian Wright 
              Edelman said. </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 
              administration's welfare proposals require poor mothers to work 
              more hours but provide not a single new penny for child care over 
              the next five years. Rather than freezing child care and after-school 
              funding and the number of children in Head Start as the Bush administration 
              budget proposes, the nation should demand that Congress and the 
              administration freeze and repeal the tax breaks for the wealthiest 
              one percent of Americans instead," Mrs. Edelman stated.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              CDF report follows the money and finds the administration's budget 
              deeds do not match its promises to Leave No Child Behind&reg;. </font></p>
<ul>
              
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The administration 
                hails Head Start as the nation's "premier early childhood education 
                program." Its 2002 budget would have cut children from Head Start 
                and its 2003 budget will not give even one more child a Head Start. 
                <br>
                <br>
                </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "The biggest 
                percentage of our budget should go to our children's education. 
                Education is my top priority," President Bush said in February 
                2001. His 2002 budget then proposed 40 times more money for tax 
                cuts than for education, according to the Center for Budget and 
                Policy Priorities.<br>
                <br>
                </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In January 
                2002, with great fanfare, the President signed his "No Child Left 
                Behind" (H.R. 1) education reform bill and "vowed to make educating 
                every child his number one domestic priority." The administration's 
                2003 budget proposed the smallest education increase in the past 
                seven years.<br>
                <br>
                </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In his inaugural 
                address, President Bush rightly declared that "deep, persistent 
                poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise." His 2002 budget 
                then proposed a $1.6 trillion tax cut that disproportionately 
                benefited the wealthy. It also proposed to double the child tax 
                credit from $500 to $1,000 but only for upper and middle income 
                families, leaving 17 million children behind, including a majority 
                of Black and Latino children. In 2003, the administration seeks 
                to accelerate and make permanent the huge tax cuts enacted by 
                Congress for the wealthiest Americans. <br>
                <br>
                </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The administration 
                says it is important for families to work and its welfare proposals 
                require more hours of work from poor parents. But its budget will 
                result in 114,000 fewer children in working families getting federal 
                child care assistance despite long child care waiting lists in 
                many states. <br>
                <br>
                </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the 2000 
                Republican National Convention, Secretary of State Colin Powell 
                eloquently stated, "We are obliged to make sure that every child 
                gets a healthy start in life. With all of our wealth and capacity, 
                we just can't stand by idly." The administration's 2002 and 2003 
                budgets leave millions of uninsured children behind including 
                immigrant children and thousands of children with disabilities 
                whose parents cannot get them needed treatment. </font></li>
</ul>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 
              Bush administration's budget choices favor powerful corporate interests 
              and the wealthiest taxpayers over children's urgent needs; widen 
              the gap between rich and poor&#151;already at its largest recorded 
              point in over 30 years; and repeatedly break promises and fail to 
              seize opportunities to Leave No Child Behind&reg;," said Mrs. Edelman. 
              </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              report states that the money spent for the tax cut for the wealthiest 
              one percent of Americans when fully phased in could pay for almost 
              all the provisions of the comprehensive Act to Leave No Child Behind 
              (S. 940/H.R. 1990) including quality child care, Head Start, after-school 
              programs, health care, nutrition, protections against child abuse, 
              neglect and homelessness, and lift millions of children in working 
              families from poverty. Yet, in the richest and most powerful democratic 
              nation in the world: </font></p>
<ul>
              
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A child 
                is born into poverty every 43 seconds.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A child 
                is born without health insurance every minute&#151;90 percent 
                of the nine million uninsured children live in working families. 
                </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Seven million 
                children are home alone without adult supervision often after 
                school when they are at greatest risk of getting into trouble. 
                </font></li>
</ul>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These 
              facts are not acts of God. They are our moral and political choices 
              as Americans," said Mrs. Edelman. "It is time for our great nation 
              to truly commit to Leave No Child Behind&reg; and to lead rather 
              than lag behind many other nations of the world in giving our children 
              a healthy and fair start in life." </font></p>
