- May 3 -  Greenpeace today presented the French authorities and the European Commission an analysis of the flawed risk-assessment of Novatis' genetically engineered maize and called for an immediate ban of the crops. The independent report shows that studies submitted by Novartis to environmental authorities in Europe to prove the safety of its insect resistant Bt crops were inappropriate and scientifically flawed. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is the first time independent scientists have assessed the studies presented to the competent authorities and the result is devastating," said Arnaud Apoteker of Greenpeace. "It is alarming that the experts of the French authority as well as the members of the European Commission's scientific committees could be deceived by such false assumptions and shoddy methodology. And at the same time the European Commission has ignored all new evidence on the environmental impact of Bt-maize submitted to it by Greenpeace."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EcoStrat, a Swiss scientific consultancy specialised in ecological assessments of biotechnology, reports that studies submitted by Novartis to assess the impact of the Bt-maize on non-target insects were designed so poorly that there was virtually no chance to observe any adverse effects. Yet the French competent authority accepted these studies as sound scientific evidence and advised that the altered crops were harmless to insects.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to EcoStrat most of the industry studies did not simulate the insects feeding habits realistically and it is questionable whether the animals actually ingested the toxin to be tested at all. The studies used inadequate methods derived from chemical toxicity testing and ignored food chain interactions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace calls upon the French government to immediately ban the Novartis maize and demands that the European Commission withdraw the European approval for the controversial crop. Greenpeace will also submit the report to the French Conseil d'Etat, which will rule on the legality of the approval of the maize in the coming weeks. "We expect the French government and the European Commission to request a detailed report from their scientists and we suggest an independent investigation in their overall practices," added Apoteker.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite EU approval, commercial growing of Novartis maize is presently banned in France, Austria, Luxembourg and Germany. Commercial growing only takes place in small quantities in Spain. In the US, where the use of GE maize declined in 2000 from 35 to 19 per cent, a court case against all Bt-plants initiated by Greenpeace and 70 farmers organisations is still pending.
