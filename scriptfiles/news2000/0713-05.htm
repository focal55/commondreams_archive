- July 13 - In the wake of the



disastrous failure of the third test of the National Missile



Defense (NMD) system on July 7, 2000, Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL)



will today introduce an amendment to the Defense Authorization



Bill which, if passed, would force the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile



Defense Organization (BMDO) to revamp its testing program. It also



prevents deployment until NMD can be truly shown to work.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) today welcomed this



move to prevent an ideological rush to deploy NMD and called on



President Clinton to cancel plans to deploy the system by 2005.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This major system failure shows NMD simply won't work. Even if



it was technically perfect, NMD would be the wrong prescription for



America," said Anne Gallivan, Associate Director for Security



Programs. "This system will not protect a single American. The only



certain answer to missile threats is disarmament negotiation and



de-alerting of the thousands of missiles that threaten us."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Backing this call, PSR today publishes an Issue Brief on



National Missile Defense, laying out the problems with the system



that make it a disaster for American and global security. These



include:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The false sense of security NMD gives military policy makers,



encouraging them to take unilateral, aggressive action;



-- The increased threat to US security by the undermining of 40



years of arms control;



-- The waste of up to $120 billion on a non-functioning system;



-- The provocation of an arms race with Russia and China.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If the FDA approved a new drug partway through a testing



program, after two out of three tests failed, its director and



scientists would be fired. If I prescribed such a drug, I would be



endangering my patients and should lose my license," said Peter



Wilk, MD, President of PSR. "National Missile Defense is



endangering millions of Americans, and its supporters should lose



their license to practice at the polls in November."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In place of NMD, PSR is prescribing several genuine security



measures to make America and the world a safer place. These are:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The immediate de-alerting of all nuclear arsenals, removing



the possibility of an accidental launch;



-- Cancellation of programs which could rekindle an arms race,



such as NMD;



-- The commencement of negotiations to reduce, and eventually



eliminate, nuclear, biological and chemical weapon threats.
