- September 28 - Today leaders of the Michigan Chapter of Sierra Club

     criticized Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Secretary of Defense

     Richard Cheney for their support for energy and other policies that

     could harm the Great Lakes and the health of Michigan residents.  Both

     Bush and Cheney have extensive records of opposition to clean water

     programs and other environmental safeguards vital to Michigan.  The

     Sierra Club urged Bush and Cheney to oppose oil drilling in the Great

     Lakes, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, and in other

     fragile places.



<p>"The Bush-Cheney energy plan promises a new assault on the safeguards

     that protect the blue waters of the Great Lakes and the blue skies of

     the Great Lake State," said Daniel Farough, Voter Education

     Coordinator, Michigan Chapter of Sierra Club.  "Their plan for

     addressing high oil prices include drilling in fragile areas,

     weakening health standards to build energy facilities, and helping oil

     companies -- all at the expense of Michigan's working families."

<p>During a visit to Traverse City, Michigan, earlier this week, Cheney

     said that he "didn't know" whether he would support or oppose drilling

     for oil underneath the Great Lakes. (AP, 9-26-00) "Slant drilling"

     under the Great Lakes could devastate the Lakes' fragile coastlines if

     there were a leak, spill or other accident as have occurred at Prudhoe

     Bay and many oil drilling sites around the world.



<p>"It's shocking that Gov. Bush and Mr. Cheney would consider drilling

     for oil under the Great Lakes.  That's like saying they would use the

     Mona Lisa for tissue paper.  Their thirst to increase oil drilling

     could devastate the Great Lakes -- Michigan's life blood," added

     Farough.



<p>Farough cited a number of other anti-environmental statements and

     positions taken by Gov. Bush and Mr. Cheney:



<p>* Gov. Bush's energy plan is likely to include a call for "more

     domestic exploration" ( CNN, 9-27-00). In a speech on September 21,

     2000, Bush said, "I believe we need to open up ANWR, which is in

     Alaska, and believe we can do so in an environmentally friendly way."

     Unfortunately, oil production in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska has been very

     dirty.  There are over hundreds of oil spills annually, with thousands

     of gallons of oil.  Last year, BP-Amoco was fined $22 million for

     illegally dumping toxic waste at Prudhoe Bay oil fields.



<p>* Cheney said "I think we ought to develop the ANWR reserves in

     Alaska.  In my opinion it would be silly not to."  (9/21/00)



<p>* "Bush intends to call for greater domestic oil exploration and less

     regulatory red tape that has hampered the development of new

     refineries, electric generating plants and natural gas pipelines."

     (Detroit News, 9-28-00)  Many of these rules derided by Bush are

     designed to protect people from water and air pollution.



<p>* Bush's energy plan is likely to benefit oil companies.  "I'll have

     an energy policy which will empower producers," he said on September

     1, 2000,



<p>* Gov. Bush weakened water quality standards for a number of Texas

     rivers and lakes, threatening recreational angling in some of these

     waters.  (Beaumont Express, 7-27-00) Texas has the third highest

     amount of toxic industrial discharges into surface waters, and toxic

     water pollution has increased by 15% under Bush.  (Toxics Release

     Inventory, Environmental Protection Agency, 5-11-00)



<p>* Bush has opposed enforcement or legislative action to protect the

     environment.  He said: "I don't think you can litigate clean air and

     clean water. I don't think you can legislate clean air and clean

     water." (Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 8-12-00) Texas has the most clean

     water violations of any state in the nation. (U.S. PIRG, 2-00)



<p>* Cheney was one of only eight House members to vote against the

     renewal of the Clean Water Act.  Every Senator and Representative from

     Michigan voted for it. (H.R. 1, 1-8-87)



<p>The Sierra Club has 630,000 members nationwide, including 18,000 in

     Michigan.
