- September 29 - The following was



released today by the Open Debate Society:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The People Will Say in Boston OPEN THE DEBATES!

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Hundreds of Students Besiege Commission on Presidential Debates

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 8 Arrested During Early Morning Sit-in; 85,000 Sign Petition



for Nader

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eight members of the Open Debate Society were arrested yesterday



at the offices of the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD)



and charged with unlawful entry. For the past three weeks picket



line speak-outs and non-violent direct actions have erupted



at the corporate headquarters of Wagner Communications and the



Brewer Consulting Group, Inc., firms located at 1200 New Hampshire



Avenue, the address given on the CPD's Web site and literature.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next Tuesday, October 3, thousands of democracy activists are



expected to protest in Boston, site of the first CPD event with



George W. Bush and Al Gore. Civil disobedience and disruptions are



expected. Citizens will march on Oct. 3 at 5 p.m. from Dudley



Square in Boston to the University of Massachusetts, site of debates.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The debates are the All-Star Game of American politics," says



Adam Eidinger, an organizer with the Open Debate Society. "Players



don't get to decide who's in the All-Star game, people do." Citizens



say numerous surveys of likely voters reveal a great deal of support



exists for the Green Party's Ralph Nader (60.9 percent) and Reform



candidate Pat Buchanan (58.7 percent) to be allowed to participate

in



the presidential debates.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eidinger and students from George Washington University and the



University of Maryland delivered 85,000 petitions to the CPD today



for Ralph Nader to be admitted. Local police mediated a tense



situation when building management refused to allow the activists in,



despite an agreement reached the day before to allow the activists



into the building at 9 a.m. D.C. Police officer Rayford Larkin



carried the petitions to the offices of Wagner and Brewer ending the



dispute.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Open Debate Society occupied the offices of Wagner and Brewer



in the early morning hours on Sept 20 and debated employees face to



face about the illegitimate nature of the CPD itself. The protests,



part of efforts nationwide to open the debates to third party



candidates, have focused on corporate sponsors of the debates while



others have targeted the regional offices of the Bush and Gore



campaigns. Attacking the two candidates' unwillingness to talk about



issues like the death penalty, globilization, human rights and



defense spending, some protests have resulted in day long occupations



and annoying hecklers at public events as was seen yesterday when



Gore spoke at the Brookings Institute.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Eidinger, "The CPD is a stealthy private corporation



controlled by the Republican and Democratic parties and funded by



Anheuser-Busch, 3 Com, and U.S. Airways." For more information on the



sit-in please visit <a href="http://www.sinkers.org">http://www.sinkers.org</a>
