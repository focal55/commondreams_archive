- October 20 - Calling on Vice President



Al Gore to fulfil his promise to shut down the most controversial



hazardous waste incinerator in the U.S., Ohio activists and residents



are headed to Washington, D.C. where they are prepared to engage



in civil disobedience next week.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protest will focus on Al Gore's pledge, made both



immediately before and immediately after the 1992 election, to



block the operation of the WTI incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio.



(1) The incinerator, which releases highly toxic substances into



the air, is located just 400 yards from an elementary school and



320 feet from the nearest home. Despite Gore's promise and the 130



plus violations of WTI's operating permit since the facility



opened, the incinerator continues to operate.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter delivered to Gore at the White House earlier this



week, the residents and activists said they are prepared to engage



in peaceful, non-violent civil disobedience to convince the



administration it must suspend operation of the facility and deny



WTI a renewal of its operating permit which expired in 1995. (2)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If anything were ever to happen to the children in the school



or neighborhood, we would never forgive ourselves had we not done



everything in our power to prevent it," the letter said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups expressed concern that the National EPA Ombudsman's



"expedited and independent" review of WTI's permit, which the



Administration promised by mid-May, is only now about to be



released. However, the documentation gathered by the Ombudsman



contains more than enough evidence to require a shutdown of the



incinerator. (3) In addition, under Ohio law enacted in 1984, it



would be illegal to site the WTI incinerator at its current



location.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Activists and residents campaigning against the site are working



closely with the international environmental organization



Greenpeace which has run a long-standing campaign to eliminate



dioxin emissions and ban the incineration of hazardous wastes in



favor of safer alternatives.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Every day that the incinerator operates is another day the risk



goes up for the people of East Liverpool. The Vice President must



use his influence to shut the WTI incinerator down," said



Greenpeace campaigner Rick Hind. "Allowing it to operate is like



telling a drunk driver to stay on the road as long as he follows



the speed limit."
