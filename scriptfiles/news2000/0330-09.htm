- March 30 - The United Steelworkers of America today noted that the removal of Oregon Steel Mills, Inc. (NYSE: OS) from the Standard & Poor's MidCap 400 Index was another sign of the company's mounting problems.



<p>“The decision by Standard & Poor's to remove Oregon Steel from the MidCap 400 Index shows that the outside world shares our union's concerns about this company's future direction and financial performance,” said Terry Bonds, Director of USWA District 12, which covers the southwestern United States. The USWA is involved in a long-running labor dispute at Oregon Steel's CF&I Steel subsidiary, now doing business as Rocky Mountain Steel Mills.



<p>On Wednesday, Standard and Poor's announced that Oregon Steel Mills would be replaced by Energizer Holdings Inc. in the S&P MidCap 400 Index.  Oregon Steel was removed, according to an  S&P spokesperson, because its market capitalization had declined to such an extend that it was no longer a midcap stock representative of the U.S. steel industry.



<p>The company's share price was $4.00 at the close of the market today, down from a recent high of $15.67 on April 30, 1999. Oregon Steel's stock was at $28.00 when the current labor dispute with the USWA began on October 3, 1997.



<p>The erosion in the company's share price has reduced its market capitalization to just $105 million as of the close of the market today, compared to $208 million as of December 31, 1999 and $514 million as of December 31, 1997 



<p>"Financial markets and ratings services don't always agree with labor unions," Bonds said.  "It has become clear to the markets and analysts what we have known for quite some time: Oregon Steel's management is focused on waging a war against its employees, not on making steel or making money."



<p>The S&P MidCap 400 will have four companies in the iron and steel industry following the removal of Oregon Steel: AK Steel Holding Corp., Carpenter Technology, Cleveland-Cliffs and UCAR International.



<p>The company's Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this week revealed that it is attempting to restructure its debt and warned that its ". . . level of indebtedness presents other risks to investors, including the possibility that the company and its subsidiaries may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on their indebtedness when due."



<p>Members of United Steelworkers Locals 2102 and 3267 went on strike against Oregon Steel’s CF&I Steel subsidiary on October 3, 1997, to protest the company’s unfair labor practices and substandard contract offer. When they ended their strike three months later, management unlawfully refused to reinstate the vast majority of Steelworkers to their jobs, exposing the company to a potential back-pay liability that could reach $300 million if litigated to the end of the appeals process.
