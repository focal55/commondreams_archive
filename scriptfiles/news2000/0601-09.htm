- June 1 - The U.S. Department of Agriculture deliberately covered up

evidence of diseased chicken being approved for consumers, and attempted to retaliate

against the meat inspectors who brought the problem to light, a group of 28 consumer and

civic watchdog groups charged Thursday in a letter to Thomas Billy, director of the Food

Safety and Inspection Service of USDA. </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter charged that Billy himself showed total disregard for the Whistleblower

Protection Act when he said at a February 15 meeting with inspectors that employees who

talked to reporters about the situation &quot;should have anticipated that there may be

some risks to those that are involved in it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The diseased chicken was approved under a new experimental slaughterhouse inspection

system that shifts much of the responsibility for inspection from federal inspectors to

the company itself.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last fall when the new system began on a pilot basis at the Gold Kist plant in

Guntersville, Alabama, meat inspectors expressed concern that the plant was allowing

diseased chicken to enter the food supply. On February 6, there were news reports that

adulterated chickens were being approved at the plant and processed as chicken nuggets for

the school lunch program. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response, a senior government manager was sent to the plant on February 8 and the

Office of Inspector General began a &quot;preliminary inquiry&quot; on February 9. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have no reason to believe product leaving these Gold Kist plants is anything

other than safe and wholesome,&quot; the USDA press release said. But internal agency

documents reveal that the senior manager, Karen Henderson, confirmed most of the

inspector&#146;s charges that diseased chicken was receiving the USDA seal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As soon as she arrived the plant added two &quot;sorters&quot; to the three already on

the line to examine the chickens for filth and disease. The plant also slowed the line

speed from 130 birds a minute to 51. Even then she found that some diseased birds passed

all company controls. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Company records show that before her visit the plant was producing 177,000 birds a day,

and condemning only 5.5 per cent. After her visit the plant cut production to 115,000

birds a day and condemned 33 per cent. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These facts present a classic example of the value and necessity of

whistleblowers,&quot; the letter to Billy said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the Office of Inspector General began its investigation, instead of determining

the facts, investigators asked meat inspectors if they had released data to reporters, and

whether they spoke to reporters while on or off duty, a question that clearly indicated an

intention to seek disciplinary action against them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Felicia Nestor, Food Safety Project Director at the Government Accountability Project,

told members of the OIG staff by phone that these kinds of questions were illegal under

the Whistleblower Protection Act. The response was to end the investigation, indicating

that it&#146;s purpose was to punish the whistleblowers, not determine whether adulterated

food was going out to consumers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are especially concerned about this,&quot; the letter said, &quot;because

collusion to discredit whistleblowers is recognized as one of the prime motivations behind

many retaliatory investigations.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Your agency showed disrespect for its own inspectors and violated the public

trust when you repeatedly led the public to believe that there was proof their allegations

were wrong,&quot; the letter said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Signing the letter, in addition to Nestor from GAP, were Joan Claybrook, president of

Public Citizen, Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute,

Joseph Mendelson, legal director of the Center for Food Safety, and representatives from

23 other civic and consumer protection organizations. </font></p>
