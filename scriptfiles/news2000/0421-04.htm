- April 21 - In connection with Earth Day, the following people are available for

interviews:

<br>

A staff attorney with the Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund specializing in

Clean Water Act litigation, Boyles said: "As we celebrate Earth Day 2000, it

's important to remember that all life on our planet depends on water.

Unfortunately, clean water is fast becoming a scarce commodity in the United

States. Despite our need for clean water, there are currently attacks on the

Clean Water Act in Congress which would undermine laws protecting our

rivers, lakes and streams."

Legislative director of the Greenpeace Toxics Campaign, Hind said today:

"The administration has not been as good as their advertising on the

environment. For example, on dioxin issues -- such as incinerators and paper

industry pollution -- they have broken promises and flip-flopped. On the

consumer level, while the European Community has banned vinyl plastic toys

that contain toxic additives, the administration has only called for

voluntary measures by industry. Of course, G. W. Bush is an F student when

it comes to the environment, but Gore is billed as an A student so when he

gets a D, it's even more disappointing."

<br>

Wysham is a research fellow with the Institute for Policy Studies and

author of several recent reports documenting disproportionate investments in

fossil fuels by the World Bank and other public investment institutions. She

remarked today: "Although the World Bank readily admits that climate change

will be deadly to many of the poorest people living in the countries it

purports to serve, it nevertheless is doling out billions of dollars each

year to coal, oil, and gas projects around the world."

"Greenwash" Awards coordinator for Corporate Watch, Srivastava said today:

"This year's Earth Day, which focuses on energy and global warming, is

bringing with it a deluge of deception from the oil and car companies most

directly responsible for the climate problem. Corporate Watch has awarded

Ford Motor Company the Grand Prize in its virtual Earth Day 2000 Greenwash

Sweepstakes Awards for attempting to cast a positive light on its

environmental record, which is one of the worst of any automaker. Ford will

spend as much money on its environmental image as it would on promoting a

new model of automobile.  It launched its PR campaign by buying nearly 40

percent of the pages in Time magazine's Earth Day special issue.  Runners up

in the Sweepstake include the World Bank, Monsanto, Shell, Chevron and

Unocal."</font>
