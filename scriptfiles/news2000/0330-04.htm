- March 30 - To protect the earth’s climate from the production and burning 

of fossil fuels, and to defend Inupiat subsistence culture from environmental threats,  

Greenpeace and Inupiat Eskimos filed opening legal briefs today in a court action against BP Amoco’s 

Northstar offshore oil project, now under construction on the frozen Arctic Ocean. 

The case, filed in San Francisco’s Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 

challenges the federal government for permitting the project, despite the fact 

it lacks an adequate oil spill plan. 

<p>

"The Arctic Ocean is our garden, and we cannot afford to have it contaminated by oil spills 

and industrialization. This lawsuit is about protecting our subsistence resources and culture 

for future generations," said Bill Tegoseak, an Inupiat Eskimo who resides in Barrow, Alaska. 

"The Inupiat people have relied on the Arctic Ocean for sustenance for thousands of years. 

Sunakkiniagniq Inuuniaqusiqput. Our life is our subsistence." 

<p>

The court case is the latest in a series of challenges to BP Amoco’s Arctic drilling plans.  

For the past month Greenpeace has maintained a base camp on the frozen ocean to monitor the 

Northstar massive construction site, just a short distance away.  And on April 13th at the 

company’s annual general meeting in London shareholders will vote on a resolution that calls 

on BP Amoco to switch away from Arctic oil drilling and instead concentrate investments in solar power. 

<p>

Specifically, the papers filed today charge that in approving the project, the federal 

Mineral Management Service and other federal agencies violated the Outer Continental 

Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Specific concerns focus 

on a defective oil spill response plan and absence of a site-specific oil spill trajectory analysis, 

which would assess where oil spilled from the pipeline or from the facility itself would spread. 

The case is expected to be heard by a federal court in mid-summer. 

<p>

In a related action, on Tuesday, March 28, Greenpeace filed an appeal with the Alaska 

Superior Court in Anchorage against the Alaska Department of Natural Resources.  

The appeal alleges the illegal use of freshwater in the construction of ice roads for the 

Northstar Project. In just two years of ice-road construction, BP has used close to the entire 

amount of water the Final Environmental Impact Statement predicted would be used for the entire 

15-year lifetime of the project.  

<p>

"BP Amoco, in collaboration with federal and state authorities, are trampling on a 

wide range of environmental safeguards to get Northstar up and running," said Dan Ritzman, 

Greenpeace climate change campaigner in Anchorage. "They cannot be allowed to 

ignore the laws designed to protect the people and the ecology of Alaska’s North Slope." 

<p>

Earlier this week, the District Court in Barrow changed the bail conditions imposed on the 

four Greenpeace members whom BP Amoco had State Police arrest for allegedly breaching the ‘no trespass’ 

zone around the Northstar site. Base leader Henk Haazen was allowed to return to Camp Sirius, 

but photographer Steve Morgan and activist Richard Watson were required to post 

substantial extra bail in order to return home prior to trial, currently scheduled for late May.  

Greenpeace USA campaigner Dan Ritzman was allowed to travel out of state on a case-by-case basis.
