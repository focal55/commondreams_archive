- July 20 - Leaders of the world's richest nations fled to the remote Pacific island of

Okinawa tonight after a meeting with leaders from Africa failed to produce a

new initiative to solve the debt crisis in the poorest countries.



<p>At an unprecedented 'Debt Summit' in Tokyo, five of the G8 heads, including

British Prime Minister Tony Blair, sat face to face for the first time with

the presidents of South Africa, Nigeria and Algeria as well as the Thai

prime minister.  However, immediately after the meeting the G8 leaders left

for their annual summit at the Busena Beach resort on Okinawa, adding to

fears that they will not take decisive action on debt.



<p>Olusegun Obasanjo, the Nigerian president and chair of the 'G77' group of

developing nations, said after the meeting: "I will be deeply sad,

disappointed and frustrated if they do not deliver more.  They must

reconsider in such a situation.  Today, the G8 nations admitted that last

year's HIPC deal was not enough.  They said some positive words, but these

must be followed by improvements and action."



<p>Campaigners from the international Jubilee 2000 movement are concerned that

the G8 will simply 'reannounce' their promises from last year's G8 summit in

Cologne.  The Cologne initiative would cut debts by only one-third, leaving

countries spending more on debt than on health care. It would also cover

only around 33 countries, leaving others like Nigeria, Haiti and Bangladesh

without debt cancellation. Even these limited promises are far from being

delivered.



<p>Ann Pettifor, Director of Jubilee 2000 UK, said: "If the G8 fail to deliver

a new deal on debt at the G8 summit, it will be the biggest insult of the

new millennium: to three African presidents here today, to Kofi Annan, the

Pope, the Dalai Lama and other religious leaders, to the 19 million who have

signed the Jubilee 2000 petition and to the billion people who suffer from

the consequences of debt."



<p>Earlier today, an international conference of Jubilee 2000 campaigners from

26 countries expressed its 'total dismay' at the failure of rich countries

to act on their promises to cancel debt and called for immediate

cancellation.  During the Okinawa G8 summit, more than 500 'summit watch'

events around the world will focus global attention on the leaders'

decisions on third world debt. Campaigners are expected to react angrily if

the G8 fail to act. 

<p>Notes to editors



<p>1.  In Cologne last year, the G8 promised the cancellation of $100 billion,

including 100 per cent of the debts owed to them bilaterally by

'HIPC'countries. Only nine countries have begun to receive small cuts in

payments and no debts have actually been canceled.

<p>3.  The Tokyo Debt Summit was attended by G8 leaders from the UK, France,

Italy, Japan and Canada as well as the four leaders from the South.
