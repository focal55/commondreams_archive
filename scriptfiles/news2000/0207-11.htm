<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BALTIMORE 

- February 7 - </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHO: <br>

On Sun., Dec. 19, Philip Berrigan and Susan Crane of Baltimore's

Jonah House, the Rev. Stephen Kelly, SJ, and Elizabeth Walz, a Catholic

Worker  from Philadelphia, calling themselves the Plowshares Vs. Depleted

Uranium,  disarmed two A-10 Warthog [Fairchild Thunderbolt II] aircraft.

Following  Isaiah's vision of a disarmed world, the activists hammered and

poured blood on  A-10s, because the Warthog, used against Iraq and

Yugoslavia, has a Gatling gun  which fires depleted uranium ammunition. The

four religious activists, for  reasons of conscience, refused to post bail

and remain in custody since their  arrest.







</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAT: <br>

A trial date has yet to be scheduled. However, a Maryland  grand jury

handed down an indictment on Jan. 18. The Plowshares activists are  now

facing the following charges:<br>

1] sabotage-–a maximum 10 years;<br>

2]

conspiracy  to commit sabotage—a maximum 10 years;<br>

3] malicious destruction

of property with  a property damage of more than $300--three years and/or

$2,500 fine;<br>

4]  conspiracy to maliciously destroy property--maximum three

years); and<br>

 5]  trespass--a maximum 90 days in jail and/or a $500 fine.<br>

<br>

The grand jury met in secret, and the defendants, who were not there, were

unable to present evidence refuting the charges. In fact, the activists

were not  informed until two weeks later of the new charges, carrying a

maximum sentence  of more than 26 years.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHEN: <br>

February 1, 2000







</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHERE: <br>

They were informed, while incarcerated:<br>

Philip Berrigan  #995-923, BCDC, 404 Kenilworth Ave, Towson MD 21204<br>

Susan Crane #995-375, 200  Court House Court, Towson MD 21204<br>

Steve Kelly SJ #995-924, BCDC, 404  Kenilworth Ave, Towson MD 21204<br>

Elizabeth Walz #995-376, 200 Court House  Court, Towson MD 21204







</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHY: <br>

It is assumed that Maryland prosecutors have been in contact  with

federal agencies, and an agreement was reached to press ahead with

extremely severe charges. Initial charges of burglary were replaced in the

indictment by sabotage and conspiracy to commit sabotage, as well as

conspiracy  to maliciously destroy property. The indictment defines

sabotage as follows: to  hinder, delay, or interfere with the preparation

of the United States for  defense or for war, or with the prosecution of

war by the United States.







</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Plowshares now struggle to prepare to stand trial against these

charges.  They are aided in their defense by Ramsey Clark, former U.S.

Attorney General,  and local attorney Jon Katz. In court, the defendants

will try to argue that the  A10s, using depleted uranium ammunition, are

offensive to humanity, decency, and  any definition of responsible conduct;

and they are a violation of the laws of  war, international law, and the

natural law. They will argue moral law and the  laws of God indict the

weapons not the people who resist them.







</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The religious activists were moved to resistance because of the

environmental  damage caused by the use of depleted uranium in Iraq and

Yugoslavia and the fact  the Pentagon sold DU ammunition to a host of other

countries, including Israel  and Turkey. In the Plowshares Vs. Depleted

Uranium's statement, they explained:  "The A-10 is an aircraft built around

a gun -- a 30 mm 7 barrel Gatling that can  spew 3,900 rounds per minute.

This criminal plane fired 95% of the depleted  uranium deployed by the U.S.

during the Gulf War, leaving behind 300-800 tons  [Dutch Laka Foundation]

poisoning humans and the elements in Kuwait and Iraq."  The statement

continued, "The U.S. has made another fatal mistake with depleted  uranium

-- it has given it away to a score of other countries, openly inviting

them to make their own weapons, fight their own nuclear wars and infest the

planet with more radiation."







</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The land and people of Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Bosnia have been

contaminated by the use of depleted uranium; and also afflicted are the

civilians who live adjacent to US military bases in Vieques, Puerto Rico

and  Okinawa, Japan, as well as neighborhoods near the manufacturers of

this toxic  weapon. It has even been injurious to the health of U.S. and

allied military  personnel who made contact with the ammunition.







</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There have been more than 70 Plowshares actions. The first took place on

Sept. 9, 1980, when Philip and Daniel Berrigan and six others hammered on

nuclear nose cones at a General Electric plant in King of Prussia,  Penn.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Philip Berrigan, Crane and Kelly were members of the Prince of  Peace

Plowshares, which disarmed an Aegis destroyer at the Bath [Maine] Iron

Works on Feb. 12, 1997. After Rev. Kelly served his sentence for the Maine

action and refused to cooperate with federal probation, he was being

pursued by  federal marshals.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Journalists are urged and welcome to visit  the four imprisoned

peacemakers. They are available for interviews.
