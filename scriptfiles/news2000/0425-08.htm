- April 25 - As participants from around the world gather at the United Nations for a

month-long conference to review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the

following policy analysts are available for interviews:

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JACQUELINE CABASSO, (212) 818-1861, <a href="mailto:wslf@earthlink.net">wslf@earthlink.net</a>,

<a href="http://www.abolition2000.org">http://www.abolition2000.org<br>

</a></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Executive director of the Western States Legal Foundation, Cabasso is at

the UN conference in New York. She said today: "The U.S. is doing a big PR

blitz trying to convince the rest of the world that it is in compliance with

Article VI of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which requires the

nuclear powers to negotiate the end of the arms race and the elimination of

nuclear weapons. In 1995, the NPT was extended with the understanding that

the nuclear powers would implement the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and

systematic nuclear disarmament. The U.S. signed the CTBT in 1996, but the

Senate has not ratified it and there have not been systematic efforts for

disarmament by the U.S. Meanwhile, Russia just approved the CTBT and

START II, and suggests going down very quickly to 1,500 strategic deployed

warheads. The U.S. has rejected this, saying it would not go below 2,500,

and has plans to go forward with National Missile Defense. Russia has said

that if that happens, it will withdraw from all arms control treaties. China

has made similar statements. It's an incredibly high-stakes game of nuclear

poker."

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JOHN BURROUGHS, (212) 818-1861, <a href="mailto:lcnp@lcnp.org">lcnp@lcnp.org</a>, <a href="http://www.lcnp.org">http://www.lcnp.org<br>

</a></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Executive director of the Lawyers' Committee on Nuclear Policy, Burroughs

is also at the conference. He said today: "The U.S. is on the defensive

because of the recent Russian ratification of the CTBT and approval of START

II. There's near-universal condemnation of the U.S. plans for systems that

would supposedly shoot down incoming missiles. Russia and the U.S. should

be talking about reducing and eliminating all their warheads -- short-range 

and

reserve as well as long-range. Instead, START II and START III, if they are

ever implemented, would still allow each side thousands of warheads in

addition to the 2,000 to 3,500 deployed on long-range missiles and bombers.

While the NPT requires that the U.S. move towards abolishing nuclear

weapons, Presidential Decision Directive 60, adopted in November 1997,

affirms that the U.S. will continue to rely on nuclear arms as a cornerstone

of its national security for the 'indefinite future'; the administration's

own pronouncements show that it is in violation of the NPT."

</a>Founder and director of the Downwinders organization, Truman was born in

Southern Utah in 1951. As a child living downwind of the Nevada Test Site,

he watched more than 30 atomic blasts. For the past 33 years, he has been

engaged in research and advocacy for all persons exposed to radiation from

nuclear activities. Today he said: "The low value that the U.S. government

gives to this important meeting is illustrated by the president and vice

president skipping the meeting, but instead going to a fundraiser nearby. At

the UN, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright claimed that the U.S. was the

world leader in the quest for nuclear disarmament. But the Russians just

passed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treat and START II. They are proposing

substantially cutting down the number of nuclear weapons, while the U.S.

refuses. We have a lot of explaining to do."
