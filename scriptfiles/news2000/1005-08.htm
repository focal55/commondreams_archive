<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Today interfaith religious communities across the

  nation organized an array of events for the second annual STOP the HATE: Interfaith

          Vigils Against Hate Violence campaign sponsored by The Interfaith Alliance

      Foundation and the Fellowship of Reconciliation.  As brutal stories of hate crimes

     continue to shock communities across our country,religious leaders are working in

       coalition with civic leaders and activists to raise awareness about the devastating

                                                  effects of hate in our society. 



                                                                          



 </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Our message is simple,hate is not a religious value, but an evil that distorts

 personhood among individuals and, within societies erodes justice and breeds

 violence,” said the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of The Interfaith

 Alliance Foundation.  



  



 </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Too often, these acts of violence desensitize our communities, creating a culture of

 powerlessness and isolation.  As religious leaders we have a moral obligation to

 challenge hatred and educate communities on its destructive powers.” 



  



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Below are highlights of events occurring across the nation. 



  



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In a Nassau County, Long Island, the Rev. Gaddy will join local religious leaders for

 an evening rally and program that will remember the local victims of hate crimes.  This

 evening’s event is expected to draw thousands of New Yorkers who will not only

 remember the victims of violence but share organizing strategies for challenging hate in

 their community.  



  



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On the other side of the country, Sudarshan Kapoor, a retired California State

 University Professor, has worked tirelessly to organize a series of events at the three

 major college campuses in Fresno, California. Themed, “Build the Culture of Peace,”

 events will include vigils,rallies, movies, workshops and celebrations engaging

 students, faculty and the community.  



  



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In Raleigh, North Carolina, The Interfaith Alliance of Wake County will be honoring

 the life of Roger Cody Jarman, Jr., a local man who was killed in an apparent

 hate crime.  



  



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In the Midwest, The Interfaith Alliance of Greater St. Louis will convene a vigil and a

 march designed to empower both religious leaders and lay activists in the fight against

 hate.  Prior the vigil,they will host a workshop for clergy and congregational leaders

 that will train religious leaders in addressing the social, economic and racial issues of

 their communities.  Then, another workshop will follow for youth leaders, campus

 ministers, and youth that will take a look at white supremacist use of music to recruit

 followers. 



  



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Last week in West Virginia, over 100 diverse students gathered at West Virginia

 University to participate in a STOP the HATE vigil.  The goal of the event was to “bring

 people together in a common cause.  If we can’t bring people together to oppose hatred

 and violence, we’re never going to get people together,” according to Bob

 Turner,director of the Baptist Campus Ministry at WVU.  



  



</font>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Uniting behind their shared values and spiritual commitment to creating a just society

 that respects the human dignity of its members, Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Buddhist

 and other faith leaders are organizing various events in their communities

 demonstrating the positive and healing role of religion in our nation,” said the Rev.

 Gaddy.
