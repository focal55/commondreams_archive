- October 12 - The following was



released today by the League of Conservation Voters:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When it comes to environmental protection, few other political



issues point to such clear-cut distinctions between Vice President



Al Gore and Governor George W. Bush. This was the assessment of



the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), following last night's



second presidential debate in Winston-Salem, N.C.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Last night's debate revealed the fundamental differences



between Al Gore and George W. Bush when it comes to protecting the



nation's air, water and land," said LCV President Deb Callahan.



"Gore is advocating a proactive approach to curbing the harmful



affects of global warming, protecting our air and water and



preserving our natural treasures, while Bush's



'wait-until-it's-too-late' approach to environmental and public



health protections could threaten 30 years of forward-thinking



environmental progress."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the debate, Gore asserted that Houston surpassed Los



Angeles as the smoggiest city. In fact, according to the



Environmental Protection Agency, Texas ranks number one in the



nation for dumping carcinogens in the environment, number one in



carbon dioxide emissions and number one in hazardous waste



production. Texas also ranks 49th among states in the amount of



money it spend per capita on its parks, a fact Bush attempted to



sidestep during the debate.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also during the debate, Bush attempted to take credit for Texas'



electricity deregulation bill, which requires Texas' older,



polluting power plants to reduce their emissions. According to the



League, Bush supported a bill that was passed by the state Senate,



incorporating his plan to encourage but not require industrial



cleanup. However, the bill, along with one to open the state's



electricity industry to competition, were bogged down in the state



House by supporters of mandatory pollution requirements. In order



to avoid defeat, the bill's House sponsor agreed to amendments



opposed by Bush, requiring companies to clean up or face mandatory



shut down. A last minute House-Senate conference produced a



compromise that included penalties for grandfathered plants that



don't install anti-pollution devices and meet current state and



federal standards for air quality. The separate utility bill



included a requirement that 100 grandfathered power plants reduce



emissions by 50 percent by 2003.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Polls consistently show that the majority of voters --



Republicans, Democrats and Independents -- alike support stronger



environmental and public health protections," Callahan said. "Bush



recognizes the political power of the environmental issue and is



trying to 'greenwash' voters about his commitment to conservation



and public health protections. However, only Gore has the proven



record and commitment on this issue."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LCV is the political voice for the national environmental



community. LCV was the first national environmental organization to



endorse Gore for president. Environmental information about all of



the presidential campaign, including candidate profiles and



comparison charts, can be accessed at the LCV web site at
