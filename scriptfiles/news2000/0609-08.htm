- June 9 - The Sierra Club today applauded the campaign finance

     reform victory that Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) won yesterday, when the

     Senate voted by 57-42 to adopt his proposal to require disclosure of

     the contributions and expenditures by so-called "527" organizations.

     The amendment was added to the Defense Authorization bill.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We congratulate Sen. John McCain for winning the first battle in the

     long war for campaign finance reform," said Carl Pope, Sierra Club's

     executive director.  "Yesterday's vote broke the stranglehold against

     reform in the U.S. Senate.  Unfortunately, the House dropped the ball

     today when it defeated this common-sense reform.  The 527 disclosure

     provision is just the first step toward comprehensive campaign finance

     reform.  The next critical step to reforming our shameful campaign

     finance system is for the Senate to pass the McCain-Feingold bill and

     ban soft money contributions to political parties."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Sen. McCain's 527 disclosure amendment would require organizations

     that conduct issue advocacy activities under Sec. 527 of the Internal

     Revenue Code to report on the contributions and expenditures of their

     programs.  Currently, organizations with 527's do not have to disclose

     the source of funds or spending when broadcasting issue-advocacy ads

     or undertaking other activities.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The Sierra Club strongly supports campaign finance reform, including

     the disclosure of 527 donors, the ban on soft money donations to

     political parties, and public financing of campaigns.  The Club

     successfully worked for House passage of the bill by Reps. Shays

     (R-CT) and Meehan (D-MA) to ban soft-money contributions to political

     parties and establish restrictions on issue advocacy efforts.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     While working towards reform, the Club is conducting issue-advocacy

     efforts under the existing rules.  The Sierra Club has a 527 and

     expects to spend $8 million in at least 17 Congressional races and the

     Presidential campaign this year.  The Club's Environmental Voter

     Education Campaign will educate the public about candidates'

     environmental records, and urge the public to ask their officials to

     take specific actions to support the environment.</font>
