- June 12 - Six prominent Indonesian NGOs stated their opposition to any resumption

      of U.S.-Indonesian military ties in a letter to members of the U.S.

      Congress. The groups called U.S. military assistance to the Indonesian military

      (TNI) &quot;indefensible&quot; and warned that any &quot;&quot;positive

      effect the US suspension [of military ties in September 1999] has had is

      now in danger of being squandered.&quot;</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are perplexed by the alacrity with which the Pentagon is

      resuming normal relations with the TNI since none of the conditions which

      the Congress stipulated last November in the Foreign Operations

      Appropriation law have been met,&quot; the <a href="http://www.etan.org/news/2000a/ngoltr600.htm">NGOs

      wrote key members of the U.S. Congress appropriations committees</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On September 9, President Clinton suspended all U.S. ties with the

      military as Indonesian troops and their militia allies set about to

      systematically destroying East Timor following its pro-independence vote.

      Congress put part of this ban into law late last year. The FY 2000 Foreign

      Operations Appropriations Act stipulates conditions which must be met

      before normal military ties can be restored. These include the return of

      refugees to East Timor and prosecution of&nbsp; military and militia

      members responsible for human rights atrocities in East Timor and

      Indonesia. They also require Indonesia to actively prevent militia

      incursions into East Timor and to cooperate fully with the UN

      administration in East Timor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We do not ask the U.S. government to actively assist the

      pro-democracy movement in Indonesia. We do, however, ask the US government

      to make our job easier by stopping its aid to our greatest obstacle: the

      Indonesian military,&quot; the NGOs wrote.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Given that the Indonesian military makes no distinction between

      national defense and domestic policing (it is all 'national security'),

      the US government must admit that any training and aid provided to the

      military can just as easily be used against Indonesian citizens as

      external enemies.... Until the TNI renounces its 'dual function'

      doctrine which justifies its interventions into domestic politics, US

      military aid to it is indefensible,&quot; the Indonesian NGOs added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NGOs are especially &quot;disturbed by indications that the U.S.

      Pentagon is trying to push forward a participatory exercise known as

      Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) this summer. We know of

      previous CARAT exercises and are keenly aware of their use to train

      Indonesian officers in assault tactics, despite their being described by

      some as 'humanitarian operations.' In fact, last year, military personnel

      trained in CARAT left right from that training to join the military’s

      criminal actions in East Timor after its vote for independence.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Addressing the congressional conditions, the NGOs wrote that &quot;the

      West Timor refugee problem still exists, the military officers responsible

      for crimes against humanity ... in East Timor last September have not yet

      been brought to justice (and may well never be brought to justice given

      the serious flaws in the government’s judicial process for the case),

      and the military remains an institution largely unaccountable to the

      civilian leadership. Most importantly, the military has not disbanded the

      East Timorese militias...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letters was sent to Senators Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Patrick

      Leahy (D-VT), respectively chair and ranking member of the Foreign

      Operations subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and to

      Reps. Sonny Callahan (R-AL) and Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), respectively chair

      and ranking member of the Foreign Operations subcommittee of the House

      Appropriations Committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Signing the letter were Johnson Panjaitan, Director, Legal Aid and

      Human Rights Association of Indonesia (PBHI); Ifdhal Kasim, Director,

      Institute of Research and Human Rights Advocacy (ELSAM); Hilmar Farid,

      Vice-Director, Volunteer Team for Humanity (TRK) Munir, Director,

      Commission for Disappeared Persons and Victims of Violence (KONTRAS);

      Lefidus Malau, Solidarity Forum with the People of East Timor (FORTILOS);

      and Binny Buchori, Executive Secretary, Indonesian NGO Forum on Indonesian

      Development (INFID).</font>
