- June 23 - Proving once again that sisterhood is powerful, the National Organization

for Women plans to rock Miami Beach as hundreds of powerful women (and

men), including Gore 2000 guru Donna

Brazile and anti-violence trailblazer Christy

Brzonkala, gather for the 2000

National NOW Conference (June 30-July 2 at the Fontainebleau Hilton).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazile, who joined Al Gore's campaign in October 1999, has a reputation

as a tenacious political organizer and is the first African American woman

to head a major contender's presidential campaign.&nbsp; She and NOW President

Patricia

Ireland will speak on grassroots organizing to maximize women's political

power.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brzonkala, who became the first person to sue her attackers under the

Violence

Against Women Act, took her quest for justice all the way to the U.S.

Supreme Court in the landmark <i>Brzonkala v. Morrison</i> case.&nbsp;

She will be honored with NOW's Woman

of Courage Award for her heroic efforts to end violence against women.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Local women who will be honored as Women of Courage are the late Miami

Beach state representative Elaine

Gordon for her twenty-two years of supporting women's rights in the

Florida state legislature, and Julia

Gabriel for her fight to improve the lives of&nbsp; farm workers.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Director and actor Lily

Mariye, who plays the role of Nurse Lily Jarvik on the NBC television

series "ER," will be on hand to talk about the pitfalls and pratfalls of

women in film.&nbsp; She has guest starred in more than 25 television shows,

including "Chicago Hope" and "Murphy Brown."&nbsp; Mariye will screen her

first short feature film, "Shangri-la Caf&eacute;," which takes a compelling

look at racism as it tells the story of one woman's struggle and the difference

she makes.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Miami's homegrown talent, U.S. Representative Carrie Meek (D-Fla.) and

Florida State Senator Kendrick Meek (D-District 36), will be honored at

a pre-conference NOW/PAC reception

on Thursday, June 29.&nbsp; The mother-son duo have distinguished themselves

as champions of affirmative action and other women's and civil rights issues.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other conference highlights include a Political Institute to prepare

activists for campaign work, a plenary devoted to the global struggle for

women's equality and NOW's Virtual Village, hands-on help with electronic

organizing.</font>
