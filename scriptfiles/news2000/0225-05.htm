<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 25 - <i>Statement of NOW President Patricia Ireland on Social Security:</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Politicians want to play a shell game called "privatization" with our

<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/">Social

Security</a> tax dollars.&nbsp; Here's how it works: Conservatives abolish

the current Social security program and hire non-government firms to do

the job.&nbsp; In the end, the companies that takeover the program would

get to line their pockets with our tax dollars while politicians get to

claim they reduced government.&nbsp; Like most shell games, privatization

is a scam.&nbsp; And women will likely suffer the greatest losses if it

is implemented.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Privatization of Social Security would be risky and expensive.&nbsp;

Administrative costs of Social Security are just 1% of benefits, compared

to 12 to 14% for private insurers.&nbsp; Most of the proposals offered

would create private accounts by diverting Social Security taxes while

cutting benefits and raising the retirement age to make up for lost revenues.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An atmosphere of panic has been created by the millions of financial

industry dollars pushing for privatization of Social Security.&nbsp; (With

the Social Security system taking in some $1.5 billion a day, the possible

fees for managing even a fraction of that amount are quite an incentive.)&nbsp;

But what we are facing is not a crisis; it's a scam contrived by the Wall

Street moguls who stand to gain from privatization.&nbsp; The threat our

families face is not the imminent collapse of Social Security funding,

but a possible shortfall if the Trust Fund is drawn down to zero after

2032.&nbsp; And the projection of this shortfall is based on a cautious

economic forecast; maintaining current levels of growth would sustain Social

Security through the 21st century without any changes in the program.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before we look for remedies, perhaps we should take a moment to analyze

the problem.&nbsp; Congress created the current <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/search97cgi/s97_cgi?action=View&amp;VdkVgwKey=http%3A//www.ssa.gov/history/offbudget.html&amp;DocOffset=3&amp;DocsFound=263&amp;QueryZip=%22Social+Security+Trust%22&amp;Collection=SSA&amp;SearchUrl=http%3A//www.ssa.gov/search97cgi/s97_cgi?action=search&amp;QueryZip=%22Social+Security+Trust%22&amp;Filter=filter%2Ehts&amp;QueryText=%22Social+Security+Trust%22&amp;Collection=SSA&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;">Social

Security Trust Fund</a> (financed by the excess of current payroll taxes

over current payments to beneficiaries) to help the system meet the challenge

of supporting baby boomers who will begin to retire in 2010.&nbsp; By 2032,

when the Trust Funds may be drawn down to zero, the system will be purely

pay-as-you-go -- as it was from the 1940s through the 1960s.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Women must be particularly wary of privatization and other proposed

remedies to "fix" Social Security.&nbsp; After a lifetime of work, women

often find ourselves in dire economic straits during what were supposed

to be our golden years.&nbsp; Women are a majority of all Social Security

recipients, and roughly three out of four of the recipients over 85 are

women.&nbsp; Older women are twice as likely to depend on Social Security

as their sole support.&nbsp; And senior women are twice as likely as men

to live in poverty.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are many important benefits under the current program that would

not be available under privatization.&nbsp; For instance, Social Security

replaces a higher proportion of low-wage workers' income when they retire.&nbsp;

Under a private plan, this progressive aspect of Social Security that provides

a buffer for the poor would be lost.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, lifelong benefits are especially important to women, who

after reaching 65 have a life expectancy of 19.2 years compared to 15.6

for men.&nbsp; What are older women supposed to do if they exhaust their

assets before death?&nbsp; Adjustment for increases in cost of living under

Social Security is also crucial to saving older women from poverty.&nbsp;

Without such protection even a modest 3% inflation rate cuts the purchasing

power of a $100 benefit to $74 over 10 years and to $55 after 20 years.&nbsp;

Inflation adjusted private annuities are non-existent in this country,

and lifetime annuities, if available, would be prohibitively expensive.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the economy fluctuates, so will the yields of privatized plans.&nbsp;

Hard as it may be to remember during this boom, the market lost 45% of

its value between 1965 and 1978.&nbsp; Seniors need a steady income they

can count on, not the booms and busts of the market.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Young people also should beware.&nbsp; Seniors aren't the only ones

who benefit from Social Security.&nbsp;&nbsp; Three million children and

their sole caretaker parents depend on Social Security's death and disability

benefits to survive.&nbsp; Indeed, Social Security's safety net is wide;

without it, vulnerable people of all ages will suffer.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the cover of an exaggerated funding crisis and in the name of

reducing government, conservatives want to revise or even eliminate Social Security in ways

that will essentially tear holes in this safety net.&nbsp; We must use this opportunity to

strengthen and make Social Security



more equitable, especially for women, whose Social Security benefits

are substantially less than men's.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gender-neutral language in Social Security does not mean equality.&nbsp;

For example, 63% of women on Social Security receive benefits based on

their husband's earnings (wives' or widows' benefits), while only 1.2%

of men receive benefits based on their wife's earnings; 37% of these women

had no earnings history and 26% have a higher benefit as a wife or widow

than as an earner.&nbsp; We challenge Congress and the next president to

change the distribution of spousal and primary earner benefits to make

them equitable so that women are no longer penalized for providing full-time

child and elder care at home.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We want the cap on social security taxes raised to remove the extra

tax burden on low-wage earners, who are disproportionately women.&nbsp;

And we want to work with policymakers to develop an earnings sharing plan

that will not be detrimental to low-income women, so that each spouse has

benefits in her or his own right rather than as a dependent.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The greatest menace to Social Security is not a crisis in funding, but

cynical politicians who are more interested in kowtowing to big money interests

than they are in safeguarding the elderly, people with disabilities, widows,

widowers and their dependent children.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Can women afford the privatization of Social Security, moving the responsibility

for administering the nation's retirement monies from Washington to Wall

Street?&nbsp;&nbsp; No, we cannot.&nbsp; Will women be duped by the privatization

shell games of politicians like the men who would like to be president?&nbsp;

No, we will not.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Women must fight to strengthen Social Security, so it will continue

to be there for our grandmothers, our mothers and for us.&nbsp; We will

not fall for the false promise of quick-fixes like privatization.&nbsp;

And we will hold politicians accountable on Election Day.</font></p>
