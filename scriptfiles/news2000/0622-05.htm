The author of the forthcoming "From Capitalism to Equality," Andrews said 

today: "Before we celebrate the economy's alleged prosperity and progress, 

we should tally the exhaustion it is causing. The average husband-and-wife 

family works six hours today for every five hours worked in 1979. The 

percentage of employees who work 49 hours a week or more rose from 13 

percent in 1976 to 20 percent today. If there is a bit of prosperity today 

in our role as consumers, the deeper truth is that today's economy consumes 

people's lives."

National spokesperson for Neighbor to Neighbor, Nichols said today: "In 

1992 -- during a recession -- there were 37.4 million Americans without 

health insurance, according to the Census Department. By 1998, it was 44.3 

million. Even in this so-called 'booming' economy, the number of Americans 

without health insurance is at record levels and continues to climb. A 

recent World Health Organization report found the U.S. health-care system 

first by far in costs, but 37th in performance. We have higher infant 

mortality than many countries…our health-care system is an international 

disgrace. While large corporations have been exporting their jobs overseas, 

most of the new jobs in the U.S. are in small businesses and only 25 

percent of small businesses provide health insurance."

<br>

Co-director of United for a Fair Economy and co-author of the new book 

"Economic Apartheid in America," Collins said today: "In 1990, median 

income was $11.54 per hour; in 1999 it was $11.88.... Now many are moving 

to eliminate or reduce the estate tax, but it is one of the best tools we 

have to slow the 'trickle-up' of wealth to the super-rich. Since 1983, the 

top 1 percent of Americans have seen their wealth grow by 42 percent, while 

the net worth of the bottom 40 percent has fallen by an astonishing 76 

percent. The estate tax was passed in 1916 as a populist reform to ensure 

that wealth would not become concentrated in a few hands. The recent House 

vote to repeal it spurned this populist principle, instead giving a blatant 

thank-you gift to their major campaign contributors."

Professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts at Boston and 

author of "Neoliberalism or Democracy?," MacEwan said today: "We're much 

more unequal than countries in Western Europe or Japan. The U.S. is twice 

as rich as Spain, yet the bottom fifth in Spain are about as well off as 

the bottom fifth in the U.S.... Over the long run, there is no connection 

between periods when we've had low taxes for the rich and economic growth."</font>
