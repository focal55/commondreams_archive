<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- March 22 - Planned Parenthood 

Federation of America (PPFA) is launching its first national 

Congressional Day of Action on Thursday, March 23, and, with help 

from comedian Al Franken, is urging pro-choice activists to make sure 

their views are heard. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those who can't lobby in person in Washington can get involved by 

logging onto the Planned Parenthood Web site, 

<a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">www.plannedparenthood.org</a>. Activists will be greeted on the site 

with a special message and call to action from Al Franken, will have 

the opportunity to chat with such congressional leaders as Sen. 

Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Rep. Ellen Tauscher (D-CA), and Rep. Anthony 

Weiner (D-NY), and will be able to send free faxes to their members 

of Congress. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We're expecting hundreds of pro-choice, pro-family planning 

people from around the country to be walking the halls of Congress," 

said PPFA President Gloria Feldt. "We also want to dramatically add 

to their voices by generating thousands of emails and faxes on the 

same day. On-line activism is part of Planned Parenthood's overall 

advocacy strategy which includes work on Capitol Hill, in local 

communities, and on-line. As one of the first organizations to 

overlay all three, we consider this an important step in reenergizing 

pro-choice America and making our voices heard in the political 

process," Feldt added. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Congressional Day of Action Online will call on Congress to 

take three important actions to protect the health and well being of 

women here and abroad: approve the Equity in Prescription Insurance 

and Contraceptive Coverage Act (EPICC); increase funding for Title X, 

America's Family Planning Program; and remove the Global Gag Rule, 

the restrictions that have been attached to international family 

planning assistance. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The virtual lobbying day is part of the Responsible Choices. 

Action Agenda, a unique campaign that uses technology to attract and 

mobilize supporters at the grassroots level and to involve more 

people in the political process. Supporting the virtual and physical 

lobbying day will be a full-page ad in the March 23 Washington Post. 

In addition, flyers will be distributed at metro stops around the 

city at rush hour on Wednesday, March 22. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Congressional Day of Action is one of many activities 

scheduled during the PPFA annual conference. From March 22 through 

March 25, more than 1,000 staff members, volunteers, and supporters 

from across the country will gather for a Public Policy 

Summit, followed by three days of working meetings, culminating in an 

awards banquet.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 



All events will take place at the Grand Hyatt Washington, across 

from the convention center in downtown Washington, DC. To arrange 

coverage, call PPFA press officers Sandra Jordan (202-973-6395) 

or Colleen McCabe (212-261-4729).
