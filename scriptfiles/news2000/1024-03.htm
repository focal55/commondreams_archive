<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- October 24 - Approximately 50,000 to 100,000 new Federal employees would be required in order to operate Governor Bush's system of privatized Social Security accounts, according to a report released today by 2030 Action, a national public policy advocacy organization founded by young adults.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the final presidential debate, Governor Bush said that his Social Security privatization plan would divert $1 trillion from the Social Security Trust Fund into private investment accounts for workers.  Governor Bush has not discussed, however, what expansion of government - specifically the hiring of new government employees as well as the implementation of new regulations in the private financial sector - would be necessary in order to implement such an idea.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Governor Bush is leading young people to believe that, under his approach, Social Security would easily morph into a 401(k) plan," said Hans Riemer, report author and 2030 Action director.  "If his privatized accounts were to provide anything like the services and options of the mainstream financial industry, Bush would have to build a massive new bureaucracy to run it, some 50,000 - 100,000 new Federal employees." 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The public, however, rejects privatization proposals if they involve new government bureaucracy.  In a Roper public opinion survey conducted for the AARP in September, 54% of the public (all ages) initially favored the idea of investing a portion of their payroll taxes.  Fifty-seven percent of this favoring group, however, subsequently opposed the idea if it would lead to a new government agency.  In total, only 38% of the public would favor privatization if it required creating a new government agency.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The workload involved in administering a system of private accounts for nearly 140 million workers is significant. Bush does not describe how his plan would be administered, but similar plans introduced in Congress (and which Bush cites as examples of reform), model an individual account plan after the Federal employee's Thrift Savings Plan.  John Kimpel, Senior Vice President/Deputy General Counsel for Fidelity has estimated that an investment account system based on the Thrift Savings Plan model "would ultimately require as many as 100,000 employees."  A workforce projection based on administrative costs yields similar results.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Bush is either going to build a massive new bureaucracy or he is going to offer workers a third or fourth-rate investment plan," added Riemer.
