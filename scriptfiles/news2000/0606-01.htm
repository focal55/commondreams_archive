- June 6 - From Portland, Ore., to



Great Neck, N.Y., peace activists are preparing for Action Days --

a



three-day, nationwide protest coordinated by Peace Action and



affiliated groups to oppose Star Wars deployment. From June 8-10,



participating organizations will hold local actions, meet with



editorial boards, sponsor advertisements in local papers and organize



call-ins and write-ins to President Bill Clinton and Congressional

representatives in opposition to Clinton's proposed $60 billion Star



Wars initiative. The overarching goal of Action Days is to promote



global security through greater arms reductions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To date, Peace Action affiliates have planned events in 10 cities



across the United States. Oregon PeaceWorks will hold a noon protest



Thursday, June 8 in Portland's Courthouse Square. Activists will



criticize Sens. Wyden and Smith for their votes on Star Wars and



engage the public in anti-Star Wars lobbying efforts. Also on June

8



at noon, Peace Action Delaware Valley will demonstrate in front



of Republican Sen. Rick Santorum's Philadelphia office. Great



Neck (N.Y.) Peace Action members will write op-eds to local



newspapers and hold a peaceful protest outside the office of



Democratic House Rep. Gary Ackerman. Similar events will take



place in Annapolis, Md., Milwaukee, Wis.; Concord, N.H. and



Chicago.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Debate shouldn't be about which Star Wars system to deploy, but



whether there should be one at all," said Illinois Peace Action (IPA)



Acting Executive Director Kevin Kinter. In Chicago, hundreds of IPA



members will spend June 8-10 distributing fliers, staging guerrilla



theater and generating support through a satirical signature ad



published in the Chicago Reader (circulation 138,000) for Star Wars



Episode 2000: The Nuclear Menace. IPA "critics" label Star Wars "A



tremendous failure!" and "Surprisingly expensive!"; donors' names



appear at the bottom of the ad, along with a call to President



Clinton in support or arms reduction initiatives.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"All of these efforts are to beat back the missile defense



hysteria since the Republicans took over Congress in 1994," said



Peace Action Research Coordinator Jim Bridgman. Peace Action's



anti-Star Wars efforts are part of a three-prong strategy to mobilize



activists through direct action, lobbying efforts and emediacy



campaigns such as <a href="http://www.DontBlowIt.org">www.DontBlowIt.org</a>,

a new Web site developed by the



Technology Project which enables citizens to send electronic



postcards to President Clinton.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Action Days follows the Peace Voter Fund's recent $100,000-plus



anti-Star Wars television and newspaper ad campaign to educate voters



about the dangers of building Clinton's expensive anti-missile



system. The campaign coincided with the June 4-5 meetings between



Clinton and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Despite several



hours of talks, the two leaders didn't reach an agreement on Star



Wars due to Putin's reluctance to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic



Missile Treaty, a cornerstone covenant which would be violated if



Star Wars goes forward. Meanwhile, presidential candidates Al Gore



and George W. Bush both claim that a new missile system is necessary



to protect the United States and its allies from potential



missile attacks by "rogue" states such as North Korea and Iran.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Results of a May ABC News poll show that 53 percent of Americans



oppose building even a limited missile system. Peace Action and



Action Days co-sponsors such as Peace Links and Fourth Freedom Forum



hope to build upon existing anti-Star Wars sentiment by promoting



public opinion. For more information about Action Days and future



Peace Action activities and campaigns, call Jim Bridgman at
