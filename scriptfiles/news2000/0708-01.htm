- July 8 - Following today's failed missile test launch Greenpeace has repeated its call 

for President Clinton to reject plans for a new "Star Wars" missile defense system.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Initial reports stated that the anti-missile weapon failed to intercept a Minuteman II rocket over the Pacific Ocean. Two of the three 

tests of the system have now failed. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The failed test just emphasizes what a failure in judgment the whole Star Wars program is," said Greenpeace nuclear disarmament 

campaigner, William Peden.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"No amount of tests, threat assessments or diplomatic double speak can ever justify Star Wars. The fact is, if it is allowed to go 

ahead, this program will ignite a new nuclear arms race. The US administration must heed the strong opposition from around the world 

that will only continue to grow," said Peden.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Minuteman missile was fired at 4.18 GMT Friday from Vandenberg Air Force base, north of Santa Barbara, California, after being 

delayed for 2 hours 18 minutes. Air Force officials claimed that the delay was due to a battery problem. Greenpeace volunteers were 

still in the Vandenberg base at the time.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace conducted a series of internationally coordinated actions against the test over a number of days in the run up to the 

launch. Volunteers entered the launch areas at both Vandenberg in California and Meck Island, part of the Kwajalein Atoll in the 

Marshall Islands, where the failed kill vehicle was fired from. In addition the Greenpeace vessel Arctic Sunrise entered the test 

exclusion zone off the California coast.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seven Greenpeace volunteers entered the Vandenberg on foot, three on Wednesday and the rest on Thursday night, and made their way 

close to the launch pad for the Minuteman II missile. They were eventually arrested just hours before the final missile launch and 

were charged with trespassing before being released.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile the crew of volunteers aboard the MV Arctic Sunrise sailed into one of the five hazard zones designated in a Notice to 

Mariners (NOTAM) and launched four inflatable zodiacs. These were areas where stage one of the Minuteman II missile was to be 

jettisoned. The ship remained in the area when the missile was launched despite Greenpeace calls several hours before the launch to 

Vandenberg in which they provided their exact coordinates. Negotiations continued until minutes before the launch. Aboard the 164 foot 

Dutch-registered Arctic Sunrise, are 23 people, including volunteers from United States, Russia, France, Canada, Germany, the 

Netherlands, India, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Cook Islands and Turkey.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A third team of two volunteers attempted to occupy the launch site for the interceptor missile which was fired from Meck Island, part 

of the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. They were also arrested and charged with trespass. Greenpeace volunteers around the 

world also mounted protests against the Star Wars test including China, Russia and Canada.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Outside Vandenberg's front gate, Greenpeace also set up an around the clock vigil, with disarmament experts on hand to provide 

background information to the public and the media.  Greenpeace also launched a special website, <a href="http://www.stopstarwars.org">www.stopstarwars.org</a>, which offers people around the world a chance to send letters directly to President

Clinton voicing their opposition to the Star Wars program.</font>
