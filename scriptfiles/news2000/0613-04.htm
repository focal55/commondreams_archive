U.S. Senator Can't Stop Human Rights Tribunal

- June 13 - U.S. Senator Jesse Helms may rage against 

the international criminal court, but he cannot stop it, Human Rights 

Watch said today.



<p>The lawmaker has called a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations

Committee, which he chairs, for Wednesday, June 14, to hear one-sided

testimony against the international criminal court. This week, 110

nations are gathering at the United Nations to put the final touches on 

rules of procedure and evidence for the court.



<p>In July 1998, the United States was one of only seven countries,

including Iraq and the People's Republic of China, which voted against 

the treaty establishing the court. One hundred and twenty nations voted 

in favor. A growing number of governments has denounced U.S. efforts to 

re-open and weaken the treaty. Last month, the European Union rejected 

the U.S. initiative as "unacceptable."



<p>"Senator Helms is fighting a losing battle," said Richard Dicker,

counsel to Human Rights Watch and the director of its campaign on the

international criminal court. "Dozens of governments around the world

are solidly behind the international criminal court, and they include

America's closest allies. This court is going to come into being whether 

Senator Helms likes it or not."



<p>The U.S. government seeks ironclad assurances that none of its nationals 

could be prosecuted before the court.  This is consistent with the 

isolationist pressure exerted by Helms.  In previous rounds of 

negotiation, Washington has already succeeded in getting multiple

safeguards to prevent possibility of politically-motivated prosecutions 

against any U.S. national. The court will only prosecute when 

governments are acting to shield individuals from their national courts.



<p>Human Rights Watch said the guarantees sought by the United States would 

end up granting immunity to tyrants accused of genocide, crimes against 

humanity, and war crimes.



<p>Ninety-seven states have already signed the international criminal court 

treaty. Twelve have already ratified it, including France, which 

ratified on Friday, June 9.



<p>"Helms' hearing is widening a schism between the U.S. and its closest

allies," said Dicker. He noted that the Organization of American States 

has endorsed early ratification of the treaty, while the Southern 

African Development Community and CARICOM have also indicated their 

strong support for the court.



<p>Dicker said that concerns about an American citizen falling victim to a 

politically-motivated prosecution were misplaced. The treaty will not 

allow the court to have jurisdiction over matters into which national 

courts have already initiated an investigation.



<p>"This court is meant for people like Foday Sankoh and situations like

Sierra Leone, where the justice system becomes inoperative amidst

turmoil and civil war," said Dicker. "These individuals need to be held 

to account for their crimes. A strong and impartial court is desperately 

needed in many parts of the world, and the United States, which has had 

so much influence in shaping the court, should not stand in its way."



<p>The negotiations on the court's Rules of Procedure and Evidence and

Elements of Crimes will conclude on June 30 in New York, after which the 

pace of treaty ratification will likely accelerate. The treaty must be 

ratified by 60 states in order to come into being. Human Rights Watch 

said that goal may be reached as early as 2002.
