<div align="center">Wellstone: Give Child Care Tax Credits to Main Street Families, Not Estate Tax Breaks for Easy Street<br>

- July 13 - Sen. Paul Wellstone, calling it a matter of helping struggling

working families rather than the wealthy, today proposed increasing tax breaks

for child care instead of passing massive estate tax breaks which will benefit

only the richest two percent of Americans.  Current plans before Congress would

enact massive estate tax breaks, costing the U.S. nearly $1 trillion over the

next 20 years.  



<p>“If that same money was invested in the needs of the nation’s children, we could

provide  health care coverage for every child in America, enroll every

school-aged child in after-school programs,  or provide quality child care for

over 18 million children,” said Wellstone.  “This estate tax bill ignores the

needs of over 13 million children living in poverty to give only the very rich

an enormous tax cut.  When there are children going hungry or homeless, or

attending school in crumbling buildings, this is simply unconscionable.”

  

<p>Wellstone’s amendment would:



<p>*   Make the Dependent Child Care Tax Credit refundable, so that working

families with no tax liability could benefit from the credit.



<p>*   Raise the maximum credit rate from 30 percent to 50 percent, with taxpayers

eligible for the maximum credit rate if their adjusted gross income is $30,000

or less.  For taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes above $30,000, the credit

rate would be reduced by one percent for each additional $1,000, or fraction of

$1,000, of adjusted gross income above $30,000.  Importantly, the credit would

never drop below 20 percent.

    

<p>*   Retain the maximum amounts of work-related child care expenses for which the

credit can be claimed, $2,400 for one child, and $4,800 for two or more

children, indexed for inflation.  



<p>*   Allow “stay-at-home” parents of infants – children younger than one year –

who incur either no work-related child care costs or only very limited work

related child care costs to take a credit of up to $500 per child for up to two

children.  



<p>*   Allow for the advance payment of the Dependent Child Care Tax Credit by

employers to employees who qualify for the credit.



<p>“For many families, the cost of child care truly is overwhelming,” said

Wellstone.  “Instead of doing something for these families, Congress argues

about how we can make sure that the richest Americans get to keep their

millions.  Working families shouldn’t be fooled by yet another giveaway that

they’ll never see.  Too many working families don’t even have access to

low-quality care, never mind the sort of high-quality child care that is crucial

to making sure the next generation of Americans has the best opportunity to

succeed possible.  We absolutely must give them access to that care so their

children have the same level playing field to succeed as kids from wealthy

families.”
