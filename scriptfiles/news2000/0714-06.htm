- July 14 - In a stinging rebuke



to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, the



U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday voted to end one of the



financial institutions' most anti-poor policies.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A provision in the House foreign operations appropriations bill



will require the IMF and World Bank to cease requiring poor countries



to impose "user fees" (charges) for primary education and primary



healthcare, including prevention and treatment efforts for AIDS,



malaria, tuberculosis, and infant, child and maternal well-being. The



requirement takes effect in 2002.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"IMF and World Bank-imposed user fees deny poor people in Africa



and elsewhere access to the most critical basic services," said



Robert Weissman, co-director of Essential Action, a Ralph



Nader-founded corporate accountability group. "Few policies are more



cruel."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The House of Representatives action will remove barriers imposed



by the IMF and World Bank, so more children and especially girls in



poor countries will be able to go to school, more families will be



able to access services to prevent disease, and more sick people will



be able to seek treatment and care," Weissman said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An amendment added to the foreign operations appropriations



bill in committee by Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.), stipulates



that funding for the IMF/World Bank's Heavily Indebted Poor



Countries (HIPC) Initiative will be made available only when the



IMF and World Bank certify that they have stopped requiring



countries, as a condition of receiving loans or through other means,

to charge user fees for primary education and primary healthcare.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A debt of gratitude is owed to Representative Jackson for his



leadership in ending the IMF and World Bank's heinous practice of



forcing governments in poor countries to charge their most vulnerable



citizens for basic services," Weissman said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"For too long, Congress has provided monies to the IMF and World



Bank without examining what the institutions are actually doing,"



Weissman said. "With its recent action, the House of Representatives



has taken a first step to end the World Bank and IMF's use of U.S.



tax dollars to impose 'structural adjustment' policies that worsen



the lives of the world's poorest people."</font>
