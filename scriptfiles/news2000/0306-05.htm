- March 6 - As Californians prepare



to vote tomorrow on a $2.1 billion measure to fund open space



protection and public parks, the Land Trust Alliance has prepared



a report that shows that voters elsewhere in the country gave



overwhelming approval to such issues in 1999 elections.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Land Trust Alliance (LTA), a nonprofit organization



dedicated to helping the nation's 1,200-plus land trusts protect



open spaces, found that 101 ballot questions on open space



protection faced voters last year, despite 1999 being an "off-year"



for elections, with no Congressional or gubernatorial races



scheduled. Ninety percent of these -- 91 referenda -- were passed.



&nbsp;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Open space funding ballots had similar success in 1998 when



voters passed 124 of 148 ballot questions, or 84 percent.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of these ballot measures were explicit tax increases to



fund open space protection. In 1999, referenda committed more than



$1.8 billion in public funds for open space preservation and parks.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A year earlier, referenda raised at least $8.2 billion for the same



purposes.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We hope that California voters, who have often been leaders on



political and social issues, follow much of the rest of the country



and pass propositions on the ballot tomorrow to fund open space and



parks, especially the question protecting lands adjacent to rivers,



streams, lakes and the coast," noted LTA President Jean Hocker.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note To Editors: Although printed versions of the study are not



yet available, LTA can speak about the full study to any reporter.

protection.</font>
