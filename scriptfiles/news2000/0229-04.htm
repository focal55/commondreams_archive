<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 29 - </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">News Advisory:

</font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What:

<br>

The international environmental group Greenpeace will hold a



breakfast briefing to highlight toxic hot spots in the United States



and around the world. Experts will offer analysis of the



Administration's flip-flop on the WTI toxic waste incinerator in East



Liverpool, Ohio. WTI is a hazardous waste incinerator located 1,100



feet from a local elementary school and 320 feet from a residential



neighborhood. Vice President Gore called for a halt to the



incinerator after the '92 election but reversed himself right after



the inauguration. The speakers will address toxic contamination in



Lake Charles, La., on Native American Lands, and on U.S. military



bases in the Philippines. They will also highlight the White House's



apparent "bully" role in pushing European delegations to back off



stronger treaty language to ban toxic chemicals.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The briefing comes as the State Department prepares to go to Bonn,



Germany on March 20 for weeklong UN negotiations on a global treaty



to ban persistent organic pollutants. (POPs) such as dioxin, DDT and



PCBs. The administration was recently embarrassed by the leak of a



communique to European countries threatening the "collapse" of the



U.N. negotiations unless they weakened their position against



toxic pollutants. So far, the U.S. position mirrors the chemical



industry lobbyists' agenda.
