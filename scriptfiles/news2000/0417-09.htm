- April 17 - After hours of sometimes heated standoff at Pennsylvania 

and 20th Streets, groups of non-violent protesters began crossing the police 

line drawn to protect the World Bank and IMF meetings taking place downtown. 

Protesters were escorted to the front of the World Bank Building by police 

and arrested in protest of the devastating social and environmental impacts 

of the institution's programs.  Amidst a celebratory atmosphere, well over 

250 protesters peacefully submitted with dozens additional arrests expected 

in the coming hours. 



<p>"These demonstrations against institutions serving corporate agendas are 

just a small part of a global movement for democracy," said Matthew Roberts 

of Mobilization for Global Justice.  " We are resolved to remain vigilant 

in our fight against corporate globalization and our fight for global democracy 

and justice. We have been fighting for democracy in this country for 200 

years.  It didn't end at the Boston Tea Party, it didn't end with the Revolutionary 

War, it didn't end in Seattle, and it won't end here."



<p>This afternoon's protests cap a week of unprecedented public mobilization 

against the World Bank and IMF.  Tens of thousands of concerned citizens 

traveled from around the US and more than fifty other countries around 

the globe to make their voices heard at the World Bank and IMF's first 

meetings of the 21st Century.  This week's mobilization is part of a growing 

global movement organized to embrace community participation, worker's 

rights, and environmental protection.  Recent months have seen protests 

against the financial institutions in countries as diverse as Ecuador, 

Bolivia and India.  



<p>"The World Bank and the IMF are unaccountable, unelected, undemocratic 

institutions that have tremendous control over policies that affect people's 

lives throughout the globe," Said Chloe Frommer of Mobilization for Global 

Justice.  "They are responsible for dislocating millions of people, taking 

water and food from local communities, and funding mega-projects that benefit 

corporate interests at the expense of our natural environment.  The heads 

of these institutions have become accustomed to conducting this business 

in anonymity, far from the eye of public scrutiny.  This week we changed 

that forever."
