- July 10 - Human Rights Watch today urged 

President Clinton to keep the promise he made in 1994 to ban 

antipersonnel landmines by joining the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty.  



<p>"Clinton's Landmine Legacy," the new 42-page report from Human Rights 

Watch released today, details U.S. policy and practice on antipersonnel 

mines and recommends a dozen steps the president should take before 

leaving office.



<p>The U.S. has said it will not join the Mine Ban Treaty until 2006,  and 

then only if it has identified and fielded an alternative to the weapon. 

To date, 137 countries have joined the global ban on antipersonnel 

mines.

 

<p>"President Clinton personally helped make the landmine crisis an issue 

of great international concern," said Stephen Goose, program director of 

the Arms Division at Human Rights Watch. "Instead of walking away from 

an issue we know he cares about deeply, President Clinton should submit 

the Mine Ban Treaty to the Senate." Goose urged Clinton to take 

executive actions to begin implementing a comprehensive ban, rather than 

waiting for the Senate to act. 



<p>The new Human Rights Watch report reveals for the first time that the 

U.S. has antipersonnel mines stockpiled in Qatar, which has already 

joined the treaty.  The U.S. is also apparently planning to add to the 

stockpile in the near future.

  

<p>Goose praised the Clinton administration for making more resources 

available for humanitarian mine action programs. But he said that the 

United States is in some respects moving away from a mine ban as 

President Clinton nears the end of his administration.  Perhaps most 

disturbing, the Pentagon is developing so-called alternatives to 

antipersonnel mines that would in fact be  illegal under the Mine Ban 

Treaty.  

 

<p>Some elements of President Clinton's landmine legacy:

 

<p>

<ul>

<li>the U.S. is not among the 137 nations, including all of NATO except 

Turkey, that have signed the Mine Ban Treaty.  Instead, the U.S. is 

keeping company with China, Russia, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Burma and 

Cuba;

 

<p><li>the U.S. still insists on the right to use antipersonnel mines in joint 

military operations with NATO and other military allies that are party 

to the Mine Ban Treaty, which would put them at legal risk;</li>



<p><li>the U.S. is one of just sixteen antipersonnel mine-producing nations 

left in the world;</li>

 

<p><li>the U.S. has the third or fourth largest stockpile of antipersonnel 

mines in the world, totaling more than 12 million;</li>

 

<p><li>the U.S. still maintains antipersonnel mine stockpiles in a number of 

countries that are party to the Mine Ban Treaty, including Germany, 

Japan, Norway, Qatar and the U.K.;</li>

 

<p><li>the Pentagon has plans to spend more than $820 million to develop 

alternatives to antipersonnel mines, but it is still very uncertain if 

the search will be successful at all, and it is increasingly clear that 

it will not be completed by 2006;</li>

 

<p><li>sometime in fiscal year 2001, the U.S. is to make a decision about 

producing, at a cost of $150 million, a new mine system called RADAM 

that contains antipersonnel mines and would be prohibited under the Mine 

Ban Treaty;</li>

 

<p><li>some in the Pentagon want to replace dumb (non-self-destructing) mines 

with a munition containing a "battlefield override"feature; this feature 

would revert the munition to dumb, indiscriminate status, and thus would 

be prohibited under the ban treaty. A production decision is expected in 

fiscal year 2002;</li>

 

<p><li>the Air Force apparently has new plans to begin stockpiling Gator 

antipersonnel mines in Qatar, a party to the Mine Ban Treaty;</li>



<p><li>the Air Force has plans to upgrade the dispensers carrying Gator 

antipersonnel mines in 2005, even though the stated objective is to have 

alternatives to Gator in place in 2006.</li></ul>



<p>Among the Human Rights Watch recommendations are that President Clinton 

set a definitive deadline for joining the treaty, rather than a 

conditional objective of 2006, and that he declare a ban on production 

of antipersonnel mines.

New York, is a founding member of the International Campaign to Ban 

Landmines, 1997 Nobel Peace Prize winner.
