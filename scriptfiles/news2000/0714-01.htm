- July 14 - Today a government



panel expressed "serious concern" that a chemical in vinyl medical



products may harm reproductive organs of critically ill male infants



exposed during medical treatments. The panel of expert scientists



also agreed that they have "concern" that the development of the



reproductive system of healthy male infants and toddlers could have



been harmed by DEHP exposure during their mother's pregnancy or from



non-medical exposures during the first years of life. This is the



first time NTP has evaluated the reproductive and developmental



toxicity of a chemical rather than carcinogenicity.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The panel's findings confirm the report released yesterday by



Health Care Without Harm (HCWH) which shows that fetuses, premature



infants ("preemies") and newborns are exposed to large amounts of a



chemical suspected to cause reproductive and developmental problems



in humans.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The chemical is DEHP (di-ethylhexyl phthalate) and it is used to



make polyvinyl chloride (PVC or vinyl) medical products soft and



flexible. In addition to use in the manufacture of medical products,



the chemical is used in other vinyl products; including floorings,



wall coverings, furniture, luggage and children's toys. The threat

of



exposure is high from some medical procedures because DEHP leaches



from vinyl medical products because it is not chemically bonded to



the plastic.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HCWH's report focuses on critically ill infants as the most



threatened population because multiple medical interventions may



require using devices that have been shown to leach DEHP. Higher



exposure for sick infants comes from neonatal intensive care units



filled with vinyl products.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These babies are exposed to DEHP from multiple pieces of



equipment. It is entering their bodies through their mouths, through



their veins and through their lungs," said Ted Schettler, MD, Science



Director of the Science and Environmental Health Network. "No one



knows exactly what impact these multiple exposures will have, but



what we know about DEHP's effects on animals gives us cause for



concern and for action."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Exposure to DEHP can cause reproductive problems, including:

<br>

-- structural changes in the testes,

<br>

-- reduced fertility,

<br>

-- changes in sperm production,

<br>

-- ovarian dysfunction, and

<br>

-- decreased hormone production in females.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hospitals can avoid much of the exposure preemies and newborns



receive from DEHP by using products made without the chemical when



available. Alternatives are readily available for most products used



in neonatal intensive care units, as well as for other PVC products

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Here is a government-sponsored panel of eminent scientists saying



that phthalate plasticizers in PVC medical products may pose a threat



to the ability to bear healthy children. Now health care



professionals and patients need to insist that if we can make the



same products out of materials that do not threaten fertility, we



should do it,"said Charlotte Brody, RN, co-coordinator of Health Care



Without Harm.
