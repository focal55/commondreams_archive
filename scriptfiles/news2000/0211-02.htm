- February 11 - When presidential candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley

						arrive to address the California Democratic Party's state convention on Saturday,

						February 12th,<B> </B>they will be joined by a fifty foot replica of a Trident nuclear

						missile. The missile will be placed in front of the San Jose Convention Center at

						8:00 am as part of an ongoing &quot;Missile Stop Tour.&quot; The missile bears the

						slogan, &quot;$35 Billion a Year for Nuclear Weapons - Pennies for Our Schools.&quot;<BR>

						<BR>

						&quot;The Clinton Administration has spent an incredible $35 billion per year on

						nuclear weapons - more than the Cold War average,&quot; says California Peace Action's

						Executive Director Peter Ferenbach. &quot;This is appalling. We're here to ask the

						Democratic candidates to commit themselves to ending funding for these unspeakable

						weapons and to ask the delegates to this convention to insist upon it.&quot;<BR>

						<BR>

						The &quot;Missile Stop Tour&quot; is part of a nationwide campaign involving numerous

						disarmament groups demanding that candidates from all parties state clearly whether

						they intend to continue nuclear weapons production. Several missiles have been built

						and Missile Stop Tour events are already scheduled in Michigan, Maine, Illinois,

						Tennessee, Colorado, Washington, Ohio, Texas, New York and Washington, DC.<BR>

						<BR>

						A poll taken last summer concluded that 86% of all Democrats and 82% of all Americans

						favor deeper reductions in our vast nuclear arsenal. (Mellman/Wirthlin Worldwide,

						6/18 - 6/21/99) Bill Bradley and Al Gore have a mixed record on disarmament issues.

						In the past both have supported the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. As Senators, Bradley

						voted against funding for new MX Missiles while Gore voted to build them. <BR>

						<B><BR>

						</B>Andrew Page, California Peace Action's Political Director described the tour

						as a way to focus attention on nuclear weapons issues, &quot;The Clinton budget authorizes

						spending $27.4 billion to build new nuclear weapons. This is a gross misuse of our

						tax dollars in light of the state's crisis in education. If the candidates are as

						committed to education as they say, then maybe they could use some of that money

						to fix our schools.&quot;<BR>

						<BR>

						A recent report by the National Priorities Project based in Northampton, MA concluded

						that 87% of California schools are in need of repair and that 23% of California's

						children live below the poverty line. Peace Action's Ferenbach said the problem was

						important for California because it was taking place &quot;right here in our own

						backyard.&quot;<BR>

						<BR>

						&quot;The Clinton Administration has supported the construction of a new nuclear

						weapons lab right across the Bay from us in Livermore.&quot; The Administration is

						also planning to resume production of nuclear warheads next year in Los Alamos New

						Mexico.
