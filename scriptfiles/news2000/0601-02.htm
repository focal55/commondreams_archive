<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By any measure of environmental quality, Texas is a mess."

     -- Madison (WI) Capital Times, May 28, 2000

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     When George W. Bush talks about the environment, he paints the image

     of Texas as a state that is cleaning up its air and water through

     successful voluntary programs.  There's just one problem: it isn't

     true.  As the Dallas Morning News wrote, "The environment is

     developing as a potent political issue for the 2000 presidential race.

      Much of the reason has to do with Mr. Bush's vulnerability on the

     issue." (11/14/99).

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Voluntary Regulations

     Bush's biggest voluntary program he touts has been to reduce

     industrial air emissions from aging facilities.  However, "only 33

     of the 160 biggest industrial plants have volunteered.  Of those 33,

     only three have taken steps to cut their emissions.  Questioned about

     this during his interview with Time, Bush became irritated."

     -Time, February 21, 2000

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"More than a third of Texas' industrial air pollution comes from

     so-called grandfathered power plants and other facilities exempt from

     state controls since 1971. Mr. Bush has resisted efforts to force

     cutbacks on these facilities. But more than two years ago, he won

     commitments from dozens of companies to curb pollution

     voluntarily...So far, little of the promised improvement has

     materialized. In 28 months, grandfathered emissions have dropped only

     about 2.4 percent, state records show."

     Air Pollution

     In 1999, Texas suffered through the nation's top 20 one-hour ozone

     violations and Houston topped Los Angeles as the nation's smog capital

     because it had 10 more days of unhealthy air.

     The emission of industrial toxic air pollutants emissions rose from

     108 million pounds in 1997 to approximately 110 million pounds in

     1998, which is the most in the nation.

     Water Pollution

     Industrial toxic pollution discharged into surface waters jumped

     nearly 20 percent, to approximately 25 million pounds in the most

     recent Toxics Release Inventory for 1998.

     Texas leads the nation in the number of facilities that violate clean

     water standards. A February 2000 report by the U.S. Public Interest

     Research Group based on EPA data found Texas had the most major

     facilities in "significant noncompliance" with pollution discharge

     limits in their permits. Between Oct. 1997 and Dec. 1998, 178

     facilities were in significant noncompliance, compared to 141

     facilities in 2nd-ranked Florida.
