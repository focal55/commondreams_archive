- June 9 - Rep. Tony P. Hall (D-Ohio)



joined Congressional leaders known for their advocacy on behalf of



American veterans in calling for an investigation of depleted



uranium's effects on human health.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter to President Clinton on Thursday, Hall and eight



other Members of the U.S. House of Representatives urged him to



request a World Health Organization study of depleted uranium in



Iraq.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are concerned by reports that the United States Government



has blocked an investigation by the World Health Organization's



experts into the effects of depleted uranium on Iraq's civilians,"



they wrote. "If these reports are true, we are sacrificing an



opportunity to help our own veterans to political concerns; we also



may be putting those who serve in the U.S. military now at risk



needlessly."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Congressmen urged President Clinton to involve himself



personally. "...your leadership is needed to reverse this troubling



record," they said. "We urge you to put the health of American



veterans and innocent Iraqi civilians ahead of political efforts to



isolate Iraq's government...Whatever WHO finds will better inform



our country's decisions about protecting American troops and others



in the future. Its work should not be delayed."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The full text of the letter follows. Joining Hall in writing



were Reps. Lane Evans (D-Ill.); Bob Filner (D-Calif.); Sam Farr



(D-Calif.); Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio); Robert A. Underwood (D-Guam);



John W. Olver (D-Mass.); Neil Abercrombie (D-Hawaii); and Silvestre



Reyes (D-Texas).

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mr. President:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you know, American veterans of the Gulf War are fighting



health problems which are not well understood by medical



professionals, but which are real and affect their lives in



significant ways. There are credible reports that Iraqi civilians



too are suffering: cancer rates in Iraq appear to be significantly



higher than the worldwide average, although the reason for this has



not been determined.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The suspected culprit in both cases is depleted uranium, a toxic



and radioactive metal. Yet, nine years after the Gulf War ended,



few efforts have been made to examine its effects on human health.



&nbsp;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are concerned by reports that the United States Government



has blocked an investigation by the World Health Organization's



experts into the effects of depleted uranium on Iraq's civilians.



If these reports are true, we are sacrificing an opportunity to



help our own veterans to political concerns; we also may be putting



those who serve in the U.S. military now at risk needlessly.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The General Accounting Office recently criticized the U.S.



Government for mishandling its investigations on the possible



effects of DU exposure on our Gulf War veterans. Critics of U.S.



humanitarian policy toward Iraq also take issue with our response



to this and other problems plaguing Iraqi civilians.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. President, your leadership is needed to reverse this



troubling record. We urge you to put the health of American



veterans and innocent Iraqi civilians ahead of political efforts to



isolate Iraq's government by immediately requesting the WHO to



conduct a comprehensive investigation of this matter.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whatever WHO finds will better inform our country's decisions



about protecting American troops and others in the future. Its work



should not be delayed.
