- October 25 - Public Citizen today released its <a href="http://www.citizen.org/vchart00/map.htm">scorecard</a> rating members of Congress on

how often they voted in the consumer&#146;s interests during the 1999-2000 Congress.

Public Citizen released the chart even as the Republican leadership has been unable to

wrap up work for the year. The organization is disseminating the information now to reach

voters well before they head to the polls.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The vote chart scores each member of Congress on a 0-100 percent scale and includes

&quot;best&quot; and &quot;worst&quot; lists. Just four U.S. senators and 32 members of

the House of Representatives received perfect scores. Thirteen senators and 36

representatives received scores of 0, the lowest possible. (See attachment.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While this scorecard is not exhaustive, the votes covered show that Congress

passed into law several harmful measures and enacted few measures that helped

consumers,&quot; Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The issues on which Public Citizen rated lawmakers included campaign finance reform,

Medicare prescription drug coverage, international trade, corporate welfare,

patients&#146; rights, fuel efficiency, nuclear waste disposal, liability protections,

regulatory protections and food safety.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three bills deemed harmful by Public Citizen became law. They were a measure to grant

permanent normal trade relations to China, a &quot;NAFTA for Africa&quot; trade bill that

will benefit multinational corporations at the expense of African countries, and

legislation that limits the legal liability for high-tech companies that developed

products with Y2K defects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the positive side, Congress made progress on campaign finance reform and a

patients&#146; bill of rights, both of which were blocked in the Senate. Congress passed a

new campaign finance disclosure law for section 527 groups and a limited auto safety law;

however, these votes were not scored by Public Citizen either because they passed by an

overwhelming margin or they passed on a voice vote.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The vote chart includes information about campaign money raised by each lawmaker. It is

on the Web at <a href="http://www.citizen.org/vchart00/map.htm">http://www.citizen.org/vchart00/map.htm</a>,

and is searchable by member or state delegation.</font>
