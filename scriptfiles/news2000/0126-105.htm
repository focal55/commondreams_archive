- January 26 - After spending $30

million in 1999 on ads intended to undermine support for an outpatient prescription drug

benefit for Medicare recipients, two spokesman for the prescription drug industry's main

trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), recently

told <i>The New York Times</i> that they would accept legislation to provide Medicare drug

benefits this year (&quot;Drug Makers Drop Their Opposition to Medicare Plan,&quot; Jan.

14).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, just five days after the article

was published, on Jan. 19, PhRMA&#146;s &quot;Public Affairs Section&quot; held a strategy

meeting with industry allies to detail plans that appear designed to undermine support for

a Medicare prescription drug bill. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It&#146;s clear that the

pharmaceutical industry is talking out of both sides of its mouth and is prepared to spend

tens of millions of dollars to ensure that elderly citizens continue to get gouged at the

drug store so that wealthy pharmaceutical executives can keep raking in outrageous

profits,&quot; said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PhRMA's battle plan includes a calendar of

events for January and February, as well as other documents, revealing that the

industry&#146;s strategy is to work in a highly coordinated way with allied organizations

and front groups. The activities include releasing reports, conducting a major grassroots

public relations and lobbying campaign, initiating state media tours to challenge

increased publicity about how much cheaper drugs are in Canada, and opposing the

&quot;Allen&quot; bill (H.R. 664/S. 731), which is the most popular Medicare prescription

drug bill pending in Congress. Specifically, PhRMA and its allies will: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Undertake a Major Grassroots Public Relations and Lobbying Campaig</font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In mid-January PhRMA was to begin running ads on television. And Citizens for

    Better Medicare (CBM), a front group formed and funded largely if not exclusively by PhRMA

    to lobby on the prescription drug issue, also was to begin running ads again after letting

    up at the end of last year. (Trade publications previously reported that up to $35 million

    in additional ads were to run in 2000.) Moreover, a major direct mail and phone bank

    operations were to begin, polls were to be released and extensive lobbying of Capitol Hill

    was to occur</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conduct State Media Tours to Challenge Lower Canadian Drug Prices</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To counter the growing wave of Americans traveling across the border into

    Canada to buy the same drugs at a 25 percent to 50 percent discount from the prices they

    pay in the United States, PhRMA planned to begin state media tours in key border states in

    late January. Targeted states were Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana,

    Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. In early February, state media tours on &quot;price

    controls&quot; are also planned.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Intensify Opposition to the Allen Bill</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act (H.R. 664/S. 731), sponsored by

    Reps. Tom Allen (D-Maine) and Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) in the House and Sens. Tim Johnson

    (D-S.D.) and Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) in the Senate, is the most popular Medicare

    prescription drug bill in Congress with 138 House co-sponsors and 12 Senate co-sponsors as

    of Jan. 24, 2000. The Allen bill would allow 39 million Medicare beneficiaries to buy

    prescription drugs at up to 40 percent off current retail prices. A June 1999 Merrill

    Lynch report found that, at most, the impact of the legislation would be to cut drug

    company revenues by 3.3 percent &#151; a modest cut given the enormous profits generated

    by the industry. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Release reports by allies and front groups to bolster the industry&#146;s

    position</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As revealed by the trade association&#146;s calendar of events, the reach of

    PhRMA is substantial when it comes to working with some of Washington&#146;s most

    well-funded conservative think tanks and lobbying organizations, many of whom receive

    substantial financial support from PhRMA and allied corporate patrons. Here is a list of

    scheduled activities on the PhRMA calendar. (An asterisk * indicates membership in

    Citizens for Better Medicare): </font></p>

    as a lobbyist for the Health Benefits Coalition in 1998, the most recent year for which

    online records are available on the Center for Responsive Politics&#146; Web site.

    According to its mission statement, the HBC was &quot;formed out of concern that federal

    health care mandates proposed in Congress under the guise of &#145;patient

    protections&#146; would increase health care costs .&#133;&quot; Tozzi, a former senior

    official at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during the Reagan and Carter

    administrations, previously has worked to discredit the risk of second hand smoke on

    behalf of Phillip Morris and its allies. </font></p>

<font FACE="Times New">

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, two communications contained in the PhRMA meeting

    documents shed some light on how PhRMA sponsors, or considers sponsoring, supposedly

    objective researchers and commentators:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan. 7, 2000 &#151; Betsey McCaughey Ross, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, wrote

    a letter to Alan Holmer, PhRMA president and CEO, in advance of a scheduled meeting

    &quot;asking PhRMA to support my work at the Hudson Institute, because my writings on

    health care policy can make a substantial difference in public opinion and in the

    nation&#146;s capitol. My track record proves it.&quot; McCaughey is the former Lieutenant

    Governor of New York State under Governor George Pataki. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan. 17, 2000 &#151; Dr. Robert Goldberg, senior research fellow at the Ethics and

    Public Policy Center, sent a memorandum to Alixe Mattingly, PhRMA&#146;s senior vice

    president for public affairs, noting that &quot;last year I put out a steady stream of

    articles (see attached samples), did dozens of radio interviews and participated in a

    number of live and televised forums on the issue of prescription drug

    coverage...Ironically I have been so busy that I have not had time to reach out to the

    right people for such additional funding. So now I am asking your help to help me contact

    the appropriate individuals in various companies to support my research and writing.&quot;
