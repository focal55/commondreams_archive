- May 24 - Citing serious environmental concerns, the Sierra Club

     today expressed disappointment that the U.S. House of Representatives

     narrowly approved permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status with

     China, but vowed to continue the fight for global fairness.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The following is a statement from Carl Pope, the Sierra Club's Executive

     Director:

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This trade agreement fails to protect workers, their families and the

     environment.  By accepting permanent normal trade relations, Congress

     has relinquished what little leverage it had to ensure that values such

     as environmental protection and human rights are part of our

     relationship with China."

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By accepting permanent normal trade relations, Congress has made it

     more difficult to protect the environment and human rights. Congress

     and the Clinton Administration must do more to ensure global trade is

     clean, green, and fair."

</font>

<p>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today's vote in the U.S. House of Representatives was much closer

     than the pundits predicted, and we thank the many courageous

     legislators who voted for principle over profit."

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This vote does not end the fight for global fairness. In fact, the

     coalition of environmental, labor and consumer groups has emerged from

     this fight stronger than ever with broader backing that now includes

     human rights groups, small business, faith-based organizations, and

     veterans organizations."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The Sierra Club opposed PNTR for three reasons.  Retaining annual

     review would:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * give the United States influence with China over the issue of

     reforms to make the World Trade Organization more open and

     transparent, which China has said it would oppose;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * provide leverage to protect the human rights of environmentalists in

     China; and

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * provide leverage to ensure China's compliance with international

     environmental agreements, such as those protecting endangered species.</font>
