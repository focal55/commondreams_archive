- April 12 - A petition filed with the Environmental Protection Agency by the environmental group Bluewater Network and 53 other organizations last month has forced the EPA to act to tighten regulatory screws on the cruise industry, notorious for a string of convictions for illegally polluting the oceans. Today’s issue of Inside EPA’s Water Policy Report reveals that the EPA has launched a rapid response initiative to address the titanic amount of pollution being caused by cruise ships. The petition has also ruffled the feathers of the cruise industry, which issued a scathing press release Monday countering the petition and sent letters to each of the petition’s recipients and signatories. 



<p>The petition (at <a href="http://www.iwpextra.com/ee00247.pdf">http://www.iwpextra.com/ee00247.pdf</a>), sent to EPA Administrator Carol Browner on March 17, 2000, highlights numerous loopholes and exemptions in environmental laws that should be controlling pollution by these colossal ships, and calls on the EPA to come up with ways to better monitor and regulate the renegade cruise industry. “Regulatory loopholes are allowing cruise ships to dump millions of gallons of pollutants into our nation’s most sensitive waters. Cruise ships are floating cities that generate tremendous volumes of waste, and some of these wastes are completely unregulated, while others are exempt from key regulations governing other industries,” said Kira Schmidt, Director of Bluewater Network’s Cruise Ship Campaign. The petition exposes the cruise industry’s checkered past as proof of the need to tighten regulation of the industry. “Several cruise lines have been caught illegally and intentionally polluting our waters, dumping oil, garbage and hazardous wastes at sea as well as in our ports. This legacy of pollution, coupled with the inadequacy of existing regulations and oversight of the industry, clearly adds up to the need for action to address cruise ship pollution,” said Schmidt.



<p>According to Inside EPA’s Water Policy Report and internal EPA documents it obtained (at <a href="http://www.iwpextra.com/ee00247.pdf">http://www.iwpextra.com/ee00247.pdf</a>), EPA has formed an interagency work group to draft and implement a rapid coordinated response to the petition. The agency has drawn up a draft action plan outlining EPA actions on the petition, including holding public hearings, publishing a report and recommendations, and issuing an Advance Notice for Proposed Rulemaking on regulation of cruise ship wastewater, all within the next six months. 



<p>The cruise industry’s response to Bluewater’s petition (at <a href="http://www.iccl.org/publicinfo/release27.html">http://www.iccl.org/publicinfo/release27.html</a>) was not quite as positive. It scolds the petition’s tone, characterizes its recommendations as unproductive and sensationalistic, and claims that the cruise industry “cares about the environment and is proactively developing solutions to environmental challenges.” Bluewater Network has responded to the industry’s letters and press release by sending its own letter (at <a href="http://www.earthisland.org/bw/response.shtml">http://www.earthisland.org/bw/response.shtml</a>) to the petition’s recipients and signatory organizations today, stating that voluntary initiatives by the cruise industry in attempting to improve their environmental performance are welcome, but must be complemented by regulatory measures which ensure that cruise ships do not continue to recklessly pollute the marine environment. “The cruise industry must learn to ‘walk its talk,’” said Schmidt.
