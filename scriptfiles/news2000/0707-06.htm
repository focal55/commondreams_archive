- July 7 - In a statement finalized just late 

yesterday, the insurance giant GEICO has announced it 

will no longer permit its advertising to appear during 

Laura Schlessinger's radio program.



<p>"We have decided we will not continue our advertising on 

the 'Dr. Laura' radio program," the statement read. 



<p>"GEICO is an equal opportunity employer and does not 

condone discrimination of any type directed toward any 

minority," the statement continued, directly linking 

GEICO's decision with the controversy over Schlessinger's 

anti-gay statements.



<p>The statement, provided to StopDrLaura.com by GEICO's 

assistant vice president and director of communications, 

Walter Smith, points to a flood of concerned messages 

from consumers regarding GEICO ads during the "Dr. Laura" 

radio show. "Recently, we have received a great deal of 

feedback -- some positive, mostly negative -- regarding 

our advertising on the 'Dr. Laura Schlessinger' radio 

program. Most of the negative feedback has been from the 

gay and lesbian community, which finds many of Dr. 

Laura's comments concerning sexual orientation to be 

highly offensive and prejudicial."



<p>For three weeks, the StopDrLaura.com site had urged 

viewers to contact GEICO. The site, which has received a 

flood of over 30 million hits and millions of unique 

visitors since its March 1 launch, contained contact 

information for GEICO and other companies connected with 

Schlessinger's program. 



<p>GEICO joins a growing list of major corporations that 

have distanced themselves from Schlessinger, including 

Procter & Gamble, United Airlines, American Express, 

Xerox, Toys R Us, More.com, BoxLot, and Amica Insurance. 



<p>"Corporate America has spoken: Schlessinger is bad for 

business," said Joel Lawson, a co-founder of 

StopDrLaura.com. "Paramount is the only company in 

America that hasn't figured this out."





<p>GEICO STATEMENT:<br>

Thursday, July 6, 2000



<p>"Recently, we have received a great deal of feedback -- 

some positive, mostly negative -- regarding our 

advertising on the "Dr. Laura Schlessinger" radio 

program. Most of the negative feedback has been from he 

gay and lesbian community, which finds many of Dr. 

Laura's comments concerning sexual orientation to be 

highly offensive and prejudicial. 



<p>"GEICO is and has been an insurer for everyone. To reach 

all audiences, we advertise in a wide range of media. We 

do not endorse the views expressed by the personalities 

on whose shows we advertise, but we do monitor the results 

of these advertising efforts closely, and we take 

seriously the feedback we receive from our policyholders 

and the listening and viewing public. Having analyzed 

these factors, we have decided we will not continue our 

advertising on the "Dr. Laura" radio program effective 

July 1. GEICO is an equal opportunity employer and does 

not condone discrimination of any type directed toward 

any minority."
