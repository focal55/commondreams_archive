- July 7 - Is self-hatred any way to sell something to girls? "4 out 5 girls you hate ask for it by name," reads the full-page ad in the June/July 2000 issue of Teen People. "Stop hating them. Start being them. With original Sun-In ® spray-in hair lightener and Super Streaks gel."



<p>The national advocacy group Dads and Daughters today called on Chattem Inc., manufacturer of Sun-In ®, to pull this offensive marketing campaign, and individual DADs members have begun writing the company with the same request.



<p>In a letter to Chattem Inc. Chairman and CEO Zan Guerry, Dads and Daughters stated: "This campaign feeds off of and exacerbates the serious problem of put-downs and bullying among girls, based on petty competition over outward appearance. We want our daughters to be more than the narrow, bleach-streaked hair definition of beauty promoted by this ad as a girl’s desired identity. We never want our daughters to desire becoming something or someone they hate. We hope that you will respond responsibly and promptly pull this advertisement, apologize for using it, and reexamine your strategies of marketing to children." DADs executive director Joe Kelly adds, "This ad directly tells teen girls to become the thing they hate." 



<p>Dads and Daughters suggests that other parents ask the company to pull this Sun-In® campaign by contacting Zan Guerry, Chairman and CEO, Chattem Inc., 1715 West 38th Street Chattanooga, TN 37409-1248; by calling President and Chief Operating Officer A. Alexander Taylor at 423-821-2037 Ext. 281; or by emailing Taylor at <a href="mailto:ataylor@chattem.com">ataylor@chattem.com</a>.



<p>Dads and Daughters is the national nonprofit membership group for fathers and daughters. DADs helps strengthen fathers-daughters relationships and transform the pervasive messages that value girls more for how they look than who they are. DADs acts against marketers who undermine daughters to sell their products, and draws attention to those who market successfully without undermining kids. Chattem Inc. (NASDAQ symbol CHTT) is the international health and beauty manufacturer of products like Dexatrim, Ban, Pamprin, and Phisoderm. Chattem had 1999 net sales of over $298 million.
