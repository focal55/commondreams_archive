- July 21 - The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior attempted to deliver 8 logs from Russian forests today to G-8 leaders to highlight the elevated rate of illegal and destructive logging that continues to occur throughout the world's last remaining ancient forests. The logs of oak and ash are from Russia's Primorsky region where, according to regional government statistics, 80 per cent of logging is illegal. Along with the logs, the Greenpeace activists tried to deliver a letter to the G-8 heads of state explaining their demands. Each log has the flag of one of the eight G-8 countries on it and  banners with crime painted across them. The Rainbow Warrior and the log barge are currently half a mile off shore from the Summit Meeting venue.

The activists have now been on cranes for more than 20 hours to prevent any more cargo from making it to the markets in Germany.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Greenpeace, time is running out for the ancient forests, of which only 20 per cent remains of the original forest cover on Earth. An area the size of a football pitch is destroyed every two seconds. And while the G-8 Foreign Ministers met last week, Greenpeace intercepted ships carrying illegal timber in Russia, Japan, Portugal and Spain.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The time to act is now. The leaders of the G-8 still have an opportunity to really do something to protect the world's ancient forests," said Michelle Sheather, Greenpeace spokesperson onboard the Rainbow Warrior in Okinawa. "In 1997 and 1998 at the G-8 summits many promises were made to combat illegal and destructive logging, yet not one of these promises has been kept. The G-8 must move beyond words and start taking action, before it's too late for our ancient forests."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Along with the US, the countries of the European Union import 75 per cent of the world's timber production. G-8 countries are also providing billions of dollars in subsidies <a href="#one">(1)</a> to help companies log the world's last ancient forests according to a report released yesterday by the World Resources Institute. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recent actions carried out by Greenpeace and the Rainbow Warrior have resulted in very positive steps to protect the world's forests. In Russia, the Primorsky Regional Forest Prosecutor's office has suspended all logging until a thorough investigation is completed. In Japan, after two days of occupying containers proven to be transporting plywood from the Amazon, and after peaceful confrontation with the heads of the importing logging giant, Eidai, Greenpeace obtained a commitment from the company's director's to stop purchasing illegal timber from the Amazon.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The G-8 can no longer turn their back on the ancient forests. They must assess and abolish subsidies that harm forests, implement domestic policies and laws to prevent trade in illegal and destructive logging and give development aid to combat illegal logging and trade.  We now need meaningful agreements by the G-8 to save the last ancient forests," concluded Sheather.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note to Editors:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="one">(1)</a> Subsidies are economic incentives given by governments to particular industries. In the case of the timber industry, these subsidies are generally perverse, that is a subsidies that is harmful to the environment and the economy.
