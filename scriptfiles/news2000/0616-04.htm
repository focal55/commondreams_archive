- June 16 - News Advisory:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bianca Jagger will join Texas State Death Penalty Abolition



Coordinator Rick Halperin and Budd Welch, father of an Oklahoma City



bombing victim, at an Amnesty International press conference Monday,



June 19 at 11 a.m. to oppose the execution of Gary Graham. The press



conference will take place immediately after the delegation attempts



to deliver a letter to Governor George W. Bush, imploring the



Governor and Gerald Garrett, Chairman of the Texas Board of Pardons

&amp;



Paroles, to grant a pardon for Graham. Graham is scheduled for



lethal injection Thursday, June 22.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The case of Gary Graham, also known as Shaka Sankofa, has received



unprecedented media attention as officials, community leaders and



members of the public learn of grave doubts about his guilt.



Convicted of killing Bobby Lambert in 1981, Graham was denied the



right to adequate legal representation at his trial and was convicted



on the basis of one highly disputed eyewitness account. His original



trial lawyer failed to present extensive exculpatory, forensic and



ballistic evidence. Tests by the Houston Police Department showed



that the bullets that killed Lambert did not match the gun that



police found on Graham.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Gary Graham's execution looms at a time when the error-prone



nature of death sentencing in the USA has become abundantly clear,"



said Dr. William F. Schulz, Executive Director of Amnesty



International USA. "His is a textbook example of the fatal flaws



that riddle the application of the death penalty in the U.S."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to questions of his guilt, Amnesty International is



concerned about the execution of a juvenile offender. Graham was



only 17 years of age at the time of the crime, making capital



punishment in this case a violation of international law. Since



September 1997, there have been nine executions reported worldwide

of



people convicted of crimes committed when they were under the age of



18; seven of these occurred in the U.S. Twenty-one of the 47



executions that have occurred in the U.S. this year took place in the



state of Texas, which now accounts for 220 of the 645 prisoners put



to death since the USA resumed judicial killing in 1976.
