Author of "The Beast Reawakens," a book on neofascism, Lee said today:

"President Clinton's visit to Germany comes at a time when that country is

mired in a major political scandal, involving secret slush funds and illegal

influence-peddling by big business. The scandal has resulted in the fall

from grace of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl and several other leaders of the

Christian Democratic Union, now the main opposition party in Germany. Thus

far, U.S. officials have yet to acknowledge the role that the U.S.

government played in setting the stage for this scandal. For years,

Washington turned a blind eye to political corruption in West Germany in the

interests of fighting Communism. Obsessed with turning West Germany into a

bulwark against the Soviet Union, U.S. officials sanctioned the restoration

of numerous Nazis and Third Reich veterans to positions of power in West

Germany during the Cold War. Among those who benefitted from this policy

were Fritz Ries, a wealthy industrialist who made a fortune from

expropriating 'Aryanized' Jewish property and from slave labor in factories

near Auschwitz. Not only was Ries never punished for his crimes, he went on

to become Helmut Kohl's principal patron within the German business

community. Therein lay the roots of the current political scandal, which has

been described as Germany's version of Watergate."

Senior fellow at the Center for Defense Information, Johnson edits a daily

email newsletter on Russia. He said today: "At the beginning of the 1990s,

Russians were very pro-American. But the U.S.'s role as an enthusiastic

supporter of Yeltsin has made Russians associate the U.S. with the failures

of economic reform and the corrupt privatization program that was

implemented with American advice and financing. A third of the population

now lives in crushing poverty and most others face a daily struggle to make

ends meet. There has been a massive deterioration of the social

infrastructure. While elections have become an accepted feature of political

life, power has been centralized in a corrupt elite who control the

country's major economic assets and much of its media. Compounding the

disillusionment has been the expansion of the NATO military alliance and

occasions such as the war in Yugoslavia in 1999. The brutal war in Chechnya

has been President Vladimir Putin's main focus since Yeltsin appointed him

prime minister in August 1999.... The dominant and enduring U.S. interest in

Russia has been to help secure and remove the huge arsenal of nuclear

weapons and nuclear materials that Russia inherited from the Soviet Union.

But Russia's continuing economic catastrophe threatens to undermine attempts

to address the nuclear issue."</font>
