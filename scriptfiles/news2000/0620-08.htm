- June 20 - The Human Rights Campaign praised the Senate's bipartisan

effort to pass historic federal hate crime legislation today that covers

sexual orientation, disability and gender. While today's vote is monumental,

the House needs to follow suit and quickly pass hate crime legislation,

according to HRC.

<p>"Thanks to the bipartisan efforts of the Senate and the leadership

of President Clinton, America is one step closer to becoming a safer place

for all Americans," said HRC Executive Director Elizabeth Birch. "This is

commonsense legislation that most people support and we are optimistic the

House will follow the Senate's lead and vote to send a message that hate

violence is unacceptable in this nation."

<p>The Senate voted 57 to 42 to pass the language of the Hate Crimes

Prevention Act (HCPA) - renamed the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of

2000 - as an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill. This

vote was significant because it was the first time hate crime legislation

was allowed to be voted on in either the full House or Senate - and it

passed. The amendment was sponsored by Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and

Gordon Smith, R-Ore.

<p>"We are pleased the bill's passage came one week after the two year

anniversary of the murder of James Byrd Jr.," said Birch, of the African

American who was chained to the back of a truck and dragged to his death on

a backwoods road in Jasper, Texas. "We hope the memory of people like James

Byrd Jr. and Matthew Shepard will move the House to action, so they can

leave legacies of helping to end hate violence in America."

<p>The HCPA would extend current federal hate crime protection

- which covers race, religion, color and national origin -- to gender,

sexual orientation and disability. HCPA would serve as a tool to help law

enforcement by allowing federal assistance, when necessary, in the

investigation and prosecutions of hate crimes. HCPA has broad support from

notable law enforcement agencies and state and local leaders including 22

state attorneys general, the Police Foundation and the National Sheriff's

Association.

<p><i>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay

political organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively

lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to

ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and safe at home,

at work and in the community.
