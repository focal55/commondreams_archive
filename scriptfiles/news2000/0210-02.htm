<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HONG KONG 

- February 10 - Greenpeace today welcomed Nestle Hong Kong’s announcement to phase out genetically engineered (GE) food, but called on the company to commit to GE free production worldwide in a demonstration organised in front of the Nestle offices in Hong Kong. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We are pleased that Nestle finally accepted that consumers in Hong Kong have the same right to GE free food as their fellow consumers in other countries such as UK, France or Belgium," said Lo Sze Ping of Greenpeace. "We expect Nestle to adopt this policy also in mainland China." 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a letter to Greenpeace Nestle Hong Kong stated that the majority of its products do not contain genetically engineered ingredients, and that Nestle is in the process in removing GE ingredients in remaining products. "We congratulate Nestle Hong Kong for the decision and urge other Nestle subsidiaries follow the suit,” said Isabelle Meister of Greenpeace. "So far Nestle has been playing for time with consumers and has tried to avoid a commitment to GE free production where ever possible." 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We will keep an eye on Nestle products around the world," said Meister. "All consumers have the right to GE-free food. Greenpeace will not accept double standards where some consumers get GE free food and the others buy GE contaminated products from Nestle." 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nestle Hong Kong is the sixth national Nestle subsidiary to commit to phase out genetically engineered organisms from its products. Nestle UK, France, Belgium, Austria and Germany all committed to GE free production last year.
