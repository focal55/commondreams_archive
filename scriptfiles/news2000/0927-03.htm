- September 27 - The Sierra Club today criticized Members of Congress who

     voted last night to weaken the standards that protect American

     communities from hazardous waste.  Fortunately, the Congressional

     leadership failed in their effort to let selected businesses avoid

     paying to clean up their toxic pollution.

<p>

     The Sierra Club is calling on people to urge their Representatives to

     stand up for the environment and vote against efforts to weaken

     pollution standards in the upcoming budget bills.  Despite having 253

     Members of Congress in favor of weakening the Superfund policy, the

     161 Representatives opposed to this effort were able to reject the

     legislation because the bill, H.R 5171, required a two-thirds majority

     to pass.

<p>

     "The Congressional leadership tried to open a loophole in the nation's

     toxic waste cleanup law and allow large polluters to escape the cost

     of cleaning up their toxic waste," said Ed Hopkins, Director of Sierra

     Club's Environmental Quality Program.  "When industries threaten our

     families' health with toxic waste, taxpayers shouldn't be saddled with

     the clean-up costs -- Americans want the polluters to pay."

<p>

     Creating a new loophole in the Superfund toxic waste law, the bill

     would have allowed thousands of businesses to escape responsibility

     for their pollution.

<p>

     Additionally, twisting the nation's Superfund law in a dubious

     direction, the bill would have shifted the burden of proving toxic

     waste violations.  Under the proposed change, the U.S. government

     would be forced to determine that a business was not exempt from the

     law because it shipped more than an allowable amount of weight.  This

     reversal of U.S. law would place an enormous burden on government to

     investigate businesses' operations.

<p>

     "By exempting some polluters from paying their fair costs of cleaning

     up toxic waste, this bill would have dumped the costs onto taxpayers

     or other businesses," said Hopkins.  "And it would have eliminated an

     important incentive to curtail future pollution by removing the threat

     of enforcement."

<p>

     Under the current federal Superfund cleanup program, the Environmental

     Protection Agency has established a program to reduce small-business

     liability for their contribution of waste to Superfund sites.

     According to the EPA, this program has given relief to more than

     18,000 small businesses from the Superfund liability system to date.

<p>

     The Sierra Club is asking people to call their Representatives and

     urge them to vote against other efforts to weaken toxic waste

     standards in the remaining budget bills.
