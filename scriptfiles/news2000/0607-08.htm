- June 7 - News Advisory:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following was released today by the Project on Government



Oversight:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The F-22 jet fighter is a misguided weapon procurement that will



weaken U.S. military capability," according to Air Force Colonel



Riccioni (ret.) who will speak at a briefing on Thursday, June 8.



"The F-22 has not demonstrated that it can achieve effective



supersonic cruise, is not stealthy and provides only a small step



forward in performance over the F-15C fighter jet," he added.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A legendary fighter pilot, aircraft designer and Pentagon insider,



Colonel Riccioni analyzed publicly available data for the F-22 and



concluded that Congress and the public were being mislead about the



technological and military capacities of the jet. Col. Riccioni, who



pioneered supersonic cruise technology and managed the design of many



supercruise fighter designs, has never spoken publicly on the F-22

or



other weapons systems.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today Representative Pete DeFazio (D-OR) intends to introduce an



amendment to the Defense budget bill to cut production funding for



the F-22 from ten jets down to six jets as recommended by a May GAO



report.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About the Briefing.



Colonel Riccioni will brief the press about his findings on



Thursday, June 8th, 2000 from 8:30 to 10:00 a.m. The location of the



event is the Cabinet Room of the Old Ebbitt Grill at 675 15th Street



in downtown Washington, DC. To RSVP or to learn more about the



event, contact Beth Daley at 202-466-5539.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About Colonel Riccioni (ret.).



Colonel Riccioni pioneered the Lightweight Fighter Program and



supersonic cruise technology in the 1970s. He was one of the three



legendary "Fighter Mafia" mavericks who forced the Pentagon to



produce the F-16 to improve the military's numerical air superiority.



He served in the Air Force for 30 years, completed several stints as



a fighter pilot and flew 55 different types of military aircraft over



his career. He worked for Northrop Corporation for 17 years



analyzing and managing aircraft programs, including the B-2 bomber.



He defined the operational role of the B-2 bomber with conventional



weapons. In recent years, Riccioni consulted with the GAO, the U.S.



Navy, and the Air Force.
