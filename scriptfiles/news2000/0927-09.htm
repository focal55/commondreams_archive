- September 27 - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today passed legislation which bans 

all U.S. military assistance to Indonesia. The committee passed the measure 

unanimously by voice vote. The bill now goes to the Senate floor.



<p>The legislation, the East Timor Repatriation and Security Act Of 2000 (S. 

2621), bans military cooperation with and assistance to the Indonesian 

armed forces until the U.S. President certifies certain conditions have 

been met by the Indonesian government and military, including the safe 

return of refugees to East Timor and judicial accountability for military 

and militia members responsible for human rights violations in East Timor 

and Indonesia. The bill also requires Indonesia to demonstrate a commitment 

to prevent militia incursions into East Timor and to not impede the UN 

administration in East Timor.



<p>"This bill prevents the U.S. from prematurely resuming military ties with 

Indonesia. Its passage today adds to widespread international pressure on 

Indonesia to rein in the militias and end the collusion between the 

military and the militias it created," said Karen Orenstein of the East 

Timor Action Network. "We join with the U.S. Congress in urging the 

Indonesian government to live up to its own promises to take action for 

peace, stability and justice for East Timor."



<p>The law cites the September 6 killing of three U.N. humanitarian workers 

(including a U.S. citizen) in West Timor by militias, Indonesian armed 

forces training and support for the militias,  the deaths of two UN 

peacekeepers in East Timor in militia attacks, and the murder of U.S. 

resident and human rights lawyer Jafar Siddiq Hamzah in Medan, Indonesia, 

as reasons for the measure.



<p>S. 2621 extends and expands current congressional restrictions passed in 

November 1999 as part of the FY 2000 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. 

That legislation only covers items such as International Military Education 

and Training (IMET) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF) that must be 

renewed annually.



<p>S. 2621 was introduced by Senator Russell Feingold (D-WI) and co-sponsored 

by nine others, including Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Tom Harkin (D-IA) and 

Lincoln Chafee (R-RI).



<p>In September 1999, the U.S. suspended military ties and economic assistance 

to Indonesia while the Indonesian military and its militias were destroying 

East Timor following the August 30 independence vote. Soon after, the 

Indonesian military began to withdraw from East Timor and an international 

peacekeeping force entered.



<p>Last spring, the U.S. military began a planned phased re-engagement with 

its Indonesian counterparts. Indonesian officers took part as observers in 

a U.S.-sponsored Cobra Gold military exercise in Thailand in May. In July, 

a joint U.S.-Indonesian exercise called CARAT/2000, in which the Indonesian 

navy and marines trained with their U.S. military counterparts, took place 

in East Java.



<p>Just prior to Secretary of Defense William Cohen's visit to Indonesia on 

September 17 and 18, the Pentagon said it had reinstated the U.S. 

suspension of military assistance to Indonesia.



<p>A companion bill, The Repatriation and Security Act of 2000 (HR 4357), was 

introduced earlier this year in the House of Representatives by Jim 

McGovern (D-MA), Chris Smith (R-NJ), Patrick Kennedy (D-RI) and others. HR 

4357 currently has 55 sponsors.



<p>Copies of this and other related legislation can be found at

<p>The East Timor Action Network/ U.S. (ETAN) was founded in November 1991 to 

support East Timorese self-determination. ETAN supports human rights in 

Indonesia and works for a peaceful transition to independence in East 

Timor. It has 28 local chapters throughout the U.S.
