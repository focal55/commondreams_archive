- October 28 - Ralph Nader today announced his support

of the Massachusetts Health Care Reform Ballot Initiative, Question 5.



<p>Question 5 requires the Massachusetts legislature to enact universal

health coverage by July 1, 2001, and implement it by July 1, 2002.  The

initiative would establish a broadly representative Health Council to

advise the legislature on the specifics of a universal health care

program.  More than 110,000 Massachusetts citizens signed a petition to

put the initiative on the ballot.



<p>The Health Council would develop a plan for a health care system that

provides barrier-free access to health care; assures patients’ freedom

to choose health care providers and health care professionals’ freedom

to act solely in the best interest of their patients; guarantees

affordable coverage; preserves and increases the quality of care and

encourages research; and simplifies paperwork.



<p>Until the Council has determined that an appropriate health system is

established, Question 5 would prohibit the conversion of non-profit

HMOs, hospitals, and health insurance firms to for-profit status.  It

would also limit the amount HMOs could spend on overhead to 10% of

premiums, and prohibit HMOs from offering physicians financial

incentives to limit care.



<p>The Vote for Health—Yes on 5 committee evolved from a movement of

Massachusetts physicians and nurses who four years ago formed the Ad Hoc

Committee to Defend Health Care in an effort to refocus the health care

debate on the needs of patients. HMOs are spending more than $1 million

per week on advertising and other efforts to defeat the initiative.



<p>If passed, the ballot initiative would make Massachusetts the first

state in the nation to achieve universal access to comprehensive,

high-quality health care for all its residents.



<p>Nader said the measure, which would ensure that at least 90% of every

Massachusetts health care dollar is spent on patient care, instead of

being diverted into paperwork and shareholder profits, is an important

step in beginning to control unchecked excesses of the HMO industry.



<p>“HMOs are destabilizing themselves by their own greed, by

their manhandling of the professions in the medical and nursing areas,

and their abuse of consumers. I think we are in a real transition period

here that gives us a great opportunity to recast our health care system

into a nonprofit mode and expand to universal health care,” Nader said.
