- January 27 - Most New Hampshire

residents want tax breaks for polluting industries eliminated,



according to a recent poll by Friends of the Earth. The poll



found that 66 percent of respondents favor eliminating corporate



welfare for polluters. Only 23 percent of those questioned



favored keeping the tax breaks in place. Support for cutting



the tax breaks is strong among both Democrats and Republicans.

<p>"This poll shows that Bill Bradley and John McCain are onto

something by attacking corporate welfare to polluting industries,"



said Gawain Kripke, Friends of the Earth's economics campaigns



director. "New Hampshire voters strongly favor eliminating unfair



tax breaks."

<p>When asked how to use the money saved from the eliminated tax

breaks, nearly half of New Hampshire residents favor using the funds



to save Social Security and Medicare programs. Alternatively,



27 percent of respondents prefer using the money for additional



environmental protection and 22 percent want to use the money to pay



down the national debt.

<p>Democratic candidate Bill Bradley and Republican candidate John

McCain have proposed eliminating a variety of special tax breaksfor



polluting industries as part of their policy proposals.

<p>Friends of the Earth recently reported that the cost of tax

breaks to oil &amp; gas and mining industries has been growing in recent



years, rising to $20.1 billion over the next five years.

<p>"Tax loopholes reward corporations for polluting the air and

water while placing a greater tax burden on the public" said Brian



Dunkiel, Friends of the Earth's director of tax policy. "These



unnecessary and harmful subsidies should be eliminated."
