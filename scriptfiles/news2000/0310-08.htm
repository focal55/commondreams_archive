<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LOS ANGELES  

- March 10 - The StopDrLaura.com 

coalition announced today that protests will be 

held at the gates of Paramount Studios, Tuesday 

March 21, 8:30-10:30 a.m. PST. Paramount 

Television Group is located at 5555 Melrose 

Avenue in Hollywood.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Paramount would never give a TV show to a host 

that called any other minority 'biological 

errors,'" said Robin Tyler, lead organizer of 

the protest and a member of the StopDrLaura.com 

team. "We will take our message 

to the gates of Paramount."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The studio plans to offer "Dr. Laura" on 

television this fall. Schlessinger has used her 

current radio program to rail against gays and 

lesbians, calling them "deviant," "biological 

errors" and has suggested that gays are likely 

to be involved in pedophilia.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The protest will be co-sponsored by The 

Horizons Foundation (<a href="http://www.horizonsfoundation.org">www.horizonsfoundation.org</a>). 

Two weeks ago, the Child Welfare League of America 

and the National Mental Health Association of America 

joined Horizons to run full-page ads in the 

New York Times, L.A. Times, San Francisco 

Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner asking 

Dr. Laura to consider the effect of her anti-gay 

rhetoric on children. Schlessinger failed to respond to 

Horizons' open letter. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It is now up to Paramount to mitigate the damage 

Dr. Laura causes and refuses to acknowledge by 

shelving the ill-conceived concepts of a Dr. 

Laura TV program," said Peter Teague, Horizons' 

executive director.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tyler said she expects the protest to be 

sizable, as it comes on the heels of the 

passage of an anti-gay ballot measure in 

California, the Knight Initiative, which 

Schlessinger actively promoted on her radio 

program. "Prop. 22 was as much her victory as 

Sen. Knight's," Tyler said. "Enough is enough."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The groups decided on a protest at a meeting 

last night in Los Angeles, attended by a number 

of leading gay and civil rights activists, and 

entertainment industry figures.  



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The protest announcement comes just eight days 

after the debut of StopDrLaura.com. The site 

has received more than three million hits, and 

ratcheted up the controversy over "Dr. Laura" 

to a point where local TV stations are 

"squirming," forcing Schlessinger to hire a 

crisis management firm.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paramount is being "besieged" with emails and 

telephone calls, reports the New York Times 

(3/5). "She hired a crisis-management firm," 

reported the latest edition of People magazine 

(3/20). Earlier in the week, Schlessinger 

railed against her critics in a 15-minute 

monologue during her daily radio program. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Criticism sends 'Dr.' Laura into a tizzy" the 

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on 

Schlessinger's strange diatribe, in which she 

called John McCain "despicable," labeled her 

critics "fascists," and even diagnosed the 

entire sitcom "Frasier" as "sick."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LOCAL TV STATIONS "SQUIRMING"

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, some of the local TV stations that 

have signed up to air Paramount's "Dr. Laura" 

show this fall may be having second thoughts. 

The alternative Houston Press reported this 

week that "executives are squirming" at the 

affiliate there, Channel 2. "KPRC has found 

itself stuck in a roiling controversy months 

before the first show is even broadcast this 

fall," the Press reported. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, San Francisco's KPIX, which also 

purchased "Dr. Laura," quickly found itself 

featured on the front page of StopDrLaura.com, 

and also in the bulls-eye of activists in that 

city. As the San Francisco board of supervisors 

passed a resolution opposing Schlessinger's 

anti-gay rhetoric, activists began discussions 

about protesting at KPIX.
