-  February 23 - Scientists and



concerned citizens gathered today for simultaneous press briefings



in three Midwest cities -- Cincinnati, Ohio; Marietta, Ohio; and



Huntington, W.Va.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They were there to release a new report titled "Ohio Valley --



Ozone Alley, a comprehensive study on smog pollution and power



plants in the Ohio River Valley and what can be done to clean them



up.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "Ohio Valley-Ozone Alley" report reveals that contrary to



popular opinion, air pollution can be worse in the Midwest than it



is in the Northeastern United States. A Harvard University



researcher reports that parts of the Ohio River Valley typically



experience health-damaging ozone smog more hours per year than



Northeast cities, even though peak pollution levels are higher on



the East Coast. This increased health risk correlates with a higher



per capita rate of hospital admissions in the Ohio River Valley due



to respiratory disorders. According to a recent study conducted by



Abt Associates, communities in the Ohio River Valley had up to



17 percent more hospital admissions during the 1997 summer smog



season than cities such as Boston or New York.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's not the peaks of ozone that do the most damage; it's the



sustained exposure," noted Dr. George Leikauf, professor of



environmental health at the University of Cincinnati. "By that



measure, the Ohio River Valley truly is a unique alleyway of high



ozone."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also establishes for the first time that emissions



from older-coal and oil-fired power plants in the Ohio River Valley



are the major source of the problem. Power plants in the Ohio River



Valley emit more than 1 million tons of nitrogen oxide (NOx) per



year, a primary culprit in ozone pollution.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We knew that power plants are a big factor in Midwest air



pollution, but this study surprised us with just how big it really



is," says Dr. Sandy Sillman, a professor of atmospheric studies at



the University of Michigan and a contributor to the report. "As



much as 50 percent of ozone pollution in the Ohio River Valley is



caused by power plants in the region."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Authors of the report maintain that utilizing up-to-date



pollution controls on some plants and coverting others to newer,



cleaner technologies would dramatically improve air quality not



only in the Northeast, but also in the Midwest and South. Nitrogen



oxide emissions could be reduced by adding



off-the-shelf control technologies to smokestacks, replacing



coal-fired plants with cleaner natural gas plants, increasing the



use of renewable energy, and investing in energy conservation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Despite the rhetoric on both sides, smog is not really an



inter-regional fight," says Kurt Waltzer of the Ohio Environmental



Council. "The pollution is in everyone's back yard and the Midwest



stands to gain even more from cleaning up our region's older plants



than the Northeast will."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report was commissioned by the Ohio Environmental Council



with primary funding from the W. Alton Jones Foundation. Research



was conducted by scientists from Harvard University, the University



of Michigan, and Abt Associates. The report will be posted online



on Feb. 23. See <a href="http://www.theoec.org/ohio-valley">www.theoec.org/ohio-valley</a>
