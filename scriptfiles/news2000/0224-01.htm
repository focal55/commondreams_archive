- February 24 - A lawsuit filed in



the US Circuit Court today seeks to compel the Environmental



Protection Agency to create strong emission standards for large sea-going vessels that impose a significant smog burden on US



port cities, including: Seattle, Oakland, Los Angeles, Houston,



New Orleans, Miami, Baltimore, New York/New Jersey and Boston.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to EPA, those vessels belch 273 thousand tons per



year 748 tons each day of nitrogen oxides (NOx) into U.S. air.



The lawsuit, filed by Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund on behalf



of the Bluewater Network, challenges EPA's failure to set



any standard for NOx emissions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"EPA could have set standards that would have reduced smog and



protected public health. In addition to smog-forming pollutants such



as NOx, large ships in port areas create tremendous health impacts



due to airborne particulate pollution which seriously impacts low



income communities near port facilities," said Russell Long,



executive director, Bluewater Network.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Clean Air Act requires EPA to establish regulations to reduce



air pollution from non-automobile engines that significantly



contribute to pollution in areas with poor air quality. Based on a



1991 study, EPA determined that the largest type of ship engines



called "Category 3" engines were a "substantial" contributor of



important pollutants, including NOx and particulate matter.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA claims it does not need to regulate these engines because an



international agreement called Annex VI to the International



Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) limits



NOx emissions. However, as Bluewater Network made clear to EPA



before the rule was finalized, Annex VI is not an enforceable



agreement and is unlikely to be anytime soon. The agreement



will only go into effect when countries responsible for at least



50 percent of the world's shipping traffic ratify the treaty.



So far only two nations have done so, and they represent only



5 percent of the world shipping. Although the United States



has signed Annex VI, the Clinton administration has not even



asked the Senate for the necessary permission to ratify it.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"EPA's refusal to regulate emissions from these ships is not only



illegal, it places an unnecessary obstacle in the way of efforts to



improve U.S. air quality," said Martin Wagner, attorney for



Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund. "While cities work to clean up



land-based pollution sources and Californians take their vehicles in



for smog checks, unregulated cargo ships, tankers, and cruise ships



keep belching pollution into our cities. An unenforceable



international treaty does not allow EPA to abandon its responsibility



to regulate pollution in the United States."</font>
