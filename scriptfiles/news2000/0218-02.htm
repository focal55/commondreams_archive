- February 17 - This is a statement of General

            Secretary Dr. Thom White Wolf Fassett. The General Board is directed to

            &quot;speak its convictions, interpretations, and concerns to the Church and to the

            world.&quot; </font>

     <p></p>

     <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

            We are disappointed that Attorney General Janet Reno would attempt to impose the death

            penalty on the District of Columbia in the case of Carl Cooper, the alleged

            &quot;Starbucks murderer.&quot; This case further perpetuates the finding that the death

            penalty is imposed in an arbitrary manner and falls disproportionately on the poor and

            minorities, especially when the victim or victims are white.</font></p>

     <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The people of the District of Columbia have repeatedly voted down the

            option of capital punishment, by referendum in 1992 and again by their City Council in

            1997. The citizens of the District should not be made to feel powerless in the democratic

            process. </font></p>

     <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United Methodist Church since 1972 has advocated the removal of the death penalty from

            all criminal codes. The Social Principles of The United Methodist Church condemn torture

            of persons by governments for any purpose and assert that it violates Christian teachings.

            </font></p>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge the Attorney General to reconsider imposing the death penalty on the District

            of Columbia. We are convinced that the nation's leaders should give attention to the

            improvement of the total criminal justice system and to the elimination of social

            conditions which breed crime and cause disorder rather than foster a false confidence in

            the effectiveness of the death penalty. </font></p>

            Conference Speaks for the entire denomination. The General Board of Church and Society is
