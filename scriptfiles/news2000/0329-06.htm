- March 29 - Two senators with close ties to big polluting industries are scheming to gut the Clean Air Act, the nonprofit Clean Air Trust warned today.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The alarm from the clean-air watchdog group came in reaction to reports that Senators George Voinovich (R-OH) and John Breaux (D-LA) would introduce legislation to prevent the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from setting health-based clean-air standards -- the quality of the air people breathe -- without a mandatory cost-benefit test.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This would cut out the heart of the Clean Air Act," said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is the biggest threat to the Clean Air Act since Ronald Reagan and his pro-polluter administration tried the same gambit in 1981," O'Donnell added.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Public health and environmental groups nationwide will rally as they did then to oppose this assault on our nation's preeminent environmental law."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Voinovich announced March 28 that he and Breaux would lead a charge to relax the Clean Air Act and require a mandatory cost-benefit test before EPA could issue clean air standards. O'Donnell noted that big polluting industries have promoted a similar attack on the law for decades under the belief that it would help them avoid cleanup.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Currently, O'Donnell noted, the Clean Air Act requires EPA to set national health standards based solely on scientific evidence -- giving Americans the right to know when the air they breath is unhealthful. Costs are then taken into consideration as EPA and the states devise programs to meet the health standards.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The proposed Voinovich-Breaux approach, O'Donnell said, "would pollute the science and eliminate the public's right to know when the air is dirty." O'Donnell noted that the benefits of cleanup are sometimes difficult to ascertain prospectively -- how much, for example, is a human life worth? -- while the costs have consistently been exaggerated by polluting industries.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Adopting the Voinovich-Breaux approach would put polluters in control of the process," O'Donnell asserted.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

O'Donnell noted that Voinovich has a long record of opposing clean air standards and of protecting one of the nation's most notorious polluters, American Electric Power Corp. based in Columbus, Ohio.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

As governor of Ohio, Voinovich joined with AEP and other big polluters in 1996 and 1997 against EPA's effort to update health standards for smog and soot -- an action that EPA said would prevent 15,000 premature deaths a year.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Breaux has long been a defender of Louisiana's oil and chemical industries. In 1990, Breaux tried to weaken the Clean Air Act to permit high levels of pollution -- so-called "dead zones" -- around chemical plants. (Breaux was thwarted by then-Senator Al Gore.)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Voinovich said he wants the Clean Air Act's standard-setting process process to mimic that of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's ironic that Voinovich would want to trade an approach that has been successful in setting real health standards and requiring real pollution reductions for one that is suspect at best," O'Donnell said.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Maybe that's why our drinking water often isn't safe," said O'Donnell. "Maybe that's why so many people buy bottled water or use water filters."

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By contrast," he added, "people don't wear gas masks and only people who already have badly damaged lungs carry bottled oxygen."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
