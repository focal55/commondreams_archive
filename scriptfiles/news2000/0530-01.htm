- May 30 - Greenpeace today applauded the logging company Precious Woods Amazon <a href="#uno">(1)</a> for its commitment to ecologically responsible logging in tropical rainforest ecosystems. During a meeting onboard Greenpeace's vessel, the Amazon Guardian, Precious Woods presented their declaration <a href="#due">(2)</a>, which was the outcome of negotiations and on-site forest inspections with Greenpeace experts that lasted more than a year. The declaration includes:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	Frequent comparisons between a set-aside forest reserve and the logged tracts to constantly improve forest management;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	Setting clear logging limits to guarantee that 85% of standing tree volume always remain in the forest;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	No application of pesticides, other chemicals or alien organisms, in order to maintain the natural state of the forest; and

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	Minimization of silviculture so that native trees species composition will not be altered.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Precious Woods, the only logging operation in the Amazon rainforest certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. FSC <a href="#tre">(3)</a>, is, through this declaration, exceeding the current certification requirements of the FSC. The FSC is the only credible international system that certifies well-managed forests from legal logging operations. FSC certified wood carries a label recognizable by consumers world-wide. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This forest management scheme should serve as a model for logging in ancient forests. An approach such as this is the best safeguard against destructive logging, and against illegal logging, which the Brazilian government themselves admits is 80% of all logging in the Amazon," said Roberto Kishinami, Greenpeace Brazil’s Executive Director. "It is proof that the logging industry can work in a responsible, ecologically sound manner, and will also contribute to further improvements to FSC standards world-wide.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Ecological logging, combined with other activities such as rubber tapping, ecotourism, demarcation of indigenous lands, and the extension of protected areas, will guarantee a secure and diverse economic and ecological future for the Amazon", Kishinami concluded.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><a name="tre">(3)</a> The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is an international, non-profit, non-governmental organisation that promotes independent, third party certification of well-managed forests and the labelling of products from such forests for use by forest product consumers. It was founded in 1993 by over 100 representatives from environmental, social and business interests from around the world, with the goal of promoting a common international set of basic principles and criteria for judging and certifying well-managed forests. The FSC standards also include a number of socially responsible practises, improving working and safety conditions throughout the entire production process.
