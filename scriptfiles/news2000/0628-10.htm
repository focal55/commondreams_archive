- June 28 - "Five to four is too slim a margin for women's rights.&nbsp; Women's

freedom hinges on one justice -- that's cause for alarm, not celebration,"

said National Organization for Women (NOW) President Patricia

Ireland in response to the Supreme Court's ruling in <i>Stenberg v.

Carhart</i> that struck down an anti-abortion law.&nbsp; "Today's decisions

on abortion provide only temporary protection of women's reproductive freedom

-- a right that has been seriously eroded by the conservative high court,"

Ireland said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In <i>Stenberg v. Carhart</i>, the Court by 5 to 4 struck down Nebraska's

abortion procedures ban.&nbsp; At issue were the remaining distinctions

between pre- and post-viability standards and the requirement of an exception

in post-viability bans to preserve the woman's health.&nbsp; The justices

ruled that the law created "an undue burden upon a woman's right to make

an abortion decision.''

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its 6 to 3 decision in <i>Hill v. Colorado</i>, the Court ruled constitutional

a Colorado law which restricts aggressive, threateningly close approaches

by demonstrators near the entrance of health care facilities.&nbsp; Prior

to enactment of the statute, protesters blockaded clinics, physically assaulted

women trying to enter the clinics, and subjected patients to intimidating

behavior by surrounding, crowding, grabbing, pushing, shoving, hitting,

and spitting on those seeking access to clinics.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These decisions are only a reprieve.&nbsp; The real fate of legal abortion

will be in the hands of the next president, who will appoint as many as

three justices to the narrowly divided high court," Ireland said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ireland warned that the upcoming elections ultimately will determine

the outcome of the abortion debate.&nbsp; Cautioning that abortion rights

also are threatened in state legislatures and in Congress, Ireland calls

on abortion rights supporters to get out and work for feminist candidates.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Let these narrow decisions serve as a wake-up call to women who are

toying with the idea of voting for anti-abortion presidential candidate

George W. Bush in November.&nbsp; A vote for Bush is a vote against safe,

legal abortion," Ireland said.</font>
