- May 18 - In reviewing the Child Support Distribution Act of 2000, H.R.4469,

the National Organization for Women finds that very few improvements have

been made for child support enforcement efforts, while many more problems

are created – especially for women and their children, the supposed beneficiaries

of this bill.&nbsp; In fact, families will get LESS money under a privatized

system where unregulated private collection companies keep 30 to 40% of

the funds secured from parents owing support payments.&nbsp; As we have

seen from experiences in various states where private collection companies

operate in child support payment collection, some families get nothing

back – even after paying hefty fees for those services!&nbsp; H.R. 4469

will subject vulnerable families to potentially unscrupulous collection

companies.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More importantly, in many cases, the safety and well-being of families

will be risked by likely breaches of privacy.&nbsp; The critical need to

closely guard private information for custodial parents cannot be overstated;

numerous studies have carefully documented the extent of domestic violence

experienced by women receiving public assistance and in the welfare-to-work

process. Nearly one in three reports that this has been a serious problem.&nbsp;

Many single mothers attempting to establish self-sufficiency cannot withstand

the consequences of having their battering ex-partner know of their whereabouts.&nbsp;

At the same time, non-custodial parents owing child support could be hurt

by these unregulated private collectors who would have access to IRS status,

passport availability, banking and credit records.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to questionable changes to the child support collection

system proposed in H.R. 4469, there is also a seriously flawed fatherhood

grant program hidden among its various provisions. NOW spoke out last year

against almost identical legislation, the Fathers Count Act, that would

provide funding to so-called fathers' rights groups to promote their political

agenda.&nbsp; Despite some promised minor improvements in the language

encouraging grantees' communication with local domestic violence networks

or shelters, there is little else in the proposal to recommend it. Similar

programs, which were intended to aid poor fathers in finding jobs, paying

child support and developing stronger relationships with their children

were shown to have minimal impact.&nbsp; The Parents Fair Share Demonstration

Projects were conducted in a half dozen cities during the 1990s.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That poor, non-custodial fathers with few employable skills are in serious

need of help is undeniable. The same is true of poor, custodial mothers.

Such a major national initiative should be carefully crafted, based on

the knowledge gained from similar efforts.&nbsp; A serious commitment of

government funds to aid poverty-stricken, under- and unemployed non-custodial

parents who want to support their children would be welcome. The proposal

incorporated in H.R.4469 is not the answer.</font>
