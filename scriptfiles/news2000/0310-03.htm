taken to improve the procedures for an unprecedented global election

expected to take place later this year to select board members for one of

the Internet's central management organizations.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Common Cause, the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), and the Carter

Center expressed their appreciation for the actions taken to improve the

elections to be held by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and

Numbers (ICANN), the group tasked with managing certain crucial Internet

domain name and numbering functions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Friday Morning the ICANN Board of Directors voted to change its current

election rules and allow members of ICANN to directly elect new At-Large

board members in an election to be held online later this year. Direct

elections were a key recommendation in a report on ICANN's elections issued

earlier this week by Common Cause and CDT.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Common Cause and CDT presented a set of concerns and recommendations to the

ICANN community at its public meeting on March 9.  The recommendations were

developed through a three month investigation of the At Large election

process, which included consultations with participants in the ICANN

process and elections experts.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Scott Harshbarger, President of Common Cause, said, "By deciding to allow

ICANN's members to directly elect new At-Large board members, the stage is

set for ICANN to pioneer the procedures for holding open and democratic elections on an

international basis in the new on-line world of the future. We applaud

ICANN's decision to move in this direction."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the Center for Democracy and

Technology, said, "ICANN is charting a democratic course. Direct elections

give voters a real voice in ICANN's decision making. Today the ICANN Board

listened to the serious concerns raised by the ICANN community, and adopted

principles that will improve the fairness of its elections. This is a

defining moment for ICANN, and CDT was pleased to be part of the process."

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We were very pleased to be able to participate in the upcoming global

on-line election. Hopefully, we added some useful insights learned from our

own international election experiences throughout the world in more than 30

countries," said Charles Costello, a senior staff member at the Carter

Center in Atlanta, Georgia.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We congratulate the ICANN board for taking steps today to improve public

participation in ICANN in the manner suggested by the CDT/Common Cause

report," said Andrew Shapiro, senior advisor to the Markle Foundation. "We

are confidant that ICANN will succeed in incorporating many of the report's

recommendations into an improved at-large membership and election process."
