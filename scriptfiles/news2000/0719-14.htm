- July 19 - With help from Headwaters heroes, Sierra Club and Environmental

Protection Information Center today took the unprecedented step of posting a

substantial bond to maintain a preliminary injunction against logging adjacent

to the Headwaters Reserve.  The large bond was required by Judge Quentin Kopp as

a condition for keeping the injunction in place until trial.  "If we continue to

be called upon to post large bonds, we will face a huge obstacle to citizen

enforcement of public interest environmental laws," said Alex Levinson, Sierra

Club Legal Director.

EPIC and Sierra Club had challenged the approval of a 705-acre logging plan

adjacent to, and surrounded by, the newly created Headwaters Reserve in northern

California.  When Judge Kopp issued the preliminary injunction July 10, he noted

that the California Department of Forestry had violated the law in prohibiting

public comment on major changes to the logging plan. The plan would have

severely impacted one of California's last healthy coho salmon streams.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Kopp ruled that "A believer in orchestration might reasonably conclude CDF's

actions were intentionally executed to prevent public exposure or comment" and

that issuing the injunction was in the public interest.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Plaintiffs were stunned by the requirement to post $250,000 to maintain the

injunction.  "Requiring significant bonds flies in the face of the intent of

these laws, that citizens be able to enforce laws when the government is

actively engaged in violating them," said EPIC's Paul Mason. "EPIC and the

Sierra Club never would have been able to bring the dozens of successful cases

in the public interest if we regularly had to post such bonds."

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It took a Herculean fundraising effort, the high profile of Headwaters Forest,

and the extreme generosity of people like Don Henley, Bonnie Raitt and James

Garner for us to raise this bond in such a short period of time," said Kathy

Bailey of the Sierra Club.  Rock musician and environmentalist Henley donated

all of the proceeds from his Tuesday concert in Berkeley to help raise more than

half of the $250,000 for the bond.  "This extreme generosity in the name of

justice and protection of the forests is truly inspiring," said Bailey.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A bonding requirement is a polluter's wildest dream," said Mason.  "It bars the

courthouse doors to public-interest litigants by requiring them to be wealthy as

well as right."
