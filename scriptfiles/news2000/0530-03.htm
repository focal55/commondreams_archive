- May 30 - The League of Conservation Voters today

endorsed Vice President Al Gore in his bid for the

presidency.  Highlighting Gore's leadership,

commitment and record on environmental issues, and

expressing strong concerns about his opponent, Texas

Governor George W. Bush, LCV called Gore "the only

choice" for environmentally concerned voters.  LCV

handed the Gore 2000 campaign its first national

environmental endorsement.<br>

<br>

 

"When Al Gore wins, the planet wins," said LCV

president Deb Callahan.  "The 2000 election represents

a significant crossroads for our environment.  By

choosing Al Gore, we guarantee thoughtful and

continued progress in addressing the nation's and the

world's most pressing environmental problems.  In

contrast, a George W. Bush presidency would threaten

the progress we've made in cleaning up our nation's

air and water and would enable polluters to profit at

the public's expense.  The stakes have never been

higher for the environment and Al Gore is the only

choice for a cleaner, healthier future."<br>

<br>

   

 

As vice president, Gore has been lauded as the

strongest and most knowledgeable environmental

advocate to reach the White House.  He has helped to

shape the Clinton Administration's environmental

policies and appointments, fought against

Congressional efforts to rollback environmental

protections and promoted updated clean air and clean

water standards to protect the public's health.  "If

we want a president committed to the people, not the

polluters, Al Gore is the only choice," said Callahan.<br>

<br>

 



"I've been working hard to protect the environment for

nearly a quarter-century," Vice President Gore said. 

"I look forward now to winning this election,

side-by-side with the League of Conservation Voters."<br>

<br>



Callahan said that no other single issue more clearly

distinguishes the differences between Gore and Bush. 

"For decades, Gore has proven his environmental

leadership, commitment and vision - he understands

what is at stake for the environment and is willing to

fight against the powerful special interests to

strengthen the laws that make our air safer to breathe

and our water cleaner to drink."<br>

<br>

  

 

"However, Gov. Bush's voluntary approach to

environmental protection would dramatically weaken our

nation's body of environmental and public health

regulations, and his record on adding and supporting

public lands in Texas is dismal," continued Callahan.

"Bush is a polluter's closest ally.  He has taken

millions in campaign contributions from polluters and

the timber industry and has appointed industry

representatives to run Texas' environmental agency. 

Bush's approach to conservation has more in common

with James Watt than Teddy Roosevelt."<br>

<br>

 

Joining in the endorsement event were the executive

directors of two state LCVs, John Rainwater of the

California LCV, and Marcia Bystryn of the New York

LCV, who both represent states that will be key to the

outcome of the presidential election.  Rainwater

delivered his organization's endorsement for the Vice

President, and Bystryn reiterated the New York group's

early primary endorsement.  In addition, the Tennessee

LCV board of directors voted Monday to endorse Gore.<br>

<br>

 

"None of our children should have to worry whether the

water they drink is pure or the air they breathe is

clean," Vice President Gore said.  "And all of us

should work for strong, sustainable growth that

safeguards the fabric of life, and does not disrupt

the climate of the world." <br>

<br>



The League of Conservation Voters is the political

voice for the national environmental and conservation

community.   LCV works to elect pro-environment

candidates to federal office, and is the only group

dedicated full-time to holding federal officials

accountable on the environment.  Since 1970, LCV has

produced the National Environmental Scorecard that

annually rates U.S. Representatives and Senators on

key environmental votes.
