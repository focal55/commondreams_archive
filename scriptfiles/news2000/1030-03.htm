- October 30 - The mass media in the United States is extremely concentrated, and the

messages that they send are broadly uniform. Six global corporations

control more than half of all mass media in our country: newspapers,

magazines, books, radio and television.



<p>These Big Six are AOL Time Warner (the largest media firm in the world),

Disney (which absorbed ABC/Cap Cities), Viacom (which includes the

former Westinghouse and CBS), Bertelsmann (the German firm that controls

10 percent of all adult trade books in the world), General Electric

(which owns NBC and all of its subsidiary media outlets), and Rupert

Murdoch's News Corp (the Australian-based firm that controls a large

American media empire that includes the Fox radio and television

stations and network).



<p>The Big Six are large companies (all in the international Fortune 500)

and they have vested interests that are largely shared with each other,

and with other large corporate interests, including: trade agreements

that favor corporate interests over workers, consumers and the

environment; undercutting the civil justice system that protects the

rights of injured persons; maintaining our current cash-driven electoral

system; and many others.



<p>Our democracy is being swamped by the confluence of money, politics and

concentrated media. Political advertising has become an important source

of revenue, especially for TV stations. Broadcasters are eager to keep

this money coming in, and they have consistently opposed campaign

finance reform.



<p>The media also has the ability to define who is a "serious" candidate in

most races. They use this power to their advantage: buying advertising

has become the single most important criterion for being defined as a

serious candidate. A good example of this is Ross Perot in 1992. As soon

as he announced his plans for massive campaign spending he was

immediately treated as a serious candidate, and given free media

exposure that most third-party candidates can only dream about, despite

the fact that at the time he had no political party and relatively few

Americans knew anything about him.



<p>The media is very effective at leveraging its financial power, and its

control over news, into political influence. The government has allowed

concentration in media that would have been unlawful a decade

ago–concentration that seriously erodes our national commitment to a

"free press." A striking example of the mass media's political influence

was the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which turned over the broadcast

rights to the digital spectrum–worth $70 billion–to television

broadcasters for free, with little debate and virtually no television

coverage.



<p>A study of network nightly news coverage from Labor Day through

mid-October found that the networks had 211 stories featuring Gore; 214

stories featuring Bush; and only 4 stories featuring my candidacy. That

is less than 1% of the stories, despite the fact that my national poll

numbers have been between 4 and 8%, and a majority of Americans

expressed their desire to have me on the debates, indicating that they

would be interested in learning more about my candidacy.



<p>Since that time, mass media interest in my candidacy has increased

substantially, but only because the Democratic party has chosen to

directly call me a spoiler. Almost all of the questions, and almost all

of the coverage, is on the "horse-race" aspect of the elections– who is

winning where; how will this or that tactic help this or that candidate.

There is very little about agenda. Last Wednesday I gave a press

conference that drew fifteen television cameras, many radio outlets and

dozens of print reporters. I talked about the environment –Al Gore had

challenged me to compare my environmental record with his, and I wanted

to take up his challenge–and I talked about economic issues, the tens of

millions of low- and moderate-income Americans who have been largely

left behind by this long boom, and are extremely vulnerable to the next

downturn. These are substantive, newsworthy issues. But the questions I

was asked were mostly about whether I was a "spoiler", and the horse

race. Almost nobody showed interest in the substance of the issues I

raised.



<p>This interest in tactics, polls, ad buys and other fluff rather than

substantive issues is by no means confined to my campaign. According to

the Center for Media and Public Affairs, “candidates political views and

records [were] featured” in only 41% of network evening news stories

about the Presidential campaign. Campaigns in the United States are

decreasingly about issues, at least as seen through the lens of the mass

media.



<p>As the world hurtles willy-nilly toward corporate globalization, other

countries should be wary of allowing over-concentration of media. Media

concentration is a cornerstone of the commercialization of culture and

the erosion of civic democracy.



<p>We in the United States must try to reclaim our democracy from the

accelerating grip of big-money politics and concentrated corporate

media. The keys to doing this will be real campaign finance reform,

which means public financing of public elections; vigorous antitrust

regulation and enforcement; ending broadcasters' free use of the public

airwaves; and the reversion of time on our publicly owned airwaves to

establish audience-controlled radio and TV networks to ensure the

diversity of voices necessary for a really free press and a true civic

democracy.
