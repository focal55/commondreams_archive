- February 17 - The Sierra Club today called on Representative Thomas

     Bliley (R-VA) to stop his shut-down of vital information from the U.S.

     Environmental Protection Agency.  By knocking the EPA's website --

     www.epa.gov -- off-line, Bliley is keeping Americans from learning

     about the environmental dangers they face.

</font>

     <p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Congressman Bliley's attack on information doesn't change the fact

     that every American has the right to know when dangerous chemicals are

     being released in their own neighborhoods.  Congressman Bliley should

     stop trying to keep Americans in the dark about local environmental

     and health threats," said Kathryn Hohmann, Director of Sierra Club's

     Environmental Quality Program.

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     This isn't the first time that Bliley has attempted to intimidate the

     EPA and prevent public disclosure.  Last year, Bliley tied up

     important provisions that would have given Americans information about

     the potential for chemical disasters facing their regions.

</font>

     <p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Last year, Congressman Bliley's scare tactic was telling the public

     that terrorists could obtain information about what chemicals are

     being stored at industrial facilities.  Now, Congressman Bliley is

     using hackers as an excuse, but his goal is the same: locking us all

     out of information about pollution that affects our communities and

     families," Hohmann continued.

</font>

     <p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By shutting down the web site at the EPA, Rep. Bliley is keeping the

     public from learning about pollution prevention programs, clean water

     partnerships, law enforcement efforts and more.  Rep. Bliley's action

     shuts the public out of knowing the amount of toxic chemicals a

     company releases into a community and pollution levels in lakes and

     streams," she added.</font>
