- October 17 - Ralph Nader today filed suit in the

United States District Court in Massachusetts against the Commission on

Presidential Debates for unlawfu1ly preventing him from accessing a

viewing room during the first presidential debate at the University of

Massachusetts in Boston Oct. 3. Nader announced the lawsuit from St.

Louis, hours before the third and final presidential debate was set to

get underway without his participation.



<p>The suit charges that the Commission on Presidential Debates, by using

state police power to exclude Nader from entering a separate viewing

auditorium at UMass for which he had a transferable ticket of

admittance, and by preventing him from appearing at a pre-scheduled

interview with Fox News at the debate site, violated federal law and the

Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.



<p>Defendants named in the suit are the Commission on Presidential Debates;

co-chairmen Paul G. Kirk, Jr. and Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr.; security

consultant John Vezeris, who barred Nader’s entrance to the campus on

behalf of the Commission; and three state police officers present on the

scene. The defendants used threats, intimidation and coercion to prevent

Nader from entering the campus, which is a violation of the

Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. The actions were also in violation of

the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of free association, freedom of

speech, and equal protection under the law.



<p>“Mr. Nader was treated differently from all others in violation of his

right to free association and equal protection under the law merely

because of his political position, his affiliation with the Green Party,

his criticism of the Commission and of the Democratic and Republican

parties, their candidates and their corporate sponsorships, and because

of his public positions that are contrary to the two party message being

conveyed by the Commission and its agents,” the lawsuit states.



<p>The suit arose from an event that took place during the first of three

televised presidential debates staged by the bi-partisan,

corporate-funded debate commission. For the Oct. 3 debate at UMass,

Nader had a ticket to access a viewing room separate from the debate

auditorium. Nader planned to view the debate and then appear as an

invited guest on the Fox News Channel to comment on the debate in a live

broadcast at the site.



<p>When Nader arrived at the campus, he was stopped by Vezeris and three

state troopers. Vezeris stated repeatedly that he was “instructed by the

Commission” to advise Nader that “it’s already been decided that,

whether or not you have a ticket, you are not invited.”



<p>Nader was threatened with arrest if he remained on the premises. When

Nader tried to go to the Fox News facility at the campus for the

pre-scheduled television appearance, he was stopped a second time by the

police officers and again threatened with arrest.



<p>“As a result of this incident, Mr. Nader was … unable to present his

views as the Green Party candidate to television and other media viewers

immediately after the debate when viewership was at its height, and he

was prevented from presenting his views to the 1,700 journalists from

around the world who were at the debate site,” the lawsuit states.



<p>Nader announced the lawsuit at a press conference today in St. Louis,

after which he planned to address the “O17” demonstrators – a broad

range of groups protesting the Anheuser-Busch-sponsored, St. Louis

debate, which is the last in a series of scripted presidential debates

that have allowed George W. Bush and Al Gore to ignore many issues and

abuses of power that are of deep concern to the American people.



<p>“The high-handed tactics used by the Commission on Presidential Debates

signal the downfall of this private company that is undermining

democracy at the direction of the Democrats, Republicans and their

corporate sponsors,” Nader said. “Polls show that the majority of

Americans want to see a four-way presidential debate, yet I have been

excluded by two parties that are intent upon silencing political

competition. By denying me entrance to the viewing room and preventing

me from appearing in a televised interview with Fox News, the Commission

has committed an indefensible act of arrogant power.”



<p>Nader said he will help establish, both directly and by encouraging

other media, labor and civic sponsors, an independent people’s debate

commission controlled by citizens who will organize presidential

debates, in the interest of voter education -- rather than in the

interest of preserving the two-party duopoly.



<p>Nader is represented in the lawsuit by the law offices of Howard

Friedman; and Adkins, Kelston & Zavez, P.C.



<p>Nader is also a plaintiff in a suit against the Federal Election

Commission challenging the legality of the agency’s regulations

permitting the corporate funding of the Commission on Presidential

Debates. That lawsuit was heard on expedited appeal by the First Circuit

Court of Appeals in Boston on Oct. 5.
