- July 1 - The August 1 Direct Action Coalition is organizing Seattle-style protests against police brutality, the death penalty, and what they call "the criminal injustice system." "We're going to bring the spirit of Seattle to the Republican Convention in Philadelphia" said Zosera Imaana, a member of a coalition of groups calling for "non-violent direct action" to disrupt the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia this summer. They hope their protest will focus attention on issues that George W. Bush would probably rather not see emphasized at the Convention. Anti-death penalty protesters have been showing up at many Bush campaign functions. Bush recently endorsed the controversial execution of Gary Graham. Texas is expected to execute approximately one prisoner a week until the November elections.



<p>The coalition brings together two currents of protest that have been on the rise over the past year. The Direct Action Network and United Students Against Sweatshops, both prominent organizers of the recent demonstrations against the World Trade Organization in Seattle, and against the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank in Washington DC, are joining with groups that protested the recent execution of Gary Graham in Texas, and the acquittal of four New York City police officers in the shooting death of African immigrant Amadou Diallo. The coalition includes the Free Mumia Abu-Jamal Coalition, the group that called for and helped coordinate large civil disobedience actions in Philadelphia, Washington DC and San Francisco during which 469 people were arrested. 



<p>The protesters are also demanding the release of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a journalist on death row for the shooting death of a Philadelphia police officer. Jamal's supporters insist he never received a fair trial. Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Ridge, who is hosting the convention, signed a death warrant for Jamal last fall. Jamal received a stay from a federal court.



<p>"We understand the link between political repression and the economic policies pushed by big corporations when it happens in Guatemala or Indonesia" said Zosera Imaana.  "The same thing is true in the United States. Police brutality, the death penalty and the incarceration of so many young Blacks and Latinos are part of a process of domestic structural adjustment." Structural adjustment is the term used by the IMF for the policies of privatization and cuts in social spending foreign countries must carry out to receive IMF loans.



<p>The protesters aren't telling their exact plans, but they promise to thwart Philadelphia's plans for a smooth convention. "If Bush and Ridge think they call hold their 'Executioners Ball' without hearing from us, they are in for a surprise" said Ms. Imaana. "We are prepared to go to jail  to make sure we are heard."
