To Withhold 'Plan Colombia' Funds<br>

- July 18 - Senator Paul Wellstone called on fellow senators today to

urge President Clinton to withhold all funding for the 'Plan Colombia'

counter-narcotics operation on human rights' grounds.  In a letter sent to

colleagues urging them to join him in insisting that Clinton withhold the funds,

Wellstone expressed his grave reservations regarding 'Plan Colombia'.



<p>During the debate in Congress about the $1.3 billion dollar assistance package

to Colombia, the Administration and the Colombian government pledged to reduce

the production and supply of drugs while protecting the human rights of

Colombian citizens. To ensure such protection, Congress conditioned U.S.

assistance to Colombia on certification by the Secretary of State that Colombia

is taking concrete steps to improve the human rights record of its Armed Forces.

Review for this certification is now underway. 



<p>"We are concerned with the Administration's ability to effectively manage the

use of the resources that will be provided under the plan while protecting the

human rights of Colombian citizens. At this time the United States cannot

legitimately certify Colombia prior to the initial obligation of U.S. assistance

and we therefore urge you not to make the certification," Wellstone wrote.



<p>"It is our belief that several conditions required for certification have not

been met. At present, the President of Colombia has issued no directive

requiring that Colombian armed forces personnel accused of human right

violations will be held accountable in civilian courts, nor has the Colombian

military taken the firm, clear steps necessary to purge human rights abusers

from its ranks or ensure that its personnel are not linked to paramilitary

organizations. According to credible reports, paramilitary groups account for

most of the political violence in Colombia today. Paramilitary groups are known

to operate with the acquiescence or open support of the military, and in fact,

more than half of Colombia's eighteen brigade-level army units have been linked

to paramilitary activity," Wellstone wrote.



<p>In June, Wellstone  blasted the Clinton Administration's "Push into Southern

Colombia" military plan during Senate debate, and offered an amendment to the

Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill that sought to transfer $225 million from

aid earmarked for the Colombian military into U.S. domestic drug treatment

programs.  The Wellstone amendment failed following an intensive lobbying effort

against it by the Administration.



<p>"We believe your Administration cannot and should not certify Colombia to

receive assistance under Plan Colombia. Colombia faces extraordinary challenges

and we should respond to President Pastrana's call for help to combat illicit

drug production and trafficking. U.S. support for Colombia, however, cannot

include partnership with an army implicated in gross human rights violations,"

wrote Wellstone.
