          - February 17 - Nearly 30% of the nation&#146;s largest industrial, 

          municipal, and federal facilities were in serious violation of the Clean 

          Water Act at least once during a recent 15-month period, according to 

          a report released today by U.S. PIRG. <i>Poisoning Our Water: How the 

          Government Permits Pollution</i> also documents nearly 270 million pounds 

          of toxic pollution released into U.S. waters in 1997.</font>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;While At 

            the same time that 40% of the nation&#146;s waterways are considered 

            too polluted for safe fishing or swimming, our report shows that the 

            government is letting polluters continue to use our waterways as dumping 

            grounds for toxic chemicals,&quot; said Jeremiah Baumann, Environmental 

            Advocate with U.S. PIRG. &quot;Despite the clear intentions of the 

            Clean Water Act to eliminate the pollution of our waters, polluters 

            continue to brazenly violate the law.&quot;</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The U.S. PIRG 

            report documents and analyzes the dangerous levels of pollutants discharged 

            to America&#146;s waters by compiling toxic chemical releases reported 

            to the Toxics Release Inventory for 1997, the most recent data available. 

            U.S. PIRG looked at the behavior of water polluters nationwide by 

            documenting violations of the Clean Water Act between October of 1997 

            and December of 1998, recorded in the U.S. EPA&#146;s Permit Compliance 

            System database, obtained by U.S. PIRG under the Freedom of Information 

            Act (FOIA).</font></p>

              million pounds (269,134,333) of toxic chemicals were released to

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The summary of 

            toxic chemical releases includes more than 600 chemicals identified 

            by EPA as being hazardous to human health or the environment. In particular, 

            the U.S. PIRG report summarizes discharges of cancer-causing chemicals, 

            chemicals that persist in the environment, and chemicals with the 

            potential to cause reproductive problems ranging from birth defects 

            to reduced fertility. Polluters discharged nearly 11 million pounds 

            of these compounds into U.S. waters in 1997.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;With so 

            much pollution going into our waterways, it is outrageous that more 

            than one in four polluting facilities are in violation of the law,&quot; 

            commented Richard Caplan of U.S. PIRG.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;By looking 

            at known sources of toxic pollution and known violators of our clean 

            water laws, this report demonstrates common-sense steps that should 

            be taken to address our water quality problems,&quot; added Caplan. 

            &quot;We need clean water now, and we have to start by requiring polluters 

            to obey the law.&quot;</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to increase 

            compliance with permits and move toward the zero-discharge goals of 

            the Clean Water Act, U.S. PIRG recommends the following:</font></p>

          <ol>

            <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mandatory minimum 

              penalties should be set for facilities that violate their permits; 

              the amount of the penalty should be set to prevent polluters from 

              profiting by breaking the law.</font> 

            <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Obstacles to 

              citizen suits should be removed, including allowing citizens to 

              sue Federal facilities.</font> 

            <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congress should 

              pass H.R. 1657, which would expand the Toxics Release Inventory 

              to require all polluting facilities to report their pollution, and 

              to include information on the use of toxic chemicals rather than 

              on solely &#145;end-of-the-pipe&#146; releases.</font> 

          </ol>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We urge 

            Congress and the President to listen to the public&#146;s demands 

            for clean water. They should expand the public&#146;s right to know 

            about toxic chemical use and pollution, and ensure strict enforcement 

            of the law,&quot; said concluded U.S. PIRG&#146;s Baumann.</font></p>
