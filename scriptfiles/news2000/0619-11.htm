- June 19 - Today 

        an unprecedented coalition of Democrats and Republicans, community activists 

        and political leaders, comedians and celebrities announced a powerful 

        alternative to the major party conventions, focusing on the issues that 

        the parties just won't touch. The alternative - Shadow Conventions 2000: 

        A Citizens' Intervention in American Politics - will parallel this summer's 

        Republican and Democratic National Conventions, which will be scripted, 

        crafted and controlled forums that relegate issue debate into obscurity. 

        </font>

<p></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The parties' addiction to massive doses of campaign cash 

        has distorted our policy priorities and led to the neglect of critical 

        issues," said syndicated columnist Arianna Huffington, one of the conveners 

        of the <a href="http://www.shadowconventions.com">Shadow Conventions 2000</a>. "The Shadow Conventions are a citizens' 

        intervention to give voice to millions of Americans currently shut out 

        of the national debate."</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Held in Philadelphia and Los Angeles parallel to the party 

        conventions, the Shadow Conventions will focus on three issues ‹ campaign 

        finance reform, poverty and the wealth gap, and the failed war on drugs 

        ‹ that are being ignored at both party¹s events, and will bring together 

        some of the nation¹s leading thinkers on these issues.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Shadow Conventions are being convened by Jim Wallis 

        of Call to Renewal, Scott Harshbarger of Common Cause, Ethan Nadelmann 

        of The Lindesmith Center, Deepak Bhargava of National Campaign for Jobs 

        and Income Support, Ellen Miller of Public Campaign, Chuck Collins of 

        United for a Fair Economy, and Ms. Huffington who will all speak at the 

        conventions. They will be joined by a broad range of activists, political 

        leaders and celebrities, including:</font></p>

<ul>

        

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Russ Feingold (D-WI) and Paul Wellstone 

          (D-MN); </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Governor Gary Johnson (R-NM); </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Representatives Tony Hall (D-OH), Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-IL), Dennis 

          Kucinich (D-OH), John Lewis (D-GA), and Jerrold Nadler (D-NY);</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Warren Beatty, Geoff Canada, John DiIulio, Al Franken, Jesse Jackson, 

          Jonathan Kozol, Paul Krassner, Lewis Lapham, Skip Long, Bill Maher, 

          Mary Nelson, Eugene Rivers, Harry Shearer, Ron Silver, and Diana Jones 

          Wilson.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Shadow Conventions will take place from July 30 through August 4 

        in Philadelphia, during the Republican party convention, and from August 

        13 through August 17 in Los Angeles, during the Democratic party convention. 

        Debates and forums will be staged on each morning, preceding the party 

        convention sessions in the afternoons and evenings. All Shadow Convention 

        events will be free and open to the public. </font></p>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shadow Convention proceedings on poverty and the wealth gap are being 

          organized by Call to Renewal, the National Campaign for Jobs and Income 

          Support, and United for a Fair Economy. These groups are dedicated to 

          ending the persistence of poverty during an unprecedented wave of prosperity. 

          Despite the booming economy, one out of five of America¹s children remain 

          poor.<br>

          <br>

          "In an economy with record breaking prosperity, it's past time to put 

          poor people on the political agenda," said Jim Wallis, the Convener 

          of Call to Renewal. "The rising tide is lifting the yachts, but not 

          all the boats."<br>

          <br>

        </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shadow Convention proceedings on campaign finance reform are being 

          organized by Common Cause and Public Campaign. These groups are working 

          to create a level playing field in political campaigns by reducing the 

          role of special interest money and the influence of big contributors. 

          The Democrats and Republicans are expected to launder more than a half 

          a billion dollars in unregulated and unlimited "soft money" contributions 

          from corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals in campaign 2000.<br>

          <br>

          "The political parties have eroded their once-noble traditions and have 

          transformed themselves into something almost unrecognizable ‹ giant 

          mail drops for special-interest money," said Scott Harshbarger, President 

          of Common Cause. <br>

          <br>

        </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shadow Convention proceedings on the failed drug war are being organized 

          by the Lindesmith Center, a drug policy institute which educates Americans 

          on alternatives to our nation¹s current failed drug policies. Almost 

          half a million people are now incarcerated in the United States on drug 

          charges, almost ten times as many as in 1980, and greater than the total 

          number of people incarcerated in Europe for everything.<br>

          <br>

          "Drug policy reform is rapidly emerging as a new movement for political 

          and social justice in the United States -- one that calls for drug policies 

          based upon common sense, science, public health and human rights," said 

          Ethan Nadelmann, Director of the Lindesmith Center. </font></li>
