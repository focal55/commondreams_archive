<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DAVOS, SWITZERLAND 

- January 28 - Non-governmental groups present in Davos to monitor the World Economic

Forum today challenged the United Nations and  business leaders to endorse

a "Citizens Compact" on the relationship of the private sector to the

United Nations.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The World Economic Forum in Davos represents the same kind of

unaccountable corporate power against which citizens protested in Seattle,"

said Olivier Hoedeman, Director of Corporate Europe Observatory in

Amsterdam. "Today as the WEF holds its closed sessions, we are asking Kofi

Annan and the UN system to join us in taking the first step toward

correcting that imbalance."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Citizens Compact comes exactly one year after UN General Secretary Kofi

Annan challenged business leaders to embrace his "Global Compact" with the

UN. This year, the UN is launching a website regarding the new corporate

"partnerships" with business. UN High Commissioner Mary Robinson will

address the WEF regarding business and human rights and progress in the

Global Compact. Since last year, non-governmental groups have protested the

UN's implementation of these new partnerships, for example the UN

Development Programme's proposed Global  Sustainable Development Facility

(GSDF). NGO concern has helped stall the GSDF. Various UN agencies also

have relationships with  McDonald's, Disney, Chevron, BP Amoco, and the

International Chamber of Commerce.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The growing public opposition to the model of globalisation promoted by

the WTO and the WEF points to the potential of the UN as a more democratic

institution that can defend human and environmental rights" said Kenny

Bruno, Research Associate with Transnational Resource & Action Center

(TRAC). "The UN is our best hope to monitor and hold accountable the giant

companies that control so much of our economies and our lives." The

Citizens Compact stresses the need for the UN to develop a legal framework,

including monitoring, to govern corporate behavior around the world.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Citizens Compact is endorsed  by more than 70 organizations on six

continents.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Olivier Hoedeman will comment on the 'Citizens Compact' at a media briefing

organised by the NGO forum "Public Eye on Davos", Saturday 29/1 at 18.00.

Venue: Dutch Astma Clinic, Scalettastrasse 19, Davos (next to the Congress

Centre).



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background information on the 'Citizens Compact' is available on the

websites of <a href="http://www.corpwatch.org/">Corporate Watch</a> and <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Eceo">Corporate Europe

Observatory</a> .
