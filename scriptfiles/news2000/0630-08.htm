<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Reporter,

</font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The Sierra Club has called upon President Clinton to veto the Military

     Construction appropriations bill because it contains two

     anti-environmental riders.  One would prevent the EPA from completing

     new rules to curb polluted runoff, which is the principal reason why

     40% of the nation's waters are unfit for swimming, fishing and aquatic

     habitat.  The other is a fiscally irresponsible rider that would

     exempt the environmentally damaging Wilson Bridge project from

     requirements that construction begin only after all funding has been

     appropriated or committed.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The Sierra Club is disturbed that some members of Congress are using

     must-pass legislation to sneak in irresponsible and anti-environmental

     riders.

     President William Clinton

     The White House

     1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Dear President Clinton:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     On behalf of the Sierra Club's more than 600,000 members, I greatly

     appreciate the strong position that you have historically taken in

     insisting that must-pass appropriations bills be free of

     anti-environmental riders.  I urge you to uphold this important

     principle and veto the Military Construction appropriations bill when

     it reaches your desk.  It contains two outrageous anti-environmental

     riders that Congress never debated on the merits because they were

     included only in the final conference report.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     One rider, slipped into the conference report late Wednesday night,

     attacks the Clean Water Act by preventing the EPA from completing and

     implementing a proposed EPA rule to implement the Act's Total Daily

     Maximum Load (TMDL) program.  This rule is a long-delayed attempt to

     improve water quality in lakes and rivers not suitable for fishing,

     swimming, aquatic life or drinking water supply.  A strong TMDL rule

     is critical to cleaning up the 40 percent of waters that do not

     support fishing and swimming.  Without an effective TMDL program, EPA

     and the states will not have the tools they need to clean up the most

     significant sources of water pollution, and the nation's progress in

     cleaning up our waters will come to a halt.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Backroom deals resulted in another rider that would exempt the

     proposed replacement of the I-495 Wilson drawbridge (just south of

     Washington, D.C.) from compliance with federal requirements set forth

     in TEA-21 that such federal capital projects begin construction only

     after all funding has been appropriated or otherwise committed.  An

     additional $170 million would be appropriated, in addition to the $900

     million already appropriated for this project termed by a Washington

     Post business columnist as a "highway construction lobby boondoggle."

     For many reasons, not the least of which are its escalating costs, we

     strongly oppose exempting the Wilson Bridge replacement from complying

     with TEA-21.  We also oppose appropriating any additional funds unless

     the replacement is re-designed with rail, not HOV lanes and the

     expensive interchanges HOV lanes would require.  Incorporating rail

     into the design is the only way to fully meet increased transportation

     demand at this busy crossing.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     I recognize that this bill contains funding for many critical

     programs.  Nonetheless, I urge you to veto it and demand that Congress

     immediately enact a Military Construction appropriations bill free of

     anti-environmental riders.
