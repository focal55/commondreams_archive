- October 11 - As oil companies, large-engine manufacturers, and their allies in Congress work to derail the Clinton administration's proposal to clean up diesel trucks and buses, a new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists shows that big rigs pose an immense, disproportionate threat to human health and the environment.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study also offers affordable solutions, including a design for a cleaner truck and market incentives to spur development of a new generation of trucks and buses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Trucks and buses are monster polluters," said Jason Mark, Transportation Program director at UCS and lead author of "Rolling Smokestacks: Cleaning Up America's Trucks and Buses."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"From school buses in our neighborhoods to eighteen-wheelers on the highway, diesel rigs are a serious cancer and clean air threat."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although trucks account for under 6 percent of the miles driven by highway vehicles in the United States, they are responsible for one-quarter of the smog-producing pollution from highway vehicles, over half the soot from highway traffic, the majority of the cancer threat posed by air pollution in some urban areas, 6 percent of the nation's global warming pollution, and over one-tenth of America's oil consumption.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The UCS report lays out a design for a cleaner big rig, one that slashes air pollution tenfold while doubling efficiency. The report also maps the way to eliminating diesel from urban areas where the added health protection offered by alternative fuels and advanced technologies is a necessity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UCS's engineers estimate that implementing a national green truck strategy would offer the following gains over "business-as-usual" efforts by 2030: prevent one-quarter of a million tons of toxic soot emissions, eliminate over 60 million cars-worth of smog-producing exhaust, allow truck travel to double without increasing oil demand, and reduce global warming pollution by 26 percent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Environmental Protection Agency's recently proposed diesel engine regulations require that emissions from new trucks show a 95 percent reduction in smog-producing nitrogen oxides over current levels and a 90 percent reduction of soot. The rule would also require oil companies to remove 97 percent of the sulfur in diesel fuel. A final decision is expected before the end of the year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The stakes are high for our health and air," said Michelle Robinson, UCS senior advocate. "The administration must stand tall against the oil and engine companies' attempts to undermine the new diesel standards."
