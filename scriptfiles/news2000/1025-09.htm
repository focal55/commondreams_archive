- October 25 - Nader 2000 campaign manager Theresa Amato

said today that the full-page “tactical voting” advertisement running in

newspapers in several states was not generated by the campaign.



<p>The ad urging people to vote for Nader was designed and paid for

independently from the campaign by Greg MacArthur, a progressive New

York philanthropist. The ads are running in states where either Bush or

Gore has a solid lead.



<p>“We are urging voters in every state to cast their votes for Ralph Nader

and Winona LaDuke, and for a progressive third party that will be a

watchdog over the two corporate parties after November,” Amato said. “In

this election, the only wasted vote is the one cast without conviction

and for cash-register politics as usual.”



<p>“Our intent in this campaign is to garner the maximum number of votes

for Ralph Nader. This is a national 50-state campaign and we will

continue to run it in every state for every vote.”



<p>Amato said she is available for interviews on the subject. Reporters can

call the press office at 202-265-4000.
