- April 20 - News Advisory 



<p>WHAT:<br>

U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, will discuss his recent trip to Iraq 

- the first by a Member of Congress to focus on humanitarian 

conditions - on Monday: <p>



WHEN: <br>

Monday, April 24, 10:30 a.m. <p>



WHERE: <br>

Room 2168, House Rayburn Building <br>

Capitol Hill <p>



Hall was in Iraq April 16-20, and visited hospitals, schools, 

clinics and water-treatment plants in Baghdad, Basra, Babylon, 

Samawah and Nasiriyah. He was accompanied by representatives of the 

Red Crescent, Red Cross, UNICEF, and others and met with other aid 

workers as well as Iraqi officials involved in humanitarian issues. <p>



"I have been concerned about the humanitarian situation in Iraq 

for some time, and particularly troubled that the last two United 

Nations officials charged with running the oil-for-food program 

resigned. There is ample evidence that the suffering of Iraq's 

people -- and especially its children -- is real, and this trip let 

me see the people behind the disturbing statistics," Hall said. 

"However, the question of whether lifting sanctions would solve the 

humanitarian problems is less clear." <p>



Hall first got involved in humanitarian work when he served in the 

Peace Corps 30 years ago. In recent years, he has focused his 

legislative and other efforts on fighting hunger and the other 

problems that affect the poor of the United States and other nations.

<p> 



Text of his statement will be posted at <a href="http://www.house.gov/tonyhall">http://www.house.gov/tonyhall</a> on 

Monday, April 24.
