- May 9 - In ordering a study of the international recommended regulations

for recycling radioactive waste,

the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is further biasing its own standard-setting

process towards the widespread recycling of contaminated materials into household

products, Public Citizen charged today at an NRC meeting concerning the standard-setting

rulemaking process.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ultimate result likely will be a recommendation from the NRC to permit an

international market for extensive recycling of radioactive waste into such products as

braces for teeth, baby strollers and frying pans -- virtually everything made out of

carbon steel, stainless steel, nickel, copper or aluminum, said Wenonah Hauter, director

of <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/">Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy and

Environment Program</a>. Currently, contaminated waste is recycled on a case by case

basis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NRC is in the process of setting a standard for the amount of radiation consumers

can be exposed to from household products made from<b> </b>radioactive waste. The

commission recently directed its staff to ask the National Academy of Science (NAS) Board

on Energy and Environmental Systems to conduct a nine-month study on the recycling of

radioactive materials.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A key component of that study is an analysis of the way other countries are proposing

to recycle the waste. The international recommendations will likely favor recycling the

waste because the International Atomic Energy Agency -- whose mission is to promote the

use of nuclear technology and which is a big booster of recycling radioactive waste into

household products -- is heavily involved in setting recycling standards in other

countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Looking to the International Atomic Energy Agency for recommendations on how to

handle radioactive waste is like asking the fox for tips on guarding the henhouse,&quot;

Hauter said. &quot;The NRC is trying to use this study to mask the fact that its own

process is skewed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NRC is promoting radioactive recycling through its support of international

standards. Different standards &quot;could adversely affect international trade,&quot; the

staff wrote in a document released recently. Even the language the NRC uses in requesting

the NAS study shows the Commission&#146;s bias; it requested &quot;alternatives for the

control of <i><b>slightly</b></i> radioactive materials&quot; (emphasis added).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Decades of research shows that exposure to radiation is a threat to human health. Any

exposure to radiation, no matter how small, results in some health risk. Diluting

radiation through recycling cannot reduce the risk to society as a whole, because the

total number of people exposed to radiation will increase as more products contain

radioactive materials. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Despite widespread public opposition, the nuclear industry is pushing the

government to permit more recycling of contaminated waste from nuclear power plants and

nuclear weapons facilities because it is far less expensive to sell the waste than to

isolate it from humans and the environment. Government agencies charged with protecting

people from exposure to radioactive waste instead appear to be helping the nuclear

industry to find a way to release the material into products that are distributed

nationwide,&quot; Hauter said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NRC staff paper did not deal adequately with several of the problems that have

tainted this rulemaking:</font></p>

<blockquote>

  

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The NRC paid millions of dollars to a contractor with a conflict of interest to

  prepare the technical analysis for the commission on radioactive recycling;</font></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The commission prejudged the outcome of the rulemaking<b> </b>by discussing in

  documents that it was planning to set a standard that would allow the release of

  contaminated materials. The Commission has not demonstrated that it would even consider an

  outcome that does not result in the release of radioactive materials;</font></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The NRC has not addressed why it has failed to consider in its technical documents

  that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is the primary source of metallic radioactive

  waste, the type of waste to be recycled into household products. The DOE&#146;s generates

  a lot more metallic radioactive waste than power plants, and this military waste is

  potentially far more dangerous than similar waste from power plants because it contains

  different radioactive elements. The commission has not considered the implications of the

  release of volumes of such dangerous materials into the environment.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The entire rulemaking process has been sullied,&quot; Hauter said. &quot;It is

shoddy and biased. The integrity of the rulemaking requires affirmative demonstration that

alternatives -- including no release of radioactive waste -- are seriously and fairly

considered. The NRC simply isn&#146;t doing that.&quot;</font>
