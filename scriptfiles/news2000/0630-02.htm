- June 30 - Following is a statement



by Tony Mazzocchi of the Labor Party on the Human Genome Project:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We in the Labor Party applaud the scientific advances being made



through the National Institutes of Health and the National Science



Foundation and other public research programs. After all it was the



taxes of our members and other working people who paid for the U.S.



portion of this research since federal funding for biomedical



research was launched after World War II. It's just too bad that we



don't have federally funded health care so that all our citizens can



receive the benefit of these advances.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the Labor Party is particularly concerned over the use of this



genetic data to misdirect biomedical research and health care. We



know that damage to our genes causes cancer and other nasty



conditions. It's not our genes that make us sick -- our genes keep

us



functioning -- it's damage to our genes that causes the problem.



We in the labor movement see this as an effort to blame the



victim -- we have cancer because we have "oncogenes" rather than



because our genes have been damaged because they have "cancerous



lungs."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The determination of human gene sequences advances our ability to



identify the damage that can be done to our genes from carcinogens



and mutagens, and the need to protect our genes from environmental



and occupational hazards. We know that most human ill health is not



inherited but is due to external insult including pollution,



infection, inadequate or inappropriate diet, physical accident or



excess stress or social disruption such as wars. Preventing damage

to



human genes from carcinogens is a far more effective public health



strategy than allowing the disease to develop and then attempting



expensive and dangerous gene therapy or other heroic measures.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are also disturbed when we see corporations like Celera



applying for and being granted patents on human genes. They didn't



invent our genes and they shouldn't be able to profit by selling our



gene sequences to the highest bidder. Patents on human genes



represent a theft not just from the American people but from people



all over the world.
