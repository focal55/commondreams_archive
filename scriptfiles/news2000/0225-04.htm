- February 25 - News Advisory:

<p>Doris "Granny D" Haddock is now just 20 miles from the

successful completion of her transcontinental walk for campaign



finance reform. She started her walk on January 1, 1999! Over the



past 14 months this amazing woman has walked more than 3,200 miles



through 11 states in an effort to show that Americans care deeply



about the need to reclaim our elections and our democracy from the



special interests that have it in a stranglehold.

<p>A woman of limited means, Haddock has relied on the kindness and

generosity of supporters and strangers alike to sustain her.



Hundreds have opened their homes, restaurants, classrooms and town



meetings to her, providing her with food, shelter, and even medical



attention when necessary. Thousands have come to walk with her and



show their collective outrage with the corruption that is so



commonplace in today's system. She has also participated in



campaign reform events at the invitation of both Bill Bradley and



John McCain.

<p>Haddock is walking the remaining miles on the towpath of the

historic C&amp;O Canal along the Potomac River. She will arrive in



Washington on Tuesday, Feb. 29, when she will walk the final five



miles from Arlington National Cemetery to a rally on the East



Steps of the Capitol at 12:30 p.m.

<p>If you are interested in interviewing Haddock, or you need more

information, contact John Anthony at 202-422-3439, or by E-mail at



janthony11@yahoo.com. Additional information can also



be found at <a href="http://www.grannyd.com">http://www.grannyd.com</a>.
