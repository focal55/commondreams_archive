          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WENONAH HAUTER, 

            <a href="mailto:whauter@citizen.org">whauter@citizen.org</a>, <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep">http://www.citizen.org/cmep</a><br>

            </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the 

            last year, gasoline prices have gone up from about 90 cents a gallon 

            to $1.36, while crude oil has gone from $12 to $30 a barrel. Hauter, 

            director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project, said today: 

            "Throughout the history of the oil industry, it has been plagued with 

            sharp peaks and valleys in oil pricing. The recent rise in oil prices 

            is completely predictable. Most of the time, oil interests are able 

            to collude and keep prices high. But, occasionally, like last year, 

            their cooperative -- some would say non-competitive -- efforts fail 

            and prices plummet. As long as public policy on oil issues is driven 

            by the oil companies' enormous campaign contributions, the recurrent 

            pattern of crisis will continue... It's true that OPEC is cutting 

            production, but many of these countries like Saudi Arabia have a historically 

            close relationship with the U.S., so the question is: why are they 

            cutting production? Other questions are: what does this have to do 

            with the election season and who are the oil companies backing and 

            who would benefit from the economy slowing down?" </font></p>

            An economist at the Commonwealth Institute, Breslow said: "OPEC is 

            exerting a little more control, which is likely to be short term. 

            Oil companies use such opportunities to exploit the situation for 

            short-term profiteering. While rising prices hurt consumers, for environmental 

            reasons the price of oil should be higher. But the money should be 

            recycled to people in an equitable fashion." </font></p>

            A fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, Bennis said: "On Monday, 

            Hans Von Sponeck, the UN's Assistant Secretary-General and humanitarian 

            coordinator in Iraq, announced his resignation after 15 months on 

            the job, because he became convinced that 'every month Iraq's social 

            fabric shows bigger holes.' The next day, the chief of the UN's World 

            Food Program in Baghdad, Jutta Burghardt, quit as well, also to protest 

            how the economic sanctions are eroding Iraqi society. Van Sponeck's 

            predecessor, then-Assistant Secretary-General Denis Halliday, quit 

            the same position after 13 months, also to challenge the economic 

            sanctions responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi... 

            The most recent Security Council resolution, which many in Washington 

            like to claim would lift the sanctions, actually does no such thing. 

            It...considers, more than a year down the line, the possibility that 

            some economic restrictions might be temporarily suspended. But the 

            default position remains that economic sanctions stay... Under such 

            restrictions, no oil company worth its stockholders is likely to risk 

            serious large-scale investment in Iraq, however much they may covet 

            Iraq's oil wealth." </font></p>
