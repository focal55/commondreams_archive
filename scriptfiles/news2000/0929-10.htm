- September 29 - Ralph Nader will storm Boston with a fourth super rally

Sunday, Oct. 1 that is expected to draw thousands of people who will demand

Nader's inclusion in the presidential debates.



<p>The event will distributed LIVE on satellite, Sunday, October 1st, from

13:30 to 17:30 Eastern, on GE3, Transponder T18.



<p>The Boston rally is the next in a series of Nader super rallies that have

drawn the largest crowds of any presidential campaign events this election

year. Last week, more than 12,000 people paid to hear Green Party

presidential candidate Nader and vice presidential candidate Winona LaDuke

speak at a rally in Minneapolis, Minn., and more than 10,000 showed up to

paid events in Seattle, Wash., and Portland, Ore.



<p>Free campaign events with Al Gore and George W. Bush are drawing crowds one

third that size.



<p>The rally will take place just two days before the first presidential debate

sponsored by the bi-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates is scheduled

to take place at U-Mass Boston. The commission has yet to invite Nader to

participate in the debates, despite the fact that he is on the ballot in 44

states and polls show that the majority of Americans want to see him in the

debates. Nader plans to be in Boston on Oct. 3 on the day of the first

debates.



<p>Nader's lawsuit against the corporate financing of the presidential debates

has been granted an expedited hearing on Oct. 5 in the First Circuit Court

of Appeals.



<p>The rally begins at 2 p.m. at the Fleet Center. Doors open at 12:30 p.m. and

tickets are $10 each.



<p>When:			Sunday, October 1st,<br>

			13:30 - 17:30 Eastern



<p>Satellite: 		GE3, Transponder 18
