<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LOS ANGELES  

- May 1 - Identity theft victims spend two years or more removing an average of

$18,000 in fraudulent charges from their credit reports, according to a

new report based on a survey of recent identity theft victims.&nbsp; The

report, by CALPIRG and the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse documents the

various ways that consumers become victims of the fast-growing crime and

makes recommendations for state and federal legislative action. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

“Unless new laws force banks, department stores and credit bureaus to

clean up the identity theft mess, this crime is only going to get worse,”

said Janine Benner, CALPIRG Consumer Associate and report co-author&nbsp;

“This study shows that nightmares you hear on the news are not just

extreme cases&nbsp; and that identity theft can happen to anyone.”</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<b>Key Findings of “Nowhere To Turn: Victims Speak Out On Identity

Theft”:&nbsp; </b></font></p>

<p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<ul>

<li>The average amount of time it

took victims to resolve their cases was nearly 2 years (23 months).

Victims who have not resolved their cases have been dealing with the

problem for an average of 44 months.</li>

<li>The average total fraudulent charges on new

and existing accounts of those surveyed was $18,000.

Victims spent an average of 175 hours and $808 in out-of-pocket costs

(not including lawyer’s fees) trying

to fix their problem. </li>

<li>76% of the respondents who contacted the police found them to be

unhelpful; 60% found credit bureaus, banks and department stores

unhelpful.</li>

<li>45% of the reported cases involved the

victims’ driver’s licenses.</li>

<li>15% of the respondents noted that there was

a criminal investigation or warrant for their arrest due to their

identity theft.</li>

</ul><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

In 1998, Congress enacted legislation criminalizing identity theft.&nbsp;

California has also criminalized identity theft and taken other actions,

including strengthening address change verification requirements to make

it harder for thieves to intercept mail and apply for credit at new

addresses. By making identity theft a specific crime, Congress and the

states have taken an important first step in fighting it.&nbsp; Yet, much

more needs to be done.&nbsp; Industry statistics estimate that between

500,000 and 700,000 people will have their identities stolen this year.

“Clearly, credit industry reform is the key to curbing this crime,” said

Beth Givens, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse director, “Further, easy access

to the bits of information that compromise a consumer’s financial

identity must be curtailed.”</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<b>Among the highlights of the CALPIRG/Privacy Rights Clearinghouse

Identity Theft Platform are the following</b>:

</font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<ul>

<li>Give consumers free credit reports annually

on request as six states already do (CO, GA, MA, MD, NJ, VT). Proposals

by US Senator Dianne Feinstein and U.S. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard

include this provision.</li>

<li>Provide victims, as well as consumers, with

the right to block access to their credit reports. A proposal by State

Senator Debra Bowen would do this.</li>

<li>Improve change of address verification, a common indicator of fraud.

And limit uses of the Social Security number, the key identifier needed

by identity thieves. See Sen. Bowen’s bill.</li>

<li>Streamline law enforcement investigation and victim assistance

procedures. Assemblymember Robert Hertzberg has introduced a bill

establishing pilot programs.</li>

<li>Close the “credit header” loophole that allows Social Security numbers

to be sold on the information marketplace, including over the Internet.

Senator Feinstein’s and other Congressional bills would include this

provision.
