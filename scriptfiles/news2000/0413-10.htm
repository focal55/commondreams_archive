- April 13 - Escalating police harassment of nonviolent World Bank 

protesters, seven individuals were arrested without cause last night.  

The National Lawyers Guild, whose representatives observed the arrests, 

has sent an urgent letter to Attorney General Janet Reno alerting her to 

the "serious violations of the Constitutional rights of political activists".



<p>On Wednesday night, at approximately 7:30pm, two vehicles of people on 

their way home from an organizing meeting were pulled over with no cause. 

 The police searched vehicles without consent and seized construction materials 

being used for nonviolent protest props.



<p>In their letter to Reno, the Lawyers Guild urged the Attorney General to 

"please instruct your officers that the Constitution has not been suspended 

for the duration of the IMF and World Bank meetings."



<p>"Despite assurances to the contrary, we are beginning to see an escalation 

of police tactics similar to the gross violations witnessed in Seattle," 

said Denis Moynihan of the Mobilization for Global Justice.  "We call upon 

all law enforcement officials to protect and serve the rights of all people, 

not simply the interests of the Washington elite.  Our resolve is stronger 

than ever to peacefully deliver our message on April 16th."



<p>Last year tens of thousands of U.S. citizens took to the streets in Seattle 

to join the international movement against corporate globalization.  They 

were met with clubs, tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and concussion 

grenades.  Now in Washington DC, organizers from across the country and 

around the world are mobilizing for global justice, this time focusing 

on the IMF and World Bank.  The National Lawyers Guild is already "concerned 

with pre-textual and unjust arrests, intimidating visits by law enforcement 

officers to organizations and individuals, overbroad street and sidewalk 

closings, and conspicuous surveillance activities."



<p>Critics of IMF and World Bank policies have long documented that these 

institutions have a track record of working with dictatorships and other 

corrupt governments that can effectively repress popular opposition to 

their policies.  "Whether its through the Nigerian military or local police 

here in Washington, unelected institutions are using armed enforcement 

agents as a buffer between them and the people who oppose their policies," 

said Oronto Douglas, lawyer for executed activist Ken Saro-Wiwa.  "This 

use of force and intimidation is entirely inappropriate against nonviolent 

opponents of corporate globalization."

<p>From jail, activist Mateo Williford said: "The FBI is attempting to squelch 

our First Amendment Rights before we've even had a chance to express them. 

We will not be deterred."
