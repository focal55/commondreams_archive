- May 29 - The Green Party and their presidential

candidate Ralph Nader have staked



their claim in Texas. Laying a cornerstone for their national campaign,

Mr. Nader and the progressive party he’s



helping to build have earned a ballot line in Texas with a grassroots

drive that in 75 days produced more than



60,000 petition signatures of registered voters who had not voted in

this year’s primaries.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Over the past twenty years, big business has increasingly dominated

our political economy,” said Ralph



Nader. “This control by the corporate government over our political

government is creating a widening ‘democracy



gap.’ My campaign will challenge all Americans who are concerned with

systemic imbalances of power and the



undermining of our democracy. Presidential elections should be a time

for deep discussions among the citizenry



regarding the down-to-earth problems and injustices that are not addressed

because of the gross power mismatch



between the narrow vested interests and the public or common good.”

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party of Texas says that it seeks to “build a just and sustainable

society through education, direct



action, and inclusive electoral politics.” Founded on March 20, 1999,

the party joins 28 state Green Parties



across the United States and a growing international movement.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party of Texas, a member of the Association of State Green

Parties, has chapters in Bexar County,



Dallas County, Denton County, El Paso County, Grayson County, Harris

County, Lubbock County, Tarrant



County, and Travis County. More than 200 Greens serve in national assemblies

in 21 countries. Green Parties



are junior partners in governing coalitions in six countries. More

than 60 Greens hold elective office in the U.S.



Greens worldwide share the values of grassroots democracy, social justice,

ecological wisdom, and nonviolence.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By handily meeting the state’s draconian ballot-access requirements

– among the harshest in the nation – the young



Green Party of Texas and presidential candidate Ralph Nader, have passed

a critical early test of their



organizational capabilities and of public response to their message

that it’s time for citizen activists to reclaim



democracy.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the state’s 32 Electoral College votes and its reputation as a

bastion of support for Republican Governor



George W. Bush, the Green Party’s success is expected to energize efforts

to get Mr. Nader and other Green



candidates on state ballots around the country. They’re already guaranteed

ballot lines in 14 states, including



California, New York and Florida.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Nader, America’s best-known advocate for consumer and citizen rights,

is running an aggressive



presidential campaign that takes aim at the insidious effects – on

workers’ rights, on citizens’ health, on



the environment, on democracy itself – of concentrated corporate wealth

and power.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Even in conservative Texas, that message has struck a responsive chord,”

said Beverly Hayes, co-chair of



the Green Party of Texas, founded barely more than one year ago. “The

state regularly ranks near the bottom



on quality-of-life issues such as the environment and delivery of social

services, and petitioners found strong



public support for an alternative party favoring stricter pollution

controls, universal health insurance and full



public funding of elections.”

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“With the Democratic Party here reduced to waiting for a turn at the

corporate trough, Texans know we



desperately need an alternative on the ballot,” Ms. Hayes said. “We

represent people who’ve been shouted



down by corporate money, whether the issue is clean air in Houston,

health insurance in San Antonio, the



corporate hustling of our schoolchildren in Dallas or a living wage

in El Paso.”

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David Cobb, secretary of the Green Party of Texas, noted that while

Republicans and Democrats host $20



million fund-raisers and Pat Buchanan had to rely overwhelmingly on

hired petitioners to get him on the Texas



ballot as an independent candidate for president, the Green Party’s

success was the result of daily



pavement-pounding by dedicated citizen activists.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“There are two sources of power in this country: money and people,”

Mr. Cobb said. “The major parties



have the corporate money – and the corporate agenda. The Green Party

is a party of ‘We the People.’”

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party is expected to field candidates in four statewide races:

for U.S. Senate, attorney-mediator



Doug Sandage; for two seats on the Texas Railroad Commission, which

regulates oil and gas, Gary Dugger,



a UPS pre-loader and union steward, and Charlie Mauch, a retired petroleum

and environmental engineer;



and for Texas Supreme Court, former appeals court judge Ben Levy.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All four offices are held by Republicans, and only one is contested

by a Democrat, a dramatic illustration of



what Green Party officials are calling “democracy in decline.”&nbsp;

Combined with Deomcratic presidential



candidate Al Gore’s apparent willingness to concede the state to Bush,

this presents Texas progressives



with a unique opportunity to “vote their hopes, not their fears,” David

Cobb said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“I’ll tell you why a lot of Texans are going to cast their votes for

Nader in November,” said Mr. Cobb.



“Because they know that a vote for Al Gore in Texas is a wasted vote.

This is our chance to send a strong,



clear message that we the people are fed up with the corporate takeover

of our politics, our institutions, our



government our very culture.”
