- June 7 - The nonprofit Clean Air



Trust today awarded its clean air "Villain of the Month" award for



June to the U.S. Supreme Court.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Trust named the High Court for its recent decision to accept



a petition by industry groups that want to subject national clean



air standards to a prospective cost-benefit test.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If the Supreme Court sides with industry, it would repeal the



core premise of the 1970 Clean Air Act: that all Americans have the



right to clean air," noted Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the



Clean Air Trust.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1970, O'Donnell explained, the Clean Air Act has also been



based on the "fundamental principle that science, not politics,



should inform the public on the effects of air pollution on public



health and welfare." The industry groups, O'Donnell added, "seek to



repeal that fundamental principle and base the air quality standards



on political considerations."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Industry was ecstatic. "This is terrific," said an attorney for



the anti-clean air U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Supreme Court's decision to permit the industry appeal was a



surprise, O'Donnell said, "because virtually everyone had believed



this was a settled issue." He noted that on four previous occasions



-- twice in 1980 and again in 1984 and in 1991 -- the High Court



declined to review lower court decisions that national clean air



standards were to be based on science alone.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Historical footnote: the concept of national air standards



actually came from the Nixon administration, which sold the idea to



Congress in part because the administration guaranteed that only



science would determine the standards.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'Donnell noted there is some irony in the Supreme Court's timing.



Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) has introduced legislation that would



achieve the same outcome sought by industry, but Voinovich hasn't



succeeded in building support for his plan -- it's even been panned



by progressive electric power companies.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In theory, it's the job of Congress -- not the courts -- to write



laws. O'Donnell noted the Supreme Court "would significantly depart



from that principle" if it ultimately sides with industry in this



case.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'Donnell added the High Court justices "could go from villains to



heroes" if they reject the industry position "since that would put



this bogus industry argument to rest." The case will be argued in



November, with a decision expected next year.</font>
