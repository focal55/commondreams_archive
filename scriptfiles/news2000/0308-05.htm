- March 8 - The Brennan Center for



Justice at NYU School of Law today urged Senators to reject the



nomination of Bradley A. Smith to the Federal Election Commission (FEC).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate Rules Committee will begin hearings on the nomination



today.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brennan Center first raised concerns about Smith when



Republicans named Smith their choice to join the FEC in early 1999.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Smith is "a wholly inappropriate choice to serve as a



Commissioner to the FEC," Brennan Center President E. Joshua



Rosenkranz wrote in a letter to Senators. "While FEC Commissioners



must administer and enforce the nation's campaign finance laws,



Smith has a long, documented history of vigorously opposing them.



A decision to appoint Smith as an FEC Commissioner would be



tantamount to voting to repeal the Federal Election Campaign Act.



In short, Smith would be a disastrous FEC Commissioner."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brennan Center has also issued a report detailing the facts



about Smith and his self-described "radical" position on campaign



finance laws and their enforcement. Smith has become, the Brennan



Center points out, "the single most aggressive advocate for



deregulation of campaign finance in the academy today." For



example, in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Smith summed up his



feelings about the nation's federal campaign laws: "The most



sensible reform is a simple one: repeal of the Federal Election



Campaign Act."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Smith's tirades about campaign finance laws have strayed so far



from the mainstream that even he had trouble believing the



nomination was serious," Rosenkranz wrote in a Roll Call op-ed



published on March 6. "The bottom line is that anyone who cares



about enforcing the law as it is written - not to mention anyone



who cares about meaningful reform - should oppose Smith."

</font>

Center's report on Smith, and Rosenkranz' recent op-ed on Smith are
