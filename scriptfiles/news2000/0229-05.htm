<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 29 - </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">News Advisory:

</font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p>At a press conference this Wednesday, March 1, U.S. Rep. Tom

Lantos (D-Calif.) will introduce a landmark House Concurrent



Resolution condemning human rights violations based on real or



perceived sexual orientation. Amnesty International hails Lantos



for taking this unprecedented and important step.

<p>"Many do not realize that there are more than 80 countries in

which homosexuality is officially criminalized. In a number of



these countries, conviction can result in harsh prison sentences,



cruel and unusual punishment, or even death," said Michael Heflin,



Director of Amnesty International USA's OUTfront program. "These



violations should be given the same level of consideration as



others in the formulation of U.S. policies to protect and promote



human rights around the world."

<p>The press conference will be held at 11 a.m. at the House

Triangle. During the event, several of the resolution's



12 Congressional co-sponsors and supporting organizations -- such



as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International



Lesbian and Gay Human Rights Commission -- will voice their support



for the resolution; it documents specific abuses in countries as



wide ranging as Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Singapore and El Salvador.



In support of the resolution, Lantos cites a number of egregious



examples, including:

<p>-- In September 1999, Uganda President Yoweri Museveni ordered

police to arrest all homosexuals, with punishment of life in



prison.

<p>-- In Brazil, a lesbian couple was tortured and sexually

assaulted by civil police. Despite eyewitness testimony, internal



pressure from Brazilian citizens, as well as an October 1999



Amnesty International action on their behalf, their case remains



unprosecuted.

<p>-- In Afghanistan, men convicted of sodomy by Taliban Shari'a

courts are placed next to stone walls by Taliban officials and are



subsequently executed as the walls are toppled upon them. They are



buried under the rubble.

<p>"Sexual orientation and gender identity is not a special

category under human rights law, but it is fully embedded in the



overall human rights norms defined in international conventions to



which the U.S. is party," said Heflin. "If this resolution is



passed, it will go a long way toward helping the U.S. advance its



image as a human rights protector."
