- February 7 - Just when it seemed tobacco companies had used their clout

    to stub out any further federal regulation of their industry, President Clinton today is

    expected to <a

    href="http://www.pub.whitehouse.gov/uri-res/I2R?urn:pdi://oma.eop.gov.us/2000/2/4/14.text.1">propose</a>

    increased taxes on the cost of cigarettes, as well as new fines related to the increasing

    numbers of underage smokers.</font>    

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposal, set to be unveiled today as a part of

    the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/New/00Budget/">White House budget plan</a>,

    would fine tobacco companies $3,000 a year for each smoker under the age of 18, renewing

    the long-standing debate over whether the industry should be held accountable for the

    millions of young Americans who take up smoking each year. The fines would take effect in

    2004, if the rate of teen smokers isn&#146;t cut in half by that time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A <a

    href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/politics/061898congress-tobacco.html">similar

    proposal</a> died in the Senate in 1998, along with measures that would have increased the

    federal excise tax on cigarettes another 55 cents. Clinton&#146;s latest proposal asks for

    a 25-cent-a-pack increase in the cigarette tax, on top of a 5 cent tax that is set to take

    effect on Jan. 1, 2002. The White House plan also asks Congress to activate the

    already-approved 5 cent tax on Oct. 1 of this year, as opposed to 2002.<br>

    <br>

    The proposals mark a potential setback for the tobacco industry, which has spent <a

    href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pubs/lobby98/topind04.htm">millions of dollars</a> in

    recent years to lobby against various anti-smoking proposals moving through Congress. In

    1999, the tobacco industry accounted for just over $2.1 million in soft money, PAC and

    individual contributions to federal parties and candidates, 82 percent to Republicans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That&#146;s a 45 percent decrease over contributions reported during

    the same period in the 1998 elections, when tobacco companies successfully killed

    anti-smoking legislation. Under a <a

    href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d105:2:./temp/~bdDRFP:@@@L|/bss/d105query.html|">bill</a>

    sponsored by <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/2000elect/index/P80002801.htm">Sen. John

    McCain</a>, R-Ariz., the industry at the time would have paid more than $516 billion to

    settle smoking-related lawsuits in the states. Several state attorneys general later

    negotiated a <a href="http://stic.neu.edu/">settlement</a> on their own, in which the

    tobacco industry agreed to limit its marketing practices, particularly to youth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But tobacco companies still face a <a

    href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/speeches/1999/tobaccopc92299.htm">lawsuit</a> filed by the

    federal government, which seeks billions of dollars for federal health care costs.

    Meanwhile, the Supreme Court continues to weigh a lawsuit that could determine whether the

    Food and Drug Administration should be given the right to regulate nicotine as a drug.<br>

    </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Much like the tobacco industry&#146;s campaign contributions,

    lobbying expenditures for the industry&#146;s top companies also decreased in 1999. <a

    href="http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/98profiles/3221.htm">Brown &amp; Williamson</a>,

    a subsidiary of British American Tobacco, reported $1.3 million in lobbying expenditures

    between January and June of &#146;99, a whopping 93 percent decrease over its $18.2

    million lobbying budget during the first six months of 1998. <a

    href="http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/98profiles/18834.htm">Philip Morris</a>, from

    January to June, reported $7.5 million in lobbying expenditures, a 48 percent decrease on

    spending during the first six months of 1998.<a

    href="http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/98profiles/20165.htm"> RJ Reynolds Tobacco</a>

    ($700,000) reported a 20 percent decrease, while <a

    href="http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/98profiles/24374.htm">UST Inc</a> ($620,000),

    parent company of US Tobacco, reported 50 percent decrease in lobbying expenditures.</font></p>
