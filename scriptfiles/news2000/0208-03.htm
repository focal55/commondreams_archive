<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 8 - The national political party committees raised a record 

        $107,210,420 during the 1999 calendar year - 81 percent more than the 

        $59,161,380 they raised during the last comparable presidential election 

        period in 1995 - according to a Common Cause analysis released today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

        Congressional campaign committees of the national parties raised more 

        than three times as much soft money during 1999 than they raised during 

        1995, $62.0 million compared to $19.4 million.

      </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p align="left"> Overall, national Republican party committees raised $57,811,386 

        in soft money contributions, while national Democratic party committees 

        raised $49,399,034 in soft money in 1999, according to the study.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/020800.gif" width="616" height="276"></p>

<p align="left"> According to Common Cause, the national party committees 

        are on pace to break all soft money fundraising records for an election 

        cycle. During the 1996 campaign, Democratic and Republican national party 

        committees raised a record $260 million in soft money, much of it used 

        for &quot;issue advertisements&quot; designed to aid the presidential 

        campaigns. </p>

<p align="left">&quot;The record sums of special-interest soft money raised 

        by the national parties is further evidence of a fundamental disconnect 

        between our political parties and the voters,&quot; Common Cause President 

        Scott Harshbarger said. &quot;If the presidential primary results in New 

        Hampshire are any indication, the American people are tired of seeing 

        their democracy sold to the special interests for millions of dollars 

        in soft money contributions. Unless something is done to stop the flow 

        of corporate and union money into the political system, we will likely 

        see a repeat of the 1996 scandals, and the further erosion of the people's 

        trust in our governmental institutions.&quot;</p>

        received during 1999, according to Common Cause, were:</p>

        CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEES POST BIG GROWTH</font></b><br>

        The national congressional campaign committees accounted for much of the 

        growth in soft money contributions since 1995. Republican congressional 

        campaign committees - the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) 

        and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) - raised $32.0 

        million in soft money during 1999, double the $15.4 million raised in 

        1995. The Democratic congressional campaign committees - the Democratic 

        Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) and the Democratic Congressional 

        Campaign Committee (DCCC) - raised $30.0 million during 1999, more than 

        seven times the $4.0 million raised during 1995, according to Common Cause.</p>

<p align="left"> &quot;The incredible growth in soft money raised by the 

        congressional committees exposes the fiction that soft money is not used 

        to support federal candidates running for office,&quot; Harshbarger said. 

        &quot;The very purpose of these committees is to elect House and Senate 

        candidates to office and the activities they conduct clearly reflect this.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"> Both of the Senatorial committees have set up joint fundraising 

        committees with Senate candidates facing competitive November elections. 

        These joint committees raise both hard and soft money contributions with 

        hard money proceeds split between the candidate and the party committee, 

        while soft money proceeds go to the party committee. For example, according 

        to DSCC reports filed with the Federal Election Commission and analyzed 

        by Common Cause, the New York Senate 2000 joint fundraiser between the 

        DSCC and Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign took in more than $660,000 

        in soft money contributions from October to December of 1999. Similar 

        joint fundraising committees between the national parties and candidates 

        have already been established for Senate races in California, Florida, 

        Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Washington. </p>

<p align="left"><b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SOFT MONEY</font></b><br>

        Under current law, corporations and labor unions are prohibited from making 

        contributions in connection with a federal election, while individuals 

        and political action committees (PACs) are subject to federal limits. 

        Hard money means contributions that are legal under federal law for federal 

        elections. Soft money means contributions made outside the limits and 

        prohibitions of federal law, including large individual or PAC contributions 

        and direct corporate or union contributions.</p>

<p align="left"> The Common Cause study is based on national political party 

        committee reports of their non-federal, or soft money, accounts from January 

        1 through December 31, 1999 filed with the Federal Election Commission 

        (FEC). Totals do not include transfers between party committees, bank 

        loans or interest, offsets to operating expenditures, or other business-related 

        receipts.
