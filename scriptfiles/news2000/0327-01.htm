- March 27 -  What goes into garbage cans is 

just the tip of a giant mountain of wasted 

resources piling up everyday, according to a 

new study released today.  While Americans are 

setting new recycling records, product and 

packaging waste is increasing at the same time.



<p>At a news conference at Los Angeles City Hall, 

a coalition of recycling experts was joined by 

Councilmembers Ruth Galanter and Mark Ridley-

Thomas to announce that while Los Angeles has 

achieved a 47 percent reduction in the City's 

waste-stream, a lot more can be done to reduce 

the ever-growing mountain of trash produced 

nationwide.



<p>"By practicing the 3 R's - Reduce, Reuse, 

Recycle - Americans kept 28 percent of 

municipal refuse out of landfills and 

incinerators in 1997, nearly triple the 

recycling rate in 1980.  The biggest benefits 

from keeping these materials out of landfills 

comes from reduced pollution, energy saved, 

reduced habitat destruction and sustainable 

jobs," Rick Best, president of the GrassRoots 

Recycling Network, said.



<p>"Paper recycled by Americans since 1990 saved 

more than 3 billion trees, the equivalent of a 

forest 16 times the size of Yosemite National 

Park," said Best.  "Local government led the 

way, which is the reason for releasing our 

report here today.  Nationally, we spent $43.5 

billion on garbage disposal last year, burying 

or burning vast amounts of resources that could 

be reused or recycled.  Many cutting edge 

businesses and communities are already cutting 

their waste in half," Best said.



<p>The GrassRoots Recycling Network (GRRN) 

released Wasting and Recycling in the United 

States 2000 today.  The report provides a 

comprehensive review of progress in recycling 

and environmental impacts of wasting resources, 

and presents a strategy for eliminating waste.  

It was researched and written by the Washington 

DC-based Institute for Local Self-Reliance 

(ILSR).



<p>"Los Angeles expects to meet California's goal 

of keeping 50 percent of waste out of landfills 

in 2000 through waste prevention, reuse and 

recycling," Los Angeles Mayor Richard J. 

Riordan said in a statement issued by his 

office today.  "By the year 2020 we plan to 

reach a 70 percent waste reduction goal," said 

Riordan.



<p>"It makes economic and environmental sense, 

saving millions of dollars for taxpayers, 

creating good paying jobs in the City of Los 

Angeles and assuring a healthy future for our 

children," Riordan said.



<p>"Unfortunately, our recycling efforts 

nationally have been one step forward, one step 

back," Brenda Platt, lead author of the report 

and Director of Materials Recovery at the 

Institute for Local Self-Reliance, said in an 

interview from her office.



<p>"More than 9,300 communities provided curbside 

recycling by 1998, compared to a handful in the 

1970s.  An estimated 150 million Americans 

recycle," Platt said.



<p>"While recycling increased, wasting in 

landfills and incinerators is much greater and 

increased by 4.4 million tons between 1996 and 

1997," Platt said.  The analysis was based on 

data from the U.S. Environmental Protection 

Agency and other published sources.



<p>"Waste generated from residential and 

commercial sources is just the tip of the 

'wasteburg.'  For every garbage can placed at 

the curb, the equivalent of another 71 garbage 

cans worth of waste is created in mining, 

logging, agriculture, oil and gas exploration, 

and the industrial processes converting raw 

materials into finished products and 

packaging," GRRN Network Coordinator Bill 

Sheehan said.



<p>Dr. Sheehan, a biologist, leads the 4-year-old 

national nonprofit organization based in 

Athens, Georgia.  GRRN's report and programs 

are funded by the Turner Foundation, the Merck 

Family Fund, The Florence and John Schumann 

Foundation, and individual gifts.



<p>"One of the key findings of our research is 

that the benefits of recycling are also far 

greater than previously thought and go far 

beyond keeping materials from landfill disposal 

or incineration," Dr. Neil Seldman, co-author 

of the report and president of the ILSR, said 

from Washington DC.  Seldman is a co-founder of 

GRRN and a member of its board of directors.



<p>Key benefits of recycling identified in the 

report include:



<p>* Reducing greenhouse gases.  Reaching a 35 

percent recycling rate and reducing wasting to 

1990 levels would eliminate 11.4 million metric 

tons of carbon equivalent (MTCE).  This is 

equivalent to taking nearly 7 million cars off 

the road.



<p>* Reducing reliance on virgin resources 

protects habitats and eliminates pollution from 

extracting resources, processing and 

manufacturing.  Producing aluminum from bauxite 

is highly energy intensive and generates a ton 

of caustic waste for every ton of bauxite 

mined.  Recovering the more than 45 billion 

aluminum cans wasted in 1998 in the U.S. would 

conserve enough energy to supply the 

electricity needed by the city of Atlanta for 

two years.



<p>* Creating sustainable jobs and businesses.  A 

survey by ten northeastern states found that 

industries manufacturing with recycled 

materials employ 103,413 people in the region.  

North Carolina recycling industries employ over 

8,700 people.  California is expected to create 

45,000 recycling jobs when it reaches 50 

percent waste reduction and recycling goal.



<p>Wasting and Recycling in the United States 2000 

identifies several factors adversely affecting 

recycling and waste reduction, including:



<p>* Corporations backing away from commitments to 

use recycled materials in products and 

packaging.



<p>* Subsidies for virgin resource extraction and 

waste disposal which put recycling at a 

competitive disadvantage, including $2.6 

billion annually in federal taxpayer subsidies 

and billions more spent by local governments 

supporting landfills and incinerators.



<p>* Products and packaging are often made with 

little regard for recycling and waste 

prevention.  For example, new plastic beverage 

containers are made with colored resins or 

labels and caps making recycling technically 

more difficult and expensive.



<p>Los Angeles City Council Member Ruth Galanter 

said "Local governments and taxpayers are being 

confronted with wasteful new packaging which 

costs more to recycle.  The trend toward 

plastics is a real problem because the cost of 

collecting and recycling the containers is 

often more than what companies pay us for the 

plastic, and our taxpayers end up with the 

bill."



<p>"I am introducing a resolution tomorrow calling 

on Coca-Cola to take back its plastic bottles 

and use them to make new bottles.  Coke and 

other beverage companies that fail to use 

significant amounts of recycled plastic in 

their bottles, burden local government and 

taxpayers who pay for litter clean-up, landfill 

disposal or subsidize the cost of recycling 

their bottles," Galanter said.



<p>Wasting and Recycling in the United States 2000 

documents that many businesses and communities 

are setting records in recycling and waste 

reduction.  "Fifteen years ago, 25 percent 

recycling was thought to be the limit or to 

reach higher would mean astronomical costs.  

Today we know otherwise.  Hundreds of 

businesses and communities have cut their waste 

in half and saved money," said ILSR's Platt.



<p>"Fetzer Vineyards is one California business 

that has cut its waste by more than 80 

percent," she said.



<p>GRRN lays out a new approach based upon 

eliminating rather than managing waste.   "Zero 

waste is our goal.  Cutting edge businesses and 

communities are already pursuing innovative 

'zero waste' strategies in the United States 

and half way around the world in Australia and 

New Zealand," said Bill Sheehan.



<p>"We have only scratched the surface of 

recycling's potential in the United States.  

Every day another city achieves cost effective 

diversion rates well above the national average 

and new markets, program and processing 

strategies demonstrate success," Joan Edwards 

said at the Los Angeles news conference.  

Edwards, a private consultant, is the former 

director of recycling programs for the cities 

of Los Angeles and New York.  



<p>GRRN's report shows that keys to successful 

waste reduction and recycling are setting 

public policy goals, backed by mandates or 

incentives like beverage container deposits, 

and creating incentives for market-based 

solutions.



<p>"The heart of the zero waste strategy is based 

on the old adage that 'an ounce of prevention 

is worth a pound of cure,'" said Sheehan.



<p>The GrassRoots Recycling Network is a North 

American network of recycling and community-

based activists who advocate policies and 

practices to achieve zero waste, to end 

corporate welfare for waste, and to create 

sustainable jobs from discards.  GRRN was 

founded in 1995 by members of the Sierra Club 

Solid Waste Committee, the Institute for Local 

Self-Reliance and the California Resource 

Recovery Association.

States 2000 are available for $25.00 postpaid.
