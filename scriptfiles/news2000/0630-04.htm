- June 30 - Skyrocketing prices at the pump have left American

     families searching for solutions to high gas prices.  While Band-Aid

     solutions and blame have been plentiful, we must instead examine

     long-term solutions.  A new Sierra Club report, "Drilling Under

     Detroit: A Long-Term Solution to Gas Prices that Works," offers

     increased fuel economy as a real solution to stabilize gas prices.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">" Rather than searching for a Band-Aid for high gas prices, the time

     has come to apply the cure: Make America's cars and Sport Utility

     Vehicles go further on a gallon of gas," said Dan Becker, Director,

     Sierra Club Global Warming and Energy Program.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Drilling Under Detroit," shows that by utilizing existing technology,

     increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards would save

     more oil than we import from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain,

     United Arab Emirates, estimates of oil in the Arctic National Wildlife

     Refuge, and national offshore oil combined.  The report also details

     the potential savings for millions of Americans who drive some of the

     most popular cars and SUVs, but pay more than they need to at the

     pump.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The American people are tired of gas guzzling, polluting and price

     gouging," said Becker.  "They're demanding that Detroit put modern

     technology on our cars and trucks to break OPEC's stranglehold on our

     wallets and the threat to our climate."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The last time fuel economy was raised significantly was 1975, when

     Congress responded to an oil crisis by instituting CAFE standards for

     cars and light trucks.  The result is the most successful energy

     savings measure ever adopted.  It was so successful, so quickly, that

     America's automobiles used less gasoline in 1980 than 1975.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     CAFE standards doubled fuel economy and save 3 million barrels of oil

     every day.  But because the standards have stagnated and Americans are

     driving more miles than ever before, demand for oil is at an all-time

     high and growing.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Numerous editorials have commented on the role of fuel economy with

     our high gas prices:

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We have the same fuel-efficiency standards in effect today as we did

     in the 1970s, when auto technology was much more crude. And we've

     taken advantage of a loophole in those standards by turning en masse

     to gas-guzzling light trucks and SUVs that make up an increasing

     percentage of our fleet."

     -Atlanta Journal-Constitution, June 23, 2000

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The reality is that we were overdue for an oil shock for a number of

     reasons, which have converged to put energy prices back in the news in

     a big way for the first time since the 1980s. Though automobiles are

     significantly more gas efficient than when the first oil shock of the

     1970s struck, less-efficient light trucks represented only 20 percent

     of vehicles then. Along with sport utility vehicles, today they

     account for one of every two new vehicles sold."

     -Harrisburg Patriot-News, June 25, 2000

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Greater efficiency is the most obvious and most logical answer to an

     oil pinch. Rejecting it means not only exporting more American dollars

     but pumping ever-increasing quantities of pollutants and

     global-warming gases into the atmosphere."
