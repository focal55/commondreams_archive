- June 16 - "A woman should not have to plead with local law enforcement to be protected

from vicious, gender-based violence," NOW President Patricia

Ireland said.&nbsp; "The recent horrendous attacks in New York City's

Central Park and the reports of outrageous police indifference must spur

political action.&nbsp; Congress must

pass the Local

Law Enforcement Enhancement Act to extend hate crimes protection to

women and pass the reauthorization and expansion of the Violence

Against Women Act."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d106:s.622:">Local

Law Enforcement Enhancement Act</a> would improve access to federal resources

to assist local and state law enforcement officials in better investigating

and prosecuting bias-related crimes.&nbsp; It would also extend coverage

to gender, sexual orientation and disability, and eliminate the requirement

that the victim be engaged in a federally protected activity such as voting.&nbsp;

The Violence Against Women

Act would fund training for police and other law enforcement and court

personnel, among other things.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Conservative members of Congress are sitting in Washington tossing

around rhetoric while every day women across the country face gender-based

violence," Ireland said.&nbsp; "The Central Park attacks have received

national attention, but the problem remains."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Perhaps with enhanced resources and training, police on the scene in

Central Park would have been better equipped to respond immediately to

allegations of sexual assaults in progress," said Ireland, referring to

reports that some victims were rebuffed when they sought assistance from

the police.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Women must turn our shock and outrage into political pressure and power,"

Ireland said.&nbsp; "We demand that members of Congress take immediate

action to pass the anti-violence bills before them.&nbsp; We will be watching,

and <a href="http://www.nowpacs.org/">women will remember in November</a>."</font>
