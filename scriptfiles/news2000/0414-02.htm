Experts Say Implementation Uncertain; Further Nuclear Weapons Cuts Needed, Have Public Backing</font></div>

- April 14 - An alliance of non-governmental nuclear arm control experts 

called today’s ratification of the 1993 START II pact by Russia’s lower house of 

parliament "a long-overdue, but very important step toward implementing 

reductions of Cold War-era nuclear bomb stockpiles." The START II pact was 

signed over seven years ago by Presidents Bush and Yeltsin. It will, if 

implemented, reduce each nation’s deployed, long-range nuclear warheads to 

3,000-3,500 from current levels of about 6,000 each.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Russian action on START II puts to the test the United States ability to 

deliver on strategic nuclear arms control," said Jack Mendelson, Executive 

Director, Lawyers Alliance for World Security. "Several hurdles remain in the 

way of implementing START II, and future U.S. Presidential and Congressional 

action on national missile defense could jeopardize further progress on reducing 

nuclear weapons dangers," he added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We expect President Clinton and the Senate will work cooperatively to 

approve the 1997 agreements that will allow for implementation of these 

substantial nuclear arms reductions," said Mendelson. Some Senators have said 

they will reject the 1997 agreements and that the U.S. should withdraw from the 

ABM Treaty itself in the hope of developing expensive — and as yet unproven and 

unworkable— sea- and space-based national missile defenses. The Clinton 

administration wants modifications to the 1972 ABM Treaty to allow for a 

"limited" missile defense -- a step now opposed by Russia, which could scuttle 

chances for further verifiable arms cuts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even after START II, both countries will retain thousands of nuclear weapons 

on hair-trigger alert, poised for mass attack, with decision-makers having just 

minutes to decide whether to launch thousands of nuclear- armed missiles. The 

U.S. and Russia will also still retain a large number of short-range, "tactical" 

nuclear bombs, not covered by START. Nations gathering next week in New York for 

a conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty are expected to express 

concern about the nuclear weapons states failure to fulfill their commitments to 

pursue nuclear disarmament.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"START II ratification is helpful, but the Cold War nuclear doomsday machine 

is still on-line," said Ira Schorr, Coordinator of Back from the Brink, which is 

pursuing a web-based citizens’ signature campaign to ‘de-alert’ nuclear 

arsenals. The address is &lt;http://www.dealert.org&gt;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Duma ratification of START II provides an historic opportunity for President 

Clinton to conclude a START III deal to secure deeper verifiable and 

irreversible reductions of each nations’ nuclear bombs," said John Isaacs, 

President of Council for a Livable World. "The U.S. should lock in the lowest 

level of nuclear weapons that Russia will accept and verify," suggested Isaacs. 

"Sadly, when Russia says it is prepared to mutually and verifiably reduce to 

1,000-1,500 long-range weapons, the Clinton-Gore Administration insists that we 

should not go below 2,500," he noted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is dangerous to continue to believe that deterring Russia, which is poor 

and no longer a Cold War enemy, requires threatening to drop 2,500 nuclear bombs 

on Russian soil. Each of these 2,500 weapons can destroy an area much greater 

than Hiroshima or Nagasaki and kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people," 

said Martin Butcher, Director of Security Programs for Physicians for Social 

Responsibility.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The President and the Congress would have the backing of the public if they 

worked together to secure further verifiable nuclear reductions under START III. 

A national public opinion survey conducted last week shows that 67% of Americans 

believe that reduction or elimination of nuclear weapons should be the goal of 

U.S. nuclear policy. Four in ten Americans (40%) believe that the complete 

elimination of nuclear weapons should be the U.S. policy goal. Another 28% say 

that reduction of these weapons should be the goal. A total of 15% say the U.S. 

should maintain the current number of weapons, and 15% say the U.S. should 

design new and better nuclear weapons. The April 7-9 poll of 1000 adults 

nationwide was conducted by The Mellman Group for the Coalition to Reduce 

Nuclear Dangers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many Pentagon leaders also agree that more progress is needed. In an 

interview on <i>60 Minutes</i> aired earlier this year, the former head of the 

U.S. Strategic Command, General Eugene Habiger said "... the fact that we have 

not been able to get down to lower and lower levels of nuclear weapons is 

troubling to me, and it should be troubling to you."</font></p>
