- March 13 - Today, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans

Frontières (MSF) demanded that the pharmaceutical company Pfizer dramatically

reduce the price of a life-saving AIDS drug in poor countries. In a

communication delivered to Pfizer today in 18 countries, Doctors Without Borders

explicitly supported the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), a non-governmental

coalition of South African AIDS activists, in their call for Pfizer to lower the

price of fluconazole or authorize sale of less expensive generic versions of the

drug in South Africa.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As physicians, we understand first-hand the frustration of watching

people die of AIDS-related meningitis when we know that an effective medicine

exists,&quot; says Bernard Pécoul, director of the Doctors Without Borders

Access to Essential Medicines Campaign. &quot;In South Africa, where one company

holds exclusive marketing rights, the cost of fluconazole is nearly 15 times

higher than in Thailand where the drug is not patent protected. People are dying

because the price of the drug that can save them is too high.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common systemic fungal infection in

HIV-positive people. Without treatment, life expectancy is less than one month.

Ongoing treatment with fluconazole can extend and substantially improve the life

of a person living with AIDS by several years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In South Africa approximately 4.5 million people are currently infected with

HIV and AIDS accounts for 100,000 deaths yearly. The daily dose (400 mg) of

fluconazole needed to treat cryptococcal meningitis currently costs $17.84 USD,

more than two times the daily wage of an average employed South African who

earns just $7.69 USD. In Thailand, however, the daily dose of fluconazole costs

just $1.20. It is illegal for any company other than Pfizer to sell or produce

cheaper versions of fluconazole in South Africa because the company has

exclusive marketing rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a communication addressed to Pfizer, Doctors Without Borders stated:

&quot;P<font color="#000000">eople in poor

countries should pay less for essential medicines. </font>While

we appreciate that p</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">atents

can be an important motor of research and development funding, there must be a

balance to ensure that people in developing countries have access to life-saving

medicines.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Doctors Without Borders//Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is conducting an

international campaign to improve access to essential medicines in poor

countries. For more about the campaign, see our website: www.accessmed-msf.org</font></p>
