- June 22 - Aerospace corporations and the Pentagon are participating in a drama to

deceive the public and rob the taxpayers of hundreds of billions of dollars

as they escalate their efforts to promote the need for the so-called

Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system.



<p>"Boeing and other weapons corporations are worried that the tide is turning

against their plan to fleece the taxpayers with the BMD program," said Bruce

Gagnon, Coordinator of the Florida-based Global Network Against Weapons &

Nuclear Power in Space.



<p>"The aerospace giants are now undertaking a huge public relations campaign

in order to scare the American people, the media, Congress, and the Clinton

administration into submission.  But we are fighting back.  People are

educating themselves, protesting, and moving into political action all over

the world in order to stop this son of Star Wars from going forward."





<p>In spite of the fact that BMD won't work as advertised, will drain the

national treasury, is based on an exaggerated threat, and will destabilize

international relations, the Pentagon and their private sector allies want

to press on -- full steam ahead.



<p>Protest events are being organized around July 7, the scheduled date for the

next NMD test from Vandenberg AFB, CA.  Actions will be held at these key

space facilities:  Cape Canaveral (June 24); Vandenberg (July 1);

Lockheed-Martin Valley Forge, PA (July 1); Ft. Meade, MD (July 4); Menwith

Hill, England (July 4); and Peterson AFB, Colorado (July 7).



<p>Major plans are also now underway by the Global Network and other groups for

an International Day of Protest to Stop the Militarization of Space on

October 7, 2000 .  Already protests are being scheduled in France,

Azerbaijan, Germany, England, Nepal, Canada, and throughout the U.S. to give

voice to the growing global consciousness that demands we keep space for

peace.  These actions intend to make clear that decisions about the future

of  space are too important to be left to politicians and weapons

profiteers.



<p>For more information on the full list of coming protests please check the
