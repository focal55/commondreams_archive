- February 24 - Following is a



prepared statement by Steve Ellis, director of water resources at



Taxpayers for Common Sense on the recent revelations about the U.S.

Army Corps of Engineers, Program Growth Initiative, a program to grow



the agencies budget by 50 percent to $6.2 billion by 2005 as



described in The Washington Post (February 24, 2000):

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This initiative is an outrageous grab for the taxpayer's money to



benefit empire building at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This



initiative is basically a plan to increase the agency's budget from



$4 billion to $6.2 billion, a 50 percent growth in only five years.



It doesn't appear, however, that this plan has any particular benefit



for the nation or the taxpayer, only to build the Corps of Engineers



empire.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Corps has several guidelines and restrictions to ensure the



taxpayer receives a good return on their investment. But according

to



the Washington Post, the Corps' characterizes these rules as



'impediments to growth.'

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The nation is attempting to reduce the national debt. However,



the Corps' ambition is to feather its nest with the same tax dollars



that could be used to reduce the debt burden on our grandchildren.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Corps of Engineers appears to be an agency out of control.



Assistant Secretary of the Army Joseph Westphal said in response to



the Corps growth initiative, "I don't think (the Corps) should be in



the business of searching for work. No way. We've got enough on our



plate." We couldn't agree with Secretary Westphal more.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The taxpayers place a great deal of trust in the Corps of



Engineers to objectively analyze projects and only recommend



construction of those that have a national benefit. However, an



effort to build or grow the Corps of Engineers destroys that trust



and all Corps analysis becomes questionable. A thorough analysis of



all the Corps' projects should be conducted by an independent panel



and any proposed Corps projects should be reviewed with great



skepticism."</font>
