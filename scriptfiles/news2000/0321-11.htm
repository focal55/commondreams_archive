- March 21 - Violence in Kashmir and nuclear proliferation are dominating

the mainstream headlines on President Clinton's trip to South Asia.  And

while security issues are clearly on the agenda in Clinton's meetings with

Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, the press is ignoring an

equally significant part of the trip: trade. Traveling along with the

Clinton family and US officials is a large corporate contingent. Behind the

scenes of the first official state visit to India by a US president in 22

years, more than 50 US corporate executives are meeting with Indian

officials and business representatives. The goal of these CEO's and other

executives is to gain more access to Indian markets.



<p>The Washington, D.C. based US-India Business Council (USIBC) is hosting

many of

the events for the corporate delegates in India.  The USIBC's Board of

Directors includes Frank Wisner, former Ambassador to India, currently

representing the American International Group Inc (AIG), one of the largest

insurance companies in the US. Also on the Council's board is Joseph W.

Sutton of Enron, a Houston-based natural gas giant whose power projects in

India have come under attack from environmental and community groups.

Others on the board include Peter Howell of banking conglomerate Citigroup,

Dinesh Keskar of Boeing India, Boyd Montgomery of UNOCAL and Charles Saris

of Pfizer pharmaceuticals, to name a few. 



<p>The large corporate delegation accompanying Clinton includes former

ambassador to India Frank Wisner, Lou Gestner, IBM's Chairman, Arun

Netraveli, President of Bell Laboratories/Lucent Technologies, John Smith,

CEO of General Motors, Kenneth Lay, Chairman and CEO of Enron and General

Electric's CEO John Welch.



<p>Many US corporations have increasingly come under fire from Indian

activists, whose concerns  range from human rights to the environment.

Last year, Enron, the single largest foreign investor in India, was

implicated in human rights violations in India by a Human Rights Watch.  A

lawsuit was recently filed against Union Carbide by victims of one of the

worst industrial disasters in history fifteen years ago in Bhopal, India.

Warren M. Anderson, chairman of the Union Carbide Corporation during

the1984 Bhopal chemical disaster has apparently gone into hiding to avoid a

summons to appear in a Manhattan federal court as part of civil proceedings

against him and the company.

 

<p>The following is a list of participants attending events hosted by the

US-India Business Council during the Clinton visit, and includes corporate

executives from both India and the US.
