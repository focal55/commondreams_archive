- June 4 - On Monday, June 5, members



of Congress will discuss the challenges and opportunities of building



a constitutuency for international affairs in the context of a new



poll: "Connecting Women in the U.S. and Global Issues."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reps. Joseph Crowley (D-NY) and Carolyn Maloney (D-NY)



will speak at a 3:30 pm EDT press conference in the United Nations



Press Conference Room (Room 226), UN Headquarters, East 46th St. and



1st Ave., New York City (NOTE: UN Media Accreditation is required for



entry to UN Facilities.)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also speaking will be Joan Dunlop of the Women's Lens on Global



Issues, which commissioned the poll, and Nancy Belden of the polling



firm Belden, Russonello &amp; Stewart.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This comprehensive poll on U.S. women's interest in global issues



finds a significant potential for mobilizing women on behalf of



international aid, multilateral organizations and a "good neighbor"



role in the world for the United States. At the poll's release, the



members of Congress will comment upon its significance for their



efforts to build a U.S. constituency in support of international



affairs.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The survey report, "Connecting Women in the U.S. and Global



Issues," shows that American women, contrary to their image,



recognize that the world has become a highly interconnected place and



believe it is essential that the United States take an active role

in

world affairs because of the impact global events have at home.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Commissioned by Women's Lens on Global Issues, the poll is being



released on the eve of the United Nations General Assembly Special



Session called "Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace



for the 21st Century." It offers the first known baseline survey of



women's interest in foreign affairs and their sometimes ambivalent



views of globalization and the U.S. role. It outlines the values



that contribute to women's interest in engagement and the types of



engagement women welcome most.
