- February 21 - The federal government&#146;s decision to legalize the

irradiation of raw meat and meat products is irresponsible because of the glaring lack of

research regarding the long-term health effects of irradiated food on humans, a Public

Citizen food irradiation expert said today.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The government has declared food irradiation to be safe by using mathematical

calculations supported by just five animal studies conducted primarily in the 1960s and

1970s, that were of questionable quality, according to Wenonah Hauter, director of Public

Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy Project. Other research has shown that food

irradiation diminishes the nutritional value of food by depleting its vitamins, she said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beginning Tuesday, Feb. 22, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will permit the

irradiation of raw meat and meat products such as ground beef, steaks and pork chops.

Under the USDA&#146;s labeling requirements, meat served in such places as restaurants and

cafeterias will not have to be labeled, so consumers will have no idea when they are

eating irradiated meat. (Irradiated meat sold in supermarkets will be labeled as such.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The legalization of irradiation of our food supply is incredibly irresponsible

given the clearly inadequate testing of the effects on consumers&#146; health and

nutrition,&quot; Hauter said. &quot;To make matters worse, weak and incomplete labeling

rules effectively remove the public&#146;s right to know what they are eating.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The body of research on irradiated food is sketchy at best and has yielded conflicting

results as to the safety of irradiated food, Hauter said. There are no studies on the

long-term health effects of irradiated food on humans, which means it is uncertain that

eating irradiated food is safe. Among the unknowns: the comprehensive effects of

irradiation on the nutritional value of food, whether irradiation has different effects on

frozen food as compared to fresh food, how irradiation affects irregularly shaped foods,

what its effects are on helpful bacteria, and the effects of irradiation on plant workers

who oversee the treatment of food.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, tests on short-term effects of food irradiation are contradictory and

inconclusive. Some research shows that food irradiation causes the creation of new

chemicals in food that could be toxic or cancer-causing. Also, research shows that

irradiation destroys vitamins A, B1, K and E.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Irradiation is classified as an additive and requires users to petition the FDA for

permission to irradiate specific foods. The U.S. Army conducted early research on food

irradiation, resulting in the legalization in 1963 of irradiated canned bacon. It was

pulled from the market, however, when the FDA discovered that the research was flawed and

that significant adverse effects were produced in animals fed irradiated food. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1980s, the government lost six years&#146; worth of studies when its contractor,

Bio-Test Ltd. (IBT), was found to have conducted fraudulent research. Despite the criminal

conviction of three of Bio-Test&#146;s directors, and despite the fact that the

company&#146;s work was characterized by &quot;missing records, unallowable departures

from testing protocol&quot; and &quot;poor work quality,&quot; the work is still cited by

many as showing that food irradiation is safe.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to FDA documents, a 1982 FDA review of 413 studies found 344 to be

inconclusive or inadequate to demonstrate either the safety or toxicity of irradiated

foods, while 32 indicated adverse effects and 37 showed the procedure to be safe.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the FDA ultimately deemed food irradiation safe, it pointed to five animal

studies. But there were problems with each of them, Hauter said. In one, four litters of

rats fed irradiated wheat were stillborn, while just one litter was stillborn in rats not

being fed the irradiated food. Another ignored defects found in dogs fed irradiated food.

In a third, rats fed irradiated milk powder lost weight and experienced miscarriages, and

in the remaining two, the sample sizes were too small to be statistically significant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 1997 CBS poll showed that 77 percent of Americans don&#146;t want to eat irradiated

food. But food irradiation is becoming more widespread in part because of efforts by the

food and nuclear industries to sway administration officials and lawmakers, said Joan

Claybrook, Public Citizen&#146;s president. For instance, in the 1995-1996 election cycle,

food industry PACs spent $22.6 million on campaign contributions, and in the 1997-1998

cycle, they spent $19.8 million.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Despite a strong show of the public&#146;s will, the money and influence wielded

in Congress and the regulatory agencies by the nuclear and food industries is undermining

democracy and the notion that government should serve people, rather than corporate

interests,&quot; Claybrook said.</font>
