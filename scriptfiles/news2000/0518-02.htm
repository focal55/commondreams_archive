- May 18 - Today, in a heated response



to the Japanese government's raids, threats and human rights



violations against environmental activists in Tokyo last week, a



dramatic protest is taking place at noon in front of the Japanese



Embassy.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An International Day of Action was declared by Greenpeace, and



supporters in more than 15 countries have gathered at Japanese



embassies demanding the immediate release of four imprisoned



activists. While no formal charges have been filed against the



activists, they have been detained in prison for nine days. Families



of the activists arrived in Tokyo today, but no decision will be made



on the activists' fate until May 20.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last Friday, a judge ordered the four Greenpeace activists, moved



to the notorious "Daiyo Kangoku" prison system. In a recent report,



The United States Human Rights Committee condemned this system for

its practice of long, unmonitored interrogations, verbal abuse, and



depriving prisoners of sleep. After the arrests the Greenpeace office



in Tokyo and the Greenpeace flagship the "Rainbow Warrior" were



raided and property seized.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Executive Director of Greenpeace International, Thilo Bode said:



"This is a blatant attempt to silence legitimate peaceful protest



against dioxin emissions into the environment. I call on the Japanese



authorities to release our activists who were simply exercising their



international right to freedom of speech in alerting the world to the



dangers of incineration and dioxin emissions."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The four activists, were arrested in Tokyo on May 9, after a



non-violent action highlighting the problems of dioxin emissions into



the environment. Japan has the highest levels of dioxin emissions in



the world today as a consequence of having more than 2000 waste



incinerators, more than any other country. Dioxins are toxic



substances created during the incineration process and are linked to



multiple cancers as well as non-cancerous effects such as



endometriosis and immune system damage. They are toxic in extremely



minute quantities and are categorized as known human carcinogens.



Amnesty International has also condemned Japanese detention of the



activists. In a statement, it said, "The heavy handed treatment of



these peaceful protesters is an obvious attempt to silence and



intimidate environmental activism. The activists are being held in



continuous detention without charge or trial, a practice which is



unacceptable by international human rights standards."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protest is being held today at noon at the Japanese Embassy in



Washington, D.C. at 2520 Massachusetts Ave. N.W., between California



and Bancroft.</font>
