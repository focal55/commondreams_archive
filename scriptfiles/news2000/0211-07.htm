February 11 - </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">by Don Reeves<BR>

AFSC General Secretary

</font></p>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Colombians captured international attention last October when

10 million people marched for peace. Talks between the Colombian

government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)

guerrilla forces have resumed. Yet, rather than support these

significant opportunities to end the longest and bloodiest civil

war in Latin America, the U.S. and Colombian governments are pursuing

an escalation of military aid which will undermine peace efforts

and is likely to draw the U.S. deeper into what Amnesty International

says could be the &quot;worst human rights catastrophe of the

hemisphere.&quot;

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Although policy makers state that the two year $1.3 billion dollar

military aid package proposed by President Clinton on January

11 will be dedicated to the war on drugs, Colombia's civil war

and the drug war are inseparable. As Barry McCaffrey, drug policy

advisor for the Clinton Administration, stated in 1999, &quot;It

is silly at this point to try to differentiate between antidrug

efforts and the war against insurgent groups.&quot; Colombia is

the largest recipient of U.S. counter-drug assistance yet in the

last decade, coca production has more than tripled and extended

deeper into the Amazon basin, according to the International Narcotics

Control Strategy Report.

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

In March of 1999, President Clinton apologized for the U.S. role

in Guatemala's internal conflict in which &quot;acts of genocide&quot;

were committed according to a U.N. truth commission report. President

Clinton stated that &quot;support for military forces or intelligence

units which engaged in violent and widespread repression was wrong,

and the United States must not repeat that mistake.&quot; The

proposed military aid package for Colombia will repeat that mistake

by intervening in a counterinsurgency war, making it more deadly,

and undermining the peace process. 

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Colombia is already the world's third largest recipient of U.S.

military assistance despite overwhelming evidence collected by

independent human rights groups and Colombian judicial authorities

demonstrating active state collusion with paramilitary groups

which are responsible for massacres, atrocities and widespread

human rights abuses against the civilian population. Massacres

and displacement are used as military tactics and civilian non-combatants

account for at least two-thirds of casualties. The violence has

produced 1.6 million internal refugees, which exceeds the forced

exodus that the world recently witnessed with horror in both Kosovo

and East Timor. The proposed aid package will draw the U.S. deeper

into Colombia's conflict, intensify the war and makes the U.S.

complicit in a wide scale violation of human rights.

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Rather than fueling the flames of Colombia's civil war, the U.S.

should: support the peace process, programs for the protection

of human rights, alternative development programs for coca and

poppy producers, and drug treatment and prevention programs to

reduce the demand of drugs at home.
