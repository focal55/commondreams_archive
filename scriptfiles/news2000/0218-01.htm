-  February 18 - The production of mixed uranium plutonium oxide (MOX) fuel by British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) at Sellafield in north-western England must be scrapped by the British government following the release of a damning report by the nuclear regulatory body, Greenpeace

said today. 

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) report released today

revealed that the falsification of safety data for MOX fuel had gone on since 1996 and involved British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) major overseas clients, Japan and Switzerland. "The appalling mismanagement of BNFL has destroyed not only the trust of their Japanese clients, crucial to their survival, but also public faith in the British regulatory system," said Greenpeace International nuclear campaigner Shaun Burnie. "If BNFL was not a taxpayer funded enterprise they would now be out of business."

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, BNFL and the NII continue to insist that the MOX fuel is safe to use, despite the safety data falsification. This is despite the revelation last December that MOX fuel produced by BNFL and loaded into a reactor in Switzerland, ruptured, leaked radiation and had to be removed. MOX fuel, due to the presence of plutonium, is widely considered less safe than conventional uranium fuel. Investigations last September into BNFL MOX quality control standards concluded that it was practicably impossible to assure the quality and therefore the safety of MOX fuel produced by BNFL.</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"For the British nuclear regulator to continue to maintain that the MOX fuel is safe to use in Japanese reactors, despite the safety data

falsification, raises serious doubts about its credibility," said Burnie. "The Japanese public are rightly sceptical of the safety claims for the MOX fuel, which has led the Japanese government to demand its return to the UK, this report will do nothing to reassure them."

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace warned that the recommendations made by the NII for

‘modifications’ to MOX production at Sellafield and retraining of staff will not address the industry’s fundamental problems. "The British and Japanese governments must finally end the folly of MOX production which cannot be justified on safety, economic or environmental grounds and also poses a major nuclear weapons proliferation threat in the volatile north-east Asian region. They must stop any further reprocessing and abandon plans to open the doomed Sellafield MOX Plant," said Burnie. 

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently the Nuclear Energy Agency estimates that making MOX costs 3 to 5 times the cost of making uranium fuel, the standard fuel for the majority of nuclear reactors around the world. The Sellafield nuclear facility discharges 3.3 billion litres of nuclear waste each year in the Irish Sea.

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The MOX plant at the centre of this scandal, the MOX Demonstration

Facility (MDF), received a £100 million upgrade in the early 1990’s, while at the same time, BNFL proceeded with construction of the £300 million Sellafield MOX Plant. Ready for operation in June 1997, the plant still remains idle, with the UK government unprepared to open a plant that has almost no commercial contracts for MOX fuel with foreign electrical utilities and British nuclear utilities have no plans to use MOX. 

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The BNFL/Japan MOX falsification scandal only became public after the

Independent newspaper revealed  details last September. In the following three months, BNFL, Kansai Electric, and the Japanese Ministry of Trade and Industry, MITI, continued to deny that the scandal effected plutonium fuel newly arrived in Japan from the UK. The fuel was due to be loaded into the Takahama reactor in Japan at the end of the year, however BNFL was forced to admit that the MOX fuel contained ‘suspect’ quality control data.
