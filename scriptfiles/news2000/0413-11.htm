- April 13 - Protesters are following up a week 

of mass rallies and victories with a day of intensive education for Sunday's 

demonstrations. With teach-ins, press conferences, and civil disobedience 

training taking place throughout the city, protesters plan to be better-prepared 

than ever before to make their message heard. Here's where you can get 

the story:<p>



Making Our Voices Heard:<br>

INTERNATIONAL ACTIVISTS AND SCHOLARS  join forces to explain how the I.M.F. 

and the World Bank create poverty, not prosperity. Press conference with 

speakers from Zimbabwe, the Philippines, Uganda, Haiti, the U.S. and more 

beginning at 8:30 a.m., National Press Club, First Amendment Rm; Soren 

Ambrose, (202) 210-0792.<br>

like wildfire with America's youth. Hear the voices of the next generation

Teach-ins – What's Wrong with Globalization and How We're Going to Fix 

It:<p>

WORLD'S LEADING CRITICS of globalization from every continent come together 

to explain the sins of the IMF and World Bank.  This event is already sold 

out, but there will be room for press – get there early! All day: 9:00 

a.m-10:30 p.m. at Foundry Methodist Church, 1500 16th St. N.W. International

activists, and workers from around the world. All day at St. Stephen's 

Church, 16th St. &Newton, N.W. Melinda St. Louis, (202) 544-9355 for more

MORE TRENCHES, LESS FAIR TRADE – that's the result of the World Bank's 

"dry canal" network stretching from Mexico, through Nicaragua to Colombia 

and beyond, wiping out rainforest and local economies all along the way. 

World Bank says "Trust us"; Nicaraguan activist Suyen Barahona and others 

say  "No thanks." Get the facts behind the fury: Noon, Protest Headquarters, 

on Florida Avenue between 13th & 14th N.W.<p>
