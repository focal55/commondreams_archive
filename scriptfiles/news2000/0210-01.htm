- February 10 - Americans could cut hunger in half within two years in the United 

                States&#151;and do their part to cut world hunger in half within 

                two decades&#151;for just pennies a day, says a new report by <b>Bread 

                for the World Institute</b>.              

<p><b>A Program to End Hunger&#151;Hunger 2000</b>, the organization's 

                10th annual report on the state of world hunger, says that the 

                United States is the only industrialized country with widespread 

                hunger, with some 31 million people at risk. The data shows that 

                people in 3.6 percent of all American households were hungry and 

                10.2 percent of households were at risk of hunger. </p>

              <p>&quot;As much as we'd like to think that ours is a generous society, 

                the fact is that the richest country in the world does less than 

                any other developed nation to combat pervasive hunger,&quot; says David 

                Beckmann, president of Bread for the World, a nationwide citizens' 

                movement against hunger based in Silver Spring, Maryland. </p>

              <p>The report argues that the United States could cut the number 

                of its hungry to some 16 million for $5 billion a year, which 

                breaks down to a cost of only $18 a year for each person in the 

                country. The U.S. government would have to contribute just $1 

                billion more yearly to lead the international effort to cut hunger 

                worldwide, Bread for the World says. The total is less than one-third 

                of one percent of the federal budget. </p>

              <p>&quot;For starters, Congress should this year raise the minimum wage 

                and pass the Hunger Relief Act,&quot; says Rev. Beckmann. &quot;The Hunger 

                Relief Act would extend food stamps to more hungry people, and 

                a $1 increase in the minimum wage would put food on the table 

                of a low-income family for six months.&quot;</p>

              <p> In the last 50 years, almost 400 million people worldwide have 

                died from hunger and poor sanitation, according to the report. 

                That's three times the number of people killed in all wars fought 

                in the entire 20th century. Significant progress has already been 

                made in reducing global hunger. Thirty years ago the number of 

                undernourished people totaled 959 million &#151; one in three people 

                in the developing world. Today, less than one in five people are 

                undernourished.</p>

              <p> &quot;The benefits of ending global hunger are so huge that any rational 

                person has to wonder why we have not done it already,&quot; says Fawzi 

                Al-Sultan, president of the International Fund for Agricultural 

                Development, a cosponsor of the report. &quot;Death, especially infant 

                mortality, and disease rates would fall. Families would be healthier 

                and happier, and their children more able to learn. Children would 

                be healthier, happier and more able to learn. Productivity would 

                rise as workers no longer had to work on empty stomachs.&quot; </p>

              <p>The report says that one in ten households in the United States 

                cannot afford the food they need. </p>

              <p>&quot;While the record-setting stock market and low unemployment have 

                become clich&eacute; topics in the press, the booming economy 

                hasn't improved the lives of all Americans,&quot; Rev. Beckmann says. 

                &quot;This is particularly striking when you realize that hunger is 

                one problem we can actually solve. But churches and charities 

                can't do it all. Our government must do its part. Congress needs 

                to pass the Hunger Relief Act and raise the minimum wage.&quot; </p>

              <p>Bread for the World calls on Congress to invest an extra $5 billion 

                annually in nutrition programs with proven track records. </p>

              <p>Similarly, a global commitment could cut hunger in half in the 

                developing world over the next 15 years. At the 1996 World Food 

                Summit, the nations of the world agreed to reduce undernutrition 

                in developing countries by 50 percent in 20 years. This goal will 

                not be met unless industrialized countries provide the necessary 

                resources. The U.S. share of this effort would be just $1 billion 

                per year. </p>

              <h4>The Extent of Hunger in the United States</h4>

              <p> &quot;In the United States, hunger does not manifest itself dramatically 

                like famine and starvation,&quot; Rev. Beckmann says. &quot;The face of 

                hunger is much different in our country than it is overseas. But 

                although it's easier for us to ignore, it is still a widespread 

                problem.&quot; </p>

              <p>One in ten U.S. families cannot always afford the food they need, 

                according to recently released data from the U.S. Department of 

                Agriculture. Some 19 million adults and 12 million children live 

                in these homes. Too many of these families have to choose between 

                buying food or paying the rent. Some of these people are going 

                hungry; some parents are skipping meals so that their children 

                can eat. Growing numbers are turning to soup kitchens and food 

                pantries. </p>

              <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture uses Census data to assess 

                the extent of food insecurity and hunger. When a family is described 

                as &quot;food insecure,&quot; it means that they cannot always afford the 

                food that they need. They are forced to cope by lowering the quality 

                of their diets, or skipping meals, or having the adults go a whole 

                day without eating. When a household is classified as &quot;food insecure 

                with hunger,&quot; even the children go without eating.</p>

              <p> In 1998, 3.7 million U.S. households (3.6 percent) were hungry 

                and 10.5 million households (10.2 percent) were at risk of hunger. 

                Nearly one in five children and more than one in ten adults live 

                in a food-insecure (hungry or at risk of hunger) household. </p>

              <p>In mid-1998, U.S. unemployment was at a low 4.5 percent and inflation 

                was 1.9 percent. The U.S. economy remained strong in its eighth 

                straight year of expansion. Yet, despite the booming economy, 

                hunger and food insecurity persisted at about the level of 1995. 

              </p>

              <p>The booming economy coincided with cutbacks in the very government 

                programs that over the years have lifted millions of people out 

                of poverty. The Food Stamp Program is a prime example.</p>

              <p> In the time from the historic Field Foundation visit to Mississippi 

                in 1967&#151;which exposed deep hunger and poverty to a shocked nation&#151;to 

                the late 1970s, hunger declined dramatically. The expansion of 

                the Food Stamp Program during this period made a big difference. 

                Yet today this program is in disarray. Nine million people have 

                dropped off the Food Stamp Program in the last five years, and 

                this may be the biggest single reason that hunger did not decline 

                despite falling unemployment. </p>

              <h4>Overcoming Hunger in the United States </h4>

              <p>Once the federal government decides to act, it would take only 

                a couple of years to cut hunger in half simply by strengthening 

                existing nutrition programs. Needed improvements in the national 

                nutrition programs would cost about $5 billion annually, or $18 

                for each person in this country which is about the cost of an 

                entrée in a nice restaurant. The most important of these programs 

                are the Food Stamp Program, the Special Supplemental Nutrition 

                Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and the school 

                breakfast and lunch programs.</p>

              <p> &quot;This is an era of unprecedented opportunity for the United 

                States, as the most powerful nation on earth, to eradicate hunger 

                in our own great country, and help shape a more food secure future 

                for all,&quot; says Representative Tony P. Hall (D-OH). </p>

              <p>The Food Stamp Program enables some low-income people to survive 

                while working at low- paying jobs. As &quot;the first line of defense&quot; 

                against hunger, it is the most extensive of the federal nutrition 

                assistance programs, reaching nearly 20 million people. Food stamps 

                help all eligible people to buy more food than they could otherwise. 

                It also fosters better nutritional habits. Food stamp recipients 

                eat 20 percent to 50 percent less junk food than non-recipients. 

              </p>

              <p>Bread for the World and hundreds of other groups across the country 

                are pushing Congress this year to strengthen the Food Stamp Program 

                by passing the Hunger Relief Act (S. 1805, H.R. 3192). This legislation 

                would make more people eligible for food stamps by changing outdated 

                rules that keep some hungry families from getting help and reestablishing 

                eligibility for legal immigrants. </p>

              <p>Bread for the World members and churches across the country are 

                also urging their members of Congress to raise the minimum wage 

                by $1 over the next two years. A person working full-time at minimum 

                wage earns only $10,700 per year, which is $5,960 below the 1998 

                poverty level for a family of four. An estimated 11.8 million 

                workers would benefit from a $1 increase in the minimum wage. 

                Opponents to raising the minimum wage contend that it would hurt 

                workers in the long run by increasing unemployment. But studies 

                have proven that a modest increase in the minimum wage has never 

                been connected to a spike in the aggregate unemployment rate.</p>

              <p> U.S. workers used to be able to feed their families. But the 

                wages of low-skilled people have lagged behind inflation for two 

                decades. Welfare reform has moved more people into jobs that pay 

                too little to feed a family. Nearly 40 percent of all emergency 

                food recipients of America's Second Harvest, a nationwide food 

                bank network, come from homes in which at least one adult is working.</p>

              <p> &quot;We need to reestablish an economy in which all full-time workers 

                receive a livable income,&quot; says Bread for the World Institute's 

                report. </p>

              <h4>Hunger in the Developing World </h4>

              <p>Right now, one person in five suffers from persistent hunger 

                worldwide, compared to one in three 25 years ago. Some 791 million 

                hungry people live in the developing world. </p>

              <p>By region, South Asia contains 283.9 million hungry people; East 

                and Southeast Asia, 241.6 million; Sub-Saharan Africa, 179.6 million; 

                Latin America, 53.4 million; Near East and North Africa, 32.9 

                million. </p>

              <p>The absolutely worst conditions continue to exist in sub-Saharan 

                Africa, where one out of every three people is hungry or undernourished. 

              </p>

              <p>The causes of African hunger include: high government debt burdens, 

                inadequate funding for health and education, pervasive poverty, 

                poor agricultural productivity on fragile lands, weak government 

                institutions and the AIDS pandemic. </p>

              <p>Undernourishment has declined steeply in East and Southeast Asia 

                over the past 25 years. The Asian and Pacific regions still account 

                for nearly two-thirds of all undernourished people in the developing 

                world. </p>

              <p>The largest number of people who suffer nutritional deficiencies 

                live in South Asia, where poverty, discrimination against women, 

                unsafe water and poor sanitation contribute to poor health. More 

                than 50 percent of children under the age of 5 are stunted (i.e. 

                low height based on age and/or underweight) due to insufficient 

                food consumption and poor health conditions. </p>

              <p>Many countries of the former Soviet Union, Central Asia and Eastern 

                Europe undergoing the transition from centrally-planned to market-based 

                economies have experienced economic hardship and rising levels 

                of undernutrition during the 1990s. The report says some 22 million 

                undernourished people live in Russia and other Commonwealth of 

                Independent States (CIS), and 4 million in Eastern Europe. Poverty 

                has skyrocketed to 29 percent in Uzbekistan, 50 percent in Kazakhstan 

                and 76 percent in Krygystan. </p>

              <p>By 2020, one in four children under the age of five&#151;as many 

                as 135 million children&#151;will be chronically undernourished in 

                the developing world, compared to one in every three children 

                in 1995. </p>

              <h4>Ending Global Hunger</h4>

              <p> The World Food Summit proposed in 1996 that world undernutrition 

                nutrition be reduced 50 percent by 2015. The total cost would 

                be $60 billion over 15 years, or $4 billion per year in increased 

                spending.</p>

              <p> &quot;One of the best ways to provide food security in the developing 

                world is to assist small-scale farmers to become more productive,&quot; 

                says Mr. Al-Sultan, president of the International Fund for Agricultural 

                Development (IFAD). </p>

              <p>The Rome-based IFAD is a specialized United Nations agency with 

                a specific mandate to combat hunger and poverty by helping the 

                rural poor in the poorest regions of the world. IFAD helps them 

                increase their food production, raise their income and improve 

                their health, nutrition and education standards.</p>

              <p> For twenty years, IFAD has remained the only international institution 

                that focuses 100 percent of its resources on helping poor, rural 

                people grow more food, earn more money and work more effectively 

                as communities for better health, nutrition and education.</p>

              <p> &quot;The ultimate challenge is to identify sustainable agricultural 

                practices and policies that both enhance the natural resource 

                base and assist the farmer's family,&quot; Mr. Al-Sultan says.</p>

              <p> In addition to funds, hungry people need policy changes to help 

                them earn a living and have a voice in political decision making: 

              </p>

              <ul>

                <li> <i>Livelihood strategies</i> that assure people assess to 

                  adequate income and other resources to meet basic nutritional 

                  needs; </li>

                <li> <i>Social investment strategies</i>, such as education and 

                  health care, that help people provide for their own basic needs 

                  and contribute to the larger society; and </li>

                <li> <i>Empowerment strategies</i> that strengthen poor and hungry 

                  peoples' ability to influence decisions that affect their lives.</li>

              </ul>

              <p>&quot;The failure to end hunger has been the 20th century's greatest 

                moral blind spot,&quot; says Rev. Beckmann. &quot;Although people are hungry 

                because they are poor and political systems do not function properly; 

                because of wars or because people belong to oppressed ethnic and 

                racial groups, we do not have to end all these problems to end 

                hunger.&quot; </p>

              <p>From 1981 to 1992, the countries of East and Southeast Asia reduced 

                the number of undernourished people at the average rate of 12.4 

                million people per year, with approximately 34,000 people per 

                day moving out of hunger. Yet these remarkable gains were threatened 

                by authoritarian government, cronyism and corruption, which contributed 

                to Asia's financial crisis in 1997-98. The crisis pushed an estimated 

                200 million additional people into poverty, temporarily reversing 

                a decade's worth of progress against hunger. In Indonesia and 

                elsewhere, food riots and popular protests for political reforms 

                underscore the need for transparent, participatory government 

                institutions. </p>

              <p>To provide some perspective on the cost of tackling global hunger, 

                when the Y2K computer crisis emerged, the U.S. government saw 

                it as an emergency and spent more than $8 billion. U.S. corporations 

                spent $50 billion on the threat, and the world spent more than 

                $500 billion. In comparison, for just $5 billion a year domestically 

                and $1 billion internationally the US government could make a 

                visible difference in the real, immediate problem of hunger both 

                at home and around the world.</p>

                justice, Bread for the World is a Christian voice for ending hunger 

                in the new century. A nonpartisan citizens' movement of 44,000 

                people of faith, including 2,000 churches, BFW members lobby our 

                nation's decision-makers about legislation that addresses hunger. 

                Bread for the World Institute, a partner organization, engages 

                in research and education on policies related to hunger and development.
