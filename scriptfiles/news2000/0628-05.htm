- June 28 - Rep. Tony P. Hall, (D-Ohio)



is urging the U.S. Government to lift the holds on contracts for



water treatment and sanitation equipment -- and to give urgent



attention to 18 contracts that UNICEF has identified as priority



items.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Hall said,



"I share UNICEF's concerns about the profound effects of increasing



deterioration of Iraq's water supply and sanitation systems on its



children's health. The prime killer of children under five years of



age -- diarrhoeal diseases -- has reached epidemic proportions and



they now strike four times more often than they did in 1990.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Holds on contracts for the water and sanitation sector are a



prime reason for the increases in sickness and death," Hall wrote.



Of the 18 contracts, all but one hold was placed by the U.S.



Government. The contracts are for purification chemicals,



chlorinators, chemical dosing pumps, water tankers, and other



equipment.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"...I support the Administration's decision to maintain



sanctions on Iraq," he added. "However, in the absence of compelling



security information, I cannot in good conscience back a policy of



contract holds that inflicts so much suffering on innocent people."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Steps have been taken to assure dual-use items are not diverted,



Hall noted; on its projects, UNICEF follows the United Nations'



three-tier monitoring system to ensure equipment and supplies are



used as they are intended. "I trust that you will factor in the

significant improvement in safeguards," he wrote to Albright, "and

I



urge you to weigh your decision against the disease and death that



are the unavoidable result of not having safe drinking water and



minimum levels of sanitation.&quot;</font>
