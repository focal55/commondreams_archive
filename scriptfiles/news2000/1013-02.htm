- October 13 - Ralph Nader said today that health care in the U.S.

should be provided by a national health insurance program providing

comprehensive benefits to all Americans and funded directly by the

federal government under a “single-payer” system.  Already, one half of

health expenditures are taxpayer dollars including by Medicare, and

federal, state and local employee health plans.



<p>“Our country needs full Medicare for everyone with free choice of

doctors and hospital by patients,” Nader said. “Any health care payment

system should also stress prevention of disease and injuries.”



<p>Nader, the Green Party candidate for President, said massive savings

from a single-payer system would be more than enough to provide

universal coverage for the same amount as the nation pays now for an

inadequate health care system that leaves more than 45 million Americans

-- with 10 million added under the Clinton-Gore Administration -- with

no health care coverage.



<p>Under the current system, Nader said unnecessary and fraudulent billing,

administrative costs for health-care vendors and huge profits and

bloated salaries at large HMOs and other health care companies.  He

described the current system a “disgrace to our democracy.” “The U.S. is

the only western nation that does not provide health insurance coverage

for all its people.



<p>“The U.S. pays more per person for health care than any other country

in the world,” Nader said.  “Yet, according to the World Health

Organization, the U.S. is ranked 37th in the overall quality of health

care.”



<p>Nader said access to health care is distributed unequally among the rich

and poor and among racial groups.  Among whites, 11 percent lack health

insurance while 21 percent of African-Americans and 21 percent of

Asian-Americans are without insurance, along with 33 percent of

Hispanics. Young people (18 to 24 year olds) have an uninsured rate of

29 percent—a higher uninsured rate than any other age group.

<p>13 October 2000



<p>Universal Health Care



<p>The state of health care in the United States is a disgrace to our

democracy.  The United States spends more per person on health care than

any other country in the world, but the World Health Organization ranked

the U.S. 37th in the overall quality of health care that it provides.

We are the only industrialized country that lacks universal health

care.  More than 42 million Americans have no health insurance.



<p>Access to health care is distributed unequally among rich and poor, and

also among the races.  Among whites, 11% lack health insurance, already

a shocking number.  But 21% of African-Americans, 21% of Asians and 33%

of Hispanics lack health insurance.  This translates directly into

higher infant mortality and lower life expectancy.  Young people aged

18-24 have a higher uninsured rate than any other age group, with 29%

uninsured.



<p>In addition to leaving broad segments of the population uninsured or

under-insured, the U.S. health care system has many other important

faults that could be remedied by a system of universal coverage.  These

include serious gaps in coverage for:  prescription drugs and medical

supplies; dental, vision and hearing care; long-term care; mental health

care; preventive care for children; and treatment for substance abuse.



<p>Health care should be provided by a national health insurance program

providing comprehensive benefits to all Americans throughout their

lives, and funded directly by the federal government (known as a

"single-payer" system).  Under the current system, hundreds of billions

of dollars a year go into insurance company overhead, unnecessary and

fraudulent billing and administrative costs for health-care providers,

and huge profits and high salaries at large HMOs and other health-care

companies.  Studies show that savings from a single-payer system would

be more than enough to allow us to provide universal coverage for the

same amount that we are now paying for inadequate health care.



<p>We find persuasive a plan based on the "Physicians' Proposal" for a

national health program published by Physicians for a National Health

Program in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1989, and their

proposal for a national long-term care program published in the Journal

of the American Medical Association in 1991.  Under this plan:



<p>

<ul>

<li>Everyone would be included in a single, comprehensive public plan

covering all medically necessary services, including acute,

rehabilitative and long-term care, mental-health services, dental care,

prescription drugs and medical supplies.<br>

<br>



</li>

<li>Everyone would have access to personalized care with a local primary

care physician, and free choice of doctors at all times.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>

Health care providers would still be in the private sector, and the

health plan would provide for different payment schemes for health-care

providers, to minimize the disruption of the existing system.  The

payment schemes would be designed to prevent profit motives from

influencing physicians, so there would be no incentives to recommend too

much or too little care.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>

A transition fund would be established for those health-care

administrators and insurance-company employees whose jobs would be

eliminated due to the simplicity of the single-payer system.





</li>

</ul>

<p>Although we could provide universal, single-payer health insurance for

the same amount that we spend on health care now, we would need funding

to replace the portion now paid for by employers and individuals.  We

would do this through several mechanisms:

<p>

<ul>

<li>A small payroll tax (<4%) on employers.  The tax would represent a

large savings for employers who now pay health-insurance premiums for

their employees, but an additional cost for those who do not.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>

A small tax on stock and bond transactions (1/4 of 1% of transaction

value for both the buyer and the seller).  For long-term investors, this

tax would be negligible.  It would have the additional effect of

reducing short-term speculation and thus the volatility of the markets.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>

An additional income tax on the wealthiest 5% of Americans.  Other

Americans would pay no additional taxes, and would be free from

health-insurance premiums and from out-of-pocket spending for medically

necessary services.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>

Closing corporate tax loopholes to ensure that corporations pay their

fair share of taxes.



</li>

</ul>

<p>Providing universal health care can only be accomplished through a

single-payer system:  no country has ever achieved universal coverage

with private health insurance.  The time to act is now.
