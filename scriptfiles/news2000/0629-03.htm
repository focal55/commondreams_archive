- June 29 - The Sierra Club today applauded the campaign finance

     reform victory won by Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Joseph Lieberman

     (D-CT) and Russell Feingold (D-WI) today when the United States Senate

     voted to adopt their proposal to require disclosure of the

     contributions and expenditures by so-called "527" organizations.  The

     bill's passage occurred two days after the House of Representatives

     passed its 527 reform disclosure bill.

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Sierra Club congratulates Senators McCain, Lieberman and Feingold

     for winning the first battle in the long war for campaign finance

     reform," said Carl Pope, Sierra Club executive director.  "Today's

     vote broke the stranglehold against reform in the U.S. Senate.  While

     the 527 disclosure provision is just the first step toward

     comprehensive campaign finance reform, it's an important one.  The

     next critical step to reforming our shameful campaign finance system

     is for the Senate to pass the comprehensive McCain-Feingold bill and

     ban soft money contributions to political parties, which are expected

     to dwarf expenditures by 527 organizations.  We call on Sen. Majority

     Leader Trent Lott to promptly allow a free and fair vote on the

     comprehensive McCain-Feingold bill."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The McCain-Lieberman-Feingold disclosure bill would require

     organizations that conduct issue advocacy activities under Sec. 527 of

     the Internal Revenue Code to report on the contributions and

     expenditures of their programs.  Currently, organizations with 527's

     do not have to disclose the source of funds or spending when

     broadcasting issue-advocacy ads or undertaking other activities.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The Sierra Club strongly supports campaign finance reform, including

     the disclosure of 527 donors, the ban on soft money donations to

     political parties, and public financing of campaigns.  The Sierra Club

     successfully worked for House passage of the bill by Reps. Chris Shays

     (R-CT) and Marty Meehan (D-MA) to ban soft-money contributions to

     political parties and establish restrictions on issue advocacy

     efforts.  The Sierra Club also supported efforts by Rep. Lloyd Doggett

     (D-TX) to successfully pass the 527 disclosure bill in the House.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     While working towards reform, the Sierra Club is conducting

     issue-advocacy efforts under the existing rules.  The organization has

     a 527 and expects to spend $8 million in at least two dozen

     Congressional sites and the Presidential campaign this year.  The

     Sierra Club's Environmental Voter Education Campaign will educate the

     public about candidates' environmental records, and urge the public to

     ask their officials to take specific actions to support the

     environment.</font>
