- March 22 - A coalition of child advocates today asked Public Broadcasting System

(PBS) President Pat Mitchell to stop broadcasting the Teletubbies, a

television program marketed to children as young as twelve months,

because young children should play instead of watching television, and

fast food companies use the Teletubbies to market junk food.



<p>The letter to PBS President Pat Mitchell follows.



<p>Dear Ms. Mitchell:



	<p>Last year, the Burger King Corp. executed a licensing agreement with

the itsy bitsy Entertainment Co. to promote Teletubbies, a Public

Broadcasting Service (PBS) television series for toddlers.  According to

news accounts, the McDonald's Corp. will soon conduct a similar

promotion.



	<p>McDonalds and Burger King produce food laden with excess calories, fat

and sodium, such as hamburgers, french fries and soda pop. When PBS

allows Teletubbies -- one of its "Ready to Learn" programs for

preschoolers -- to partner with these companies, it is helping to market

junk food to very young children. 



	<p>According to Burger King, this partnership was a magnificent success. 

"Teletubbies was a great promo partner," says Cindy Syracuse, Burger

King's manager for youth and family marketing.



	 <p>That is good news for Burger King.  It is not good news for the

toddlers who are manipulated into eating unhealthy food.  Childhood

obesity has become a major problem in the United States.  The Journal of

the American Medical Association recently reported that the "United

States has experienced alarming increases in obesity among children and

adolescents."  A report from the American Academy of Pediatrics notes

that "[I]ncreased television use is documented to be a significant

factor leading to obesity."



	<p>The AAP report also states that increased TV viewing may lead to

decreased achievement in school.  It observes that "[T]ime spent with

media often displaces involvement in creative, active, or social

pursuits."  By marketing Teletubbies as educational for children as

young as one, PBS is leading parents to believe, mistakenly, that

watching TV is good for babies.  In fact, the AAP recommends that

children under two should not watch TV at all.  According to the AAP,	



	<p>"Pediatricians should urge parents to avoid television viewing for

children under the age of 2 years....research on early brain development

shows that babies and toddlers have a critical need for direct

interactions with parents and other significant care givers (eg, child

care providers) for healthy brain growth and the development of

appropriate social, emotional, and cognitive skills. Therefore, exposing

such young children to television programs should be discouraged."



	<p>Many parents trust PBS to provide high-quality educational programing. 

But Teletubbies was created for our youngest children, for whom watching

TV provides no known benefits and may cause harm.  PBS is abusing

parents' trust by encouraging children under two to become viewers. 

This is a bonanza for TV advertisers.  "If you own this child at an

early age, you can own this child for years to come," explained Mike

Searles, then-president of Kids-R-Us, a major children's clothing store.

"Companies are saying, ‘Hey, I want to own the kid younger and

younger.'"  It is troubling in the extreme that PBS would assist

advertisers in this exploitation.



	<p>Teletubbies appears to be a lucrative investment for PBS.  But the cost

-- to children and to PBS -- is too high.  By continuing to broadcast

Teletubbies in light of its partnership with the fast food industry and

the AAP's recommendation to keep young children away from TV, PBS is

compromising its educational mission, and violating the public trust. 

If PBS cares about the health and well-being of American children, it

should take Teletubbies off the air immediately.   We urge you to do so.



<p>Sincerely,
