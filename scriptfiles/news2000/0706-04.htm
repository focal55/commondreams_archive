- June 6 - The nonprofit



Clean Air Trust today awarded its clean air "Villain of the



Month" award for July to the Cinergy electric power holding



company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cinergy earned the dubious distinction by raising the specter of



brownouts related to cleanup of smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx)



pollution from its coal- burning plants in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana



after stalling cleanup for several years. In the process, Cinergy



appears to be trying to displace its cross-state rival, American



Electric Power, as the Midwest's most notorious polluter.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cinergy, which includes Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric (Ohio), Union



Light, Heat &amp; Power (Kentucky), Lawrenceburg Gas (Indiana) and

PSI



Energy (Indiana), cited the brownout threat after a federal appeals



court upheld a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency plan to require



a major NOx cleanup in 19 states, including those with Cinergy



plants.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Utilities will not be able to avoid taking power plants out of



service in the summer to do retrofits," said a Cinergy spokesman,



arguing that would lead to power shortages. The spokesman, according



to the Cincinnati Enquirer, charged that the EPA plan "had little to



do with pollution and more to do with economic development" in the



Northeast.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ironically, nearly three years ago Cinergy announced a



commitment to reduce its NOx by two-thirds. Its president and CEO,



James Rogers, pledged at the time to a "constructive, common-sense



approach" to deal with the regional smog problem. He added that the



company would achieve its goals "through a combination of power plant



modifications and emissions trading once a regional trading system

is



established."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since then, however, Cinergy has done little except fight



creation of the conditions that would have enabled it to meet its own



commitment. (Cinergy is part of an industry group that has sued to



block or delay the cleanup.) Had the company acted three years ago,



it would have been well on its way to meeting the required NOx



reductions and wouldn't have to be threatening to turn off the lights



next summer.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By contrast, American Electric Power, based in Columbus,



announced June 21 that it would install modern NOx controls on its



giant Gavin plant in southeast Ohio. AEP said the pollution controls



would be up and running by next summer. Significantly, AEP did not



threaten brownouts.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cinergy's reaction to the court decision was somewhat surprising



because the company had been trying to earn a more progressive



reputation by urging other power companies to consider cleanup of



multiple air pollutants. It's almost as if the thinkers there



decided to take the summer off.
