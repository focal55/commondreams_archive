- June 23 - "I witnessed one of the most heart-wrenching events imaginable last

night: state-sanctioned murder. The legal lynching of Gary Graham was one

of the most reprehensible things a state can do to one of its citizens.

I wept uncontrollably.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In the few moments he had before he was put to death, Gary Graham not

only continued to proclaim his innocence, but he challenged us all to end

this senseless, state-sanctioned&nbsp; slaughter we call capital punishment.

He said, 'Push the moratorium for all Black people.'&nbsp; We must take

his challenge and go even further. We must push the moratorium for ALL

people.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We have information proving that across the nation the death penalty

system is so judicially bankrupt that it would only be continued by a government

that is morally bankrupt. I meet people every day who are outraged by the

continued practice of capital punishment. Those who watch polls cannot

help but notice that support for the death penalty stands at its lowest

level in almost 20 years, and that support drops dramatically when life

in prison without the possibility of parole is an option. But leaders must

do more than measure public opinion, they must mold it.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"More jails aren't the answer. Bold leadership that imposes a moratorium

is the answer. The system is too fundamentally flawed to continue tinkering

around its edges with anything less than a moratorium. Congressman Jesse

Jackson Jr. is leading the call for a moratorium with his H.R. 4162, The

Accuracy In Judicial Administration Act of 2000 (AJA).&nbsp; The AJA calls

for a minimum 7-year national moratorium on all executions until all inmates

sitting on death row right now have a chance to explore potentially exculpatory

DNA and other evidence.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"But DNA evidence is no silver bullet. DNA does not racial profile,

police do. DNA does not abuse confessions out of suspects, police like

Commander Jon Burge do. DNA does not preemptively strike minorities from

the jury, prosecutors do. DNA does not cross-examine witnesses and challenge

circumstantial evidence, competent lawyers do. DNA cannot hire you a legal

'dream team,' defendants with money do. DNA does not test the ballistics

of a gun, an adequately-funded crime lab does. DNA does not have political

ambition, prosecutors do. DNA does not appoint boards of pardons and paroles,

governors do. DNA does not appoint federal judges, presidents do. DNA does

not have political aspirations

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Yes, DNA is very important, but it would not have helped Gary Graham.

Just

<br>

like it cannot help most people sitting on death row right now."&nbsp;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-"Why does H.R. 4162 call for a seven-year moratorium? The Death Penalty

Information Center reported that the average time between a capital conviction

and execution is eight years.&nbsp; The average time that innocent people

have spent on death row before proving their innocence is seven years.

In 1996, Congress passed the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty

Act (AEDPA), which effectively cut an inmate's rights to appeal a capital

conviction to four years. H.R. 4162 is the only bill that completely halts

executions nationwide.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"H.R. 4162 also uses the Voting Rights Act's proven mechanism for state

compliance with national law, allowing states to re-certify their death

penalty systems in a way that remains consistent with constitutional law

and federal policy.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The imposition of death must also be taken out of the hands of people

running for public office. That only creates state-sponsored murder that

leaves all of us twisting in political winds. Last night, George Bush followed

Bill Clinton's example. In 1992, Bill Clinton left the campaign trail to

execute mentally retarded Ricky Ray Rector. Yesterday, George Bush left

the campaign trail to execute Gary Graham. He has turned his state's death

row into an assembly line.&nbsp; If the Elian Gonzalez leadership model

is followed, Al Gore will certainly not be outdone, and the first federal

execution in 37 years will go forward on August 5th.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This madness must be stopped. We must all, on either side of the death

penalty issue, have the collective courage to do what must be done. We

must have a moratorium on the death penalty, and we must have it now.</font>
