- May 21 - The Clinton/Gore Administration, vowing to

overturn an environmental court victory that protects dolphins, has

appealed Judge Thelton Henderson's decision in "Brower v. Daley" to the

Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  If successful, the appeal would allow

weaker federal standards for the labeling of tuna as "Dolphin Safe".</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        David Phillips, Director of Earth Island Institute's International

Marine Mammal Project, stated: "Once again, President Clinton and Vice

President Gore are trying to mislead consumers and harm dolphins with a

phony 'Dolphin Safe' tuna label, all to placate a handful of foreign tuna

millionaires in the dubious name of free trade."</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        Judge Henderson, whose series of rulings in 1990, 1991, and 1992 in

an earlier Earth Island case helped save hundreds of thousands of dolphins

from dying in tuna nets, wrote in his April 11th decision:</font>

<p>



        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"(The Court) concludes...the Secretary acted contrary to the law

and abused his discretion when he triggered a change in the dolphin safe

label standard on the ground that he lacked sufficient evidence of

significant adverse impacts....Indeed it would flout the statutory scheme

to permit the Secretary to fail to conduct mandated research, and then

invoke a lack of evidence as a justification for removing a form of

protection for a depleted species, particularly given that the evidence

presently available to the Secretary is all suggestive of a significant

adverse impact."</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        The successful lawsuit, filed by Josh Floum, Esq., and Ariela

Freed, Esq., of Legal Strategies Group of Emeryville, CA, contended that

the U.S. Commerce Secretary's decision, which claimed that the chasing and

netting of millions of dolphins in tuna nets is not causing significant

adverse impacts on depleted dolphin populations, was arbitrary and

capricious, and illegally ignored research supplied by the Commerce

Department's own scientists.  Earth Island and other groups, who developed

the "Dolphin Safe" label in 1990, charged that the Clinton/Gore

Administration's weakening of U.S. dolphin protection laws to accommodate

tuna millionaires in Mexico and other countries in the name of free trade

would result in more dolphin deaths.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        Earth Island Institute, nine other environmental groups, and

87-year-old environmental activist David R. Brower filed the lawsuit last

August in U.S. Federal District Court to overturn the decision by the

government to weaken the "Dolphin Safe" label on American tuna cans.

Additional plaintiffs included biologist and dolphin activist Samuel

LaBudde, Humane Society of the United States, American Society for the

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Defenders of Wildlife, International

Wildlife Coalition, Animal Welfare Institute, Society for Animal Protective

Legislation, Animal Fund, Oceanic Society, and Environmental Solutions

International.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        Before the illegal finding by the Commerce Secretary, the "dolphin

safe" label could only be used for tuna caught without any chasing and

netting of dolphins.  Tuna fishermen in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP)

target dolphins because tuna often swim below dolphins.  More than 7

million dolphins have been drowned in tuna nets over the past 4 decades.

But since 1990 and the advent of the "dolphin safe" tuna program, dolphin

deaths have decreased by 97% in the ETP.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        However, on April 29th, 1999, U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley

ruled, contrary to all available scientific information, that chasing and

netting dolphins by the tuna industry does NOT cause significant adverse

impacts.  This action automatically weakened the standards by which tuna is

judged to be "dolphin safe", instead allowing chasing, harassing, netting,

injuring, and even killing of dolphins when catching tuna, so long as an

on-board observer claims he did not see dolphins killed outright or

"seriously injured."</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        Federal scientists have determined that dolphin populations in the

ETP are not recovering as expected, even with the dramatically lower

reported kills of recent years.  Harassment of dolphins by tuna fishermen

and problems arising from the consequent physiological stress (some dolphin

schools are chased and netted as often as three times in one day) are

likely factors which cause harm to dolphin health and reproduction.  Many

dolphins suffer injuries in the nets and die after release, but are not

counted by the on-board observer.  Mothers are separated from calves, and

undercounting may be occurring on board some Mexican tunaboats.</font>
