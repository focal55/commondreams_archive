- October 16 - As the presidential



race rounds into the home stretch, polling analysis released



today shows that clean air and water issues could be key to



moving Independent and undecided voters in what is expected to



be a photo-finish presidential race. While Independent and



undecided voters are relatively uninformed about the



distinctions between presidential nominees Vice President Al



Gore (D) and Texas Governor George W. Bush (R) on environmental



issues, they move away from Bush and toward Gore in significant



numbers when presented with each candidate's record.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the national poll commissioned by the League of



Conservation Voters (LCV) and conducted by Peter D. Hart



Research Associates, the issue of clean air and water is very



important to 74 percent of Independents, forming a swing block



of 14 percent of all voters. A strong majority of these clean



air and water Independents (60 percent) believe environmental



laws do not go far enough and should be strengthened, higher



than Independents in general (52 percent) and Democrats (49



percent).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"All signs in the presidential election say that we are in



for a photo finish," said pollster Peter Hart. "In an election



in which the candidates are looking for new toe holds, the



environment is likely to be a key issue in persuading two



constituencies-Independents and undecided voters. These groups



care intensely about the environment as an issue and when they



learn the positions of Al Gore and George W. Bush, they move



significantly away from George W. Bush and to Al Gore."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the poll, clean air and water is very or fairly



important to 86 percent of voters, rating just below education



(93 percent) and health care (89 percent). Although clean air



and water rated higher in importance than both the economy



(83 percent) and cutting taxes (71 percent), 37 percent of



voters said they did not know enough to distinguish between the



environmental positions of the two candidates. More importantly,



51 percent of Independents who say clean air and water are very



important are unable differentiate the environmental records of



Bush and Gore.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the outset of the survey, Gore led Bush by a 44 to 41



margin with 60 percent of voters saying they trusted Gore on



environmental issues and only 46 percent saying they trusted



Bush. After learning about the records of the candidates,



63 percent said they trusted Gore, while 42 percent said they



distrusted Bush on the environment. In the final head-to-head



match-up, Gore widened the margin, beating Bush by 47 percent to



39 percent. Most of the movement came from Independent and



undecided voters who are motivated by environmental concerns, in



particular clean air and water.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With three-quarters of Independent voters saying that clean



air and water are very important, the Gore campaign is



well-served to expose Governor Bush's polluting record in Texas



and to highlight the fact that Bush's 'polluter-friendly'



approach to clean air and water policy would jeopardize 30 years



of American environmental progress," said Deb Callahan, LCV



president. "When they know the facts about his poor



environmental record, Independent and undecided voters are



unwilling to risk voting for Bush."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the polling analysis, there is very little



change in how partisan Democrats and Republicans say they will



vote after hearing about the candidates' environmental



positions. However, Hart said that the poll reveals by moving



Independent and undecided voters "the environmental issue could



take Al Gore from a neck-and-neck race to a solid front-runner



position."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The national survey of 1,023 likely voters (including an



oversample of 225 voters in several battleground regions) was



conducted Sept. 13-17, 2000, by Peter D. Hart Research



Associates for the League of Conservation Voters. The margin of



error is plus-or-minus 3.5 percent for a sample this size and



higher for specific subgroups. Survey analysis and polling



questions can be found on-line at <a href="http://www.lcv.org/presidential/">www.lcv.org/presidential/</a>.
