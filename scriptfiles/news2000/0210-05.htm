- February 10 - The

          U.S. Justice Department has rejected a demand by six Republican

          senators to investigate Americans United for Separation of Church and

          State for alleged intimidation and harassment of voters.</font>          

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a

          letter dated Feb. 4 that arrived at Americans United's Washington

          office yesterday, Deputy Assistant Attorney General John C. Keeney

          wrote that the complaint against Americans United was deemed not

          worthy of a criminal investigation and said the matter has been

          dropped.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans

          United Executive Director Barry W. Lynn welcomed the complete

          exoneration but added that more needs to be done. &quot;Each one of

          those senators owes Americans United an apology,&quot; Lynn said.

          &quot;With absolutely no evidence, these six men asked the top law

          enforcement official in the land to undertake a criminal investigation

          of my organization. This grotesque abuse of power should alarm every

          American.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

          senators filed a formal complaint against Americans United last July,

          charging that the organization's efforts to educate houses of worship

          about the tax implications of intervening in partisan politics was a

          violation of federal statutes that criminalize activities designed to

          intimidate voters. Although they presented no compelling evidence of

          wrong-doing, the senators requested a criminal investigation of AU.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

          six--Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Paul Coverdell of Georgia, Jeff

          Sessions of Alabama, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Don Nickles of Oklahoma

          and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina--charged <a href="http://www.au.org/pr71999.htm">in

          a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno</a> that Americans United may

          have &quot;attempted to disenfranchise religious voters by

          intimidating people of faith into not participating in the political

          process.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

          senators were referring to projects undertaken by Americans United in

          1996 and 1998 during which the group sent educational materials to

          churches nationwide, advising them Christian Coalition &quot;voter

          guides&quot; are partisan material and that distributing them in

          church could result in revocation of tax-exempt status.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Helms

          and the others filed the complaint just a few weeks after Christian

          Coalition President Pat Robertson traveled to Washington to meet with

          the GOP Senate leadership last June to discuss campaign strategy for

          the year 2000. Americans United charged that the scheme to harass the

          organization was drafted then. (Two weeks after the meeting, the

          Coalition issued a statement applauding the senators' move.)</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the

          Justice Department rejected the overture. In the Feb. 4 letter to

          Lynn, Keeney wrote, &quot;[T]he two criminal statutes that were

          potentially involved...reach only threats of physical or economic harm

          that are communicated to voters to stimulate or deter them from

          registering to vote or voting in federal elections. They do not reach

          the mere expression of opinions concerning the possible tax

          ramifications to organizations that engage such activities. For that

          reason, we declined to initiate a criminal investigation of the matter

          about which the Senators had complained.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn

          said that Americans United will not be intimidated by Helms, his

          far-right Senate allies or the Religious Right. &quot;If the Christian

          Coalition and its political cronies thought they could harass and

          bully Americans United into dropping its efforts to educate churches

          about the perils of partisan political activity, they were

          wrong,&quot; Lynn said.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later

          this year, Americans United plans to announce the details of a

          national education campaign to remind churches to stay out of partisan

          politics and reject the Christian Coalition's duplicitous campaign

          materials.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With

          this full exoneration in hand, we will redouble our efforts during

          this election year,&quot; Lynn said.</font></p>
