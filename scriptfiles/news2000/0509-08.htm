<br>

Dear Sirs and Madams:<br>

<br>

On behalf of the members of our broad coalition of organizations

concerned with the privacy of citizens and consumers, and on behalf of

all consumers of financial services generally, we are writing in response

to confirmed reports that the several federal financial agencies may be

delaying the compliance date of important new rules designed to implement

the financial privacy provisions of Subtitle A of Title V of the

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA” or “the Act”) (Pub. L. No. 106-102,

codified at U.S.C. 6801 <u>et seq.</u>).<br>

<br>

As you know, our organizations and numerous others believe that the rules

imposed by the Act do not provide consumers with adequate protection

based on Fair Information Practices. We believe that companies should not

have the right to share or sell confidential customer information for

secondary purposes without informed opt-in consent. Nevertheless, we

strongly support on-time implementation of the Act’s rules effective

November 2000 as an important step toward our goal of achieving full

financial privacy protection for American consumers.<br>

<br>

Indeed, last week the President took the next step toward achieving our

shared goal when he proffered his financial privacy protection plan to

the Congress. The President’s plan would close some of the loopholes in

the Act and, importantly, establishes that all medical information and

some sensitive financial information should be protected by a requirement

of opt-in consent. The President’s position that the Act is too weak is

supported by many of your agencies and some of you have even testified to

that effect before the Congress.<br>

<br>

Therefore, we find it unacceptable that you are now suggesting that the

modest rules proposed by the Act would not be enforced until 15 months

from now, instead of by November 2000. We are unalterably opposed to this

proposal, which would allow financial institutions to fail to provide

consumers with any notice regarding the institution’s privacy policies

and practices. Further, this proposal would delay providing customers

their new opt-out rights to prevent having their financial information

transferred to certain nonaffiliated third parties.<br>

 <br>

We would note that the financial services industry has had ample notice

and time to prepare for these new regulations.&nbsp; Indeed, the industry

supported and argued for adoption of the Act that provides the statutory

basis for your rules, arguing against the stronger privacy protections

that a broadly bi-partisan group of legislators sought to enact either on

the House floor or during the conference on the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.

Following the enactment of the Act, the financial services industry

repeatedly has cited the existence of these new requirements, and of your

agencies’ proposed rules, in arguing against adoption of additional

financial protections&nbsp; including those recently proposed by the

President. In fact, as far back as November, Hjalma Johnson, the

President of the American Bankers Association, issued a news release

stating &quot;During the first 100 days of 2000, I would like to see

every bank in the country develop a formal privacy policy and make that

policy publicly available - 100 percent of banks in 100 days, beginning

January 1.&quot;<br>

<br>

We are hopeful that the&nbsp; financial industry’s plan to delay and

weaken these rules is not&nbsp; as successful with you as it has been

with some state legislatures. Despite strong support for enactment of new

privacy laws in several states, no state has yet taken advantage of the

Act’s provision allowing stronger state laws. In Washington State, for

example, a strong privacy proposal went down to defeat only because

industry convinced the legislature to “wait-and-see” how well the “tough”

new law would be implemented by Washington, DC. Meanwhile, their cohorts

in Washington, DC were apparently trying to convince you that they could

not possibly offer consumers either the privacy disclosures or the modest

right to opt-out of some third-party transactions by November 2000.<br>

<br>

The financial industry’s demands to delay the privacy requirements of

Gramm-Leach-Bliley are unacceptable and are not supported by the

record.<br>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*First, disclosure requirements are not new to the financial

industry. Virtually every consumer financial law imposes disclosure

requirements and the industry routinely complies with 180-day agency

requirements. Typically, as is certainly true of this act’s requirements,

the regulations mirror the statutory language to such an extent that the

true implementation period should be calculated from the date of passage,

not the date on which the rules are published.<br>

<br>

</font>

<dd>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*Second, since 1997 the Fair Credit Reporting Act

has required financial institutions to implement an opt-out system that

only applies to some, not all, information. It is disingenuous for the

industry to claim that they have no experience with applying opt-outs to

some, but not all, information transfers, since they have been doing it

already for three years.<br>

<br>



</font>

</dl>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will be asking the Congressional committees of jurisdiction, as

well as the bi-partisan Congressional Privacy Caucus, to examine the

recommendation that your agencies grant these massive financial

conglomerates a reprieve from rules they knew were coming and knew they

could comply with. At a time when consumers are demanding more privacy

protection, not less, it would be shocking if you endorsed this plan to

delay giving consumers enforceable privacy rights.<br>

<br>

Thank you for your consideration of our views in this matter. We look

forward to hearing from you.<br>
