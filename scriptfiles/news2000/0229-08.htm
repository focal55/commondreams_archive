- February 29 - The following is a



statement by Sarah Brady, of Handgun Control Inc., regarding



the Michigan grade school shooting:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today a six-year-old girl went to elementary school and



didn't come home. She was shot dead by a classmate, age 7,



who shouldn't have been able to get a gun but did, largely in



part because of our nation's weak gun laws continue to allow



children such easy access to firearms. We don't yet know where,

why or how the young shooter was able to get a handgun and bring



it to school, but we do know he didn't buy it at a mall toy



store with his allowance. Quite possibly the shooter found the



gun sitting in his own home; which is usually the case when



young children shoot others.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This horrible tragedy should send a clear message to lawmakers



in Michigan and around the country: they should quickly pass child



access prevention or 'safe storage' laws that make it a crime to



leave a loaded firearm where it is accessible by children.



Consider this: a 1997 study by the Journal of American Medical



Association found that state CAP laws save lives and reduce



unintentional deaths of children by firearms by an average of 23



percent. The study also demonstrated that these laws are



particularly effective in protecting children younger than ten."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today's shooting should also send an important message to



parents, especially those who own guns: that keeping a gun in the



home can be deadly. Sadly, tragic stories of accidental or



unintentional shootings from the careless storage of guns at home



are all too common. They happen every day. It happened only last



July in nearby Pontiac, Michigan, when a two-year-old boy was



killed as he and his three-year-old brother played with a gun in



their bedroom with their seven-month-old sister nearby.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"And lastly, the responsibility for shootings like these do not



stop at the hands of the gun owner. Why are that gun makers



manufacturing weapons that a six-year old child can fire? This



makes no rational sense. When will gun makers realize that they



bear a responsibility to make sure that their products do not mete



out preventable deaths, and that they do not warrant nor deserve



special protection from the law to avoid that burden? Instead of



safeguarding the gun makers, we should be childproofing the guns.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is another senseless tragedy which could have been



prevented. With such easy access to guns in our society and our



schoolyards turning deadlier, more and more parents are worried for



the safety of their children. That's why, on May 14, Mothers Day,



I am joining thousands of mothers, grandmothers, dads and concerned



citizens who are lending their voices to a growing movement - the



Million Mom March Across America - calling on Congress to pass



tougher gun control laws to help keep guns out of the hands of



children and criminals. We are united in our resolve to make sure



that tragedies, like the one today in Mount Morris Township,



Michigan, do not happen again. No mother should have to wait for



that six-year old at the door, only to be told she will never be



home again."

citizens' gun control lobbying organization. Based in Washington,



DC, HCI works to enact stronger federal, state and local gun



control laws, but does not seek to ban handguns. Founded in 1974,



HCI has more than 400,000 members nationwide and works with local



groups around the country to enact and protect reasonable gun



control laws. More information about HCI and its affiliated
