- April 25 - In a new analysis of costs of national missile defense

based on a report issued today by the Congressional Budget Office, Council

for a Livable World and the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers estimate

that the cost of the preferred Republican option of a layered defense would

total at least $120 billion through 2015.



<p>[The CBO report is available on their web page: <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/">http://www.cbo.gov/</a>]

	

<p>Many Republicans claim that the Clinton Administration's  proposed

land-based system is inadequate; instead, they prefer a defense that

includes land, sea, and space interceptors.  For example, they endorse

placing interceptors on Aegis ships, a plan they believe would be cheap and

quick.  Yet a 1999 Pentagon analysis estimated that this plan would cost

$14.5-$17.5 billion.

	

<p>In addition, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the cost of

space-based lasers would be $27.5 billion and space-based interceptors

$18.25 billion.  Total cost: $119.7 - $122.7 billion. 



<p>And the costs are likely to sky rocket still more.  John Isaacs, the

Council's president agreed: "If Americans are having sticker shock over the

Congressional Budget Office's new estimate that the Clinton program will

cost $60 billion, wait until they see what Republicans have in mind."

	<p>

Daryl Kimball, the Coalition's executive director, accused the Pentagon of

using low cost estimates to convince Congress to buy in, only to have the

price rise later on.  "It is time for the Pentagon to play it straight with

the American people; it is proposing a costly and little-tested technology

that is of dubious effectiveness," said Kimball.  Earlier this year, the

Pentagon discussed spending $12.7 billion on National Missile Defense over

the next six years.  Since that time, the cost estimates have been shooting

upwards.

	

<p>In an April 12, 2000 Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, Lieutenant

General Ronald Kadish, the director of the Ballistic Missile Defense

Organization, conceded that the numbers were changing: "So my view is that

it is not an attempt to misrepresent the cost of this program, but we have

to be precise in what question is being asked."

	

<p>Many Republican politicians have made it clear that if George W. Bush is

elected, they intend to push for a multi-layered national missile defense.

Just last week, 25 Republican Senators sent a letter to President Clinton

criticizing as inadequate the land-based missile defense system planned in

Alaska and North Dakota.

	

<p>The letter stated: "The [Administration] approach fails to permit the

deployment of other promising missile defense technologies — including

space-based sensors,...and additional interceptor basing modes, like Navy

systems and the Airborne Laser — that we believe are necessary to achieve a

fully effective defense against a full range of possible threats."



<p>If Republicans regain the White House, it will be full throttle towards

$120 billion and beyond.
