and Protection of Clean Air Act Benefits

- May 9 - The Bluewater Network announces today that a letter 

from 90 environmental groups has been sent to Congress to demand a complete ban 

on the use of the gasoline additive MTBE and all other ether-based oxygenates; 

payment of MTBE cleanup costs by the oil industry rather than taxpayers; and 

prevention of air quality backsliding through protecting the Clean Air Act's 

fuel oxygenate program or passing comparable renewable fuels legislation.</font>

<p></p>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which 

required areas with the worst ozone or smog problems to use two percent oxygen 

in gasoline, the oil industry sharply increased their use of the oxygen-bearing 

chemical methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). While other oxygenates such as 

ethanol can be used to meet this requirement, the oil industry's choice to use 

MTBE in 85 percent of reformulated gasoline has led to widespread contamination 

of the nation's water supplies. </font></p>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Even the MTBE from a single overturned automobile can contaminate 

75 million gallons of drinking water," said Russell Long, Executive Director of 

the Bluewater Network. "With extensive damage already, and cleanup costs 

projected in the billions, the only answer to this threat is a complete 

ban."</font></p>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are over a dozen bills now making their way through Congress 

that reduce or eliminate MTBE use. Many of these bills also give states the 

choice to opt out of the Clean Air Act's oxygen requirement, despite the fact 

that this federal requirement does not specify the use of any particular 

oxygenate, including MTBE. Ethanol is an alternative, renewable fuel oxygenate 

that provides air quality benefits like MTBE, but compared to MTBE or the toxic 

components of gasoline, poses very little threat to water quality. </font></p>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We can't stand by and allow the oil industry to use the MTBE 

problem as an excuse to gut important air quality protections," said Elisa 

Lynch, Clean Fuels Campaign Director for the Bluewater Network. "Bills that lift 

this key provision of the Clean Air Act will not only endanger public health and 

the environment, but open a Pandora's Box for other hostile changes to one of 

the nation's best environmental laws."</font></p>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The overwhelming majority of evidence suggests that the Clean Air 

Act's oxygen requirement has substantially reduced air pollution from vehicle 

emissions. States that opt out of this requirement will suffer worsening air 

quality in the very same areas where MTBE has devastated drinking water 

supplies. </font></p>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Preserving the oxygen content requirement or passing comparable 

renewable fuels legislation will also support the burgeoning biomass industry. 

Ethanol can be produced from biomass waste products such as rice straw, wood 

pulp, corn stover and other agricultural by-products. This provides a clean, 

renewable fuel that not only goes a long way towards protecting air and water 

quality, but combats global warming, reduces waste, and supports local economies 

and national energy security.</font></p>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Using locally-produced biomass ethanol is a win all around--for 

the environment and for the economy. In addition to cleaning up emissions from 

gasoline, it decreases environmental impacts from oil exploration and 

transportation, puts waste products to good use, is a self-sustaining national 

energy source, and supports local farm economies and communities," said Russell 

Long, Executive Director of the Bluewater Network.</font></p>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 90 groups signed onto the letter to Congress include a wide 

range of national and grassroots groups that look after the interests of the 

environment, public health and local communities. These include the Bluewater 

Network, Surfrider Foundation, Southern Organizing Committee, Washington 

Environmental Council, Water Keeper Alliance, New Jersey Environmental Lobby, 

Earth Island Institute, Ozone Action, and the Silicon Valley Toxics 

Coalition.</font></p>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 90 groups are also asking Congress to ban other ether-based 

fuel oxygenates--ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether 

(TAME) and diisopropyl ether (DIPE)--which are of equal concern for the nation's 

drinking water resources. These chemicals have physical characteristics very 

similar to MTBE, and are already in use by many refiners, despite the fact that 

they are essentially unstudied. It is known, however, that they have toxicity to 

animals that is similar to MTBE, and that they may be carcinogenic.</font></p>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We want to make sure we don't repeat the MTBE mistake. If we 

don't also ban all of the ether oxygenates, the MTBE ban could amount to a shell 

game on the part of the oil companies, not protection of water quality," said 

Brooke Coleman, spokesperson for the Bluewater Network. </font></p>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cleanup costs for MTBE contamination could run into the billions 

and take decades to accomplish. Since it was the industry's choice to use this 

dangerous chemical, environmental groups are also calling on Congress to pass 

legislation requiring that polluters, not taxpayers, pay to clean up MTBE water 

contamination.</font></p>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last month the American Chemical Society reported that a third of 

the nation's community water wells may already be contaminated with MTBE. 

MTBE--a possible carcinogen that causes water to smell and taste like 

turpentine--is extremely expensive and technically difficult to clean up once it 

gets into water.</font>
