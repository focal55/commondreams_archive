- July 13 - The Senate's rejection of an amendment offered by

Sen. Dick Durbin (D- Illinois) to the Defense Authorization bill leaves

most Republicans in the embarrassing position of endorsing national missile

defense whether or not it is adequately tested.  

<p>The Durbin amendment called for additional testing of the Clinton national

missile defense plan against decoys and countermeasures and the

resurrection of an independent panel to review the test results.

<p>According to John Isaacs, President of the Council for a Livable World,

"The 52 - 48 vote proves, once and for all, that Senate missile defense

proponents are ideologically committed to deploying a system whether or not

it works."

<p>The Senate's rejection of the Durbin amendment comes on the heels of a

failed national missile defense intercept test last Friday evening and

stands in stark contrast to charges by prominent scientists across the

country that the Pentagon's testing program is inadequate to deal with

countermeasures that countries may use to thwart the U.S. missile defense.

<p>"The Senate vote represents a 'what me worry' approach to defending our

country," Isaacs continued.  Isaacs noted that Senate Armed Services

Committee Chairman John Warner endorsed the Durbin amendment last evening

("We have said to him [Durbin] three times:  We accept the amendment.") and

then turned around to lead the charge against the provision.

<p>Isaacs pointed out the Republican opposition to increased testing of the

system ignores the warnings of experts even within the Pentagon.  Durbin

read into the Congressional Record a letter in which the director of

operational testing and evaluation, Philip Coyle, made clear his support

for additional testing.

<p>"The embarrassing test failure last weekend underscores the widespread

view that national missile defense is simply not ready for prime time,"

said Isaacs, "Unfortunately, the majority in the Senate does not share this

view."

<p>President Clinton is scheduled to make a decision on deployment later this

summer or fall.
