-  

October 2 - In April 1999, the



United Nations Humanitarian Panel issued a report based on their



assessment of the humanitarian situation in Iraq. The panel



concluded that "the gravity of the humanitarian situation of the



Iraqi people (was) indisputable and (could not) be overstated."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, members of End the Economic Sanctions Against



the Iraqi People-Valley Coalition will hold a peace march (5 p.m.)



and a vigil/performance piece (7 p.m.) at Trinity Cathedral in



Phoenix. Trinity Cathedral is located at 100 W. Roosevelt St.,



Phoenix.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Religious speakers participating in the candlelinght vigil



include: Monsignor Edward Ryle, director of the Arizona Catholic



Conference; Rabbi Albert Plotkin, rabbi emeritus of Temple Beth



Israel in Scottsdale; Deacon Veronica Ritson of Trinity Cathedral;



Rev. Mary Jacobs, Disciples of Christ; Stan Shantz, pastor of



Trinity Mennonite Church; Rev. Jo Ed Miller, Presbyterian Church



(U.S.A.); Imam Latif Al-Gafaji and Nasjid Al-Rousel. During the



solemn ceremony, a bell will ring every 10 minutes in remembrance



of an Iraqi who has died as a result of economic sanctions. Candles



will be lit as a singer sings a song of peace, hope and healing,



followed by a moment of silence.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A performance piece, We Think the Price is Worth It, will be



performed by Brophy and Xavier High School Justice Club members and



Scottsdale Community College dance students. The performance piece



is based on Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's statement to



Leslie Stahl during an interview on 60 Minutes. When Leslie Stahl



asked her if half a million dead children in Iraq was a price worth



paying, Albright replied that it was a difficult choice, but "we



think the price is worth it." Members of the End the Economic



Sanctions Against the Iraqi People-Valley Coalition disagree.</font>
