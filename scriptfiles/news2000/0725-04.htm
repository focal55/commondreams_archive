<br>

The Brennan Center is asking the court to order the North



Carolina Board of Elections to place the Green Party's Presidential



candidate Ralph Nader on the North Carolina ballot for the November



2000 general election. North Carolina's ballot access rules for



Presidential candidates are among the most restrictive in the nation.



As stated in the Center's brief, "...the defendants simply cannot



justify the high hurdles that have been imposed on minor party



candidates."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background:

<br>

Ralph Nader is currently the highest polling third party



or independent candidate for President in this election cycle



and has a name recognition factor of 91 percent with the American



people. With the national media's political attention now shifting



focus from Bush and Gore to candidates like Nader and Buchanan, the



Presidential campaign season for third-party and independent



candidates is just beginning. However, as far as North Carolina is



concerned, the season for qualifying for the ballot is already over.



Under North Carolina law, Nader had until June 15, 2000 to collect



51,324 signatures and have the signatures verified by the local



Elections Boards. In order to yield 50,000 some valid signatures, a



successful petition drive must aim to collect approximately



85,000 raw signatures, since not all collected signatures will



be valid. Relying largely on volunteer signature gatherers



as opposed to paid professionals, Nader was unable to meet the



tight deadline imposed by the North Carolina Board of Elections.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recognizing the unfair and unconstitutional burden North



Carolina's ballot access rules place on new or minor political



parties, the Brennan Center for Justice filed suit on May 15,



2000 to secure Nader a place on the North Carolina ballot.
