- March 23 - In a letter sent yesterday, Human Rights 

Watch and five other organizations asked the United Nations Security 

Council to take decisive steps to address the humanitarian emergency in 

Iraq. The letter urged member states to use the Iraq debate scheduled 

for this Friday, March 24, to address the crisis "in a thorough and 

transparent manner" and to give priority to fundamental humanitarian and 

human rights principles in the design and operation of the sanctions 

regime. 



                            </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Council should make Friday's meeting 

open and public," said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle 

East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, "and the U.S. 

should stop pretending that the sanctions have nothing to do with the 

dire public health crisis confronting millions of Iraqis." Megally also 

criticized the many "holds," which stop contracts without rejecting 

them, that the United States and the United Kingdom have placed on key 

Iraqi imports. The signatories of today's letter include Save the 

Children/UK and the Mennonite Central Committee, which have ongoing 

humanitarian aid programs in Iraq. 



 </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In early January, Human Rights Watch asked the Security Council to lift 

most restrictions on Iraq's non-military trade and investment while 

tightening controls on the country's ability to import weapons-related 

goods. The organization, citing its own extensive documentation of 

government responsibility for genocide and crimes against humanity, also 

called for the establishment of an international criminal tribunal to 

try top Iraqi leaders. 



 </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Security Council scheduled this Friday's meeting to discuss the 

Secretary-General's March 10 report on the oil-for-food program 

(S/2000/208). In that report the Secretary-General noted that an 

"excessive number of holds" continued to impede the relief program and 

regretted that the sanctions committee, made up of the Security Council 

member states, had not responded to his earlier request that it provide 

"written and explicit explanations" regarding holds within twenty-four 

hours (paragraphs 84 and 87). 



 </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Secretary-General's report cited as an example the hold on a harbor 

dredger for the port of Umm Qasr, Iraq's major port of entry, an item 

whose absence makes the offloading of vital food and spare parts slow 

and inefficient (paragraph 72). "This appears to be an instance where 

concern for potential dual use lacks balance and a sense of proportion," 

said Megally, "It makes a mockery of the Council's stated concern for 

the well-being of ordinary people." 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Holds on contracts in the water and sanitation and electric power 

sectors, the report said, have been a major factor impeding progress in 

the area of public health, where emergency conditions persist. The 

International Committee of the Red Cross, in a December 1999 report, 

said that the oil-for-food program "has not halted the collapse of the 

health system and the deterioration of water supplies, which together 

pose one of the gravest threats to the health and well being of the 

civilian population."
