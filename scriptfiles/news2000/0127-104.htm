<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SEATTLE  

- January 27 - In a second sweeping opinion, the federal 

district court of the Western District of Washington has ruled that the 

National Marine Fisheries Service is in continuing violation of the 

Endangered Species Act (ESA) in its management of the North Pacific 

groundfish fisheries, the largest fishery in the North America.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Tuesday, the Court ruled that the National Marine Fisheries Service has 

completely failed to consider the effects of its federally managed 

fisheries program on endangered Steller sea lions. This ruling follows an 

earlier decision under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) that 

the agency had been fishing without any understanding of the true impact of 

the fisheries on the environment. In order to comply with the ESA and NEPA, 

the agency must examine the individual and cumulative effects of the 

fisheries on the North Pacific ecosystem, and consider changes to the 

current fishery management regime.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Throughout the opinion, the Court noted that the agency has broken promises 

over the years and has utterly failed to meet the mandates of the 

Endangered Species Act, even failing to examine relevant and available data 

in its latest efforts to comply with the law. The opinion stated, "NMFS's 

analysis is admittedly incomplete and its conclusions inconclusive."</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"NMFS undermined its credibility with the Court in its ability to protect 

the endangered Steller sea lion," said Paul Clarke of Greenpeace. 

"Greenpeace has long been skeptical of NMFS's repeated concessions to the 

industrial trawl fleet; now the court has shown that we were not mistaken."</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The summary judgment came in a lawsuit brought by Earthjustice Legal 

Defense Fund and Trustees for Alaska on behalf of Greenpeace, American 

Oceans Campaign and the Sierra Club. The court rejected NMFS's attempt to 

dismiss the case and will require NMFS to complete the study of the North 

Pacific groundfish fishery to evaluate effects on the Steller sea lion, 

which was reclassified from 'threatened' to 'endangered' in 1997.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The trawl fleet has brought intense pressure on the agency to allow 

continued overexploitation of the North Pacific, despite the impacts to sea 

lions, harbor seals, and to the long-term health of the fisheries," said 

Janis Searles, an attorney with Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund in Alaska. 

"The ruling forces the Agency to finally evaluate what it will take to 

conserve the North Pacific ecosystem and maintain healthy fisheries that 

are sustainable."
