<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- January 26 - A new hard-hitting issue ad will begin airing on Wednesday, January 26 in seven states to remind voters of the role Republican moderates played in helping Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Senator Jesse Helms (NC) defeat the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) last October 13th.  Peace Action, a nationwide grassroots organization with over 50,000 active members, has vowed to fight for the CTBT by holding these politicians accountable.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This treaty, like all other major arms control measures of the nuclear age, should have been a bipartisan effort, but the process was railroaded by Senators Jesse Helms and Trent Lott," said Gordon Clark Executive Director of Peace Action.  Republican moderates like Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe (ME), Christopher Bond and John Ashcroft (MO), Spencer Abraham (MI), Pete Domenici (NM), Slade Gorton (WA), John Warner (VA), Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts (KS) are linked in the ads with Senator Helms for defeating the CTBT.  "We said in press conferences after the CTBT vote that we intend to highlight this vote by so-called moderate Republican senators, and make them continuously defend their actions to their constituents or change their position.  These ads are the first step in this process," said Clark.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 30-second ad begins with footage of a nuclear explosion countdown and pauses before a mushroom cloud explosion when the text "October 13, 1999," appears on the screen.  An announcer follows with; "Senator Jesse Helms killed a treaty to stop nuclear weapons tests.  And Senator ______ (senator's name varies with state) voted with him.  Every President since Eisenhower has known that nuclear weapons tests lead to arms races.  Our children deserve a safer world.  Tell Senator_______ (varies with state) to support a test ban now."  Images of Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Reagan are used to underline the bipartisan nature of arms control measures.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Peace Action, formerly SANE/Freeze, is moving aggressively into paid media strategies to influence policy makers.  "We are a serious grassroots organization, but our activists want us to be on the air to remind Congress not to vote against our children's future like they did last October," said Van Gosse, Organizing Director for Peace Action.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Background on Republican Arms Control Efforts<br>

</b>President Eisenhower made banning nuclear testing a national priority 40 years ago, and President Nixon initiated the historic START 1 and ABM treaties.  President Reagan was the first world leader to raise the possibility of abolishing nuclear weapons altogether, and negotiated landmark arms reductions with Mikhail Gorbachev; President Bush followed suit by taking our missiles in Europe off alert, the most dramatic step towards peace of the 1990s. According to numerous public opinion polls, the CTBT enjoys broad support by both Republicans and Democrats alike.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Now the Republicans, led by Helms, are repudiating this legacy, and we intend to remind genuinely moderate Republicans of this fact, and urge them to restore their Party's leadership in arms control," says Gordon Clark.  "Our message is simple: Don't let Jesse Helms hold U.S. foreign policy and a safer world hostage to his xenophobic and isolationist agenda."</font></p>
