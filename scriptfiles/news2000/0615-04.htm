- June 15 - Sierra Club Executive Director, Carl Pope, New York City Council Speaker,

Peter Vallone and New York City Council Member, A. Gifford Miller announced

today the introduction of landmark legislation into the City Council that will

protect endangered forests worldwide. The bill, which would apply to all City

projects, will curb the use of wood from globally threatened forests and provide

incentives to purchase wood certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)

and wood alternatives.  If passed, New York will be the first major city to

shift to green timber.

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"New York City is one of the largest municipal wood users in the country and

much of this wood comes from the most rare and important ancient forests in the

world," said Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director. Currently, New York City

uses large quantities of tropical rainforest timber in projects ranging from the

Coney Island boardwalk, to park benches in City Parks. Temperate rainforest wood

from the coast of British Columbia was used recently in the construction of a

bikeway/walkway in Riverside Park.

With forests from the US Northeast to the temperate rainforests of Canada under

siege from destructive logging practices, the Sierra Club and other

environmental groups are increasingly looking to consumer power to save forests.

 In the wake of protests from the Sierra Club and other groups, Home Depot

announced last August that it would stop purchasing old-growth and switch to FSC

certified wood.  New York City, with the largest municipal budget in the

country, is the next step in this effort to harness the market to save forests.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"New Yorkers are shocked when they discover that many of the city's park

benches, boardwalks and other structures are made from wood cut down from

rainforests," said Council Member Gifford Miller. "When so many alternatives

exist, there is simply no reason why New York City should be contributing to

global deforestation," he continued. "This legislation puts New York City in the

front of a growing consumer trend of using environmentally friendly building

materials," he added.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If Home Depot can do it, New York City can too," said Peter Vallone, Speaker of

the New York City Council. "We have a real opportunity to set a national

example, support the growing market for eco-certified wood and to get other

cities to follow suit," he added. "And, with New York State recently certifying

700,000 acres of its state lands, we will be closing the loop and supporting

forestry jobs right here in New York State," he said.
