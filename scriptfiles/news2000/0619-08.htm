- June 19 - Bianca Jagger,



member of Amnesty International USA's (AIUSA) Executive Director's



Leadership Council, delivered a letter of support for Gary Graham



to Governor George W. Bush's office this morning in an effort



to further dialogue about Graham's case.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter, co-signed by AIUSA Executive Director Dr. William F.



Schulz, implores the Governor and Gerald Garrett, Chairman of



the Texas Board of Pardons &amp; Paroles, to halt the execution



of Gary Graham. Graham is scheduled for lethal injection this



Thursday, June 22.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Since 1973, 87 people have been released from death row following



the emergence of evidence signifying their wrongful conviction,"



Jagger and Schulz wrote in the letter. "Contributing factors to



these wrongful convictions include: inadequate legal



representation, prosecutorial and police misconduct and the use of



unreliable witnesses. Governor Bush, you stated that you were



confident no innocent person had been executed in Texas. The case



of Gary Graham raises grave concern that a possibly innocent person



will be put to death." Numerous public figures added their names



to the letter, including Reverend Jesse Jackson, Susan Sarandon and



Tim Robbins, the Congressional Black Caucus, Edward Asner, former



New York Governor Mario Cuomo and Mike Farrell.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The case of Gary Graham, also known as Shaka Sankofa, has received



unprecedented media attention as officials, community leaders and



members of the public learn of serious doubts about his guilt.



Convicted of killing Bobby Lambert in 1981, Graham was denied the



right to adequate legal representation at his trial and was



convicted on the basis of one highly disputed eyewitness account.



His original trial lawyer failed to present extensive exculpatory,



forensic and ballistic evidence. Tests by the Houston Police



Department showed that the bullets that killed Lambert did not



match the gun found on Graham.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to questions about Graham's guilt, Amnesty



International is concerned about the execution of a juvenile



offender. Graham was only 17 years of age at the time the crime



was committed, making capital punishment a violation of



international law. Only six countries have executed juvenile



offenders in the last five years -- Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Iran,



Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the US.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Twenty-one of the 47 executions that have occurred in the US this



year took place in the state of Texas, which now accounts for 220



of the 645 prisoners put to death since the US resumed judicial



killing in 1976.
