- May 2 - For the third time this year, the nuclear industry was unsuccessful in its attempt to

pass the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2000 (S.1287). This afternoon, a critical

34 &quot;nay&quot; votes were registered &#151; enough to sustain the president&#146;s

veto of this irresponsible legislation.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Senate has once again refused to support the nuclear industry&#146;s request

for a bailout. By not overriding President Clinton&#146;s veto of the Yucca Mountain

legislation, the schedule for moving deadly nuclear waste from reactors across the country

to Nevada will not be recklessly speeded up. This bill willfully disregards the safety and

health of over 50 million Americans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This legislation was sponsored by Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska), the recipient of

over $18,000 from nuclear PACs last year. In addition, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,

the recipient of over $58,000 in nuclear PAC contributions last year, arranged on behalf

of the industry to keep the bill available for legislative action this year by getting it

recommitted to the committee. Although many senators are willing to risk the safety of

their constituents for campaign dollars, there are enough lawmakers who will stand up for

America and vote down this bill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill would allow temporary waste storage at Yucca Mountain as early as 2006, as

soon as the Department of Energy (DOE) receives a license to construct a repository. This

means the largest nuclear waste shipping campaign in the history of the world would be

launched &#151; with waste traveling through 43 states for 25 years, past the homes and

workplaces of 50 million Americans. In addition, the bill stipulates that the DOE begin

placing waste in the repository no later than 18 months after a construction permit is

granted. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yucca Mountain, located near Las Vegas, Nev., is the only site being considered by the

DOE as a &quot;permanent disposal&quot; site for highly radioactive nuclear waste. This

spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste is currently located at 77 sites across the

country and would have to be transported by truck or rail to Yucca Mountain if that site

is approved as a geologic repository. It is unfortunate that lawmakers have ignored the

risks of a catastrophic release of radiation in the event of a crash. We are encouraged by

the number of lawmakers who voted against the bill, however, and hold out hope that a veto

will be sustained.</font>
