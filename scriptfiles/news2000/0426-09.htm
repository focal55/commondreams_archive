- April 26 - Claiming that the American people "deserve

better," a potted plant, commonly known as "Ficus,"

formally announced its campaign this morning to

seek the Congressional seat in New Jersey's 11th

District as a write-in candidate on both the

Democrat and Republican Party ballots in the June

6 primary.



<p>"The United States Congress is full of babbling

idiots and bumbling morons," said Ficus

campaign strategist and filmmaker Michael Moore.

"Most run unopposed in their primaries and 95%

are re-elected every time in the general election.

What we get from these Congressmen-for-life is a

lot of hot air, a bunch of promises that are never

kept, problems like health care and education that

are never addressed, more taxes for a bigger

military when there are no wars, and a bigger

paycheck for Congress when they don't deserve it."



<p>Moore, in presenting the Ficus at a press

conference in the historic town square of

Morristown, New Jersey (site of George

Washington's military headquarters), also

announced that Ficuses in more than twenty other

Congressional districts around the country (see

list), where the incumbent faces little or no

opposition, are also entering the race.



<p>"Ficus Fever is sweeping the nation," said Moore.

"In a country where the majority no longer vote,

writing in Ficus will give the disenfranchised voter a

chance to cast a vote for "None of the Above!"



<p>Ficus will run as both a Democrat and a

Republican because, according to Moore, "There is

little difference between the two so-called parties."



<p>"Both the Democrat and Republican nominees for

President are for NAFTA, for the death penalty, for

increased military spending, against immediate

universal health care, against stringent gun control

that would ban handguns, and both looked like

pandering idiots regarding their exploitation of that

six-year old Cuban boy."



<p>"But, more important, both parties are beholden to

those who pay for their campaigns. Why should the

wealthy have two parties doing their bidding, and

the other 90% of Americans have no real

representation?"



<p>The Ficus will accept no campaign contributions.

All it needs is air, sunlight, and water.



<p>"And a little fertilizer," which Moore said the Ficus

"should find plenty of in Washington."



<p>Moore said that "all Ficuses running for Congress

across the country meet the Constitutional

qualifications: each Ficus is at least twenty-five

years old, each has been in the U.S. for at least

seven years, and each is a resident of the district

where it seeks election."



<p>A search of the official Ficus website -

<a href="http://www.Ficus2000.com">www.Ficus2000.com</a> - confirms that at least

twenty-one potted plants are running as write-in

candidates in states such as California, Illinois,

Pennsylvania, and Alabama.



<p>The Congressional seat in New Jersey's 11th

District, which covers Morris County and part of

Essex County - and is inhabited by the state's

highest income earners - is currently held by Rep.

Rodney Frelinghuysen, a three-term Republican,

and the thirteenth wealthiest member of Congress.

Frelinghuysen's father once held the same seat

and, since 1793, New Jersey has sent six

Frelinghuysens to Congress -- four to the U.S.

Senate and two to the House of Representatives.



<p>"We think it's time to point out to the Frelinghuysen

Family that we live in a democracy, not a dynasty. If

no credible human out of the district's 500,000

voters was willing to step forward and challenge

Mr. Frelinghuysen, at least the voters now have a

houseplant to give them a real choice on June 6."



<p>Moore said the Ficus will run under the slogans:

"FICUS: Because We Deserve Better"

and

"Put a Houseplant in the House - Vote Ficus."



<p>Anyone around the country who would like to

challenge their incumbent Congressman with a

potted plant is encouraged to contact Moore on the

<a href="http://www.Ficus2000.com">www.Ficus2000.com</a> web site.



<p>"The choice is simple - hot air or oxygen? I've seen

a lot of politicians lie, cheat, steal, and use

improper syntax. I have never met one who can

perform photosynthesis."
