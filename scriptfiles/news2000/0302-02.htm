- March 2 - A broad coalition of progressive and conservative organizations and

scholars asked Members of Congress, governors and others to protect children

from Channel One, an in-school marketing company. The coalition aims to

cut off advertising revenues for Channel One and to remove it from the

nation's public schools. The coalition sent letters to:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">•Members of the U.S. House and Senate Appropriations Committees, asking

them to eliminate all federal funding for Channel One;

<br>

•Governors, asking them to take all steps within their powers to remove

Channel One from their state's public schools;

<br>

•Channel One's advertisers, asking them to stop advertising on Channel

One;

<br>

•Members of the House Education Committee, asking them to hold hearings

on Channel One; and,

<br>

•Channel One's partners, asking them to sever their partnership with

Channel One.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following is the letter to U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman

Ted Stevens:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Chairman Stevens:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We ask that the Senate Committee on Appropriations stop all federal

funding of the controversial in-school marketing company called Channel

One.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Channel One, under the guise of a news show, delivers two minutes of

advertising each schoolday to a captive audience of approximately eight

million children in 12,000 schools.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Government is a major advertiser on Channel One. The Office

of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force

and the U.S. Marines advertise on Channel One.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Channel One is a big step in the wrong direction for children, schools

and taxpayers. It is deserving of your committee's attention for the following

reasons:

</font>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1. Channel One uses the compulsory attendance laws to force

children to watch ads</b>. Joel Babbit, then-president of Channel One,

explained in 1994 why advertisers like Channel One: "The biggest selling

point to advertisers [is] . . . we are forcing kids to watch two minutes

of commercials."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>2. Channel One wastes precious school time.</b> Channel One consumes

the equivalent of one instructional week of school time each school year,

including one full day watching ads.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>3. Channel One helps advertisers bypass parents to promote products

which parents may not approve of</b>, such as exorbitantly expensive athletic

sneakers and violent movies.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>4. Channel One wastes tax dollars spent on schools.</b> A 1998 study

by Max Sawicky and Alex Molnar, titled "The Hidden Costs of Channel One,"

concluded that Channel One's cost to taxpayers in lost class time is $1.8

billion per year.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>5. Channel One may harm children's health.</b> Channel One advertises

Snickers, Twix, M&amp;M's, Pepsi and other junk food to children in classrooms.

The <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> recently reported

that "Obesity is epidemic in the United States." Obesity is a major public

health problem. Given skyrocketing levels of childhood obesity and diabetes,

it is insanity for schools to encourage children to develop poor eating

habits.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>6. Channel One -- not parents or school boards -- decides its ads

and program content.

</b>Channel One violates the principle of local control

of education. Parents should be able to choose who may affect their children's

lives, not Channel One.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>7. Channel One undermines parents' efforts to teach positive values

to their children. </b>Channel One teaches a curriculum of materialism,

that buying is good, and will solve your problems, and that consumption

and self-gratification are the goals and ends of life.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>8. Channel One corrupts the integrity of public education and diminishes

the moral authority of schools and teachers.</b> In effect, Channel One

appropriates the authority of schools and teachers and transfers it to

advertisers for these controversial products. Schools implicitly endorse

the products that Channel One advertises.</font>

</blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The opposition to Channel One is large and growing. For example, in June,

1999, the Southern Baptist Convention, which represents the largest U.S.

Protestant denomination, passed a resolution urging community leaders to

remove Channel One from the schools.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge you to include provisions in the relevant appropriations bills

prohibiting ONDCP, the Navy, Air Force, Marines and all other federal government

entities from advertising on Channel One.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are grateful for your kind attention to this matter and look forward

to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. Please direct your response

to Mr. Jim Metrock of Obligation, Inc. at (205) 822-0080 or Mr. Gary Ruskin

of Commercial Alert at (202) 296-2787.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During a 12-month period of 1998-99, Channel One spent over $1 million

in an expensive, failed lobbying effort to prevent a congressional hearing

on how Channel One harms children, schools and taxpayers. The Channel One

hearing took place on May 20, 1999, before the U.S. Senate Committee on

Health Education, Labor and Pensions. Testimony from that hearing is available
