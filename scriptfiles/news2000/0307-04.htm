- March 7 - Environmentalists hailed a decision

        in U.S. District Court today upholding a US Forest Service decision to not offer new oil

        and gas leases along Montana&#146;s Rocky Mountain Front. Environmental groups had

        intervened on behalf of the government in the oil and gas industry&#146;s lawsuit. The

        court rejected industry&#146;s claim that the Forest Service violated a host of laws when

        it heeded the public&#146;s call to leave the pristine Rocky Mountain Front free of

        bulldozers, pipes, natural gas wells, and roads. </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lands in question extend from the Canadian border in north-central Montana

        and border Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall and Scapegoat Wilderness Areas. The

        decision applies to more than 750,000 acres in one of the least disturbed mountain

        ecosystems in the world. The area is home to more than 300 wildlife species, including

        such threatened and endangered species as grizzly bear, gray wolf, peregrine falcon, and

        bald eagle. The area is also home to numerous Native American cultural and religious

        sites.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dennis Tighe, president of the Montana Wilderness Association said, &quot;The

        public overwhelmingly supports keeping the Rocky Mountain Front as it is today&#151;a wild

        place, with healthy wildlife and significant cultural values. The public and the Forest

        Service made it crystal clear that this area is more valuable as a wildland than as an

        industrial natural gas field.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his decision, Judge Charles Lovell rejected industry&#146;s claim it had not

        been sufficiently warned that the Forest Service would consider the public&#146;s

        overwhelming opposition to industrial development in this unique wildland. The judge

        concluded that industry&#146;s arguments, &quot;&#133;boil down to semantics, and are

        disingenuous at best.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The decision protects the Front for future generations and at the same

        time preserves the jobs that depend on a pristine wilderness,&quot; said Chuck Blixrud, a

        longtime outfitter from Choteau, and president of the Professional Wilderness Outfitters

        Association.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jim Angell, an attorney for Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund who represented the

        coalition of Native American, conservation and recreation groups that intervened in the

        case, explained that, &quot;The court reaffirmed that national forests are not private

        fiefdoms of industry. The court recognized that the public must have a voice in how its

        national forests are managed.&quot;</font>
