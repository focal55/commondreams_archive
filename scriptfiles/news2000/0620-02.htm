Wellstone Warns That Bankruptcy ‘Reform’ Legislation Will Harm Seniors, Working Families</div>

- June 20 - At a media conference today with families who have found

themselves financially strapped by catastrophic medical bills,  job loss and

divorce, Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN), other members of Congress and experts on

bankruptcy law warned of the human toll of bankruptcy ‘reform’ legislation now

being considered by the Congress.  The media conference brought to light a side

of the bankruptcy debate that until recently has not received much attention:

The working families and people who would be hurt by this harsh so-called reform

legislation.



<p>“The bankruptcy system is a critical safety net for working families in this

country.  It is a difficult demoralizing process, but for nearly all who decide

to file, it means the difference between a financial disaster being temporary or

permanent.  The repercussions of tearing that safety net asunder will be

tremendous, but the authors of the bill remain deaf to the chorus of protest and

indignation that is beginning to swell as ordinary Americans and members of

Congress begin to understand that bankrupt Americans are much like themselves,

and that they are only one layoff, one medical bill, one predatory loan away

from joining the ranks,” Wellstone said.  



<p>Wellstone pointed out that the bill is being driven by yesterday’s ghosts.  The

peak increase in bankruptcy filings came and went in 1996.  In fact, there were

112,000 fewer bankruptcies in 1999 that there were in 1998 – a nearly 10%

decline.  Faced with this unhelpful fact, proponents of the legislation argued

that the absolute number of filers wasn’t the problem, the real crisis was the

high number of “abusive” filers.  However, it is clear that in the vast majority

of cases bankruptcy is a drastic step taken by families in desperate financial

circumstances and who are overburdened by debt. 



<p>“The bankruptcy bills passed by  House and Senate are ill-conceived, unjust, and

imbalanced.  They impose harsh penalties on families who file for bankruptcy in

good faith as a last resort, and address a ‘crisis’ that is self correcting. 

They reward the predatory and reckless lending by banks and credit card

companies which fed the crisis in the first place, and do  nothing to actually

prevent bankruptcy by promoting economic security in working families,” said

Wellstone.
