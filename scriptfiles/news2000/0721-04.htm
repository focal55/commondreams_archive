- July 21 - The Sierra Club condemned anti-environmental votes in

     both the House and Senate today, which passed appropriations bills

     loaded with anti-environmental riders.  These riders, which are

     important policy changes attached to must-pass legislation, threaten

     streams with cyanide-laced mining waste and actually kill an effort to

     require that federal contractors obey federal law.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     In the House, anti-environmentalists blocked a proposal to simply

     reaffirm that compliance with federal laws, including environmental

     law, is part of the test for determining whether a contractor can be

     eligible for federal contracts.  The amendment to the Treasury

     Appropriations bill was introduced by Representative Tom Davis (R-VA).

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's amazing that anyone would oppose the idea that federal

     contractors shouldn't break the law," said Ed Hopkins of Sierra Club's

     Environmental Quality Program.  "Who wants known abusers of

     environmental safety measures to receive our tax money?"

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     In the Senate, a rider struck a blow to environmental protection

     despite efforts to defeat it.  The rider undermines badly-needed

     environmental safeguards for the hardrock-mining industry.  Existing

     safeguards haven't kept pace with modern mining practices, which now

     involve massive open pits and the extensive use of toxic chemicals

     such as cyanide and sulfuric acid in the open environment.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     In a victory for the environment, Senator Baucus was successful in his

     effort to remove language from the bill that would have transferred

     public lands from a National Seashore and National Wildlife Refuge in

     North Carolina for a controversial, costly, and environmentally

     harmful jetty project in Oregon Inlet.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Despite the efforts of environmental leaders in the Senate, enemies

     of the environment chose to ignore public support for environmental

     protection and voted instead to help polluters and special interests,"

     said Melanie Griffin, Director of Sierra Club's Land Protection

     Program. "Members of Congress are attacking our nation's democratic

     process when they use riders to undermine environmental protection and

     circumvent public debate."</font>
