<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- March 2 - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is wasting billions of dollars on environmentally harmful projects, charges a new report by Taxpayers for Common Sense

        (TCS) and the National Wildlife Federation (NWF). These revelations come amid recent allegations that the Corps of Engineers tampered with economic studies to green-light new construction projects and has a secret plan to grow the agency's budget by billions of dollars.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, Troubled Waters: Congress, the Corps of Engineers, and Wasteful Water Projects names the 25 most wasteful water projects in the nation and identifies each project's main congressional supporters. Each of the 25 projects in the report is illustrative of problems with the Corps of Engineers approach and management and the need for drastic changes at the agency.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report highlights the biggest beach building boondoggles, waterways that seldom see a barge, and flood control projects that will actually increase flooding.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Taxpayers should be outraged by this flagrant misuse of their money," said Ralph

        DeGennaro, Executive Director, Taxpayers for Common Sense. "The Corps of Engineers seems to have a single-minded purpose -- to expand its empire on the back of the American taxpayer."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No federal agency has had - or will ever have - such a profound impact on the nation's floodplains, waterways and coastal areas as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  The ongoing construction and maintenance of dams, navigation channels, and flood control projects have dramatically altered the American landscape and  cost federal taxpayers billions of dollars.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Vast habitats are being threatened or destroyed because the Corps of Engineers is disregarding its environmental responsibility," said Mark Van

        Putten, President of the National Wildlife Federation. "The Army shouldn't be at war with Nature, it should be shaping a future where communities and their environments are in harmony."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Established in 1779, the Corps of Engineers spent much of the last two centuries building and deepening more than 140 ports and harbors, constructing the nation's 11,000 mile network of inland waterways, and building 8,500 miles of levees and floodwalls.  Most recently, the Corps has expanded its civil works program into coastal areas, spending funds to build seawalls and jetties and to pump sand on beaches. All too often, Corps of Engineers projects attempt to control nature, at the expense of people, communities and the environment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In late March the Clinton administration is scheduled to release its proposed 2000 Water Resources Development Act

        (WRDA), the authorization bill for the embattled Corps of Engineers. The debate over WRDA will pit powerful agricultural, shipping, and development interests against the real needs of local communities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report is released amid revelations that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a secret plan called the "Program Growth Initiative" to expand the agency's budget from $4 billion to $6.2 billion in five years. "The Corps of Engineers is out of control," continued

        DeGennaro. "Its ambition to feather its nest with the same tax dollars that could be used to reduce the national debt is outrageous."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "Program Growth Initiative" and Troubled Waters reveal that the Army Corps of Engineers is using financially and environmentally harmful projects to fill agency coffers.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Too often, the Corps of Engineers is willing to bypass federal law to approve environmentally destructive projects," continued Van

        Putten. "The country is already spending hundreds of millions of dollars to fix ecological problems created by past Corps mistakes."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amid recent revelations about the need for drastic changes at the Corps of Engineers, the report recommends to the Corps and to Congress a number of general reforms. Highlights of the reforms include:<br>

        </font></p>

<ul>

          

<li>

            

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Deauthorize the oldest, most fiscally and environmentally harmful projects;<br>

            </font>

</li>

<li>

            

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Place a moratorium on new beach sand-pumping projects;<br>

            </font>

</li>

<li>

            

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eliminate the most wasteful, low-volume inland waterways;<br>

            </font>

</li>

<li>

            

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stop mission creep by the Corps of Engineers and stick to core missions: navigation, flood damage reduction, and environmental restoration;<br>

            </font>

</li>

<li>

            

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Increase the local cost share for water projects and deny public funding for projects that have few beneficiaries.<br>

            </font>

</li>

</ul>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Halting the projects listed in this report would save federal taxpayers more than six billion dollars in coming years," concluded

        DeGennaro. This prescription for reforming the Corps will bring the agency's policies into line with taxpayer and environmental needs. Van Putten sums it up by saying, "The Corps needs to cut the fat, follow the rules and demand fair cost-sharing." The following projects are the most wasteful in the country:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/corpswatch/troubledwaters/projects/easternark.htm">#1. The Eastern Arkansas Irrigation Projects (Arkansas)</a> - The $275 million Grand Prairie Demonstration Project is the first of five Eastern Arkansas irrigation projects that together would cost over $1 billion and would jeopardize the White River National Wildlife Refuge.  The intended beneficiaries of the project are farmers, many of whom actually oppose the project and prefer cheaper alternatives.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/corpswatch/troubledwaters/projects/delaware.htm">#2. The Delaware River Deepening Project (Delaware, Pennsylvania) -</a> This plan to deepen 108 miles of the Delaware River up to the Port of Philadelphia would cost $311 million. The purported beneficiaries, oil refineries, have indicated they don't want the project. The plan would damage the banks of the Delaware River, and could contaminate area drinking water.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/corpswatch/troubledwaters/projects/uppermiss.htm">#3. Upper Mississippi River Lock Expansions (Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota) -</a> Driven by large agribusiness corporations, the Corps of Engineers is likely to recommend a $1.2 billion project to expand the Upper Mississippi River locks and dams system. The Corps was recently charged with using fraudulent studies after the project was deemed economically unjustified.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/corpswatch/troubledwaters/projects/sunflower-yazoo.htm">#4. Big Sunflower Dredging and Yazoo Pump (Mississippi) -</a> The $62 million Big Sunflower River maintenance project would dredge 104 miles of the Mississippi Delta to protect marginal farmland from seasonal floodwaters.  Sending the water downstream will require the $165 million Yazoo Pump to move the water into the Mississippi River. These projects would destroy rare bottomland hardwood forests without eliminating regional flooding problems.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/corpswatch/troubledwaters/projects/oregoninlet.htm">#5. Oregon Inlet (North Carolina) -</a> Two proposed jetties at the Oregon Inlet on North Carolina's coast will erode two nearby federally protected areas on the Outer Banks. The $108 million dollar project will be unnavigable up to 25% of the time, during the commercial fishing season.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/corpswatch/troubledwaters/projects/apalachicola.htm">#6. Apalachicola River Navigation (Florida, Georgia, Alabama) -</a> Federal taxpayers spend nearly $20 million each year to maintain the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee River System through Florida, Alabama and Georgia. The project accommodates fewer than two barges a day and destroys some of the region's most productive wetlands.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/corpswatch/troubledwaters/projects/snakeriver.htm">#7. Lower Snake River Navigation (Idaho, Washington, Oregon) -</a> In Idaho and Washington State, the Corps of Engineers spends $32 million per year relating to four dams on the Lower Snake River for barge navigation.  The dams threaten endangered salmon populations.  If the fish go extinct, taxpayers may be liable for potentially billions or tens of billions of dollars in compensation payments to Native American tribes.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/corpswatch/troubledwaters/projects/savannah.htm">#8. Savannah Harbor Expansion (Savannah, Georgia) -</a> In Savannah, Georgia, the Corps of Engineers is proposing to proceed with a $230 million port deepening that will damage a wildlife refuge and is justified on claims of traffic growth unparalleled in the port's history.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/corpswatch/troubledwaters/projects/newjersey.htm">#9. New Jersey Beach Replenishment (New Jersey) -</a> Federal taxpayers will pay hundreds of millions of dollars and ultimately billions of dollars to replenish 127 miles of the New Jersey coastline that encourages high-risk development and coastal sprawl in flood prone areas.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/corpswatch/troubledwaters/projects/longisland.htm">#10. Long Island Beach Replenishment (New York) -

        </a> The Corps is proposing multiple projects for the South shore of Long Island, including an "interim" project on Fire Island that initially will cost $53 million.  The final bill to federal taxpayers for the projects under consideration could ultimately exceed $600 million.  Experts warn that interfering with natural beaches is unlikely to prevent current erosion and flood problems.</font></p>
