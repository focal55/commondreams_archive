- June 8 - A Washington-based budget



watchdog group today praised efforts by Budget Committee Chairman



John Kasich (R-OH) for holding a hearing on corporate welfare and



efforts by Rep. Joseph Hoeffel (D-PA) to create a commission to



reduce corporate welfare.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In testimony before the House Budget Committee, Taxpayers for



Common Sense Legislative Director Jill Lancelot commended Chairman



Kasich's and Rep. Hoeffel's efforts to refocus the spotlight on



federal subsidies and tax breaks to corporate interests, which



total at least $125 billion annually, according to published



estimates.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As Congress begins to tackle the annual spending bills, it is



an apt time to bring to light corporate welfare abuses" said



Lancelot.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Hoeffel's effort, the Corporate Welfare Commission Act of



1999, seeks to reduce corporate welfare by identifying and



prioritizing needless or wasteful tax breaks and subsidies for



elimination. The bill, H.R. 3221, would establish a bi-partisan



commission charged with the task of making clear recommendations



for cuts.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is the first step in slaying the corporate welfare dragon



once and for all," continued Lancelot.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lancelot noted that most of the recipients of corporate welfare



are already industry leaders with little need for special handouts.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lancelot also argued that the benefits to taxpayers are



questionable.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lancelot cited the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), which was



created with the objective of furthering technological advancements



by awarding grants for research and development to corporations.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Though the program may have had a worthy objective, there is no



proof that ATP subsidies are essential for encouraging investment



in research and development," said Lancelot, adding that some



subsidy recipients are major corporations, whose research and



development programs would continue without government subsidies.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lancelot argued that corporate welfare has also left taxpayers



with unexpected costs. The 1872 Mining Law, for instance, entitles



the mining industry to take free of charge gold, silver, platinum,



and other precious metals on public lands.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the costs for cleaning up abandoned mines are more than the



allotted reclamation bonds provided by the mine owners. For



example, a cleanup in Montana cost the government $180 million, but



the responsible mining company only paid $60 million toward the



cleanup effort, according to the Department of the Interior.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Although Congress at various times has addressed the unfairness



of corporate welfare, unfortunately, very little has been done to



correct these abuses," concluded Lancelot. "A successful commission



would maintain its integrity with the least amount of political



influence on the decision making process."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">H.R. 3221 may be debated later this summer.

</font>
