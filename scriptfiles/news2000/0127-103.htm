<p>From Seattle... to Des Moines... to Manchester

<br>Round One: The Battle in Seattle

<br>Round Two: The People's Challenge, Des Moines, Iowa

<br>Round Three: The People's Agenda, Manchester, New Hampshire

<br>&nbsp;

<p>Following on the heels of the protests against the World Trade

Organization (WTO) in Seattle, an alliance of over 100 farm, labor



and environmental groups issued a "People's Challenge" to the



presidential candidates on January 12 in Des Moines, Iowa.

<p>The groups asked the candidates to articulate their plans on the

following issues:

<p>1) What is your plan for the management of our federal public

lands?

<br>

2) What is your plan for guaranteeing workers the freedom to

organize without retaliation from corporations, and to protect



workers who strike from being permanently replaced?

<br>

3) What is your plan for protecting small family farms and other

small businesses in this country?

<p>Despite promises from several of the candidates and their

campaigns to response to the "People's Challenge" by January19,



none did.

<p>Thursday morning, the groups will send a delegation of leaders,

led by David Brower, to engage the candidates on these and other



vital issues that are threatening the planet and our democracy.



They will then hold a press conference to share with the American



people what they have learned about the candidates' plans.

<p>--

<br>Details on the press conference:

<br>11:00 -- 11:30 am

<br>Sandy Point Discovery Center

<br>89 Depot Road

<br>Stratum, NH

<br>603-778-0015

<p>--

<br>

"Many of these same organizations and leaders shut down the WTO

in Seattle," said Jake Kreilick, Campaign Coordinator, National



Forest Protection Alliance. "We will not be ignored by the



presidential candidates. It is time for the candidates to listen



to the will of the people, not the corporations."

<br>

&nbsp;

<p>"The American people realize that he who pays the piper calls

the tune," said Nancy Snow, Executive Director of New Hampshire



Common Cause. "As campaign spending goes up, voter turnut goes



down. We're looking for leadership from our candidates to end this



cynical and destructive pattern that is threatening our democracy."

<p>"72 percent of New Hampshire voters and 76 percent of New

Englanders want our national forests protected from logging,



roadbuilding and other destructive practices," said John Demos, NE



Representative for the Amerian Lands Alliance and Heritage Forests



Campaign. "Where is the leadership from the candidates on these



issues?"

<p>Rick Katzenberg, New Hampshire Sierra Club stated, "New

Hampshire is not immune from the effects of global warming. 23 out



of the past 25 months, the temperature in New Hampshire has been



above normal. New Hampshire's citizens have a right to demand that

<br>

each of the candidates provide not just rhetoric, but a specific

plan to combat this monumental threat."

<br>

&nbsp;

<p>"The bottom line is that none of the candidates are considering

what the decisions we make cost the Earth," summarized David



Brower, the senior statesman of the American environmental



movement.
