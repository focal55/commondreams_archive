- October 19 - A solid majority



of Americans, 56 percent to 29 percent, say drilling in



the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not worth the risk it poses



to the environment for what experts estimate would amount to just



180 days of the U.S. oil supply, according to a poll released today



by The Wilderness Society and the Alaska Wilderness League.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After hearing balanced arguments on both sides of the issue a



nearly equal majority (55 percent) say they support President



Clinton declaring the coastal portion of the Arctic Refuge a



national monument, which would prevent oil exploration and drilling



there. Less than a quarter of those polled would strongly oppose



such a move by the president.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This poll demonstrates that the more people learn about the



Arctic Refuge and the more they hear the arguments for and against,



the stronger their support is for protecting the Arctic Refuge from



oil exploration and drilling and for designating it a national



monument," said Mark Mellman, president of the Mellman Group which



conducted the survey. "Despite the alarm being sounded about



energy prices, Americans do not want to risk oil drilling in the



fragile Arctic Refuge."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Alaska has



become a topic of intense debate in the last few months, as the oil



industry and supporters have stepped up efforts to proceed with oil



and gas development on the last five percent of Arctic coast



currently unavailable to the industry. Government studies indicate



that the amount of oil that could be economically recoverable might



be enough to provide the country with a 180-day supply at current



consumption rates.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Drilling for oil in the Arctic Refuge makes no more sense than



damming the Grand Canyon for its energy potential.," Allen E. Smith



said, Alaska Regional Director of The Wilderness Society. "Some



places are simply too special, and we need to pass them along to



future generations just like they are. Even if we tear up every



wilderness in America, we cannot change the reality that we have



only three percent of the world's oil reserves and use 25 percent



of the world's produced oil."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Arctic Refuge is home to polar and grizzly bears, wolves,



wolverines, and muskoxen, relics of the ice age. Millions of



migratory birds nest and stage their migrations along the coastal



portion north of the towering Brooks Range. A herd of caribou



that numbers 129,000 travels to the coastal plain of the Arctic



Refuge each spring to give birth. According to the US Fish and



Wildlife Service, the 19.5-million-acre Arctic Refuge has more



abundant and diverse wildlife than any conservation area in the



circumpolar north.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regardless of whether or how much oil the Arctic Refuge might



hold, recent history has shown that new production would have no



impact on oil prices or U.S. energy security. For example, when



Alaska's much larger Prudhoe Bay oil field came on line in 1977,



average U.S. gas prices doubled within four years. Experts say



that prices are set by global supply and demand factors, not the



presence or absence of an individual U.S. field. According to the



U.S. Geological Survey mean estimates, the Arctic Refuge may hold



3.2 billion barrels of oil-far less oil than Prudhoe Bay-and the



equivalent of less than six months' worth of U.S. oil consumption.



Still, oil companies and their supporters have attempted to



capitalize on recent gas and home heating oil prices to generate



pressure to allow drilling rigs onto the last stretch of America's



Arctic coast where they are prohibited.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bipartisan congressional legislation that would permanently



safeguard the coastal plain has more than 200 cosponsors, including



Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth (R-DE) and



Environment Committee Chairman Bob Smith (R-NH). However, Alaskan



members of Congress chair the committees that have jurisdiction



over such measures, and they have blocked all hearings and debate.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The American people want the Arctic Refuge protected for future



generations, not plundered for a speculative short-term fix of



oil," said Adam Kolton of the Alaska Wilderness League. "If the



oil lobbyists have a choke hold on congressional action, then



President Clinton should act to declare the area a national



monument."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Mellman Group conducted the survey of 1000 likely voters



from September 27 through October 8. The survey has a margin of



error of +/- 3.1 percent.
