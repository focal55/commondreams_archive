- June 20 - The D.C. to Denver Freedom Ride 2000 completed the first leg of its journey to the Green Party National Convention in Denver.  The Freedom Ride made stops Monday in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Riders helped Pennsylvania Greens kick-off two candidacies for state legislature, and East Liverpool, Ohio, where the Ride was hosted by activists fighting the WTI toxic waste  incinerator.  Riders saw first hand the devastation of the environment from the incinerator and heard reports of the health effects on East Liverpool's citizens.  In 1992, Al Gore promised to oppose the building of the incinerator but after recieving large donations from those set to profit from the incinerator the Clinton administration gave the go-ahead.  "No one who visits East Liverpool would consider voting for Al Gore," Freedom Rider Mike Livingston remarked.



<p>On Tuesday, the Freedom Ride took its message of connecting communities for environmental, economic, and social justice to Columbus, Ohio, where Riders participated in a press conference held by the Ohio Green P9news@wusatv.comarty at the Ohio Statehouse.  The Ohio Green Party declared its support for statehood for the District of Columbia.  The Ride then headed to Cincinnati to participate in a candlelight vigil for victims of human radiation experiments and attend a reception for the Ride hosted by Pink Paradigm, a Cincinnati Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender activist organization.



<p>Today, the Ride heads to Indiana and Illinois, and stops for the night in St. Louis, Missouri.



<p>The D.C. To Denver Freedom Ride 2000 is led by D.C. school board member Gail Dixon and other leaders of the D.C.

Statehood Green Party.  The caravan of social justice activists travels from  D.C. to Colorado June 19-23 to raise national awareness of the struggle for democracy in the District of Columbia and to show the D.C. group's solidarity with other types of oppressed communities.

	

<p>Other participants in the Freedom Ride include U.S. Senate candidate Tom Burrell (G-TN); D.C. convention delegates Mike Livingston, Scott McLarty, international observer Nika Greger of the German Green Party; convention delegates from New York, New Jersey and Tennessee; and approximately two dozen activists from the District, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York.

	

<p>The schedule for the Ride includes:



<p>JUNE 21: Visits in Indianapolis with Indiana Alliance for Democracy activists and Greens in St. Louis.



<p>JUNE 22: Meetings with Leonard Peltier Defense Committee activists in Leavenworth.



<p>JUNE 23: Arrival rally in Denver (8:30 a.m.) with the Association of State Green Parties; presidential candidate Jello Biafra is expected to speak. Press conference at noon, details TBA.

	

<p>The Freedom Ride will be filmed by amateur filmmaker Cynthia Delaroza for a future documentary, and participants will be available for interviews at the Convention at an exhibit about the Freedom Ride and the communities it visits.

	

<p>The convention is expected to add a D.C. statehood plank to the national Green platform, and to nominate Ralph Nader for president and Native American activist Winona LaDuke for vice president. Free speech activist Jello Biafra and community economics pioneer Steven Gaskin also seek the Green presidential nomination. 

	

<p>The D.C. Statehood Green Party, a member of the Association of State Green Parties, was established in November 1999 by the merger of the D.C. Statehood Party and the D.C. Green Party.
