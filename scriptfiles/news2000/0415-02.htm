- April 15 - Police harassment of nonviolent protestors escalated today 

with an early morning raid of protest headquarters, known as the "Convergence 

Space."  Approximately 200 activists were preparing for morning nonviolence 

trainings and eating breakfast when hundreds of District and federal officers 

arrived on the scene, and entered on the flimsy pretense of a fire inspection 

shortly after 8:30 a.m. 



<p>Police claimed that the warehouse was in violation of fire codes, but neither 

police nor fire officials provided warrants or other documentation, despite 

repeated requests from activists.  Protesters were forced to leave the 

site so quickly that many had to leave their personal effects inside, including 

one woman who was denied access to her insulin. Police seized the vast 

majority of puppets, banners and other materials being prepared for Sunday's 

protest.



<p>"I think that DC is now safe from puppets," said Katya Komisaruk, a lawyer 

who was on site.  "It took scores of police and fire officials to arrest 

all the protesters' art supplies.  Furthermore, it is clear that the police 

chose Saturday deliberately as the courts are closed and its unlikely we 

will get justice until Monday."



<p>ACLU lawyers are currently in discussion with city attorney Donna Maraski. 





<p>Deborah Thomas, head of the local Advisory Neighborhood Committee, said 

"Activists have been excellent neighbors and a positive presence in the 

community. There are other buildings in this neighborhood that should have 

been addressed decades ago."



<p>"This is clearly an attempt to handicap our protests – it's an outrageous 

example of police harassment," said Molly McCarthy of the Mobilization 

for Global Justice. "Tomorrow the police will see that our power does not 

stem from our puppets."
