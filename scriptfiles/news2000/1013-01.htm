<li>On Oct. 10, the Nader/LaDuke 2000 Campaign reached its goal of raising

$5 million. The money was raised entirely through individual

contributions, with an average donation of under $100. The campaign

accepts no political action committee contributions, and does not raise

soft money.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>

Nader Super Rallies are drawing the largest crowds of the presidential

campaign, far exceeding the events of all other candidates. In the past

six weeks, more than 12,000 people paid to hear Nader speak at the

Target Center in Minneapolis, 10,000 at the Key Arena in Seattle, 12,000

at the Fleet Center in Boston and more than 10,750 at the Portland, Ore.

Coliseum. On Tuesday night, October 10, at the Pavilion at the

University of Illinois in Chicago, Nader drew an overflow crowd of more

than 9,500.  The Madison Square Garden event is the sixth Super Rally of

the campaign.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>

Nader/LaDuke are on the ballot in 43 states and the District of

Columbia. The nationwide ballot-access effort involved the work of tens

of thousands of volunteers working on petition drives. Six lawsuits were

brought by the campaign to challenge onerous ballot-access laws crafted

by the two-party duopoly. Successful outcomes in West Virginia and

Illinois led to Nader’s inclusion on those state ballots.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>

Students for Nader are organizing on more than 850 campuses

nationwide. Students are finishing a massive voter registration drive

and are holding voter education events such as teach-ins, student

debates and protests against Nader’s exclusion from the presidential

debates.  An estimated 25,000 students are active in the campaign.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>

More than 100,000 people have signed an online petition demanding

Nader’s inclusion in the presidential debates. Polls show that 64

percent of the American public wants Nader to be included in the

debates. At the first presidential debate Oct. 3, Nader was denied

access to the debate viewing room, for which he had a ticket, and Nader

is filing a lawsuit against the Commission on Presidential Debates.

Another lawsuit filed by Nader challenging the corporate funding of the

Commission was heard in an expedited appeal by the First Circuit Court

of Appeals in Boston on Oct. 5.<br>

<br>

</li>

<li>

Ralph Nader is the only presidential candidate to have visited all 50

states. Nader continues to travel from state to state almost daily, and

he is drawing crowds in the thousands at rallies across the country as

his support grows and poll numbers continue to rise.
