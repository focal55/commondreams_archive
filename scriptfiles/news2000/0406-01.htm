- April 6 - Although the principles for electricity

deregulation legislation released today by a coalition of utilities, power marketers

and consumer groups are an improvement over the pending anti-consumer electricity

deregulation bills (H.R. 2944 and S. 2098), they would not provide enough protection for

electricity consumers, competitors, workers and the environment.

<p>The principles fall short of separating companies that generate and sell electricity

from those that own and control regulated transmission systems. As long as utility holding

companies are permitted<b> </b>to own transmission systems <i>and</i> power plants <i>and </i>power

marketing firms <i>and </i>non-utility businesses (such as appliance sale and repair

shops), new competitors will not be able to enter wholesale or retail electricity markets,

consumers will never see lower electricity prices, and non-utility businesses will

continue facing unfair competition from companies that harvest profits from captive

ratepayers.</p>



<p>The principles ignore the plight of utility workers. Federal legislation must keep

electricity flowing and protect workplace safety by ensuring that utility workers receive

appropriate training. Legislation should also ensure that workers will not lose their jobs

or benefits as utilities engage in a frenzy of mergers and power plant sales.</p>



<p>Further, the principles fail to endorse policies embraced by most public interest

organizations: a renewable portfolio standard (requiring a minimum amount of electricity

sold to be from renewable sources); a public benefit fund; and mandatory reductions in

air, land and water pollution from the electric power industry, the largest industrial

polluter in the nation.</p>



<p>The need for effective legislation is growing. Despite electricity deregulation laws in

about two dozen states, very few residential consumers are seeing lower electricity

prices. Utilities have become unregulated monopolies that stifle competition and enter

into new, non-utility businesses. Since 1990, more than 30 percent of the utility

workforce has been laid off, which has led to more service interruptions because fewer

workers are available to do needed maintenance and repairs. More pollution is spewing from

the nation&#146;s coal and nuclear power plants. We need a solid law, but if we follow

these principles, we will not fully solve our problems.
