- October 3 - If nuclear waste is transported through Ohio to Nevada for

permanent storage as proposed by the federal government, Cleveland could experience

serious threats to public health, the environment and the economy in the event of a crash

or a radiation leak, spokespeople for the Radioactive Roads and Rails campaign said today.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Labor, environmental and public interest groups held a news conference outside the

Federal Building to call attention to the dangers associated with transporting high-level

radioactive waste through Ohio. A public workshop on the topic of high-level waste

transportation will be held in the evening. The Radioactive Roads and Rails campaign will

hold events in Youngstown and Toledo later this week.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is preparing to recommend Yucca Mountain, located

near Las Vegas, Nev., as a &quot;permanent disposal site&quot; for high-level radioactive

waste generated by atomic weapons facilities and commercial nuclear reactors across the

country. A new analysis prepared by the Clark County Comprehensive Planning Division in

Nevada found that the waste would have to travel through 734 counties with a total

population of 138 million people. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If Congress caves in to the pressures of the nuclear power industry for a dump at

Yucca Mountain, it will initiate the largest nuclear transportation plan in history,&quot;

said Lisa Gue, policy analyst for Public Citizen. &quot;Seventy thousand metric tons of

high-level radioactive waste would be on the roads and rails of 43 states, passing the

homes, workplaces and schools of 50 million Americans, for at least 25 years while the

waste is being shipped to Nevada.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOE has refused to specify which routes would be used to ship waste. However, potential

routes evaluated in the draft Environmental Impact Statement include the Ohio Turnpike as

well as rail lines through the state.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seane Wise, a Chief Steward of UE Local 791 who works on the Ohio Turnpike in the

Cleveland area, drew attention to a resolution recently adopted by the national convention

of the United Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers of America/United Turnpike Workers.

The resolution, which was initiative of the Ohio Local 791, opposes the transportation of

high-level nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is an issue of worker safety, public health, and environmental

sustainability,&quot; Wise said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Participants at today&#146;s news conference, which took place against the backdrop of

a full-sized inflatable model of a nuclear waste transport cask, raised concerns about the

safety of radioactive waste transportation schemes. Gue explained that a 1987 study

sponsored by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission relied on computer modeling to predict

how the casks would perform in the event of an accident. But the casks themselves have

never been subjected to full-scale physical testing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We already know that accidents happen on our roads and railways,&quot; said Chris

Trepal, executive director of Earth Day Coalition. &quot;If shipments of nuclear waste

were involved, it&#146;s unclear whether hospital, fire and police personnel in Ohio would

have the capacity to respond effectively to a radiological emergency.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even without an accident, the transport casks containing nuclear waste would be

licensed to release low-level radiation at a rate of 10 millirems per hour from a distance

of 2 meters, routinely exposing people nearby the equivalent to a full-body X-ray. Workers

and other drivers on the Ohio Turnpike would be disproportionately affected.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Toll booth workers don&#146;t want the risks of low-level radiation imposed on

them each time a Yucca Mountain shipment enters and exits the turnpike,&quot; Wise said.

&quot;Turnpike maintenance personnel should not have to cope with potential radiological

accidents. In short, our union is sending the message that high-level nuclear waste does

not belong on the Ohio Turnpike.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Transportation hazards are not the only risks associated with the proposal to build a

permanent nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. Scientists in Nevada have pointed to

the danger of groundwater contamination if waste were to leak. Further, if an earthquake

were to hit, the storage canisters themselves could break open. The chance of an

earthquake occurring is far from remote; Nevada ranks third in the country for seismic

activity. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no safe way to dispose of nuclear waste,&quot; Gue said. &quot;A

repository at Yucca Mountain would have a regulatory period of 10,000 years, but the waste

will remain dangerously radioactive for much longer. No one can guarantee the integrity of

the storage casks so far into the future.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Said Margaux Shields of Ohio Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), &quot;The proposal

to build a permanent storage facility at Yucca Mountain does not address the nuclear waste

problem. It merely transfers the risk to the state of Nevada and communities like

Cleveland, which are unlucky enough to be located along transportation routes targeted for

the large-scale shipment of nuclear waste.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Julie Marini also spoke at today&#146;s press conference, representing the office of

Mayor Michael White. A written statement by U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) was

circulated. The event was held as part of the Radioactive Roads and Rails Campaign, which

is sponsored nationally by Public Citizen and the Nuclear Information and Resource Service

(NIRS), and in Ohio by UE Local 791 (Ohio Turnpike Workers), Earth Day Coalition and Ohio

PIRG (Public Interest Research Group).</font>
