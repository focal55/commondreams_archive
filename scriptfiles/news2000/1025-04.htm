- October 25 - Ralph Nader said today that he would welcome any 

          public discussion or debate with Vice-President Gore about environmental 

          issues, and the two candidates&#146; environmental records.  On Monday, 

          in response to a reporter&#146;s question about Nader&#146;s appeal 

          to voters concerned with theenvironment, Gore said: &#147;I&#146;ll 

          stack my record against anyone, including him.&#148;</font>

<p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#147;Al 

          Gore is suffering from election-year delusion,&#148; Mr. Nader told 

          reporters today, &#147;if he thinks his record on the environment is 

          anything to be proud of.  He should be held accountable by voters for 

          eight years of principles betrayed and promises broken.  A broad spectrum 

          of voters from diverse political persuasions are willing to stand for 

          stand environmental policies and against the corrupt corporate politics 

          of the two-party system.&#148;</font></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 

          this campaign, Nader has proposed the following environmental initiatives, 

          among others:</font></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          </span></span>Increasing the use of renewable energy such as solar, 

          wind, and biomass, and diminishing use of fossil fuels; ending subsidies 

          to the fossil fuel and nuclear power industries, in order to combat 

          global warming and air pollution.</font></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          </span></span>Withdrawing from the WTO and promptly re-negotiating global 

          trade treaties so that the new agreements raise global environmental 

          standards necessary to ensure to ensure protection of our air, water, 

          forests and climate.</font></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          </span></span>Ending commercial logging on US public lands and road-building 

          in all </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">60 

          million acres of large forest tracts remaining in the National Forest 

          system</font></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          </span></span>Improving air quality standards in urban areas, and passing 

          a Defense of the Environment Act that would make it more difficult for 

          anti-environmental riders to pass Congress</font></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          </span></span>Allowing our farmers to grow industrial hemp, that our 

          country now has to import, which will reduce the need for importing 

          oil, cutting down trees for paper, among many other benign environmental 

          uses from this versatile plant that Washington and Jefferson grew.</font></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 

          a recent letter to voters concerned with environmental issues, Nader 

          offered a detailed critique of Gore&#146;s environmental record, and 

          throughout the campaign has strongly criticized the Vice-President for 

          abandoning environmental principles.</font></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Keeping 

          in mind that Clinton handed the Administration&#146;s environmental 

          portfolio to Gore upon taking office, consider the following aspects 

          of the Administration record:</font></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          </span></span>The dangerous WTI hazardous waste incinerator was permitted 

          by the Gore EPA,  despite his promise in 1992 that it would not be granted.  

          The incinerator burns 60,000 tons of waste every year, making it one 

          of the largest incinerators of its type in the world.  Today, the incinerator, 

          which is located very near an elementary school, continues to pollute 

          the environment with dangerous emissions.  Gore claimed that the Bush 

          administration allowed the first  permit there, but Bush EPA head William 

          Reilly has said he was advised by the Gore staff during the transition 

          to go ahead with the trash burn permit.</font></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          </span></span>The Administration has not proposed any across the board 

          increase in </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">CAFE 

          standards, breaking a specific 1992 campaign promise.  Average fuel 

          efficiency is now down to 24.5 mpg, the lowest it has been seen since 

          1980.  This freeze in standards contributes to air pollution and global 

          warming, while costing consumers at the pump.</font></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          </span></span>Gore&#146;s support for clean alternative fuels has never 

          matched his promises. Instead of fighting for expanded solar energy 

          and conservation budgets, he and Clinton have  wasted around $1.5 billion 

          in a giveaway to GM, Ford and Chrysler to produce a fuel efficient &#147;Super 

          Car&#148; the prototype for which has not even been developed.  Taxpayer 

          subsidies to fossil fuel and atomic power companies also continue unabated.</font></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          </span></span>Gore agrees with George W. Bush on continuing the so-called 

          &#147;Clean </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Coal&#148; 

          subsidy, which wastes millions of dollars finding ways to clean up the 

          burning of domestic coal, such as &#147;sequestering&#148; the resultant 

          CO2 in sea beds or oil wells, while ignoring the environmental harm 

          that comes from mining.  Meanwhile, he has failed to take a stance on 

          mountaintop removal in West Virginia and in his home state of Tennessee.</font></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          </span></span>The Administration has allowed grazing, helicopter logging, 

          and even hard rock mining in National Monuments. Logging in National 

          Forests has continued under this &#147;earth-friendly&#148; administration:  

          Clinton-Gore signed the &#147;salvage rider&#148; that suspended the 

          Endangered Species Act despite claiming they opposed it.  Logging subsidies 

          in the Tongass (Alaska) and White River (Colorado) have been dutifully 

          given to timber companies, and one in six old-growth trees that existed 

          when they took office has been cut and sold for below cost.</font></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          </span></span>At the behest of the food industry, the Administration 

          signed away the Delaney </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Clause 

          which prohibited any cancer-causing pesticides or ingredients in food, 

          and</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">made a mockery 

          of advisory committee set up to help implement the badly misnamed Food 

          Quality Protection Act by allowing it to become controlled by agribusiness 

          corporations and pesticide manufacturers.</font></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          </span></span>Wetlands destruction is no longer properly tracked, and 

          the </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Administration 

          blocked the protection for functioning wetlands that are currently farmed, 

          even refusing to have the Army Corps of Engineers implement section 

          404 of the Clean Water Act, which would protect wetlands.  This shatters 

          a 1992 promise of Clinton and Gore&#146;s to &#147;base wetlands policy 

          on science rather than politics.&#148;</font></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          </span></span>As Ozone depletion continues, Gore has equivocated his 

          stated opposition to ozone-depleting chemicals, as the Administration 

          cut deals over the pesticide Methyl Bromide, and even encouraged DuPont 

          to slow its phase out of CFC production.</font></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

          </span></span>Prosecutions of environmental crimes have declined by 

          as much as 50% since the Bush Administration according to Public Employees 

          for Environmental Responsiblity, despite a specific promise from Clinton 

          and Gore to crack down on environmental crime.</font></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#147;If 

          this record demonstrates success, then what might constitute failure?&#148;  

          Nader asked.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#147;The best 

          case Al Gore has made to any environmentalist in this election year 

          is that he is not George W. Bush,&#148; Nader said today.  &#147;But 

          Gore cannot even attack George W. Bush&#146;s record in Texas with complete 

          credibility,&#148; Nader noted, &#147;since his administration has broken 

          its promise to clean up the maquiladoras that suffer from the rank environmental 

          problems along the Mexican border, problems that have only gotten much 

          worse since the passage of NAFTA.  The decaying corporatist Democratic 

          party has becoming very good at electing very bad republicans.&#148;</font>
