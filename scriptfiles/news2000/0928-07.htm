- September 28 - The following is a



statement by Gloria Feldt, president, Planned Parenthood Federation



of America:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The announcement today by the FDA approving the use and



distribution of mifepristone in the United States means that



women's personal reproductive decisions have taken another dramatic



step forward toward freedom from political intrusion.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have arrived at the end of a long, frustrating, and often



heart-rending wait, and the beginning of a new era. For the last



decade, news stories about the impending availability of



mifepristone triggered calls from countless women to Planned



Parenthood health centers nationwide asking for what they often



called "that French abortion pill."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At last, we can tell these women definitively and without



equivocation that:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Yes, this early option pill will be available to you.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Yes, Planned Parenthood centers will begin offering the



service very soon -- probably in about a month.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- And yes, science has prevailed over politics, and we as a



society will have the opportunity to get past the intrusions and



interference that have impeded women's access to this abortion



method all these years.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reproductive health care is an essential part of basic women's



health care. American women will finally have access to the same



reproductive health care options that our sisters in Europe have



had for all these years and that is simple justice.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mifepristone will give thousands of American women an expanded



choice by giving them a very safe additional option for very early



abortions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because many health care providers who do not now offer



abortions have said they would like to provide mifepristone, more



women in more places should soon be able to access this



non-surgical early option.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When access is geographically more widespread, women may be



afforded a higher degree of privacy, with less fear of harassment,



or violence.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mifepristone thus holds the potential to change the debate about



abortion, and in doing so, turn the tide against anti-choice



intimidation. For far too long, that kind of intrusion has



undermined women's access not only to abortion, but also to the



full range of reproductive health care services -- including family



planning services that prevent the need for abortion.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet even as we celebrate this victory for women and for



individual freedom, we must remember that a woman's right to choose



is still not secure.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anti-choice forces will continue to campaign against



mifepristone. They will continue to use intimidation, harassment,



violence, and political pressure to eliminate women's options.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Planned Parenthood has always been about choices. We will



continue to work every day to protect the right of women to make



their own responsible choices.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And on this particular day, we applaud the FDA's approval of



mifepristone and salute everyone involved for their courage in



bringing this important reproductive health advance to American



women.</font>
