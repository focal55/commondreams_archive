- May 2 - The Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, has

    dubbed May 3rd as &quot;Tax Freedom Day.&quot; It has chosen this date by calculating the

    percentage of national income that goes to taxes of all types (state, federal, and local).

    It then determines the date when the same percentage of the year has passed.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As several recent studies have shown, this method significantly overstates the tax

    burden for a typical family. Because the nation has a progressive tax structure, with

    wealthy households paying a larger portion of their income in taxes, the typical family

    actually faces a considerably lower tax rate than what the Tax Foundation estimates. A

    typical family in the middle of the income distribution pays approximately 28 percent of

    its income in taxes, which would place its &quot;Tax Freedom Day&quot; at approximately

    April 12th. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One way to make the tax system more progressive, and further move up a typical family's

    Tax Freedom Day, is to institute a tax on financial speculation such as the buying and

    selling of shares of stock, options, futures, and other financial instruments. Dean Baker,

    the co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, calculated that a modest

    tax of 0.25 percent on the sale or purchase of a share of stock, along with comparable

    taxes on other financial instruments, could raise more than $100 billion a year in

    revenue. This revenue could finance an income tax cut of 40 percent for a typical working

    family. A cut in the income tax of this magnitude would move up &quot;Tax Freedom

    Day&quot; for a typical family to the beginning of April, or possibly the end of March.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alternatively, the revenue from the tax could be used to fund important needs, such as

    national health care insurance, or the expansion of Head Start and Child Care. A proposed

    schedule for this tax, along with the revenue estimates, are included in his paper

    &quot;Taxing Financial Speculation: Shifting the Tax Burden From Wages to Wagers.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The paper also notes evidence from earlier studies that a small tax on financial

    transactions could play a stabilizing role in financial markets by reducing the volume of

    short-term speculation. This tax could have prevented some of the panic selling that has

    led to currency crises in East Asia, Russia, and Brazil in recent years. It could also

    slow the short-term trading which has led to large swings in the Nasdaq in recent months.

    In addition, by lessening the volume of trading, a speculation tax would reduce the amount

    of resources wasted in the operation of financial markets. </font></p>
