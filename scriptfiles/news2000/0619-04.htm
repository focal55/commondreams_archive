- June 19 - Ralph Nader joined by Susan Sarandon, Phil Donahue and others filed suit in Federal District Court in Boston today challenging Federal Election Commission regulations which allow corporations to sponsor Presidential debates.



<P>By allowing the expenditures, the Federal Election Commission is creating an unlawful exemption to the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) which prohibits corporate contributions and expenditures in connection with campaigns for federal office, the lawsuit said.



<P>"The Commission on Presidential Debates, incorporated by the national Democratic and Republican Parties, has solicited and received millions of dollars from for-profit corporations to help it stage its debates," the suit alleged.



<P>Anheuser-Busch and other corporations are paying for the debates this fall.  The first debate is scheduled for Boston on October 3.



<P>Included in the list of corporate sponsors in 1992 were AT&T, Atlantic Richfield, Ford Motor Company, IBM, J.P. Morgan & Co. and Philip Morris Companies, Inc.  In  1996, the debate sponsors included Anheuser-Busch, Lucent Technologies, Philip Morris Companies, Inc., Sara Lee Corporation and Sprint Corporation.



<P>"Unlawful corporate contributions to the debates corrupts the political process, tilts the electoral playing field sharply toward the Democratic and Republican parties, undermining third parties and limiting the choices of voters," Nader said.  "The debates should be forums for broadening the political dialogue and increasing the information that reaches the public, but these purposes are being defeated when corporations-whose executives and managers have consistently contributed to both major parties over the years-join hands with the Democratic and Republican parties to exclude alternative voices."
