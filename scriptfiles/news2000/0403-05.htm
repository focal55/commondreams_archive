- April 3 -The Sierra Club today decried Texas Governor George W. 

     Bush's proposal to weaken the Federal Superfund law for cleaning up 

     abandoned toxic waste sites.  Speaking in Pennsylvania today, Bush 

     endorsed weakening cleanup standards for contaminated industrial sites 

     known as "brownfields." 

     

     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Decontaminating and redeveloping brownfields is a crucial part of 

     revitalizing our cities-- and a major emerging environmental issue.  

     If properly decontaminated, brownfields can be converted from 

     abandoned industrial areas to clean areas for families or for new 

     industrial facilities; if improperly cleaned, they can expose the 

     families or workers to a plethora of poisons.  Unfortunately, Governor 

     George W. Bush wants to weaken existing federal standards which 

     protect communities from botched cleanups.

     

     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"George W. Bush's promises on the environment are as credible as Rick 

     Rockwell saying `til death do us part,'" said Carl Pope, Sierra Club 

     Executive Director.  "Today Gov. Bush is proposing weakening Superfund 

     protections; he's already proposed weakening the Clean Air Act.  It's 

     discouraging that he'd begin the 21st Century by proposing to weaken 

     environmental laws passed in the last century."

     

     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush proposed allowing industrial firms to build new facilities on 

     brownfields without meeting existing cleanup standards adequate to 

     fully protect human health and the environment.  The Bush proposals 

     would leave workers at these facilities vulnerable to health risks as 

     well as threatening contamination to groundwater and the environment. 

     Bush would have to weaken the Superfund law to accomplish this goal.  

     Last year, the Texas State Government proposed weakening the Clean Air 

     Act to remove sanctions for cities with unaddressed air pollution, 

     such as Dallas and Houston.

     

     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many Americans are now discovering the issue of brownfields, featured 

     in the movie, "Erin Brockovich."  In its years of work on the issue, 

     the Sierra Club has come across many families that are all too 

     familiar with the consequences of improper development:

     

     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· Chromosomal damage in children: In Midway Village, CA, housing was 

     built on a site owned by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in 1976.  Nearly 

     40 percent of the low-income residents have reported serious illnesses 

     from toxic waste left on the site. How was the contamination cleaned 

     up?  By paving over those areas that exceeded a certain contamination 

     standard.  This sometimes meant only paving over half a lawn; or one 

     home but not a neighbor's.  Many of the children have suffered 

     chromosomal damage.

     

     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· Mercury in bloodstreams: In Hoboken, NJ, apartments were built in an 

     aging industrial building, which once manufactured mercury vapor 

     lamps.  Despite its former use, the New Jersey Department of 

     Environmental 

     Protection never tested the building for mercury.  In 1995, a resident 

     laying new floors noticed pools of mercury in the subflooring and 

     crawl spaces. Mercury has a devastating effect on the central-nervous 

     system. For one four-year-old, this has resulted in unusually poor 

     eyesight for his age.

     

     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There are two ways to clean brownfields: a right way, and a quick, 

     cheap and dirty way," said Kathryn Hohman, Sierra Club Environmental 

     Quality Director.  "Vulnerable families or workers should be concerned 

     that Governor Bush is choosing the quick, cheap and dirty way, 

     ignoring common-sense safety and not informing the public."

     

     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Solutions: <br>

     Brownfields should be restored to productive use, this can reduce the 

     public's exposure to dangerous contaminants and make use of existing 

     infrastructure.  Good brownfields policies have the following 

     features:

     

     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*  Strong cleanup standards are essential to protect public health and 

     the environment.  The Sierra Club opposes policies that reduce cleanup 

     standards as a way to lower redevelopment costs.

     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*  Retaining federal enforcement authority is a vital safety net for 

     protecting public health.

     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*  Financial assistance and incentives are needed to help communities 

     assess, remediate and redevelop brownfields.

     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*  Strict liability standards must be retained to insure that those 

     responsible for contaminating brownfields are held accountable for the 

     cost of cleanup.

     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*  Substantive and early opportunities for the public to participate 

     in decisions about brownfields remediation and redevelopment are 

     essential.

     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*  Brownfields redevelopment should not disproportionately affect 

     racial minorities or persons of low income.
