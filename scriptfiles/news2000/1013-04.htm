<br>

Director of the Center for American and Jewish Studies at Baylor University 

in Texas and author of "Oh Jerusalem: The Contested Future of the Jewish 

Covenant," Ellis said today: "The escalation of the Israeli helicopter 

gunships firing into civilian areas is just appalling.... Justice would 

mean a shared real sovereignty of all of Jerusalem: political, economic, 

spiritual.... The Israelis are still occupying the Palestinians; the Oslo 

'peace process' is not one of justice and reconciliation -- it is a 

solidification of a victory by Israel over the Palestinians. Israel has 

taken just about all of Palestine. Those of the Abrahamic faiths who claim 

religious tradition should be aware of...the Jubilee tradition [which] 

calls for a periodic redistribution and return of land and wealth -- today, 

for Jews, this means a decision to share the land..."

<br>

Director of the Shalom Center and author of "Godwrestling -- Round 2," 

Waskow said today: "The violence has to stop, whether it's a lynch mob or a 

bombing. It is inconceivable to me that the two peoples aren't going to be 

living like conjoined twins for the rest of history, and if conjoined twins 

are not insane, they know that the health of the other one is crucial to 

the health of each one. Two conjoined twins who share a single, vital organ 

have to nurture each other and protect each other, and these two peoples 

share a single vital organ: the land."

<br>

Coordinator of Friends of Sabeel-North America, which supports an 

ecumenical center for liberation theology in Jerusalem, Barlow said: "One 

must express regret for all loss of life including the many Palestinians 

and the two Israeli soldiers who were killed yesterday. One also needs to 

ask what the soldiers were doing there."

<br>

Professor at the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown 

University, Haddad said today: "Much of this was set in motion with 

Clinton's criticism of Arafat for not signing the Camp David agreement. We 

should be sending food and medicine to the Palestinians -- not arming 

Israel. Israeli violence seems to be considered justifiable while 

Palestinian despair is being condemned. Palestinians are being told that 

they have to accept their situation, sign on the dotted line and be quiet. 

Israel seems to be expecting Arafat to kill his own people for them. Many 

in the U.S. think the Palestinians are attacking Israel, but the 

Palestinians are seeking liberation from a repressive occupation -- Israel 

has yet to fulfill withdrawals it has agreed to."

<br>

Professor of international relations at California State University and 

author of "The Newest Explosions of Terrorism," Grosscup said today: "The 

essential definition of 'terrorism' is that it is against innocents -- but 

the U.S. Navy patrolling the Mideast and enforcing the strangulating 

economic sanctions against Iraq doesn't really qualify it as 'innocent.' 

When a force has a global presence, people tend to resist its plans for 

domination, even if they have to kill themselves to strike just a minor 

blow. In skewed language, many refer to violent acts against Western 

military power as 'terrorism' while violent acts by Western powers are 

deemed humanitarian heroism."</font>
