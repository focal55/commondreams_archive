- July 11 - Dr. Gary Romalis, an



abortion provider in Vancouver, was stabbed today as he arrived at



work. "We are deeply shocked and dismayed at what has happened



today," said Vicki Saporta, executive director of the National



Abortion Federation (NAF). "It is abhorrent that once again,



individuals who oppose the right to choose have used violence to try



to advance their extreme anti-choice agenda."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Dr. Romalis is currently in stable condition. Our thoughts right



now are with him and his family and friends, as they try to cope with



this tragic attack."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NAF member physician Dr. Ellen Wiebe, also an abortion provider in



Vancouver, said, "This has been a terrible shock. I call on churches



to stop the rhetoric that helps mentally unstable people resort to



violence. I'm very glad that the government of British Columbia is



providing extra security to abortion providers."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"NAF has alerted our member clinics in the US and Canada about the



attack. Since the suspect fled the scene and is currently at-large,



we have contacted member clinics and advised them to take extra



security precautions. We have also been communicating with the FBI



and Department of Justice National Task Force on Violence Against



Abortion Providers. We urge Canadian law enforcement officials to do



everything possible to swiftly arrest this criminal and bring him to



justice."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Romalis is the first physician to be injured twice as a result



of anti-choice violence. In November 8, 1994, he was shot in the leg



and seriously wounded. James Charles Kopp, currently on the FBI's



Ten Most Wanted list, is wanted for questioning in connection with



that shooting, as well as the shootings of two other abortion



providers. Kopp was charged with the murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian,



an abortion provider in Buffalo, NY, and the shooting of Canadian



abortion provider Dr. Hugh Short. According to NAF's statistics,



today's attack represents the 17th attempted murder of an abortion



provider since 1991. Since 1993, a total of seven people have died



as a result of anti-choice violence.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Saporta will be in Vancouver with other NAF staff tomorrow morning



to offer assistance to NAF member clinics and law enforcement



officials in Vancouver.

The National Abortion Federation is the largest professional



association of abortion providers, with member clinics throughout the



U.S. and Canada. NAF is dedicated to ensuring that abortion remains



safe, legal and accessible.
