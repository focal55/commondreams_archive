<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- April 17 - The following was



released today by Physicians for Social Responsbility (PSR):

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elements in the DOE plan for compensating sick nuclear workers



include the offer of either $100,000 compensation or a comprehensive



package including health care costs, lost wages and job training.



However, it will be necessary to examine the plan in detail



before it is possible to assess its merits and demerits fully.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In particular, PSR is concerned to ensure that:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The DOE promise that the burden of proof on the cause of



illness should not fall on workers is actually kept;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Workers' families, and communities surrounding nuclear weapons



facilities are also be compensated for illness or the loss of loved



ones;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The plan is put into operation immediately. Workers, their



families and others are suffering now, and need all the assistance



they can get immediately. The $17 million allocated in FY2001 to fund



the plan is clearly inadequate to allow this.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The new Occupational Illness Compensation Office considers all



worker claims fairly and without bias. DOE has promised they will now



be the workers advocate but have to act to prove this claim. Truly



independent physicians should assess each case, and the burden of



proof should be with the government to prove a case bogus.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PSR will remain vigilant. DOE has an appalling record in treatment



of its workers over 50 years. This announcement of a major change in



DOE policy will have to be verified in practice. Independent scrutiny



of DOE actions in implementing the plan through the coming years will



be essential. PSR, whose authoritative and ground-breaking



publication Dead Reckoning first brought this terrible legacy of



nuclear weapons production to public notice, is uniquely placed to



scrutinize DOE and will continue to monitor activities closely,



bringing any backsliding to public attention. PSR will also push for



the extension of this scheme to all affected communities, and for



recognition of the fundamental problem that nuclear weapons



production is a threat to public health. PSR will continue its work



to bring an end to nuclear weapons production, and for their early



abolition.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"DOE plan is a step in the right direction," said Kimberly



Roberts, PSR Program Associate. "Nuclear weapons workers, and their



families need help urgently. Communities living around polluted DOE



plants are not yet included in the plan. DOE has made a good start,



it should work with Congress to get the job finished."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PSR is also concerned that DOE regards this issue as a past



problem that can be solved once and for all. In fact, while nuclear



weapons production continues, the pollution of workers, communities



and the environment continues. It is unlikely that this plan can



function for only 3-4 years as DOE envisage, and then be scaled down



drastically.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is not a problem that will just go away," said Robert K.



Musil, Ph.D., executive director of PSR. "The only cure for this



sickness is prevention, which means the end of nuclear weapons



production."</font>
