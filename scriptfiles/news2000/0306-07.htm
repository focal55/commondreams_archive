- March 6 - Today, a



prestigious panel of environmental and social justice leaders will



convene a national town hall meeting in Sacramento to highlight



growing threats to the planet, the citizenry and our democracy.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Falling on the eve of the pivotal California presidential



primary -- and following on the heels of the protests in Seattle



against the anti-democratic World Trade Organization and its



assault on workers, farmers and the environment -- The Peoples'



National Town Hall Meeting will provide citizens with a forum to



address the most pressing issues of our time. The Peoples' Forum is



being organized to highlight issues of concern to millions of



Americans not currently being addressed by the major presidential



candidates.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Included among the issues to be addressed by the panel will be



workers rights, environmental protection, campaign finance reform,



food safety and basic human rights.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"America and the planet are at a crossraods," said Tom Weis of



the National Forest Protection Alliance, one of the organizers of



the event. "We can either continue down our current path of



environmental and human destruction, or we can chart a new course



predicated on democratic values, compassion, sustainability and



equal rights for all."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the panelists will be David Brower, the dean of the



American environmental movement, and 90-year-old great-grandmother



Doris "Granny D" Haddock, who just completed a historic walk across



the country crusading for campaign finance reform.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The presidential candidates don't yet fully understand what



happened in Seattle," explained Brower. "But they will. That



was a turning point in our nation's history. We are embarked in a



struggle to take back our democracy, one step at a time."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Granny D" summarized the spirit of the event by saying, "In



this generation, the fate of our natural environment, and of our



democratic environment will be decided. Only great leadership, and



great love, can get us through the times ahead. We must all take



our part in this great drama. It is more than politics; it is a



struggle of the soul, and it is exquisitely personal to each of



us."
