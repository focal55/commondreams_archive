- July 18 - According to



Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), residents of Washington



could experience a wide range of increased health risks as a result



of climate change. These threats are outlined in "Death by Degrees:



The Health Threats of Climate Change in Washington," a new 35-page



report released today at a press briefing in Seattle. Press



briefings are also scheduled tomorrow in Richland and Spokane.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Climate change is expected to bring more extreme weather events



to Washington, a state that is already above average in the number

of



presidentially-declared weather disasters. More frequent and severe



floods could cause injuries, spread illness through contaminated



water and destroy property. Severe flooding in Washington in



February 1996 killed three and caused an estimated $800 million in



damages. The January 1997 landslide in Snohomish County brought



down more than 100,000 cubic meters of earth, swept five cars of a



passing freight train into Puget Sound and killed a family of four.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Warmer summer temperatures could worsen air pollution by



increasing concentrations of ground-level ozone and other



pollutants that exacerbate asthma and other respiratory diseases.



Warmer ocean temperatures could increase bacterial contamination of



shellfish. Longer summers could increase the incidence of Lyme



disease and other insect-borne diseases. Earlier snowmelts and



higher temperatures could also cause more summertime droughts, such



as the drought of 1999, threatening agricultural production,



compromising water quality and impairing hydroelectric power



generation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We have just ended the hottest decade on record," said Dr.



Robert K. Musil, executive director of PSR, a nonprofit



organization representing 16,000 health professionals nationwide.



"The death rate for asthma has tripled over the past 20 years.

Decisive action is needed now to protect human health. The number



one priority is to reduce the burning of fossil fuels, especially



by coal-burning power plants and automobiles."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report lays out specific opportunities for personal and



political actions needed to achieve this goal. The report on



Washington is the sixth report in a planned series of 18

state-specific reports in which PSR describes the effects that



rising world temperatures may have on local communities. Free



copies of the report are available to the public through the PSR



national office, 202-898-0150, ext. 228 or online at



<a href="http://www.psr.org/washington">www.psr.org/washington</a>.
