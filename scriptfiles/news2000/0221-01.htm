<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 21 - Announcing his bid today for the Green Party

nomination for President, Ralph Nader promised to

campaign actively and "send a message across the

country."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a statement at a news conference at the Madison Hotel,

a few blocks from the White House, Nader, one of the most

respected political figures in America, stated that he

will campaign on "fundamental issues -- democracy,

concentrated corporate power and the excessive

disparities of wealth."  Invoking the message of last

year's Seattle demonstrations against the WTO, Nader

introduced an extensive blue-green agenda that pointed to

core labor standards and environmental safeguards as

central issues in his campaign.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In 1996 I stood for election, this year I'm running,"

Nader said. "The American people deserve a debate on

corporate globalization and its damage to democracy."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Addressing concerns regarding Nader's potential impact in

November, Nader's advisors claim that his campaign will

help turn out the vote and could assist the Democrats in

taking back Congress.  In the 1996 election, more

potential voters didn't vote than did.  A serious Nader

campaign could bring independent and new voters to the

polls, energizing the 18-to-30-year-old voters and others

who have traditionally not turned out to vote.  But there

are those in the Democratic Party who do not relish the

prospect of having to debate Nader or deal with the

issues raised by his progressive-populist campaign.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pointing out the impact of "big money, big influence"

politics on Washington, Nader distributed a fifteen page

statement on how to revitalize democracy.  Nader said

that "concentrated corporate power is on a collision

course with democracy".



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1996, in the Green Party's first presidential

campaign, Nader received nearly 700,000 votes and

finished in fourth place, although limiting his campaign

spending to under $5000.  In 2000, the Nader campaign

intends to raise $5 million dollars.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On March 7th in California, initial polls have indicated

that Nader could receive a significant block of votes in

the state's open primary.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Connecticut native, Nader is a Harvard-trained lawyer

who has a four decade record in consumer and public

interest law and activism.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Green Party is holding its national Nominating

Convention in Denver at the Renaissance Hotel, June

24-25.  One of approximately 80 Green parties

internationally, the US Green Party platform focuses on

environmental protection, economic justice, grassroots

democracy and nonviolence.
