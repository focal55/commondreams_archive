- June 26 - The

          U.S. Supreme Court today ordered a lower federal court to reconsider

          its ruling permitting certain types of officially sanctioned

          &quot;student-led&quot; prayer in Alabama public schools.</font>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans

          United for Separation of Church and State, which cosponsored the case

          along with the Alabama ACLU, hailed the court's action.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Public

          schools are not Sunday schools, and students should not be compelled

          to participate in religious worship against their will,&quot; said the

          Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &quot;The

          federal appeals court clearly misconstrued the law, and we're glad the

          Supreme Court has intervened.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This

          is a victory for church-state separation,&quot; Lynn continued.

          &quot;We're confident that the days of coercive prayer in Alabama

          public schools are now numbered.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

          case, <i>Chandler v. Siegelman</i>, was filed in 1996 by Michael

          Chandler and his son Jesse. The Chandlers objected to

          school-sanctioned Christian prayer, Bible distribution, religiously

          based student assemblies and other sectarian activities in DeKalb

          County public schools.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In

          the fall of 1997, U.S. District Judge Ira DeMent struck down the

          activities in the DeKalb schools, declaring that they violated

          church-state separation. However, portions of his ruling were later

          overturned by the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and

          &quot;student-led&quot; religious activities were permitted.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today

          the Supreme Court ordered the appellate court to take another look at

          its verdict. The high court said the Alabama ruling should be

          reconsidered in light of a

          decision June 19 in a separate case dealing with coercive

          &quot;student-led&quot; prayer at public school football games in

          Texas. The justices held that majority rule on prayer at Texas public

          schools is unconstitutional.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AU's

          Lynn said today's action by the Supreme Court in the Alabama case is a

          step in the right direction. &quot;Promoting prayer, Bible reading and

          Christianity is not the job of the public schools,&quot; said Lynn.

          &quot;We have churches for that.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Continued

          Lynn, &quot;Public schools must serve students from many different

          religious backgrounds. To protect everyone's rights, it's important

          that the schools remain neutral on religious questions.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

          high court's action in the Alabama case was another defeat for TV

          preacher Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ).

          The ACLJ's Jay Sekulow helped defend the DeKalb County School

          District's prayer policies. (Sekulow also represented the losing side

          in the Texas football prayer case.)</font></p>
