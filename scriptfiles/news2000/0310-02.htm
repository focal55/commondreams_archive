- March 10 - Nearly three-quarters



of a century after science teacher John Scopes was found guilty



of breaking Tennessee law for teaching evolution, most Americans



have a strong opinion about what should be taught in America's



science classes.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a new nationwide poll on the subject, conducted by DYG



Inc., the polling firm headed by Daniel Yankelovich, and commissioned



by People For the American Way Foundation, 83 percent of Americans



say Darwin's theory of evolution belongs in the nation's science



classes.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the public dispute is most often portrayed as an "either-or"



choice -- evolution vs. creation -- most Americans don't see it that



way, the poll shows. About 70 percent of Americans don't see



any conflict at all between the two explanations for how life



came to be. The majority of the public clearly does not buy



the notion put forward by the creationists that you must choose



between the Bible and evolution.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most Americans see evolution as scientific theory and creation



as a matter of belief, and believe that the two are not mutually



exclusive. While they want schools to acknowledge that many people



have religious beliefs concerning the beginning of life, they do not



want evolution to be replaced by creationism, nor do they want the



two taught side-by-side as equal but competing scientific theories.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"To put it simply, this poll shows that most Americans believe



that God created evolution," said Ralph G. Neas, president of



People For the American Way Foundation (PFAWF), which commissioned



the poll in the wake of public outcry over last year's decision



by the Kansas Board of Education to drop evolution from its



statewide science standards.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unlike previous polls that touch on the dispute over evolution vs.



creationism, this one focused exclusively on this topic, producing

an



in-depth, nationwide look, for the first time, at how Americans see



both subjects and how they want schools to handle them. Many



Americans say schools should teach about creationism, but only a



small fraction (less than 3 in 10) want it to be taught about in



science class as science, either alongside evolution (13 percent)



or exclusively, in its place (16 percent).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Earlier polls have really only scratched the surface of this very



complex and nuanced issue," said Daniel Yankelovich, president of the



polling firm DYG Inc. "Three or four survey items are not enough to



understand how the public really thinks about evolution and



creationism in the classroom. We developed an entire, comprehensive



survey to exploring the numerous and critically important facets



involved in public opinion on this issue."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the majority of Americans favoring evolution, 20 percent



say schools should teach only evolution, with no mention of



creationism; 17 percent say schools should teach only evolution



in science class, but would permit religious explanations for



the origins of humankind to be covered in another, non-science



class; and 29 percent would allow creationism to be discussed



along with evolution in science class, but it should be made



clear that evolution is scientific theory while creationism



is a belief, not science.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The public is clearly not supportive of attempts by a small,



extreme minority to force their religious beliefs into science



classrooms either as "Creation Science," (which almost half of



Americans have never heard of) or by stripping the teaching of



evolution from the curriculum. The poll shows that the majority of



Americans (60 percent) reject the Kansas Board of Education's



1999 decision to delete Evolution from its state science standards.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"One of the most remarkable things this poll shows us is



that, with this kind of broad public support, there shouldn't



be any controversy at all about teaching evolution," said Neas.



"The fact that there is a debate shows us how effective a very



small but very vocal group has been in imposing their views



on our schools."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The poll should also be a warning to public officials and



schools," Neas continued. "If they cave in to pressure to eliminate



evolution or to force creationism into the science classroom, they



will be acting against the views and wishes of most Americans."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The polling was carried out by DYG Inc., the opinion research



firm founded and still headed by Daniel Yankelovich and Madelyn



Hochstein. PFAWF's purpose in commissioning the poll was to



inform the public debate over the issue by letting the American



people's views be known and understood.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In all the media debate over the Kansas Board's decision to drop



evolution, the one missing ingredient was what the people thought,"



said Neas. "We conducted this poll to complete the picture."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Evolution vs. creation is a perennial hot topic, one that is sure



to heat up in Kansas again with state education board elections on



the horizon and half of the seats up for grabs. Recent disputes over



a textbook disclaimer in Oklahoma and a charter school that wanted

to



teach creationism in Rochester, N.Y., are just a few recent



examples of the perpetually simmering debate started when Charles



Darwin published his revolutionary theory a century and a half



ago.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When it comes to how schools should handle what has been portrayed



as a conflict between evolution and creation, the public agrees on

a



number of basic principles, although they haven't formulated a



detailed idea of precisely how schools can resolve the matter in



practice. There is broad agreement that schools should acknowledge



that some people have creationist beliefs and even teach about those



beliefs -- but not as science. There is also a strong consensus not



only that schools should teach evolution, but that how they handle



the subject along with creationist beliefs should be a matter of

national policy, not just a local matter to be decided by each state



or school district.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll results also suggest that, while the public is



overwhelmingly supportive of teaching evolution, their knowledge is



quite limited about the details of evolutionary theory, pointing to

a



need for greater efforts to inform and educate the public about



evolution. At today's news conference in Washington, PFAWF announced



that it has begun planning such a campaign to coincide with the 75th



Anniversary this year of the Scopes Trial.
