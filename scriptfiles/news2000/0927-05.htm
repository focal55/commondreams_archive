- September 27 - The Joint Chiefs of Staff testified today before the House and

Senate Armed Services Committees repeating their call for increased defense

spending.  While Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Henry

Shelton refused to give an overall figure, each of the individual service

Chiefs suggested increases that total between $48 to $58 billion per year.



<p>Several Senators including Sen. Max Cleland (D-GA) and Sen. Pat Roberts

(R-KS) echoed a remark previously made by Marine Corps Commandant Gen.

James Jones recommending defense spending comprise 4-4.5 percent of Gross

Domestic Product (GDP).   



<p>Under either the above GDP proposal or the Chiefs' plan, by 2005 the

Pentagon's budget would increase to $483 to $544 billion or 70 to 80

percent of all discretionary spending as estimated by the Office of

Management and Budget.  "This would be tantamount to a declaration of war

on education and health care," said John Isaacs, president of the arms

control organization Council for a Livable World.  Defense spending

currently comprises one half of all discretionary spending (funds which

Congress has direct control over).    



<p>Each of the Chiefs claimed that without significant increases for

procurement they will not be able to maintain forces capable of conducting

two major theater wars nearly simultaneously.  But this strategy has come

under increasing attack as a means of artificially maintaining a Cold War

sized and armed force, even though the U.S. faces very few significant

military threats. 



<p>"That's the real problem," said Isaacs, "this outdated and unrealistic two

war requirement allows the chiefs to claim there is a huge gap between

current funding and what is needed.  Eliminate that requirement and they

will be hard pressed to tell the American people that the $310 billion

dollars the Pentagon will get next year is simply not enough."



<p>Despite the fact that all four services will reach their recruiting goals

this year and funding for readiness accounts such as spare parts has

increased dramatically, the Chiefs pointed to mounting readiness problems.

Shelton acknowledged there will be an "increasing trend in current

readiness", but questioned the ability to maintain readiness in the future

without massive increases in modernization accounts.  He claimed that the

services have been forced to "rob Peter to pay Paul" by using procurement

funds to pay for immediate readiness needs.



<p>Congress and the Pentagon waste billions each year by funding Cold War era

weapons such as the F-22 fighter aircraft when current proven technologies

are cheaper and still the most advanced in the world.  Sen. McCain (R-AZ)

also estimates that the fiscal 2001 Defense Appropriations bill contains $7

billion in unneeded, unrequested pork, and the Pentagon claims it could

save $3 billion a year if Congress would authorize two more rounds of base

closures.



<p>"Sounds to me like Congress is ‘robbing Peter to pay pork'," said Isaacs
