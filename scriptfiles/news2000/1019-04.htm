- October 19 - Students across the country today are calling

on President Clinton to protect Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge

from harmful oil development by designating the area a National Monument.

As part of a “national day of action,” students at nearly 200 campuses

are generating comments by mobilizing people to call, write or fax the

White House. More than one million comments to the President are expected

to be collected by the end of the week.<br>

<br>

Drilling in the Arctic Refuge has become a heated topic in recent months

due to the strong positions on this issue by the Presidential candidates.

While Vice President Al Gore is against drilling, Texas Governor George

W. Bush has pledged to open the pristine coastal plain of the Arctic

Refuge to oil development should he win office, despite the fact a

majority of Americans are opposed to drilling. <br>

<br>

“Students at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point are very concerned

about the Arctic Refuge,” said student organizer Angela Harper. “We are

doing all we can to convince President Clinton to protect the Arctic

including generating hundreds of calls to the White House for today’s day

of action.”<br>

<br>

The students’ nationwide efforts are supported by U.S. Public Interest

Groups (U.S. PIRG), Free the Planet!, ecopledge.com, and the Sierra Club

Student Coalition. The Alaska Wilderness League has led the call to

protect the Arctic Refuge, working closely with members of the Gwich’in

Nation, a subsistence people in Alaska, whose culture will be

dramatically affected by drilling in the Refuge. <br>

<br>

In addition to calling on President Clinton to name the area a National

Monument, activists will flood BP Amoco with e-mails urging the company

to stay out of the Arctic Refuge.&nbsp; More than 100 ecopledge.com and

PIRG chapters will target BP as part of the PIRG's Arctic Wilderness

Campaign.<br>

<br>

“The best way for BP to go ‘beyond petroleum’ is to support wilderness

designation for the coastal plain of the Refuge,” said Athan Manuel,

director of the PIRG Arctic Wilderness Campaign. “BP needs to recognize

that the Arctic Refuge is a unique and precious resource that should be

protected, not plundered.”<br>

<br>

Students at Florida State University in Tallahassee are handing out

“black ice” snow cones to symbolize the potential of oil spills should

the Refuge be developed. At the University of Connecticut, “Kara the

Caribou,” a huge inflatable caribou, has stopped along her migration for

today’s events.<br>

<br>

The Arctic Refuge is the last great wilderness of the United States. The

Arctic Refuge is home to nearly 200 species, including polar bears,

grizzlies, wolves, caribou and millions of migratory birds. Each summer,

130,000 porcupine caribou migrate across northeast Alaska and northwest

Canada. The herd migrates to the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain of the

Arctic Refuge where the cows have their calves. The calving grounds are

considered sacred by the Gwich’in, who rely on porcupine caribou to

maintain their traditional way of life.<br>

<br>

Estimates predict that there is no more than a 6-month oil supply in the

Arctic Refuge. This oil would take a decade to make it to market and

would have no affect on gas prices.<br>

<br>

Call President Clinton toll free at 1-888-750-4897 and tell him to

designate the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge a national monument. For
