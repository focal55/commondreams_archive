<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- March 8 - Jubilee 2000/USA supports the unanimous decision of the Meltzer Commission

Report to call for total debt cancellation for the world's most impoverished

countries.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In its only unanimous decision, the Commission writes, "the International

Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the regional development banks should

write-off in their entirety all claims against highly indebted poor

countries (HIPCs)."  This decision coincides with the Platform of Jubilee

2000/USA, which calls for the definitive cancellation of all crushing

foreign debt in the world's most impoverished countries in this Jubilee Year

of 2000.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congress set up the Commission in the fall of 1998, the last time the

Congress allocated funds for the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The

bipartisan Commission was established to consider the future of the major

international financial institutions.  While the report was approved 8-3,

the call for debt cancellation, in its entirety, was the only unanimous

decision of the group.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report recommends that the IMF, in the future serve only as a quasi

lender of last resort. It states that, in this plan "there would be no need

for detailed conditionality (often including dozens of conditions) that has

burdened IMF programs in recent years and made such programs unwieldy,

highly conflictive, time consuming to negotiate, and often ineffectual."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This criticism refers to the Structural Adjustment Programs that Jubilee

2000 campaigners in the Global South have identified as destructive to

sustainable development.  The Platform of the Jubilee 2000/USA Coalition

states that as debts are canceled, there should be no accompanying

conditions that exacerbate poverty.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jubilee 2000/USA is also pleased to see that the Report calls for an

increase in "transparency and accountability".  We know, from our partners

in the Global South, that broad sectors of civil society are qualified and

ready to participate in new financial relations in such a context.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Campaign welcomes the Commission's conclusions.  However, Jubilee

2000/USA opposes any interpretation or use of this report that might

contribute to a slowing down of the international process, now underway, to

cancel foreign debt.  The suggestions of this Commission should, instead,

help to strengthen and speed up the process already in motion.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This report will contribute to the momentum, brought about in great part by

the Jubilee 2000 movement worldwide, to cancel all the foreign debt of the

world's most impoverished countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia.  In

that way this Year of 2000 will become truly a Jubilee Year," declared Dan

Driscoll-Shaw, National Coordinator of Jubilee 2000/USA.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jubilee 2000/USA is made up of environmental, faith-based and human rights

groups that are calling for debt cancellation in this Jubilee Year of 2000.

Together with the AFL-CIO, Jubilee 2000/USA is planning a National

Mobilization in Washington on April 9th, when they will form a human chain

around the Nation's Capitol.  In this way they will symbolize the chains of

debt that bind so many in our world and the need to break those chains now.
