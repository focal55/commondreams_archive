- January 31 - The following was released

today by United for a Fair Economy. Big Money United is a



non-partisan, light-hearted spoof by United for a Fair Economy:

<p>--

<br>

Big Money United, a newly-formed coalition of billionaires,

millionaires and major corporations, will rally in Veterans Park



at the corner of Elm and Central streets, in Manchester, N.H., one



block from the Holiday Inn, tomorrow, Tuesday, Feb. 1, from



1-2 p.m. to declare their support for all the leading presidential



candidates.

<p>The nation's super-rich, who have traditionally supported

individual candidates in presidential elections, this year decided



to put aside their increasingly tiny differences and unite under



the single banner of Big Money United. Officials say the merger



will give them better "synergy" in coordinating the economic



platforms of the candidates.

<p>Big Money United is a conglomerate of the following organizations:

<p>Millionaires for Gore

<br>

This group doesn't mind that Gore talks a lot about "working

families" because they know he will go to bat for them on trade



issues. And a few of them still want a crack at that Lincoln



bedroom.

<p>Multi-Millionaires for Bush

<br>

Even though he would give a whole 11 percent of his tax cuts to

the bottom 60 percent of Americans, this group trusts he'll look



out for them. After all, even his initials stand for "Great



Wealth!"

<p>Billionaires for Forbes

<br>

This group knows that Steve Forbes' flat tax would tax only

those people foolish enough to depend on wages for their income,



while relieving the real engines of the economy -- the super-rich --



from all taxes on investment income.

<p>Trillionaires for Trump

<br>

They know they can hit the jackpot with a candidate who's one of

them.

<p>Heralding what he calls "a new era in big-money politics," BMU

spokesman Earl Derrick said that the big-donor coalition seemed to



come together on its own. "We just looked at the situation and



said, 'Hey, what are we fighting about?' On taxes, trade



regulation, corporate subsidies, Fed policy and on down the line,



any of these candidates will take care of us once in office,"



Derrick said.

<p>Big Money United is not affiliated with any political party.

"Democrat or Republican, Left or Right, Alpha Male or Beta Male,



they're just labels," Derrick said. "The economic policies of all



of these candidates have been pre-screened by the whole campaign



finance system. This is just an effort to further streamline the



process."

<p>Representatives of all four organizations will be available for

interviews.
