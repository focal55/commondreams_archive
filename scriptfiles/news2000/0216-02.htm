          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - February 

            16 - "Mr. Smith's writings make plain that his agenda as a commission 

            member would be a further dismantling of reasonable campaign limits 

            intended to curb the corrupting influence of big money rather than 

            serious enforcement of current campaign finance laws." - The New York 

            Times </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President Clinton 

            has nominated Bradley A. Smith, Professor of Law at Capital University 

            in Ohio, to serve on the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Smith, 

            the hand-picked choice of the Senate's most extreme opponents of campaign 

            finance reform, Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS) and Senator Mitch 

            McConnell (R-KY), has written extensively that the whole corpus of 

            federal election law is unconstitutional and should be repealed. The 

            FEC is the body charged with enforcing these laws. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The saga over 

            the Smith nomination began in the summer of 1999, when Smith's name 

            was first floated as a potential nominee. Common Cause, the Brennan 

            Center for Justice, and Democracy 21 waged a campaign to put pressure 

            on President Clinton not to forward Smith's name for the vacancy created 

            by outgoing Commissioner Lee Ann Elliott. While historically the Commission 

            is made up of three Democrats and three Republicans, there is precedent 

            for the President to refuse to nominate the choice of the congressional 

            leadership of the opposite party. In 1985, for instance, President 

            Ronald Reagan refused to appoint Thomas Harris, the choice of congressional 

            Democrats, to the FEC. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In July, press 

            reports indicated that Senate Republicans had linked the Smith nomination 

            to the nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be Ambassador to the United 

            Nations, by placing a "hold" on Holbrooke. Although the hold was eventually 

            dropped and Holbrooke was confirmed, President Clinton did not immediately 

            advance the Smith nomination. Recent news reports indicate the Smith 

            nomination was made in exchange for progress in confirming judicial 

            appointments that had been held up in the Senate. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SMITH OPPOSES 

            LAWS HE WOULD ENFORCE </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Professor Smith 

            has written that most of the nation's campaign finance laws are unconstitutional. 

            In a 1997 Wall Street Journal op-ed entitled "Why Campaign Finance 

            Reform Never Works," Smith wrote that "the most sensible reform is 

            a simple one: repeal of the Federal Election Campaign Act." The Federal 

            Election Campaign Act, or FECA, is the body of law which sets out 

            the limits on political contributions enacted in the wake of the Watergate 

            scandal. This law, Smith has written, is "profoundly undemocratic 

            and profoundly at odds with the First Amendment." </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such sentiments, 

            say reformers, make it unlikely that Smith would meet even the minimum 

            qualifications for Commissioner as described in the statute, which 

            cite "impartiality" as a basis for selecting Commissioners. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Any member of 

            a federal regulatory agency should, at a minimum, believe in the mission 

            of that agency, the laws to be administered by the agency, and the 

            constitutionality of those laws," reform groups wrote to President 

            Clinton in June. "Mr. Smith is in no way 'impartial' about the campaign 

            finance laws. He does not believe in them." </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"At a time when 

            the idea that we need to reduce the influence of big money in our 

            elections and our government is gaining ground, President Clinton 

            is nominating someone to the FEC who has complete and utter hostility 

            to the laws he would be charged with enforcing," Common Cause President 

            Scott Harshbarger said when the nomination appeared imminent. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Smith's views 

            seem more extreme to reformers in light of the Supreme Court's recent 

            decision in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, which upheld 

            the constitutionality of spending limits that are at the core of FECA. 

            The Court explicitly pointed to the corruption-preventing properties 

            of contribution limits, warning against the "broader threat of politicians 

            too compliant with the wishes of large contributors." But Smith does 

            not even concede there is a problem, writing in the Georgetown Law 

            Journal that "money's alleged corrupting effects are far from proven." 

            </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Smith told Roll 

            Call that "the reason most" why he agreed to accept the nomination 

            is to "present the case that there's another way to talk about reform 

            than reform being equivalent to more regulation." That, according 

            to Common Cause, is the wrong reason to accept a high-ranking position 

            at an enforcement agency. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The FEC isn't 

            some kind of debating society," Harshbarger said. "This is an agency 

            which is supposed to administer and enforce the laws already on the 

            books." </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">REFORMERS PLEDGE 

            TO FIGHT NOMINATION</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Because of the 

            controversy surrounding Smith's views, Smith's main proponent in the 

            Senate, Senator McConnell, appears as though he will try to ram the 

            nomination through the Rules Committee and on to the full Senate, 

            according to Common Cause. Groups like Common Cause, Democracy 21, 

            and the Brennan Center for Justice are pushing the Senate Rules Committee 

            to hold full hearings on the nomination, and to allow outside groups 

            to testify. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although Senate 

            Republicans will likely choose to avoid the scrutiny that full confirmation 

            hearings would bring on Smith and his views, Smith himself has said 

            he does want the opportunity to air his views in open hearings. "Obviously, 

            I'm pleased, and I'm looking forward to the confirmation hearings," 

            Smith told the Columbus Dispatch on February 10. "I've taken a lot 

            of whacks, sort of unanswered in the press over the last year," Smith 

            continued. "And since most of these whacks have come from people who 

            have never read my stuff, have never seen me, and are just reprinting 

            Common Cause press releases, I look forward to actually being able 

            to appear as myself." </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Common Cause has 

            pledged to fight Smith's confirmation in the Senate. "Any Senator 

            who claims to support campaign finance reform cannot support this 

            disastrous nomination," Harshbarger said. "A vote for Brad Smith would 

            be a vote to return to the dark days of Watergate, when there was 

            zero regulation of campaign contributions - because Professor Smith 

            wants to completely discard the laws in this area." </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We also do not 

            believe that judicial nominations should be held hostage and linked 

            with the Smith nomination," said Harshbarger. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A simple majority 

            is required to confirm Presidential nominees in the Senate. Last year,52 

            Senators voted for the McCain- Feingold campaign finance reform bill 

            - all 45 Democrats, and Republican Senators Susan Collins (ME), James 

            Jeffords (VT), John McCain (AZ), Olympia Snowe (ME), Arlen Specter 

            (PA), Fred Thompson (TN), and the late Senator John Chafee (RI). On 

            a separate cloture vote on a slightly different version of the bill 

            - a bill that only included a soft money ban - reformers picked up 

            the votes of GOP Senators Sam Brownback (KS), Tim Hutchinson (AR), 

            and William Roth (DE). </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Fifty-four current 

            Senators are on record for strengthening our campaign finance laws," 

            Harshbarger said. "A vote for Smith is even more than a vote against 

            campaign finance reform. Voting for the Smith nomination would mean 

            eviscerating even the most basic campaign finance laws already on 

            the books." </font></p>
