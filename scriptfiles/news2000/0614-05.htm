- June 14 - Challenging Phillips Petroleum “to act as an exemplary environmental citizen and support wilderness designation for the Arctic Refuge,”  a coalition of environmental and conservation groups called on the second-largest oil company in Alaska to stay out of the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.



<p>The letter cited Phillips’ support for International Migratory Bird Day and noted that the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge supports more than 180 species of migratory birds.  “What better way to help migratory birds and preserve their habitat than by endorsing wilderness protection for the Arctic?” said Athan Manuel, director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) Arctic Wilderness Campaign and the author of the letter.  “The habitat that the Refuge provides to migratory birds and other wildlife would be permanently damaged by oil drilling and development.   We urge Phillips to recognize those wilderness values and support permanent protection for America’s Arctic.” 



<p>The coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is often referred to as America’s Serengeti. In addition to migratory birds, the coastal plain is the birthing ground for the Porcupine River Caribou herd and supports large populations of muskoxen, wolves, and all three species of bear - polar, brown and black. 



<p>The Refuge is also sacred to the Gwich’in people. Gwich’in means “people of the caribou,” and they depend on the caribou for food, clothing, and as a link to their traditional way of life. 

<p>The letter specifically asks Phillips to endorse the Arctic Refuge Wilderness bills, H.R. 1239 and S. 867. The bills would designate the 1.5 million acres of the coastal plain as wilderness, permanently protecting the area from development. The Wilderness bills each have a record number of co-sponsors -- 168 in the House and 27 in the Senate.



<p>In addition to U.S. PIRG and the Alaska Wilderness League, the other signers of the letter include:  Alaska Environmental Response Team, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Canadian Leadership Group, Defenders of Wildlife, Free the Planet, Friends of the Earth, International Gwich’in Steering Committee, National Parks and Conservation Association, Natural Resources Defense Council, Northern Alaska Environmental Center, Porcupine Caribou Management Board, Sierra Club, and The Wilderness Society.  

<p>“Momentum for protecting the Arctic Refuge is building.  The American people oppose drilling and a record number of co-sponsors are on the Arctic Wilderness bill,” concluded Manuel. “It’s time for Phillips Petroleum to get the message, support permanent protection for the coastal plain of the Refuge, and save America’s Arctic.”
