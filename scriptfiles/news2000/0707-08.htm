- July 7 - Four D.C. Statehood Green Party

candidates for public office delivered completed

ballot petitions to the Board of Elections and Ethics

on Wednesday, July 5, the due date for placing names

on the ballot in the District of Columbia.  Statehood

Greens have major party status in the District, and

candidates will participate in the September primary

and November general elections.



<p>Housing, health care, and human rights activist Arturo

Griffiths will compete for the At-Large seat on D.C.

City Council.  The last elected party (D.C. Statehood

Party, before the merger in 1999 with the D.C. Green

Party) member to sit on Council was Hilda Mason, who

also occupied an At-Large seat.



<p>D.C. public high school teacher Tom Briggs is running

for the Ward 2 Council seat.  Labor lawyer and the

D.C. Human Rights Commissioner Renée Bowser is the

Ward 4 candidate.  Martin Thomas is running for D.C.

"Shadow" Representative.  (Tracey Joyner, candidate

for Ward 8, has dropped out of the race for personal

reasons.)



<p>Ralph Nader and running mate Winona LaDuke will be

listed on the D.C. ballot as Statehood Green Party

candidates for President and Vice President of the

United States.  Four D.C. Statehood Green delegates,

including At-Large Board of Education member Gail

Dixon, attended the National Nominating Convention of

the Green Party in Denver, Colorado on June 24 and 25.



<p>Statehood Green activist, D.C. public school parent,

and track coach Thomas Smith will run for the At-Large

seat on the D.C. Board of Education in November, for

which ballot petitions are due later this summer.



<p>The Statehood Green Party campaigned intensely against

passage of the charter amendment referendum to convert

the Board of Education to a partially appointed body,

for which D.C. voters cast ballots on June 27 and

results (too close to call last week) will be

announced on Friday, July 7.  



<p>Statehood Greens called the amendment an assault on

the democratic voting rights of parents and other D.C.

voters, and also cited the failure of D.C.'s last

educational bureaucracy, the Board of Trustees

appointed by the Financial Control Board, which closed

16 schools and allowed millions of unaccounted-for

dollars to disappear.



<p>Statehood Green candidates and supporters consider

Democratic elected officials who supported the

referendum especially vulnerable in the 2000 election.

 The "Vote Yes" effort was bankrolled by

representatives of America On-Line, Marriott Hotels,

and other out-of-town businesses -- after a court

order stopped Mayor Anthony Williams from using

taxpayer money and payed public employees to campaign

for the referendum.



<p>The D.C. Statehood Green Party, which accepts no

corporate contributions, has criticized the extent to

which public policy decisions from both District

officials and Congress, which oversees D.C.

legislation, serve wealthy and powerful business

interests, resulting in exploitative development,

neglect of low-income neighborhoods, displacement of

residents, environmental decay, and weakening of the

democratic rights of the people of the District.  



<p>A few examples of these are construction of a

convention center in the Shaw neighborhood, eviction

of tenants in Columbia Heights, the placement of trash

transfer stations, the disappearance from Ward 8 of a

major grocery store (the Statehood Green Party helped

set up a Saturday farmers' market in Anacostia last

year), the overruling of Initiative 59 ("medical

marijuana"), and plans for a ballpark on Massachusetts

Avenue.
