<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- January 28 - The Human Rights Campaign Foundation, the educational arm of

the Human Rights Campaign, today announced that it will host a major

concert, "Equality Rocks," on Saturday, April 29, 2000 at RFK Stadium in

Washington, D.C.  Featuring such superstar performers as Garth Brooks, Ellen

DeGeneres, Melissa Etheridge, Anne Heche, Kristen Johnston, kd Lang, Nathan

Lane, and Pet Shop Boys, Equality Rocks will empower the HRC Foundation to

continue its vital work into the new century.  The concert will embody the

dream of equality and safety for all people, and a world free of violence

based on difference.  It will also be a celebration fostering mutual respect

and dignity, especially among young people, so they can dream their dreams,

free of fear and violence, says HRC.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's not just a concert, it's a concerted effort for equality and safety,"

said HRC Executive Director Elizabeth Birch. "Never before have so many

powerful and inspiring artists come together to support our community and

celebrate the dream of equality, safety and fairness for all people. This

historic concert is unprecedented in the United States and sends a wise and

much needed message to America that it is time to end the senseless violence

that has torn apart our nation."</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In recent years, the violence and hatred unleashed among young people has

shaken the nation. HRC and Equality Rocks are about creating new standards

of civility and understanding. HRC is deeply committed to fostering an

atmosphere of respect for difference and basic human rights for all.

Equality Rocks hopes to address the climate in which long-term prejudice and

bias is formed. The message of the event is that people in every setting and

institution have a responsibility to build a better nation for all young

people.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"To help young people the artists are saying it's: All of Us for All of

Them," said Birch.  "This event is also a celebration of HRC's work.  The

organization will celebrate its 20th Anniversary this year.  HRC has always

dreamed of a world in which difference is not just tolerated, but embraced

and celebrated.  We are going to dream, hope, rock."</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Proceeds of the concert will benefit the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, a

nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation, well-known for its educational programs.

The concert will take place on the eve of the Millennium March on Washington

for Equality, and the HRC Foundation will provide a major grant to the MMOW

organization from the proceeds of this event.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tickets are available nationwide by calling TicketMaster at 800-551-SEAT or

202-432-SEAT. More major artists will be announced and all artists are

subject to change.
