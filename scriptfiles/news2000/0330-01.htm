- March 30 - New York, Chicago and other cities across the country have taken steps to

ban controversial ATM surcharges, according to a new report released by

the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. The report coincides with the

4th anniversary of national ATM surcharging on April 1st, and rebuts

deceptive banking industry arguments against the rights of states and

cities to ban surcharging.<br>

<br>

On April 1, 1996, the national ATM networks, Plus and Cirrus, rescinded

their ban on ATM owners imposing surcharges on non-accountholders. The

surcharge is a second fee, on top of a foreign fee already paid by most

consumers when they use an ATM not owned by their bank.<br>

<br>

&quot;Despite fierce legal counterattacks by bank lawyers and federal

regulators, more cities and states are working to ban the double ATM

surcharge,&quot; said Ed Mierzwinski, Consumer Program Director of U.S.

PIRG. &quot;More and more state and local officials are recognizing that

it's unfair to charge consumers twice to use the ATM only

once.&quot;<br>

<br>

“Banks had a ninth straight year of record profits in 1999, earning $72

billion,&quot; added Mierzwinski, &quot;So why do they need to pile on $2

billion in revenues from the unfair ATM surcharge? It is unacceptable

that it costs consumers $2.50 or more to use ATMs that cost only $1 five

years ago, especially when government studies show that the bank’s cost

of an ATM transaction is only 27 cents.&quot;&nbsp; Prior to the advent

of national surcharging in 1996, only about 23% of all banks imposed

surcharges, while PIRG’s latest national survey, released one year ago,

found that 93% were surcharging, for an increase of 304% in 3 years,

Mierzwinski added.<br>

<br>

Recently, several cities have passed resolutions to ban the ATM

surcharge. In February, the city of Woodbridge, NJ joined Santa Monica

and San Francisco in banning surcharges. In New York City, a majority of

City Council members have co-sponsored a ban proposed by Speaker Peter

Vallone, according to the PIRG report, <b><i>&quot;ATM Fee Backlash:

Local Rebellions Against Unfair Surcharge Spread.&quot;<br>

<br>

</i></b>The report summarizes the status of surcharge legislation in

states and cities around the nation. Among the key findings of the report

are:<br>

<dd>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">·<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Surcharges

have begun to exceed $1.50. Fifth Third Bank (OH) is now imposing $2

surcharges. Mellon Bank [eastern/central PA locations] is now charging

$1.75.<br>

<br>

</font>

<dd>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">·<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>In

February, nine state Attorneys General [California, Connecticut, Iowa,

Oregon, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Washington and West Virginia] filed

a legal brief in support of the right of the cities of Santa Monica and

San Francisco to ban ATM surcharges. In November, a US District Court

judge blocked implementation of their bans, a joint appeal is pending to

the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.<br>

<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">·<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>

Local bans are under consideration in the councils of New York City and Chicago. Other cities where campaigns have been launched include Portland, Salem and Eugene, Oregon and Newark, NJ.<br>

<br>

</font>

<dd>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">·<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>In February, Iowa petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review a decision overturning its broad ATM regulations over state banks, which had included an administrative ban on surcharging. While Connecticut’s ban was overturned by the state Supreme Court in December, its ruling only narrowly held that the Banking Commissioner had overstepped his authority when he banned surcharging in 1995. A legislative surcharge ban supported by state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has cleared a joint House-Senate committee and is being prepared for House floor action.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report examines the legal case for state action and details how the 1978 Electronic Funds Transfer Act, which governs ATMs, explicitly allows states and cities to regulate ATM fees. <br>

The report also describes the anti-competitive nature of ATM surcharging, which has allowed banks to continue to raise fees. It points out that the bulk of the benefits go to larger banks. Both PIRG and Federal Reserve Board studies have shown that bigger banks impose higher fees on all types of consumer accounts.<br>

<br>

&quot;ATM surcharges make it harder for small, locally-owned, low-cost community banks and credit unions to hold onto their depositors. If enough customers switch to big banks, then the big banks will have even more market power, leaving consumers with little choice in the marketplace,&quot; added Mierzwinski.<br>

<br>

The report makes the following recommendations:<br>

*Cities, states and Congress should continue to work to ban the ATM surcharge.<br>

*Congress should rein in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The federal bank regulator's abusive interpretations of its authority have had a chilling effect on the ability of states and cities to regulate unfair banking practices, including ATM surcharges, over-priced checking accounts and triple-digit payday loan companies.<br>

*Congress should reinstate a requirement that the Federal Reserve Board publish an annual study of bank fees, a requirement that the Congress allowed to sunset in 1999.<br>

<br>

&quot;PIRG is working with cities around the country to ban the unfair double surcharge,&quot; concluded Mierzwinski. &quot;We encourage Congress to act, but if they won't, consumers will have to rely on cities and states for protection against this unfair fee.&quot;<br>
