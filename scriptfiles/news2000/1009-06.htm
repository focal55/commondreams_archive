- October 9 - The following was



released today by Gore/Lieberman 2000:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As reported by Bloomberg News, Dick Cheney was not being fully



honest when he claimed in a debate with Joe Lieberman that "the



government had absolutely nothing to do with" his financial success



over the last eight years. "Cheney's reply left out how closely



Dallas-based Halliburton's fortunes are linked to the U.S.



government. The world's largest oil services firm is a leading U.S.



defense contractor and has benefited from financial guarantees



granted by U.S. agencies that promote exports," reported Bloomberg.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Bush campaign is on the attack because they lost the debate



on the issues and Bush can't string together a coherent statement



to explain his own policies," said Gore/Lieberman deputy



communications director Kym Spell. "Dick Cheney is the one who



told a real whopper in last week's debate when he said his wealth



had nothing to do with the government. He knew very well that his



company benefited from millions of dollars in government loans and



contracts."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Excerpts:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

"During Cheney's five years as chairman and chief executive,



Halliburton was identified as a potential participant in 10 loans



or loan guarantees -- valued at a total of $1.8 billion -- awarded



by the U.S. Export-Import Bank to foreign companies, according to



Ex-Im Bank records. Earlier this year, Cheney personally contacted



a senior Ex-Im Bank official in support of $500 million in loan



guarantees to Russia's OAO Tyumen Oil Co., according to bank



documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In 1997, Cheney publicly hailed the Ex-Im Bank and its past



assistance to Halliburton and other U.S. businesses. 'The emerging



global marketplace makes what you do as an institution, here, at



the Ex-Im Bank, all the more important in sustaining a healthy,



competitive U.S. economy,' Cheney told the agency in a May 1997



speech to its annual conference, according to a transcript of his



remarks at the bank's Web site."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Halliburton also has emerged as a leading defense contractor.



From 1996 through 1999, the U.S. Defense Department granted



Halliburton contracts valued at about $1.8 billion, according to



department records. The Pentagon ranked Halliburton the No. 17



recipient of 'prime contract awards' in fiscal 1999, with $657.5



million."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Cheney has reported earning $20.2 million in adjusted gross



income from 1993, when he left his job as U.S. defense secretary,



through 1999. In August, after his selection as the Republican vice



presidential nominee, Cheney realized an $18.5 million profit by



exercising some of the stock options received as compensation from



Halliburton, according to regulatory filings."</font>
