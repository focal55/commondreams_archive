- January 26 - Pointing to the failure of

the WTO meetings in Seattle last year, Friends of the Earth and



partner groups say environment, labor and human rights issues cannot



be sidelined any longer in discussions about the global economy at



the World Economic Forum held this week in Davos, Switzerland.

<p>"This gathering is a test of whether or not world leaders heard

the message of Seattle -- all international institutions and forums



must open up and become democratic, " said Andrea Durbin, Director

of



International Programs for Friends of the Earth.

<p>Friends of the Earth is calling on the leaders gathered for the

World Economic Forum to recognize that globalization must benefit the



majority of the people around the world, not just a small minority

or



corporate interests. Further, the group insists that when world



leaders gather in Davos, they must commit themselves to a new agenda



to right the wrongs of globalization and deal with concerns raised

by



Friends of the Earth and other NGOs.

<p>Specifically, Friends of the Earth has called on government

leaders in Davos to: 1) commit to an environmental review and



assessment of the past 5 years of the WTO; 2) strengthen Multilateral



Environmental Agreements; 3) stop the WTO's interference with



international and national environmental law; and 4) negotiate a



binding code of conduct for corporations.

<p>"Last year, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called on corporations

to abide by the basic values of human rights, environmental



protection and worker rights," said Durbin. "We are here in Davos to



hold governments and companies accountable to this pledge. The



biggest gap in the global economy are binding standards for good



corporate behavior."

<p>There will be a media conference on NGO concerns with Davos called

"The Public Eye on Davos," a joint project of the Berne Declaration,



Friends of the Earth/U.S. and the Globalization Challenge Initiative,



on Friday, Jan. 28, 2 p.m., at Dutch Asthma Clinic, Scalettastrasse



19, Davos (next to the Congress Centre). Speakers include:

<p>-- Peter Bosshard (Berne Declaration)

<br>-- Andrea Durbin (Friends of the Earth/U.S.)

<br>

-- Manuel Chiriboga (Asociacion Lationamericana de Organizaciones

de Promocion, ALOP)

<p>Friends of the Earth representatives can be reached for comment in

Davos: Andrea Durbin, Director of International Programs (079/ 205

51



36); and Brent Blackwelder, President (079/ 434 00 64).
