Co-author of "Netizens: On the History and Impact of Usenet and the

Internet," Hauben said today: "While the Internet's infrastructure grew up

under public administration and funding, the U.S. government has set out to

give away vital Internet functions to a private corporation called the 

Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Congress requested that

the General Accounting Office do an investigation of the creation and

development of ICANN and its contracts with the Commerce Department. The

GAO report (which was 'corrected' by the Commerce Department before being

issued on July 7) acknowledges it would be illegal and unconstitutional to

transfer public property to ICANN. However, it accepts the statement of the

Commerce Department about whether this has actually happened rather than

doing an independent assessment. There is no consideration of the public

interest in the creation of ICANN or the GAO report."

Executive director of Media Alliance, which is working to ensure open access

in San Francisco, Buffa said today: "People like the Internet because it is

open, but companies like AT&T and AOL/Time Warner are attempting to

become the gatekeepers as broadband cable -- which provides faster service

-- may become the way most people access the Internet. These companies

are positioning themselves to use their status as the cable provider in cities

across the country to favor the content that they have a financial interest

in -- and undermine the content that they don't. If they are successful, they

will in effect become private regulators of what was to be an open and diverse

medium. What's needed is open access so that all content providers have a

level playing field."

A writer specializing in technology criticism, Beacham said today: "A

significant threat Internet users face is the assault on personal privacy by

information-ravenous corporations and institutions that find it highly

profitable to build and sell dossiers on the lives of unsuspecting users.

The government, rather than take the lead in protecting personal privacy, is

now a threat itself. The FBI's recently-revealed Carnivore system has the

unprecedented power to rapidly surf the Internet and analyze millions of

communications by citizens."

<br>

Co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Baker said

today: "Copyrights are an anachronism restraining the development of

technology in the Internet age. This form of protectionism is far more

costly than the tariff and quota barriers that have become an obsession for

proponents of 'free trade.' We should be developing creative alternative

methods for funding the production of artistic work, as Stephen King is

attempting to do with his latest novel. An even better method would be an

individual tax credit system, where people would get a 100 percent credit

for a small contribution for supporting artistic work. This work could then

be freely reproduced, taking full advantage of the technological

possibilities of the digital age."</font>
