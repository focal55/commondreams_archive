- February 1 - A federal district court violated the First Amendment

rights of two Northwest Airlines flight attendants by forbidding them from engaging in

certain speech-related activities -- an order that could require them to censor their Web

sites, according to papers filed Tuesday by Public Citizen in federal appellate court.



<p>According to <a href="http://www.citizen.org/litigation/briefs/sumrevmem.htm">the filing</a>, made by <a href="http://www.citizen.org/litigation/litigation.html">Public Citizen Litigation Group</a> in the U.S. Court

of Appeals for the 8<sup>th</sup> Circuit, a Minnesota district court violated the two

men&#146;s rights on Jan. 5 when it issued a temporary restraining order against them. The

order forbade them from &quot;approving of&quot; or &quot;permitting&quot; a sickout. The

court issued the restraining order without notifying the men, so they weren&#146;t

represented at a hearing held to discuss it. Public Citizen is seeking to have the order

vacated.</p>



<p>For one flight attendant, the order could mean that he must censor the comments that

others post on his site. For the other man, it means that he must be extra cautious in

what information he posts, lest the company accuse him of supporting a sickout and

therefore violating the district court&#146;s order. A violation could lead to a fine

and/or jail time.</p>



<p>&quot;This is a flagrant violation of basic due process rights, and it would have

dangerous repercussions if it is permitted to stand,&quot; said Paul Alan Levy of the

Public Citizen Litigation Group. &quot;A grave injustice has been done to these two

individuals, because the order is a blatant case of restraint of speech that has

historically been forbidden.&quot; Detroit attorney Barbara Harvey is co-counsel in the

case.</p>



<p>Senior Northwest Airlines flight attendants Kevin Griffin and Ted Reeve each created

Web sites last year during contentious contract negotiations between Northwest and the

Teamsters Local 2000. Both men aimed to provide an easily accessible source of information

pertaining to the contract negotiations.</p>



<p>Reeve&#146;s site contains such information as a history of the union, a list of

officers, notices of membership meetings, communications to all flight attendants by

company officials about contract negotiations, union messages and media reports about

contract negotiations. Griffin&#146;s site includes comparative pay charts, union bylaws

and contract &quot;low lights.&quot; It also provides an opportunity for people to post

comments.</p>



<p>Some people posted comments encouraging attendants to participate in a sickout. When

they did, Griffin posted a message asking people to &quot;refrain from calling for certain

actions that may be illegal.&quot;</p>



<p>Neither man participated in a sickout that occurred in late December. In fact, Reeve

has not called in sick once during his 10 years with the airline.</p>



<p>In documents seeking the restraining order, Northwest alleges that 19 individuals --

all union officials and representatives except for Reeve and Griffin -- had fomented the

sickout. The airline said that Reeve and Griffin had created Web sites, that calls for

illegal job actions had been posted on one of them and that Griffin himself had posted a

comment that implicitly called for a sickout. In fact, however, the message the airline

submitted to the court was written by another flight attendant.</p>



<p>Griffin and Reeve heard about the restraining order only after the court issued it,

even though they could have been contacted at work, home or through e-mail. They never had

the opportunity to argue that there was no basis to the order as it applied to them,

Public Citizen&#146;s filing says.</p>



<p>The injunction constitutes a prior restraint of speech, Public Citizen&#146;s filing

contends. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment bars injunctions against

speech without notice.</p>



<p>&quot;This order is a classic prior restraint of First Amendment rights that is

forbidden in all but the most extreme circumstances,&quot; Levy said. &quot;It is an

elementary First Amendment principle that citizens are entitled to express their sympathy

for illegal activities as long as they don&#146;t incite them.&quot;</p>



<p>Further, the law is clear that individuals cannot be held liable for the acts or

advocacy of others, the filing states. The Communications Decency Act provides that one

cannot be held liable for a message that someone else posts to their Web site.
