- June 12 - The proposed national missile defense system won't work, according to the US scientific community. More than 35 scientists and engineers from 16 states descended on the US Capitol today to warn lawmakers that the plan is long on politics and short on science.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Rep. Rush Holt (D-NJ), one of two physicists in the House, and Roy Danchick, a former employee of a major missile defense contractor, joined missile defense experts on the steps of the US Capitol.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



This fall, President Clinton will decide whether to deploy the system based on its cost, arms control implications, the maturity of the technology, and the missile threat. His decision will come after a third intercept test in early July and a Pentagon recommendation in July or August. (The first intercept test last October scored an ambiguous hit and the second test in January missed altogether.)  The president is also waiting to see if Russia will agree to modify the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow US deployment.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



But the scientists make clear there is no scientific basis for such a decision.</font>

<p> 



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Congress has been ill-informed about the science behind national missile defense," said Dr. Michael Jones, a physicist at the University of Hawaii. "Deploying a system of dubious 

effectiveness will not eliminate the threat but is likely to lead to decreased US and international security." </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Union of Concerned Scientists and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Security Studies Program released a major study in April presenting technical evidence that the planned US national missile defense system would be defeated by simple responses from the attacking country. The report, by a panel of 11 independent senior physicists and engineers, also found that the current NMD testing program is not capable of assessing the system’s effectiveness against a realistic attack.</font>

<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This so-called national missile defense could be defeated by relatively simple countermeasures designed to overwhelm or fool the system," said Dr. Joseph Lach, a physicist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Chicago. "Any country that can deploy a long-range missile with a nuclear or biological weapon can deploy these countermeasures."</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Such countermeasures might include dividing a biological warhead into many small bomblets that would overwhelm the defense with too many targets, or deploying nuclear warheads inside mylar balloons with empty balloons along side. Or a nuclear warhead could be covered by a shroud cooled to very low temperatures, preventing the heat-seeking interceptor from detecting and homing on the target.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



The NMD system is not scheduled to be tested against realistic targets such as these 

before the first phase of deployment in 2005, if at all.</font>

<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Pentagon’s own test data show that the proposed NMD system cannot discriminate 

a real target from a decoy," said Roy Danchick, a mathematician and former employee of TRW, 

a major NMD contractor. "Pentagon statements to the contrary are nothing more than a 

smokescreen."</font>
