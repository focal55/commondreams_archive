- May 4 - Supporters of debt cancellation for the poorest countries

will be haunting Prime Minister Mori throughout his whirlwind tour of G8

nations in Europe and North America this week.



<p>Tomorrow (5/5), Jubilee 2000/USA supporters will be peacefully demonstrating

outside the White House when Mr. Mori arrives to meet with President

Clinton.  Demonstrators will be present beginning at 9:20; Mr. Mori's visit

is scheduled for 9:40am.  Jubilee 2000 Campaigners have become increasingly

frustrated by the failure of the G8 world leaders to meet the debt promises

made almost a year ago in Cologne, Germany.



<p>Campaigners are not protesting the visit of Prime Minister Mori.  Rather,

the intent is to respectfully call on the Prime Minister, as Chair of the

G8, to make the Okinawa summit truly historic: by canceling the debts of the

poorest countries before the end of the year; and by including

representatives from the indebted nations in these discussions.



<p>The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and G77 (leaders of the poorest

nations) have both said that they should be at the table when decisions are

being taken which affect the lives of the people that they represent.



<p>Dan Driscoll-Shaw, director of Jubilee 2000/USA said: "Jubilee 2000

supporters will be present outside the meetings of Prime Minister Mori and

all his G8 counterparts to draw attention to the failure of the world's

leaders to live up to their promises on debt cancellation.  Our campaign is

certainly pressuring the US Congress to play its part.  Yet, we are also

appealing to Prime Minister Mori to set the stage for an historic Okinawa

summit which clears the way for a debt-free future for the poorest in the

world".



<p>Jubilee 2000 is an international movement active in more than 50 countries

and campaigns for the cancellation of the unpayable debts of the world's

poorest countries in this year. 17 million people worldwide support Jubilee

2000, including the Dalai Lama, the Pope, Ruyichi Sakamoto, U2's Bono,

Radiohead and supermodel Naomi Campbell.
