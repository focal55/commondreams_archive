- July 18 - In an exciting milestone for the growing independent media movement, Pacifica 

Radio's Democracy Now! will be filmed and carried live on satellite and cable 

television during this summer's political conventions, opening a vast new 

national audience for grassroots voices and community radio. The daily 

two-hour broadcasts direct from the Independent Media Centers in Philadelphia 

and Los Angeles will also be live audio and video streamed over the World 

Wide Web.



<p>Hosted by award-winning journalists Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzalez, Democracy 

Now! will be distributed by Deep Dish TV and Free Speech TV (FSTV), a 

non-commercial network. The Dish Network carries FSTV, reaching some two 

million-subscriber homes nationwide, many in rural areas not served by public 

radio. FSTV will also distribute Democracy Now! To public access and 

educational cable channels nationwide, reaching a potential total audience of 

20 million households. 



<p>In four short years, Democracy Now! has established itself as the premier 

independent radio voice in the country. The one-hour daily program has 

regularly broken key national and international stories, won top journalism 

awards, built a strong and growing audience, and generated critical acclaim 

and national press attention. The reason is simple. Democracy Now! Stays 

ahead of the news, providing in-depth coverage of the crucial issues of the 

day before they hit the media radar screen. 



<p>From the student sweatshop movement to the streets of Seattle, from East 

Timor to the Niger Delta, Democracy Now! has become an important crucible for 

new ideas and grassroots voices struggling for a just and equitable world. 

"Welcome relief from the right-wing diatribes so common on the airwaves," 

said The Philadelphia Daily News. Newt Gingrich told Democracy Now! Anchor Amy

 Goodman, "I have advised my mother to talk to no reporters because of people 

like you." The Indonesian military banned her from entering the country. The 

Washington Post says simply: "The mainstream media listen."



<p>The national television broadcast marks a historic collaboration between the 

50-year-old community radio movement and the 25-year-old community TV 

movement. It will dramatically expand the audience for grassroots voices and 

allow independent media to amplify its national presence.

Los Angeles/Democratic, Aug. 14 - Aug. 18<br>
