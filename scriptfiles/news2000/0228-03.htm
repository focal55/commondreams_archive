- February 28 - Common Cause and the Commonwealth Club are cosponsoring a Forum on Money in 

Politics and Campaign 2000 at 12:30 p.m. on Thursday, March 2, 2000 at the 

Commonwealth Club, 595 Market Street, San Francisco, Calif.  Journalists 

interested in attending should call the Common Cause Press Office at 

202/736-5770 to reserve a spot.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The forum is open to the public, and will be an opportunity for a broad 

discussion on the role that money plays in politics, especially the 2000 

election.  The forum will explore issues such as how to make elections more 

competitive, the impact of big money on the political and legislative 

process, the role of television and the Internet in elections, public views 

on campaign reform issues, and ways to improve civic participation.  The 

forum will be moderated by Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Charles Kolb, President of the Committee for Economic Development, a 

nonpartisan public policy organization representing business and academic 

leaders, and Cheryl Perrin, executive director of the Campaign Reform 

Project, another group of business leaders devoted to reform will serve as 

panelists.  Both groups are partners with Common Cause in a series of 

forums across the country on the role of money in politics.  Joining them 

will be Rebecca Avila, executive director of the Los Angeles City Ethics 

Commission; television journalist Belva Davis; and novelist Richard North 

Patterson.
