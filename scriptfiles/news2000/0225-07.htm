- February 25 - A senior scientist at 

Greenpeace issued a <a href="http://www.greenpeaceusa.org/media/publications/mossville_contamination.pdf">report</a> today criticizing serious flaws 

in an Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 

report on dioxin contamination in the predominantly African 

American town of Mossville, La. 

<p>

&quot;ATSDR claims that the dioxin levels in the soils, chicken 

eggs and breast milk from Mossville are not elevated,&quot; said 

Pat Costner, Greenpeace senior scientist, &quot;but its data 

show that dioxins in the soil are twice as high as the U.S. 

average; dioxins in the breast milk sample are 30 percent 

higher than the U.S. average; and dioxins in the chicken 

eggs are almost twice as high as the level that the Food and 

Drug Adminstration considers to be 'adulterated'.&quot;

<p>

In April 1999, an arm of the U.S. Public Health Service, 

ATSDR, released a report of its investigation of dioxin 

contamination in Mossville. In the report, ATSDR concluded 

that dioxin levels are elevated and higher than the national 

average in some of the people in this small African 

American community. The town is next door to several vinyl 

chloride monomer and chlorine manufacturing facilities that 

emit dioxin. 

<p>

The plight of the impoverished semi-rural town has gained 

national attention as a result of pressure by local residents, 

Greenpeace and national and international human rights 

and environmental protection groups. The community has 

been deemed one of the sickest in the nation by a 

prominent toxicologist. National environmental justice 

organizations and Greenpeace say the community's black 

residents are victims of environmental racism. 

<p>

&quot;ATSDR's study is flawed and so are its recent actions 

toward the community,&quot; said Damu Smith, a Greenpeace 

toxics campaigner. &quot;It has ignored residents health 

concerns by boycotting a scheduled meeting with the 

community this week to explain its own investigation. The 

people deserve answers and environmental justice now.&quot; 

<p>

Without explanation, a top ATSDR official helping to 

coordinate the dioxin investigation has refused to attend a 

meeting with Mossville residents to discuss the agency's 

study. &quot;ATSDR has misinterpreted its incomplete results,&quot; 

added Costner, &quot;and there is evidence of fundamental 

problems in its analysis of dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals 

in Mossville people's blood.&quot;

<p>

The Greenpeace report concludes with a set of 

recommendations, among them are:

<p>

<ul>

<li>Identify and eliminate local sources of dioxins and dioxin-like contaminants.

<li>Declare a moratorium on new permits for industries that are dioxin sources.

<li>Establish a transition planning process to mitigate any potentially negative economic impacts associated with 

    the elimination of dioxin sources.



 

</ul>
