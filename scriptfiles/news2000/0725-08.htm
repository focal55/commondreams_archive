-  

July 25 - An international coalition of human rights and environmental

groups denounced a new UN-corporate collaboration as "threatening the

mission and integrity of the United Nations."  



<p>The coalition sent a letter sent to Secretary General Kofi Annan today

urging him to re-evaluate his partnership with the private sector. The

letter was released as the top executives of some of the world's most

powerful (and destructive) corporations prepared to converge on the UN for

the first Global Compact partners meeting.



<p>Posted on the Corporate Watch website, www.corpwatch.org, the coalition

letter calls a number of the Global Compact's newly announced corporate

participants, including Nike, Shell, Novartis and Rio Tinto "simply

inappropriate for partnerships with the United Nations." In the letter the

coalition charges that the Global Compact allows corporations to "gain all

the benefits of association with the UN without any responsibilities."  



<p>"The first three words of the UN Charter are `We the Peoples.' said John

Cavanagh Director of the Institute for Policy Studies, which endorsed the

letter.  "Private corporations are accountable only to their shareholders,

often in flagrant disregard of the rights of the people who work for them,

live near them, or suffer the consequences of their decisions. Millions of

people who work for or live near several of the 44 firms that have signed

the Global Compact have had their rights denied or abused by these firms"

said Cavanagh.  



<p>"The UN should serve as a counterbalance to corporate globalization rather

than a booster for it," said Victoria Tauli-Corpuz of the Philippines-based

Tebtebba Foundation (Indigenous Peoples' International Centre for Policy

Research and Education)  "It is extremely disappointing to see this most

important institution moving in a direction which seriously compromises its

stated primary objective of working for the well-being of the world's poor."



<p>"The United Nations should be institutionalizing independent mechanisms for

greater corporate accountability to human rights, labor rights and the

environmental instruments and principles instead of pursuing vague

partnerships" said Miloon Kothari of the International NGO Committee on

Human Rights in Trade and Investment (India). 



<p>"The Secretary General seems to think the UN can help `fix' the problems of

globalization by getting serial violators of human rights, labor rights and

the environment to declare that they won't be bad anymore." said Kenny

Bruno, UN Project Coordinator for TRAC-Transnational Resource and Action

Center.  "But the ongoing actions of Nike, Shell, Novartis and others

continue to speak louder than words."  



<p>The coalition of groups from around the world pointed out that the

inclusion of Shell in the Global Compact is in violation of the UN's just

issued guidelines which state that "business entities that are complicit in

human rights abuses...are not eligible for partnership." 



<p>The letter goes on to warn how corporations may use the UN logo under the

new guidelines, asserting that "the UN logo and the Nike swoosh do not

belong together."  The guidelines provide ample opportunity for global

companies to display the UN logo in conjunction with a UN project they may

be involved with, allowing them to enhance their "brand image" by for

instance, placing the Nike swoosh next to the UN olive branches.  



<p>"The UN must not become complicit in the positive branding of corporations

that violate UN principles" said TRAC's Kenny Bruno.  "By doing so, the

world body is essentially allowing corporations to wrap themselves in the

UN flag."

<p>Text of letter follows:



<p>July 25, 2000



<p>His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan<br>

Secretary General<br>

Room 3800<br>

United Nations, NY 10017



<p>Mr. Secretary General,



<p>On July 20th, a number of us wrote asking you to re-assess the Global

Compact and to join us in a "Citizens Compact." We are writing again today

to express our shock upon learning the identities of the corporate partners

for the Global Compact and our disappointment in the Guidelines for

Cooperation Between the United Nations and the Business Community.



<p>In the July 20th letter, we expressed concern that the UN is endorsing a

specific vision of corporate-led globalization that is opposed by many

sectors of civil society. We also suggested that the purely voluntary

nature of the Global Compact may distract from the need for a legal

framework to hold corporations accountable internationally.  



<p>We wrote to you as individuals who care deeply about the United Nations and

on behalf of organizations that have worked for years to strengthen and

support it.



<p>Now, after reviewing the July 17th Guidelines and the initial list of

companies joining the Global Compact, we believe that the Global Compact

and related partnerships threaten the mission and integrity of the United

Nations.



<p>Some of the companies in the partnership are simply inappropriate for

partnerships with the United Nations.



<p>Nike, one of the Global Compact partners and an international symbol of

sweatshops and corporate greed, is the target of one of the most active

global campaigns for corporate accountability. The company has made

announcements of changes to its behavior only after enormous public

pressure.  It has also aggressively opposed the only union and human

rights-group supported independent monitoring program--the Worker Rights

Consortium (WRC).  CEO Phil Knight withdrew a $30 million donation to the

University of Oregon after the University joined the WRC.  Nike also cut

its multimillion dollar contracts with the University of Michigan and Brown

University after they joined the WRC.  Nike became a sweatshop poster child

not just through complicity in labor abuses but through active searching

for countries with non-union labor, low wages, and low environmental

standards for its manufacturing operations.  This has made Nike a leader in

the 'race to the bottom' -a trend that epitomizes the negative tendencies

of corporate-led globalization.



<p>Shell is a corporation with a history of complicity in human rights abuses,

most infamously in Nigeria. Its operations there are also notorious for

environmental contamination and double standards. Shell has adopted

sophisticated rhetoric about its social responsibilities, but it has not

shown understanding, let alone remorse, about its own role. For example, on

its website, Shell posts a photograph of a pro-Ogoni rally, without

acknowledging that the Ogoni people's protests have been against Shell itself.



<p>BP Amoco is another company with sophisticated rhetoric on environmental

and social issues. But their actions do not measure up. CEO John Browne

admits that climate change is a problem for any oil company, yet his

company continues to search for oil and gas even in remote and pristine

regions, while investments in renewable energy are a pittance compared with

the size of the corporation and its investments in ongoing fossil fuel

exploration and production.



<p>Rio Tinto Plc is a British mining corporation which has created so many

environment, human rights, and development problems that a global network

of trade unions, indigenous peoples, church groups, communities and

activists has emerged to fight its abuses. For instance, the company stands

accused of complicity in or direct violations of environmental, labor and

human rights in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Namibia,

Madagascar, the United States and Australia, among others. 



<p>Novartis is engaged in an aggressive public relations and regulatory battle

to force consumers and farmers to accept genetically engineered food,

without full testing for potential harms and without full access to

information. The behavior of Novartis in the area of genetically engineered

foods is diametrically opposed to the precautionary principle, one of the

principles of the Global Compact.



<p>These are but a few of the corporate endorsers of the Global Compact whose

historical and current core activities run counter to the spirit and the

letter of the Compact itself.



<p>The Guidelines on Cooperation Between the United Nations and the Business

Community which you issued on July 20th raise a further, related set of

issues.  These guidelines state that 'business entities that are complicit

in human rights abuses...are not eligible for partnership.' The inclusion

of Shell in the Global Compact violates those guidelines.



<p>The Guidelines also state that a "business entity may be authorized to use

the name and emblem" of the United Nations. As the United Nations

Development Programme has noted, when a company uses the UN logo, "a mutual

image transfer inevitably takes place."  It is dismaying to contemplate

such an image transfer between Nike, Shell, or Rio Tinto and the UN. The UN

logo and the Nike swoosh do not belong together.



<p>The Guidelines state that the use of the UN name may only be used when the

"principal purpose is to show support for the purposes and activities of

the UN..." This guideline does not take into account the modern practice of

branding, by which a corporation sells it image as much as its manufactured

products. Nike, one of the Global Compact partners, is a pioneer of modern

branding. It is obvious that the use of the UN name and logo by

corporations will be not only for short term profit but for the long term

business goal of positive brand image.  The UN must not become complicit in

the positive branding of corporations that violate UN principles.



<p>Given that there is no provision for monitoring a corporation's record in

abiding by UN principles, the Guidelines' modalities for partnerships are

quite susceptible to abuse. For example, a company with widespread labor or

environmental violations may be able to join with the UN in a relatively

minor cooperative project, and gain all the benefits of association with

the UN without any responsibilities. The UN would have no way to determine

whether the company, on balance, is contributing to UN goals or preventing

their realization.



<p>In short, Mr. Secretary General, the Global Compact partnership and the

Guidelines for Cooperation do not "ensure the integrity and independence"

of the United Nations. They allow business entities with poor records to

"bluewash" their image by wrapping themselves in the flag of the United

Nations. They favor corporate-driven globalization rather than the

environment, human health, local communities, workers, farmers, women and

the poor. 



<p>Again, we urge you to re-assess the Global Compact and its partners. We

urge you to re-evaluate your overall approach to UN - corporate

partnerships. The mission and integrity of the United Nations are at stake.
