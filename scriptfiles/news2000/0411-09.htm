- April 11 - At a press conference 

here today, Defenders of Wildlife, the National Family Farm 

Coalition, Friends of the Earth, GREEN and an alliance of more than 

180 other groups called for a congressional investigation of the 

American Farm Bureau Federation, saying that the organization does 

more to hurt than to help family farmers. 



<p>A new Defenders report, Amber Waves of Gain, highlights many 

areas of Farm Bureau operations and gives numerous examples of how 

the Farm Bureau is an organization that may have financial 

interests in mind rather than the interests of family farmers. The 

groups also staged press conferences in seven other cities across 

the country. 



<p>"We started taking a close look at the Farm Bureau when it 

threatened the Yellowstone wolf reintroduction program," said 

Rodger Schlickeisen, Defenders of Wildlife president. "We found 

out that the Farm Bureau not only fights every imaginable 

conservation measure, but it often advocates policies that are 

detrimental to family farmers. It pushes an extremist right-wing 

agenda that has nothing to do with farming and it benefits unfairly 

from its nonprofit tax status. Farm Bureau membership is mostly 

people who have little to do with agriculture." 



<p>Amber Waves of Gain demonstrates that the Farm Bureau 

is an intricate web of interconnecting business interests, 

including insurance companies, agribusiness giants and banks, 

linked with the national federation, the 50 state bureaus and more 

than 2,800 county bureaus. 



<p>During today's press conference, Schlickeisen said the Farm 

Bureau should be investigated for unfair business practices and for 

deceptive representation to its own membership. The Farm Bureau 

avoids paying nearly $61million annually in taxes on unrelated 

business income, he said. 



<p>"In 1996, Congress slipped into law a gift for the Farm Bureau," 

said Schlickeisen. "It exempted the bureau from paying taxes on 

virtually any kind of membership dues. Since the Farm Bureau 

collects membership dues from millions of people who aren't 

involved in agriculture, this translates into tens of millions of 

tax-free dollars from these unrelated business activities." 



<p>Although the bureau claims to be the "voice of agriculture," 

many of its activities support factory farm operations that are 

putting family farmers out of business. 



<p>"Dean Kleckner, the former president of Farm Bureau, gave us a 

formula to survive," said Chris Petersen, a county Farm Bureau 

board member from Iowa. "He told us to adopt new technologies, put 

our families to work in town and raise more crops and livestock. 

We've done all this and we're still losing thousands of family 

farmers each year while Farm Bureau and agribusiness giants team up 

to make billions of dollars." 



<p>Bill Christison, president of the National Family Farm 

Coalition, said the Farm Bureau is rampant with conflicts of 

interest and misrepresentation in developing its farm policy. In 

addition to unwavering support for Freedom to Farm and unfair trade 

policy, "Farm Bureau thinks crop insurance is the fix for our 

failed farm policy," said Christison. "The truth is that crop 

insurance is currently not working for the family farmer, the 

taxpayer or the environment. But it does yield excessive profit for 

Farm Bureau insurance companies." 



<p>Frank Kloucek, a South Dakota state senator, said the Farm 

Bureau facilitates market concentration through its alliances and 

corporate partnerships, and this is crushing family farmers. 

"Family farmers and ranchers have been robbed by the corporate 

raiders long enough," said Kloucek. "Farm Bureau must be held 

accountable for its misrepresentation of independent agriculture 

producers." 



<p>"These are just a few of the reasons all of the groups 

represented today believe Farm Bureau needs to be closely 

examined," said Schlickeisen. "Additionally, Farm Bureau pushes 

agendas to control markets and pushes corporate-friendly 

legislation, both of which eliminates family farmers' ability to 

compete. All the while, Farm Bureau leadership is profiting from 

the suffering of rural America." 



<p>Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth declared, 

"Over the past 30 years the Farm Bureau has consistently opposed 

sound environmental positions to protect the health of our land, 

air and water. The Farm Bureau has been overtly hostile towards a 

safe and healthy environment for the American people. The Farm 

Bureau is not protecting the family farm, the Farm Bureau is 

presiding over the destruction of the family farm and the 

destruction of the American environment." 



<p>The first county farm bureau was founded in 1911 by the Chamber 

of Commerce in Binghamton, N.Y. Today, the Farm Bureau has grown 

into one of the most powerful lobbying forces in Washington, 

recently listed by Fortune Magazine as the 14th most powerful. 

Because of the Farm Bureau's intricate web of nonprofit and 

for-profit businesses, it is hard to estimate the organization's 

total worth. However, it takes in more than $200 million annually 

from membership dues, more than $12 billion in revenue from its 

cooperatives and more than $6.5 billion annually in net insurance 

premiums.

<p>Defenders of Wildlife is a national, nonprofit conservation 

organization with more than 400,000 members and supporters.

their habitat.
