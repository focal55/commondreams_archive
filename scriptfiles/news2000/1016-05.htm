- October 16 - Local supporters of the Green Party

presidential ticket will

join forces with their colleagues from across Illinois on Tuesday

morning to protest the exclusion of Green Party presidential candidate

Ralph Nader from the debate to be held in St. Louis at 8 p.m.



<p>In St. Louis, Illinois Nader supporters will join rallies and protests

outside of the corporate-sponsored debate, which only includes George

Bush and Al Gore.



<p>“People are getting angrier about the arrogance of the major parties.

Who do they think they are? First, the Democrats spend months trying to

take Nader off the ballot in Illinois; now they conspire together to

keep Nader out of the debates.” said Dan Johnson-Weinberger, Illinois

coordinator for the Nader campaign. “Ralph Nader has drawn the biggest

crowds of any candidate – 10,000 in Chicago last Tuesday, 15,000 in New

York last Friday. The corporate-backed parties must not be allowed to

silence a candidate favored by millions of progressive voters.”



<p>The statewide caravan of Nader supporters will get its start in Chicago

on Tuesday morning at 8 a.m. on Solidarity Drive, near the Adler

Planetarium. From there, the caravan will split into two groups, one

heading to Bloomington-Normal for a rally there, and the other to

Champaign-Urbana and then on to Decatur. Both groups will meet in

Springfield, and then together roll down to St. Louis. Groups from

Peoria and Carbondale will also join the caravan.



<p>At each city, Green protestors will call attention to the exclusionary

tactics of the two-party system and to the need for a grassroots

democratic movement to take political control away from corporate

sponsors and lobbyists and return power to voters.



<p>The caravan will arrive heading to the Washington University campus in

St. Louis, where the Republican and Democratic candidates, George Bush

and Al Gore, are scheduled to appear in a televised debate sponsored by

Anheuser-Busch Brewing Company.



<p>Nader will be in St. Louis Tuesday along with hundreds of his Illinois

supporters.
