- February 17 - The following was



     released today by New Hampshire Peace Action:

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scott Ritter, the former UNSCOM weapons inspector and an



      authority on Iraq's military capabilities, continues to be ignored



      by presidential candidates who refuse to meet with him.

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, in the last three days two UN officials, Hans von



      Sponeck, head of the "Oil for Food" Program, and Jutta Burghardt,



      head of the UN's World Food Program in Iraq, have resigned their



      posts in protest of the Iraq sanctions policy. In addition to Denis



      Halliday, the former head of the "Oil for Food" program, that makes



      four high ranking UN officials who have denounced the sanctions.

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Candidates George W. Bush, John McCain, Al Gore, and Bill



      Bradley, have all been challenged to meet with Scott Ritter. The



      four were notified of Ritter's desire to speak with them at recent



      open forums around New Hampshire as well as through repeated phone



      calls and faxes to their campaign offices.

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ritter has challenged all politicians to answer this question:



      "If you want to displace Saddam, how many American soldiers are you



      willing to get killed? If your answer is zero, how many Iraqi kids



      are you willing to kill under the sanctions?" Ritter stated that



      the sanctions strengthen's Saddam's control over Iraq and are both



      strategically ineffective and morally reprehensible. Ritter stated,



      "I resent having the moral character of the U.S. stained in this



      manner."

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bradley's campaign promised to speak with Ritter over a week ago



      but has not followed through. Ritter did speak with McCain's policy



      aides and he was told they would advise the Senator of Ritter's



      positions and his desire for a meeting. However, McCain has so far



      refused to meet with Ritter and will not alter his position on the



      Iraq sanctions policy. Both Gore and Bush refuse to comment.

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the UN, sanctions kill over 90,000 civilians each



      year and more than 5,000 children each month from disease and lack



      of proper medications that are banned under the "dual usage"



      program. After ten years, the sanctions have failed to remove



      Saddam while Iraqi civilians, mostly children, have continued to



      suffer and die.<br>
