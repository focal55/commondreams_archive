- May 19 - Congressional



environmental champions today joined leading environmental groups



in denouncing Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China.



The coalition, led by members of the House Natural Resources



Committee, Minority Whip David Bonior, Friends of the Earth, Sierra



Club and The Humane Society pledged to vigorously oppose a trade



agreement which turns a blind eye toward environmental protection.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We should neither put our seal of approval on this flawed



agreement, nor give up our</font>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> annual opportunity to scrutinize the



environmental implications of U.S.-China trade," says the letter



sent today by Reps. DeFazio (D-OR), Miller (D-CA), Andrews (D-NJ),



Bonior (D-MI), Pelosi (D-CA), Stark (D-CA), Kaptur (D-OH) and



Woolsey (D-CA).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter cites a litany of missed opportunities to address



vital environmental problems like trade in endangered species,



global warming and potential destruction caused by invasive



species. It stresses that the U.S. should have sought assurances



that China would not seek to weaken endangered species regulations



and invasive species protections once it enters the World Trade



Organization (WTO). The letter also notes that the trade deal



failed to promote the export of clean, renewable energy technology



to China, where two million people die annually due to air



pollution.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmentalists have accused the U.S. of negotiating a trade



deal that prioritizes benefits to big business at the expense of



the planet.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The trade deal is a 250 page smoking gun that proves how U.S.



trade policy has been captured by corporate polluters and fat cat



campaign contributors," said Friends of the Earth president Brent



Blackwelder. "The Administration found time to negotiate tariffs



on golf carts and weasel tail hair, but didn't even put anything on



the table that remotely addressed the safety of the air and water



we depend upon for survival."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth joined the Sierra Club, the Humane Society,



Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, Defenders of Wildlife, Rainforest



Action Network, American Lands Alliance, and the Center for



International Environmental Law last week in urging Congress to



vote against PNTR. Many congressional opponents of PNTR, most



recently Rep. Andrews (D-NJ), have cited environmental concerns as



a key deciding factor.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Tuesday May 23rd, environmental groups will join with the



labor and human rights organizations for a protest vigil at the



Capitol urging Congress to vote against against PNTR for China.
