- September 27 - Ralph Nader campaigned today in Youngstown, Ohio, blasting the corporate 

          prison industry as well as the Clinton Administration and George W. 

          Bush for encouraging its growth. The Corrections Corporation of America, 

          the largest multinational prison corporation operating in the United 

          States, operates a 1,700-inmate facility in Youngstown, the Northeast 

          Ohio Correctional Center, and plans to build two more facilities and 

          add 5,500 beds in the Youngstown area. </font>

        <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Speaking 

          at Youngstown State University this afternoon, Nader called the prison 

          industry “one of the most ill-conceived ventures corporations have ever 

          entered into,” and challenged Vice-President Gore and Governor Bush 

          to give back the more than $100,000 in soft money that corporations 

          running for-profit prisons have given to both the DNC and RNC. </font></p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">“The 

          goal of the criminal justice system should be to increase public safety,” 

          Nader said today. “For-profit prisons make a mockery of this goal. By 

          treating inmates as profitable commodities, corporate prisons obscure 

          a public policy that should be aimed at reducing the incarceration rate 

          through treatment and rehabilitation.” </font></p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Nader 

          also questioned the safety of private prisons and the economic rationale 

          behind them. “So-called cost saving techniques have resulted in reductions 

          in human rights and health care quality for inmates, and under-prepared 

          staffs unable to deal with violent criminals or even inmate escapes. 

          For those interested in the economics, studies have shown that private 

          prisons are just as expensive to the taxpayer as public ones, without 

          factoring in the manifold costs to society of a poorly run correctional 

          system.” The growth of the corporate prison industry also brings with 

          it the specter of increased use of prison labor in the coming century.</font></p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;'> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">“It 

          doesn’t take rocket science to figure out what drives this industry,” 

          Nader told Youngstown residents. “Politicians pander to fears of crime, 

          the prison population booms, and corporations view what should be considered 

          a national crisis as a profit-making opportunity.” Nader also noted 

          that communities like Youngstown that have suffered from the loss of 

          manufacturing jobs and high unemployment rates are especially vulnerable 

          to corporate prisons moving in. “CCA sold this prison as a valid form 

          of economic development, received tax breaks and free utilities from 

          gullible public officials, and is now underpaying its own workers.” 

          Nader cited figures showing some CCA salaries at $24,600, barely a living 

          wage.</font></p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 

          The corporate-prison industry has boomed under the eight years of the 

          Clinton Administration, particularly in George W. Bush’s Texas, where 

          overcrowding and increasing incarceration rates have led to corporations 

          building prisons and adding beds on speculation. The federal government 

          has also primed the corporate-prison pump in recent years, contracting 

          out convicts and illegal aliens to for-profit prisons. Nader today challenged 

          Gore and Bush “to give back the money, and tell corporations to get 

          out of the prison industry.”
