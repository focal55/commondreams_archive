          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - February 

            15 - A front page New York Times story reported Sunday on passages 

            of State Department documents which show that the U.S. government 

            knew far more than it acknowledged about the murder of two U.S. citizens 

            in Chile. Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi, who supported the democratically 

            elected government of Salvador Allende, were detained and murdered 

            in September 1973 in the days following Gen. Augusto Pinochet's bloody 

            military coup backed by the U.S. government. Their execution was the 

            subject of the film "Missing." The following people are available 

            for interviews: </font></p>

            <a href="mailto:pkorn@gwu.edu">pkorn@gwu.edu</a>, <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv">http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv</a> 

            <br>

            National Security Archive senior analyst Kornbluh, who has led the 

            campaign for the release of documents on the U.S. role in Chile, said 

            today: "The Horman case is at the core of the hidden history of U.S. 

            involvement in Pinochet's coup and the repression that followed. After 

            years of being covered up, it is imperative that all documents relating 

            to the death of Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi -- particularly those 

            of the CIA and the Defense Department -- finally be declassified."

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JOYCE HORMAN <br>

            The widow of Charles Horman, who has worked to uncover the facts about 

            his murder for 26 years, said today: "I want to know who gave the 

            order -- and why. We have now learned that the State Department shared 

            our view in the late '70s that there was culpability within the U.S. 

            government in the murder of Charlie Horman. If we had known that at 

            the time, we would have continued our legal case against Henry Kissinger 

            and other State Department officials. The CIA now says that it will 

            release its documents. I hope that's true this time. We need to know 

            who committed the murder and who should be held accountable. There 

            needs to be release of documents; congressional pressure can help 

            make that happen. The U.S. government should ask the government of 

            Chile to release all information they have -- and to provide an official 

            explanation of the circumstances of the murder of Charles Horman. 

            The new government, which seems to represent a solid rooting of democracy 

            in Chile, should be more helpful in telling the truth of what happened 

            to Charlie." </font></p>

            Lawyer for Joyce Horman since 1976, Weiss is with the Center for Constitutional 

            Rights. He said today: "It is ironic that we recall our ambassador 

            to Austria for pro-Nazi statements by a government official, but are 

            unwilling to reveal the truth of our complicity in Nazi-type acts 

            against U.S. citizens in Chile. When asked why he did nothing to help 

            save Charlie [who he gave a ride to], Captain Ray E. Davis, head of 

            the U.S. military mission to Chile at the time of the coup, told the 

            Times, 'We weren't down there to cause trouble.' He is wrong -- they 

            were there to cause trouble. It is time that U.S. complicity in this 

            crime be revealed." </font></p>
