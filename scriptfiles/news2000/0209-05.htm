<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 9 - Today the Council for a Livable World Education Fund released its new

report detailing various weapons sold by the U.S. to selected abusive

governments around the world.  Entitled "Human Rights and Weapons: Records

of Selected U.S. Arms Clients," this study not only describes the type,

number, and dollar value of some of the weapons sold to these countries by

the U.S., but also in what kinds of abusive practices the security forces

of those nations engage.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report notes that:



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The U.S. delivered numerous small arms to Colombia for its anti-drug

efforts in the last decade, and licensed for sale 5,500 pistols and

revolvers, as well as riot control chemicals to Colombia last year.

Colombian security forces "committed numerous, serious violations of human

rights throughout the year," including torture and over 20 cases of

extra-judicial killing. 



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Turkey, one of the U.S.'s largest arms buyers, received 9 F-16s, as

well as several missiles in 1998.  They were cleared to buy 200 armored

personnel carriers and riot control equipment that year as well.  According

to the State Department, extra-judicial killing and torture are still

widespread in Turkey, including one case of torturing a two and a half year

old boy.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Indonesia, which recently withdrew from illegally occupied East Timor

after 25 years, was cited by the State Department for "serious human rights

abuses," including torture techniques of stapling and electric shock, as

well as one case of police torturing a seven month old baby.  The U.S.

continued to train Indonesian armed forces in 1998, as well as sell and

deliver weapons, such as  ammunition and logistical/supply equipment.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eritrea and Ethiopia, two of the world's poorest countries, began

fighting in 1998.  That did not stop the U.S. from selling each side

weapons, or delivering previously purchased ones.  The majority of the

support was for logistics, supply, and training.  Ethiopia bought $10

million worth of weapons from the Pentagon in 1998.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Combining human rights and arms trade data into one document will hopefully

demonstrate the connection between human rights abuses perpetrated by these

countries and the U.S. military equipment they receive.  It is also meant

to show that the State Department, which supposedly takes human rights into

account when licensing arms exports, fails to do so, or at least not in any

meaningful manner.  



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As U.S. forces are increasingly used to quell regional conflicts around the

world, the chances that they will face American weapons increases.  This

report illustrates that if the U.S., the world's number one arms dealer,

wants to promote regional stability and protect its troops, then it should

curtail arms sales, particularly small arms, to abusive governments or

areas of conflict.
