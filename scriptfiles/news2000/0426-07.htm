<br>

On her 24th birthday, Sonneborn was informed that her husband was killed in

Vietnam. Twenty years later, she felt compelled to travel to Vietnam. The

result was "Regret to Inform," an Academy Award nominated film (nationally

broadcast on PBS earlier this year) which documents the experiences of

widows from of all sides of the Vietnam-American war. She is now organizing

the Widows of War Living Memorial -- <a href="http://www.widowsofwar.org">www.widowsofwar.org</a> -- which

provides a forum for widows of war to tell their stories and become a force

for peace. Said Sonneborn: "When I went to Vietnam I knew that war was the

enemy, not the Vietnamese people."

<br>

A former Air Force captain who served in Vietnam, Willson is writing his

memoirs. He said today: "We need to acknowledge the horrific harms we caused

both the Southeast Asians and ourselves, so that we can genuinely heal. It

revealed our dark psyche, but we can use that to redeem ourselves, as vets

do."

A U.S. policy analyst during the Vietnam War, Ellsberg released the Pentagon

Papers, a study by the U.S. government that documented its own deceit. He is

available for interviews beginning Thursday.

<br>

Professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of

"Manufacturing Consent" and "After the Cataclysm: Postwar Vietnam and the

Reconstruction of Imperial Ideology," Herman said: "The United States did

not lose the Vietnam war; it failed to win -- or to achieve its main objective

of keeping control of South Vietnam in the hands of a minority government

of U.S. choice. But it was successful in so devastating all of Vietnam (and

Cambodia and Laos as well) as to end any 'threat' that Vietnam would offer

an alternative route to development. The long postwar boycott, based on the

fact that the aggressor has seen itself as the victim, helped ensure that

Vietnam would not recover from its severe wounds."

Editor of "The Vietnam War in American Stories, Songs, and Poems," author of

"M.I.A. Or Mythmaking in America" and the forthcoming "Vietnam and Other

American Fantasies," Rutgers University professor Franklin said today: "One

cannot understand today's America without comprehending how the Vietnam War

has been transformed into fantasies permeating our culture. The antiwar

movement was not hostile to veterans -- it was led by veterans and GIs.

Contrary to much mythology, no POWs were left behind."

<br>

Author of "Lessons of the Vietnam War," Starr said today: "The seeds of

conflict typically are planted years ahead in actions taken and

opportunities ignored by political leaders not held accountable by an

independent press. Vietnam was avoidable. Unless the people's leaders and

press take seriously the need for an informed citizenry, the wars to come

will not be."</font>
