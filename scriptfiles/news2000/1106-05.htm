- November 6 - David Brower was the greatest environmentalist and conservationist of the

20th Century. He was an indefatigable champion of every worthwhile effort to

protect the environment over the last seven decades.  His death is a

tremendous loss.



<p>The monuments to his work dot the landscape of the nation's environmental

movement. He founded Friends of the Earth  along with the League of

Conservation Voters and initiated the founding of  Friends of the Earth

organizations throughout the world.



<p>Much of his work was devoted to wild lands and Brower was in the forefront

in helping to develop national parks and seashores in King Canyon, the North

Cascades, the Redwoods, Great Basin, Alaska, Cape Cod, Fire Island and Point

Reyes.  He led the way in protecting primeval forest in Olympic National

Park and wilderness on San Gorgonio.



<p>His courage and dedication must be given great credit in keeping dams out of

Dinosaur National Monument, the Yukon and the Grand Canyon and in

establishing the National Wilderness Preservation System. The list of his

accomplishments fill chapters in the history of the world's environmental

movements. Future generations will be the major beneficiaries of his

willingness to take up the tough battles for the preservation of the earth.



<p>The environmental movement has lost a champion, and I have lost a dear and

valued friend.
