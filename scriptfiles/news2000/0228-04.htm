- February 28 - The

          Christian Coalition's lawsuit against the Internal Revenue Service is

          a desperation move that is certain to fail, according to Americans

          United for Separation of Church and State.</font>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Feb.

          25 the Coalition filed suit against the IRS in U.S. district court in

          Norfolk, charging that the federal tax agency unfairly denied the

          group tax exemption.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Said

          Americans United Executive Director Barry W. Lynn, &quot;This lawsuit

          is an act of desperation by a group that has lost much of its

          membership and even more of its credibility. There is not a shred of

          evidence that the current IRS has any ideological bias.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn

          said a mountain of evidence shows that TV preacher Pat Robertson's

          group is a political machine that does not deserve tax exemption.

          Americans United has submitted volumes of evidence to the IRS

          documenting the Coalition's political character, Lynn said, including

          a tape of a closed-door Robertson speech in which the TV preacher

          called on the group's state leaders to emulate Tammany Hall, one of

          the most corrupt political machines of American history.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The

          Christian Coalition deserves tax exemption about as much as Bob Jones

          University deserves an award from the NAACP,&quot; quipped Lynn.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn

          said the lawsuit is probably motivated by mundane political concerns.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;After

          the IRS denied the Coalition tax exemption last year, Robertson and

          his cronies tried to do an end-run,&quot; Lynn noted. &quot;They

          announced that they would use the tax exemption of the group's Texas

          affiliate for the national organization. But they made it clear that

          they would keep doing the partisan political projects that made the

          IRS rule against them in the first place.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This

          pathetic shell game is very unlikely to fool the IRS,&quot; Lynn

          continued. &quot;The Coalition is probably going into court now to try

          to position itself to fight off renewed IRS scrutiny.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

          Coalition has not changed its mendacious ways. It is currently

          preparing to distribute supposedly unbiased voter guides for the

          California presidential primary that are actually stacked to favor

          Republican candidate George W. Bush and lambaste his leading opponent,

          John McCain. Congressional candidates are also targeted.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn

          also charged that the lawsuit is a fund-raising ploy.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Robertson's

          group has faced severe financial and personnel problems,&quot; Lynn

          noted. &quot;The lawsuit is undoubtedly a way to show donors that it

          still has some fight left in it. I expect the fund-raising letters are

          already rolling out.&quot;</font></p>
