- October 18 - Ralph Nader was denied entry last night to the

campus of Washington University by the Commission on Presidential

Debates, despite the fact that he had a valid pass and was scheduled be

interviewed by WUTV, the campus television station.  This marks the

second time in two weeks that the CPD, in association with local law

enforcement, has unlawfully denied Nader access to a university campus

hosting a presidential debate.



<p>“Once again the crooked debate commission run by Al Gore and George W.

Bush violated my civil rights and the rights of the student television

station by politically excluding me from entering the campus of

Washington University in order to give WUTV an interview, which had been

previously scheduled,” Nader said.



<p>“I had the necessary perimeter pass to enter the campus, which I showed

to the police, and I was excluded even though others in my group with

the exact same badges were allowed at the same time into the campus by

the same police.  Once again the CPD has sowed the seeds of its own

future political destruction.”



<p>Nader yesterday filed suit against the CPD in United States District

Court in Massachusetts for unlawfully preventing him from entering a

viewing room and conducting an invited televison interview by Fox News

on the premises of University of Massachusetts Boston during the first

presidential debate on October 3.



<p>“I urge an apology from Gore and Bush for the violation of my civil

rights by commissioners who are under their influence and direction,”

Nader stated tonight. “In addition to being excluded from an interview

with the campus television station under the direction of Gabriel Roth,

I was deprived of the opportunity to be interviewed on the premises of

Washington University by other members of the media.”



<p>Nader was denied entrance to the Washington University campus at the

intersection of Skinker and Forsyth at approximately 6:45 yesterday

evening by a CPD official who would not identify himself.



<p>“The entire sordid episode, which adds an even greater stigma to the

arrogance of power displayed by the Republican and Democratic parties,

was recorded by two dozen radio, TV and print reporters who observed the

entire interaction with the police, the campus police director, and the

cowardly representative of the debate commission who refused to identify

himself as he slithered through the crowd to tell me that I had been

excluded and quickly slithered back into his lair without having

identified himself,” Nader said.



<p>Gabriel Roth, a cameraman with WUTV, who was to conduct the interview

with Nader, confirmed the unique treatment given to Mr. Nader by the CPD

and law enforcement.  “Throughout the day, people with the green host

pass (that Mr. Nader had) were able to get into the perimeter area in

which the interview was to be conducted.  Two of Mr. Nader’s staff had

the same green host pass and they walked right past the security

checkpoint.”



<p>“What was even more stupid,” Nader stated, “is that the CPD instructed

the law enforcement officers to give no reason for my exclusion, no

legal grounds for my exclusion—a clear demonstration of arbitrary and

unlawful authority.  I informed the police that they were being given an

unlawful political order by the debate commission and that they would

likely find themselves in court along with CPD officials.  The head of

Washington University security did not seem comfortable fulfilling the

unlawful task that he was given, or the manner in which he was

politically manipulated for partisan reasons by the Gore/Bush

commission.



<p>“After the election we will help establish a people’s debate commission

which will destroy the monopoly of access to tens of millions of

American voters that is now held by this corrupt, corporate-funded

private company, the Commission on Presidential Debates.”
