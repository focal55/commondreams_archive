- July 7 - Despite loud claims from the Pentagon and Boeing about

the usefulness of tonight's test of the proposed national missile defense,

tomorrow the U.S. will not be much closer in determining whether the

Pentagon's current plan will work or is ready for deployment.

	

<p>Whether the test is a success or failure, it will be only the third of 19

scheduled missile warhead intercept tests -- less than 16%.  Moreover, the

booster rocket that would be used in 2005 has yet to be tested and the

interceptor used tonight is only a prototype. 

	

<p>Two previous intercept tests of the ABM system have resulted in one failure

and one partial success.  Tonight's test will not be much more complex than

the last test, which failed.  The only added difficulty is testing whether

the information gathered about the incoming target can be transmitted to

the interceptor "kill vehicle" while in flight.  

	

<p>"No car manufacturer would decide whether to build a new automobile based

on only three of 19 tests," said John Isaacs, president of Council for a

Livable World. "No new computer system would be placed on the market with

such a paucity of market data," Isaacs continued. 



<p>The Pentagon has promised to recommend a course of action  (Deployment

Readiness Review) to President Clinton in the weeks after the test, while

the President has committed to a deployment decision before the fall.

	

<p>Pentagon leaders have suggested they can recommend a "go" decision whether

or not an intercept occurs in space this evening.  They argue that this

relatively easy test is needed because the system must "walk before it can

run."

	

<p>However, a decision on spending $60 billion -- the Congressional Budget

Office cost estimate of the Clinton plan over the next 15 years -- should

not be made with such inadequate data.



<p>In recent weeks, a number of prominent individuals, former government

officials, Nobel laureates and foreign policy experts have called on

President Clinton not to deploy national  missile defense.  (For a list

see:  <a href="http://www.clw.org/ef/bmdopposition.html">www.clw.org/ef/bmdopposition.html</a>)



<p>"The bottom line is that national missile defense is still not ready for

prime time.  The President should heed the call from so many experts and

defer any deployment decision into the next Administration," Isaacs concluded.
