- July 21 - This week, Priests for



Life, an organization of Catholic priests, launched an ad campaign



calling on lawmakers and voters to restrict abortion. In today's New



York Times, Priests for Life ran a



full-page ad stating, "To those who would allow abortion and claim

to



be Christian, we say, 'STOP BEING A SCANDAL TO THE GOSPEL OF JESUS



CHRIST'." In response, the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive



director of The Interfaith Alliance, issued the following statement:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This ad seeks to create a political litmus test for determining



Christian identity. To suggest that an individual is not a true



Christian because he or she holds a different view on abortion is



manipulating religion in a way that is dangerous, divisive and lacks



civility. Abortion is a complex and passionate issue that divides



Christians as well as other religious communities. While we don't



take a position on the issue of abortion, we recognize the necessity



of creating a civil environment that fosters open debate where people



of faith can have honest differences without having their faith



called into question."

<i>Founded in 1994, The Interfaith Alliance (TIA) is a non-partisan



clergy-led grassroots organization dedicated to promoting the



positive and healing role of religion in the life of the nation and



challenging those who manipulate religion to promote intolerance.



With more than 100,000 members drawn from over 50 faith traditions,



clergy-led local Alliances in 38 states, and a national network of



activists in every state, TIA promotes civility, mutual respect, and



cooperation in our increasingly-diverse society.</i></font>
