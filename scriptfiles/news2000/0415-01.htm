<b>Doctors Say Corporate Globalization is Bad For Your Health – M.D.s Speak 

Out:</b><br>

IMF/World Bank policies aren't just bad for your pocketbook – they're bad 

for your health, say physicians world-wide. IMF/World Bank austerity measures 

gut health programs around the globe and undermine international efforts 

to alleviate the spread of mass epidemics.  Dr. Quentin Young of Physicians 

for a National Health Program will lead a march to the World Bank to demand 

health justice.<br>

When: 7:15 p.m., Saturday, April 15<br>

<b>World Bank, IMF Fan Flames of AIDS Epidemic – ACT UP! Fights Back:</b><br>

Bank and IMF Structural Adjustment Programs gut health care and other key 

social services in 'developing' countries. That means shutting down AIDS 

response programs. Speakers from ACT UP! and the HIV Community Coalition 

will provide the facts on how corporate globalization exacerbates the global 

AIDS epidemic and impedes treatment and education programs.<br>

When: 1-3:30 p.m., Saturday, April 15<br>

Where: All Soul's Church, 16th St. @ Columbia, N.W.<br>

More info: Rob Weissman, (202) 387-8030<p>
