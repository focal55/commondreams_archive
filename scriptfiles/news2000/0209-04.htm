- February 9 - A highly respected research group, known for its analysis on civic

      issues, today released a study blasting the growing practice by states and

      local governments to &quot;farm out&quot; the delivery of critical social

      support services to private companies. The community-based report, as the

      first of its kind, studies the long-term social impact of privatization. &quot;Rather

      than provide a quick fix, &#145;privatization&#146; consistently inflicts harm

      across program areas,&quot;<b> </b>observes the Durham,  NC-based Institute

      for Southern Studies.      

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pointing to case studies of privatized public programs for healthcare,

      corrections, and support of poor children, the report, titled<i> Private

      Gain, Public Pain</i>, cites numerous examples where the intention of the

      contracts backfired calamitously onto an already strapped program and its

      most vulnerable participants. Since the private/public arrangement is

      disproportionately prevalent in the southern United States, the watchdog

      group focused on examples in Florida, Tennessee, and

      Mississippi.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Findings cited in the 32 page report include:</font></p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">          

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. As corporations slash overhead to boost profit margins, poor

          quality services, fewer jobs with worse conditions, and loss of

          predicted cost savings occur. Meanwhile, problems in publicly

          funded programs continue and often are exacerbated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. To maximize profits, private providers often favor one group of

          clients or service recipients over others, limiting access by charging

          higher costs, or reducing the time and resources spent to serve each

          individual, resulting in a pattern of preferential treatment

          leaving the weakest most harmed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. By minimizing community input; shifting the focus away from

          community needs; and leaving communities uninformed, privatizing

          services degrades the public's ability to monitor services, be

          involved in decision-making, or otherwise hold an agency accountable.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

        </font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The results clearly indicate that members of a community are the

      true watchdogs in assuring that reforms take place,&quot; said ISS

      Research Director, Kim Diehl, one of the study&#146;s authors.

      &quot;Concerned citizens, community leaders, and public officials need to

      create better and more thoughtful alternatives for the improvement of

      public services,&quot; adds co-author Keith Ernst.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report recommends:</font></p>

<p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regulatory Oversight: Legislatively require procedures and

        criteria for performance review.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Set Standards: Require agencies to meet threshold criteria for

        cost savings, protections for the public and rights of workers. Require

        that companies demonstrate they have not violated environmental, labor,

        or other community standards<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Community-based evaluation: Encourage public discussion, such as

        town meetings and an informed press to assess root causes of problems.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Increased community awareness: Educate the public and

        policymakers on problems by airing concerns via letters to editors,

        internet bulletin boards and contacting elected officials.

<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Target solutions: Identify and advocate for specific reforms.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Freedom of Information: Extend public disclosure requirements of

        government agencies to the corporations that take over public services.</font>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
