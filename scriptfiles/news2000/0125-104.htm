<br>From Seattle to Des Moines to New Hampshire: The People's

<br>Challenge and the People's Agenda

<p>Round One, The Battle in Seattle,

<br>Round Two, The People's Challenge, Des Moines, Iowa

<br>Round Three, The People's Agenda, Manchester, New Hampshire

<p>On Jan. 12, a grassroots alliance of more than 100 environmental,

religious, farm and other organizations issued a "People's Challenge"



to the presidential candidates in Des Moines, Iowa, at a National



Environment, Labor and Farm Day of Action. Following on the heels of



the protests in Seattle against the World Trade Organization and its



assault on farmers, workers and the environment, some of these same



groups and organizations are now carrying infusing the spirit of



Seattle into the presidential campaign arena. The groups are



demanding that the presidential candidates begin addressing America's



growing farm, worker and environmental crisis. As the citizens'



alliance grows, we will add other issues (e.g. campaign finance



reform) to the "People's Agenda." A delegation of leaders from the



various organizations traveled to the campaign offices of the major



presidential candidates in Des Moines to deliver (and hand-delivered



to candidates Bradley, McCain, Hatch, Forbes and Bauer) "The People's



Challenge":

<p>We challenged each and every candidate for president of the United

States to articulate a plan on the following questions by no later



than Wednesday, Jan. 19.

<p>1) What is your plan for the management of our federal public

lands?

<br>

2) What is your plan for guaranteeing workers the freedom to

organize without retaliation from corporations, and to protect



workers who strike from being permanently replaced?

<br>

3) What is your plan from protecting small family farms and other

small businesses in this country?

<p>Gore and Bradley's Iowa staff were cordial and engaging. Bush's

staff were nervous and offered us home-baked cookies. Forbes' staff



showed us the door. Despite promises by several of the candidates and



their staff to respond, none did.

<p>On Thursday morning, Jan. 27, we will send a delegation to engage

the candidates themselves at local campaign stops in Manchester to



discuss the People's Agenda. This will be followed by a press



conference to share with the voters what we have learned about the



candidates' positions on the issues that matter to millions of



Americans.

<p>Further details on Thursday's delegation visits and press

conference will be released to the media on Wednesday.
