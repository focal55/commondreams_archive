- April 9 - The following was 

released today by National People's Action: 



<p>Daniel F. Ackerson, board member of American Express, received 

a visit today at his home, 1100 Mill Ridge Rd. in McLean, Virginia, 

from some 450 leaders of grassroots neighborhood groups concerned 

about the role of the corporation in financing predatory subprime 

mortgage lending. 



<p>American Express is one of the largest investors in First 

Alliance, a Minnesota based mortgage lender notorious for 

originating "ripoff" loans, say advocates. American Express made 

more than $89 million on First Alliance investors last year. The 

company has the power to stop First Alliance, which recently 

declared bankruptcy to avoid paying off on scads of lawsuits that 

have been filed throughout the country, from making more predatory 

loans. American Express and its shareholders also benefit from 

loans made by First Alliance, another predatory subprime mortgage 

lender. 



<p>A recent joint investigation of 20/20 and The New York Times 

explored the link between investment banking firms such as Lehman 

Brothers, part of the AmEx corporation, and Minnesota-based First 

Alliance. The company has helped First Alliance originate loans 

that lead borrowers into foreclosure or toward losing their homes 

due to high fees and high interest rates. 



<p>"We're asking Mr. Ackerson to be the person who convinces AmEx 

to put people before profits and stop Wall Street money from 

flowing to firms that make equity theft loans -- loans that benefit 

the lenders and brokers rather than the borrowers," says Gale 

Cincotta, national chairperson of National People's Action. 



<p>Predatory subprime mortgage lending is issue number one for 

grassroots activists from across the country who will be in 

Washington, D.C., Sunday, April 9 and Monday April 10. 



<p>Neighborhood groups are concerned about all facets of the 

refinance business. This starts with the mortgage brokers who 

target homeowners for refinance loans in order to collect juicy 

kickbacks from lenders -- as much as 10 percent or more of the 

principal of the loan in many individuals' cases. The lenders, too, 

must be held responsible for charging an appropriate level of 

interest and realistic fees. So too the Wall Street investment 

firms that put up capital to make these loans possible and which 

rake in profits on loans that set people up for foreclosure. 

Federal regulators and the secondary market also have roles to play 

in ensuring that subprime lending has no adverse effects on 

communities. 



<p>"Subprime lending is the Wild West of the mortgage market right 

now," says Cincotta. "Unless we regulate the interest rates and 

fees that subprime, high-interest-rate lenders can charge, more 

families are going to lose their homes and more communities in the 

city and suburbs will have abandoned buildings." 



<p>National People's Action is a 29-year-old coalition of 302 

grassroots neighborhood groups based in 38 states.
