- May 8 - Today, the auto industry and their allies in Congress are

     poised to launch another salvo in their continuing attack on the

     environment with a rider to the Department of Transportation

     Appropriations bill freezing automotive miles per gallon standards.

     This rider, introduced today in the House Appropriations

     Transportation Subcommittee blocks the Administration from even

     studying whether to update the most successful energy savings measure

     Congress has ever passed-- the law setting Corporate Average Fuel

     Economy (CAFE) standards.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This sneaky, backdoor effort does a severe disservice to American

     consumers while harming the environment," said Daniel Becker, Director

     of the Sierra Club's Global Warming and Energy Program.  "With this

     rider, Congress is turning its back on high oil prices and pollution

     by actively working to keep gas-guzzling cars on the market and

     increase our emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to global

     warming."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Currently, CAFE standards save more than three million barrels of oil

     a day, and save the owner of an average new car $3,000 at the gas pump

     each year.  Since 1995, a rider on the Transportation funding bill has

     blocked the agency from studying new standards.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Year after year, this rider allows the auto industry to neglect

     modern fuel-saving technologies in favor of forcing consumers to buy

     more gas," said Ann Mesnikoff, Sierra Club Washington Representative.

     "By adding this rider, Congress lets automakers rely upon outdated

     technology when alternatives that save consumers money and slash

     global warming pollution continue to collect dust on the shelf."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The freeze rider denies the purchasers of SUVs and other light trucks

     the benefits of existing fuel saving technologies. The CAFE standards

     for light trucks has gone largely unchanged for 19 years.  Due to the

     increasing number of these vehicles, the average fuel economy of all

     new passenger vehicles sold in 1999 sank to its lowest point since

     1980.  Cars and light trucks alone guzzle 40 percent of the oil used

     in the United States.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This rider stands in the way of the biggest single step the U.S. can

     take to curb global warming and save oil -- raising miles per gallon

     standards for cars and light trucks," Becker said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     A substantial increase in CAFE standards would result in a net

     increase of 244,000 jobs nationwide, with 47,000 of these in the auto

     industry, according to a study by the American Council for an Energy

     Efficient Economy.  Improved standards would reduce pollution,

     including cancer-causing hydrocarbons.  America's cars and light

     trucks are responsible for 20 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide pollution

     that causes global warming.  The EPA predicts that the impacts of

     global warming could include sea-level rise, decreased crop

     production, and extreme heat waves and storms.</font>
