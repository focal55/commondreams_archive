          - February 15 - Following is a statement by Common Cause President Scott 

          Harshbarger: </font> 

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The flawed campaign 

            finance proposal released today by Governor George W. Bush fails the 

            test of reform because it leaves in place the kind of soft money that 

            played such a big role in the campaign finance scandals of 1996. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1996 campaign 

            finance scandals revolved around huge, unregulated and unlimited soft 

            money donations that would have been illegal if given directly to 

            candidates because of the contributions' size and source. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, the Bush 

            proposal fails to adequately address the soft money scandal. His proposal 

            is silent on the subject of soft money spilling into federal elections 

            through state party committees, and would allow unlimited and unregulated 

            donations from the wealthiest individuals in America, many of whom 

            have business pending before Congress. In fact, more than a quarter 

            of soft money already comes from individuals -- many of the top soft 

            money individual donors are actually founders, chairs, CEOs, directors, 

            or executives of major corporations. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Second, the Bush 

            proposal is not even-handed. Bush's so-called "paycheck protection" 

            act is completely silent on the question of whether shareholders would 

            be required to give their permission before corporate funds are spent 

            on political activities which shareholders disagree with. The real 

            way to protect paychecks in this country is to ban all soft money, 

            from corporations, labor unions, and wealthy individuals -- that's 

            the kind of soft money ban at the heart of the McCain-Feingold bill. 

            </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Third, the Bush 

            proposal leaves the "sham issue ad" loophole untouched. Under the 

            Bush proposal, anonymous groups could continue to run campaign ads 

            masquerading as "issue discussion," using money that would be completely 

            illegal if given to candidates directly. Previous versions of the 

            McCain-Feingold bill would have required such organizations to play 

            by the same rules as the candidates themselves - meaning disclose 

            your donors, and use money which would be legal under federal law. 

            </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To leave in place 

            some of the most corrupting money in politics today reduces everything 

            else in the Bush proposal to window dressing: a hodge-podge of half-steps 

            which would do nothing to further real reform.</font>
