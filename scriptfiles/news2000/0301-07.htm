<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DETAILS:

<br>

Join the Institute for America's Future and The Century



Foundation for a discussion with Theda Skocpol, author of a new



book, "The Missing Middle," as she explores the potential of a new



politics focused on the "Missing Middle" of American society.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this important new book, Skocpol points out that



conservatives have forced the political debate to the right.



American politics revolves around whether or not to cut taxes for



the very rich, whether to cut programs for the very poor, whether



we should dismantle the social insurance programs for the very old.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She makes a strong case that, despite millions of dollars spent



on right wing propaganda, the American people are rejecting false



trade-offs that would allow the dismantling of universal social



programs. For example, she explains why Americans aren't buying the



idea that Social Security and Medicare should be dismantled. They



have rejected a well-funded campaign designed to promote a war



between generations because Americans know that all generations



benefit from these universalistic programs.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Skocpol argues that, even while progressives defend programs for



the oldest, the youngest, and the poorest, now is the time to



advance new policies to enhance security and opportunity for the



"missing middle" -- the average working parents of modest means.



Skocpol concludes that the time is ripe to end the polarized and



fragmented debates of today. Taking lessons from the most



successful past social efforts, she identifies ways the missing



middle can reclaim American politics and shape a new social policy



in the coming century.

</font>

Sociology at Harvard University and author of Boomerang: Health



Care Reform and the Turn Against Government (Norton), among other



books, and co-editor (with Stan Greenberg) of The New Majority:



Toward a Popular Progressive Politics. The Missing Middle is a
