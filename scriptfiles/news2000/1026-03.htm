- October 26 - Today in Portland,



NARAL President Kate Michelman unveiled NARAL's new ad, which warns



that a vote for Ralph Nader could propel George W. Bush into the



White House. The ad begins running today in Portland, Oregon and



Minneapolis- St. Paul, Minnesota, and tomorrow in Madison,



Wisconsin.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"NARAL has made a strategic decision to confront the Nader



threat head on. We will reach out to voters to be sure they have



all the facts and understand the full impact of their vote," said



Michelman. "The threat to a woman's right to choose is too grave



to do otherwise."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"George W. Bush is anti-choice and as president could appoint



enough Supreme Court justices to overturn Roe vs. Wade. Like it or



not, a vote for Ralph Nader will help to elect Bush," said



Michelman.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is not about the integrity of Ralph Nader and his



supporters. It is about reminding voters that the unintended



effect of a vote for Nader could be the end of a woman's right to



choose," added Michelman.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ralph Nader remains at 5 percent in the polls nationally, but



his popularity in just a few states could tip the Electoral College



in George W. Bush's favor.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NARAL ad is set to air in key electoral states between now



and Election Day, including Oregon (7 electoral votes), Minnesota



(10), and Wisconsin (11). The ad buy complements the over



$5 million NARAL is currently spending on its direct voter contact



program in 15 target states reaching 2.1 million pro-choice swing



voters.</font>
