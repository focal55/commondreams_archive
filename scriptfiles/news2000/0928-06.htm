- September 28 - The following was



released today by NARAL:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After more than a decade of delays at the hands of anti-choice



activists and lawmakers, mifepristone, commonly known as RU 486,



today received final approval from the FDA. NARAL President Kate



Michelman immediately hailed the announcement as "a tremendous



advance for women's health and reproductive rights."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Mifepristone's approval is one of the most significant advances



in women's reproductive health that we have seen in decades," said



Michelman. "Its approval today is yet another milestone on the long



road to women's reproductive freedom and equality in this country."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The FDA's action today opens doors long closed to American



women, but the benefits of mifepristone will reach far beyond the



realm of reproductive freedom and choice," said Michelman. "The



potential mifepristone holds for the treatment and possible



eradication of numerous diseases could mean an end to the suffering



of millions of Americans."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 500,000 women in Europe have used mifepristone safely



for over a decade. It was proven safe and effective following



clinical trials here in the U.S. Mifepristone is effective for



terminating early pregnancies up to 49 days from the beginning of



a woman's last menstrual cycle. It has also shown promise in the



treatment of numerous medical conditions, including breast cancer,



HIV, Cushing's syndrome, and endometriosis.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In praising the FDA's action, Michelman also pointed out the



tenuous nature of mifepristone's approval status.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As we celebrate this victory, we must remain vigilant.



Anti-choice lawmakers in the House repeatedly tried to block FDA



approval of mifepristone and are unlikely to halt their efforts



now. George W. Bush has also stated his opposition to mifepristone



and has said he would be 'inclined not to accept' the FDA's ruling



if it approved the drug," said Michelman. "Al Gore supports the



approval of mifepristone. We must ensure that our next president



supports making this important reproductive health option available



to American women. We must also return the House to the hands of



a leadership that will work to expand women's reproductive health



options, not curtail them."</font>
