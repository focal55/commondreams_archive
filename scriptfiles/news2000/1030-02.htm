- October 30 - Time is running out for Sens. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), Thomas Daschle

(D-S.D.) and Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.) to make good on their promise to prevent radioactive

waste recyclers from escaping liability for damage caused by their recycled products.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Tuesday, Oct. 24, a coalition of about two dozen public interest, labor,

environmental and consumer groups sent a letter to these Senate leaders requesting that

they close a loophole exempting radioactive waste recyclers and generators from liability

if they release radioactive products into the public domain. The groups include Nuclear

Information Resource Service, Public Citizen, the Sierra Club, Physicians For Social

Responsibility, U.S. PIRG, Greenpeace International and Friends of the Earth</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, Congress passed the Superfund Recycling Equity Act (SREA), which exempted

certain recyclers from Superfund liability. Generators and recyclers of radioactive

material could use this exemption to escape liability derived from &quot;recycling&quot;

radioactive waste into consumer products. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Nov. 19, 1999, in a colloquy published in the Congressional Record, Lott, Daschle

and Lincoln agreed to close this loophole &quot;at the earliest possible

opportunity.&quot; Now, in the final hours of this congressional session, these senators

are failing to make good on their pledge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The senators should keep their word,&quot; said Wenonah Hauter, director of <a href="../cmep/">Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program</a>.

&quot;We have very serious concerns about the consequences of permitting recyclers of

radioactive waste to escape liability for dumping their dangerous waste into products that

people will use daily. Failing to fix this supposedly unintentional loophole will impose

enormous health and environmental costs on this and future generations.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter was delivered to remind senators of their commitment and of the

public&#146;s opposition to unleashing radioactive materials into the marketplace.

Currently, radioactive materials from commercial nuclear power plants can be recycled on a

case-by-case basis and used to make products. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)

plans to set a standard for the amount of radiation that the public can be exposed to from

these products.</font>
