- October 26 - In an interfaith campaign to encourage people of faith to vote in the November 7th elections, over a thousand religious leaders will dedicate their sermons to the message that voting is a civic responsibility and religious obligation.  Organized by The Interfaith Alliance Foundation, <i>Call To A Faithful Decision Weekend</i> - October 27-29th is part of a faith-based grassroots campaign to encourage informed civic participation in the religious community. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This Sunday, October 29, 2000, the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of The Interfaith Alliance Foundation and Pastor of Preaching at Northminster Baptist Church in Monroe, Louisiana, will deliver a sermon entitled "Call To A Faithful Decision" at the historic Riverside Church in Manhattan.  Dr. Gaddy's sermon will provide a Christian perspective on the importance of voting and highlight several clear and distinct issues being debated by the presidential candidates.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The heightened role of religion in the campaign has brought increased scrutiny and confusion about the role of religious leaders during the election season," said Dr. Gaddy.  "Our hope is to model and illustrate through example how religious leaders in our nation can be powerful messengers about the importance of voting and the critical issues at stake without compromising principle or promoting a party or candidate."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Discussing the role of clergy in the election, Dr. Gaddy noted that, "Too often political parties and special-interest groups treat religious leaders like political puppets believing clergy should deliver votes.  We disagree and have been working to encourage religious leaders to play a critical role in this election by raising awareness about the faith context of the issues being debated, and then encouraging congregants to cast informed and faithful ballots on November 7th." 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In September, religious leaders were sent copies of The Interfaith Alliance Foundation's "<a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/Resources/CTFD_WLG.pdf">Call To a Faithful Decision Weekend Worship Leader's Guide</a>," an interfaith resource which includes sample sermons from diverse religious traditions, liturgy, scriptural references, voter registration drive information, and suggested methods for introducing political issues to congregations in a non-partisan manner.  The guide assists clergy in preparing their individual messages on the moral imperative for civic participation.  



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guide contributors include: Rabbi Jack Moline, Agudas Achim Congregation in Alexandria, Virginia; Father Daniel Coughlin, Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.; Arun Gandhi, co-founder of The M.K. Gandhi Institute for Non-Violence, Memphis, Tennessee;  the Rev. Dr. Donald Shriver, president emeritus of Union Theological Seminary, New York; the Rev. Jim Wallis, convener of Call To Renewal and editor-in-chief of Sojourner, Washington, D.C.; Salam Al-Marayati, executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, Los Angeles; Rabbi Charles Sherman, Senior Rabbi of Temple Israel in Tulsa, Oklahoma; and, the Rev. Barbara Carlson, Unitarian Universalist Church, Bloomington, IN. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In June of this year, The Interfaith Alliance Foundation sent an  "An Election Year Guide for Houses of Worship" to more than 65,000 religious leaders.  The guide, also available on-line at <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/tiaf/aeygfhow.html">http://www.interfaithalliance.org/tiaf/aeygfhow.html</a>, provides clear and concise information describing the legal guidelines regulating the participation of houses of worship and religious leaders during an election.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These activities are part of Call To a Faithful Decision 2000, a national voter-education initiative to educate and empower religious leaders to raise awareness about the issues affecting our nation in a manner that is consistent with the integrity of faith and the spirit of the First Amendment.
