<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK  

- June 20 - Human Rights Watch today urged Texas Gov. George W. Bush to halt the execution of Gary Graham (now known as Shaka Sankofa). Graham, who was convicted of murder at the age of seventeen, is slated to be executed on Thursday evening unless Gov. Bush intervenes. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch sent letters this week to Gov. Bush and the Texas parole board requesting a stay to ensure that Graham not be put to death for a crime he committed as an adolescent. The international monitoring group also noted that fundamental questions remain about the evidence in Graham's case and the fairness of his trial. </font></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the United States reinstated the death penalty in 1976, Texas has 



executed six juvenile offenders, more than any other state.  Twenty-six 



juvenile offenders—a third of the national total—now sit on Texas's 



death row.  This record makes Texas the worldwide leader in putting 



adolescent offenders to death.  Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, 



and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are the only countries other 



than the United States known to execute juvenile offenders, in defiance 



of international standards.



</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Death is an inhumane punishment, particularly for an adolescent 



offender," said Lois Whitman, executive director of the Children's 



Rights Division of Human Rights Watch.  "Adolescents simply don't have 



an adult's experience, perspective, or judgment."</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Graham's conviction and execution would raise serious concerns even if 



he were not a juvenile offender.  He was convicted on the identification 



of a lone eyewitness who testified that she saw him for less than a 



second.  In the judgment of some experts, the eyewitness may have been 



influenced by a suggestive police lineup.  Two other eyewitnesses came 



forward after Sankofa's trial to say that he did not commit the murder 



for which he was sentenced to death.</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His defense attorney never challenged the flawed lineup and failed to 



call a single witness in his defense.  That attorney has since been 



disciplined at least four times by the Texas bar and was once jailed for 



contempt after he repeatedly mishandled a criminal case.  When such 



issues have not been raised at trial, appeals courts generally cannot 



consider them.</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Graham's case, a federal court noted that he had presented 



"significant evidentiary support" for his claim of innocence.  But no 



court has ever investigated those claims fully.  At a minimum, the Texas 



Board of Pardons and Paroles should review this evidence before it rules 



on Graham's clemency petition.</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Governor Bush has publicly stated that he would reconsider a jury 



verdict if the jury never heard critical evidence of innocence.</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This case gives Governor Bush the opportunity to make good on his 



word," said Whitman.
