- May 16 - Statement of Athan Manuel, PIRG Arctic Wilderness Campaign:



<p>Drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has nothing to do

with National Energy Security.  Senator Murkowski's bill (S. 2557), the

so-called National Energy Security Act of 2000, is more about financial

security for Big Oil than it is about National Energy Security. 



<p>Oil from the Arctic Refuge, where the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that

there are 2.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil, would literally be a drop

in the bucket. At current rates of consumption that is enough oil to last

the U.S. for about six months.  And any oil thought to be in the Refuge

would take almost 10 years to reach U.S. consumers.  



<p>Contrast that with the oil field recently discovered in Kazakhstan.  That

field is thought to contain between 8 and 50 billion barrels of oil.  



<p>The new field in Kazakhstan points out the harsh reality about oil - most

of it lies outside the United States. The U.S. will never drill its way to

energy independence.   



<p>If Senator Murkowski really cared about energy independence he wouldn't

have voted against raising our nation's corporate auto fuel economy

standards.  He also wouldn't have sponsored legislation that repealed a ban

on the export of Alaskan crude oil in 1995.  As a result, millions of

barrels of crude are being diverted from California to China and other

Asian countries. 



<p>In addition to plundering one of the last remaining pristine areas in this

country, S. 2557 authorizes a host of poor energy policies while

resurrecting expensive boondoggles that have already been rejected by the

American public and Wall Street.  S. 2557 is nothing more than a license to

plunder public resources and prop up the failed nuclear industry coated

with a thin veneer of energy efficiency and renewable energy provisions.  



<p>This bill would increase already outrageous taxpayer handouts to the oil

and gas industry.  It also resurrects the "coal liquefaction" program, a

continuation of the failed "synfuels" program of the 1970's and it promotes

nuclear spent fuel reprocessing.  Finally, at a time when public safety is

threatened by aging nuclear reactors around the country, this bill would

further erode citizens' ability to participate in nuclear safety proceedings.



<p>What we need is an energy policy that focuses more on energy efficiency and

renewables than on ruining some of the last unspoiled areas left in the

U.S.   We have plenty of oil rigs -- and plenty of pollution from the

burning of fossil fuels -- but there is only one Arctic National Wildlife

Refuge.
