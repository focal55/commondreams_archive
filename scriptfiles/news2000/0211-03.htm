-   A shipment of 30,000 tonnes of maize to Brazil will be returned to the US as a result of a warning from Greenpeace that some of the grain might include genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The shipment, scheduled to arrive today at the port of São Francisco do Sul - Santa Catarinal state, on the Maltese flagged bulk carrier 'Bulk Star', will be sent back after a decision by the animal feed producer Perdigão. 

<p>Perdigão, one of the largest lifestock producers in Brazil confirmed Thursday that the cargo is not certified as non-GE and is therefore likely to contain GE grains. After consultation with Greenpeace the company agreed to send the cargo back to the US. Greenpeace also informed the Brazilian authorities, who announced that they will demand certification of all US maize to stop illegal imports of GE maize. 

<p>"This is a great victory for the Brazilian environment and consumer," said Mariana Paoli of Greenpeace. "Since neither the US exporting companies nor the government take any measures to guarantee the legality of their exports, all importers in countries like Brazil should only import certified non-GE corn." 

<p>"To export GE crops to countries that have not approved them without telling the importer what they are getting is both irresponsible and arrogant and, as in the case of Brazil, a direct violation of the national law. All producers using imported US crops should demand certified non-GE maize to avoid financial losses."

<p>The Biosafety Protocol adopted two weeks ago in Montreal, Canada reconfirms a country's right to reject imports. Furthemore, an illegal transfer can be penalised and the country of origin made to cover the expenses. "The Brazilian case highlights the need for this Protocol and the reason why it was created," said Isabelle Meister of Greenpeace. We urge all countries that are part of the Protocol to apply the rules agreed in Montreal already now and not to wait for the ratification of the Protocol."

<p>At present Brazil requires labelling of GMOs but the specific labelling rules are not yet implemented. Under Brazilian law, the country's Health, Agricultural and Environmental Ministries must evaluate and authorise any import of GMOs. Brazilian maize imports are estimated to reach 1.5 million tonnes this year. No GE maize has been approved in Brazil.
