<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MEXICO CITY 

- March 31 - Concerned for two farmers and environmental

     activists who were arrested, beaten and allegedly tortured by members 

     of the Mexican military, a pair of international grassroots 

     organizations are taking unprecedented actions on their behalf.  In a 

     first-ever move, the Sierra Club and Amnesty International are jointly 

     running ads in Mexican publications and are sending representatives to 

     Mexico to meet with officials and to show support for Rodolfo Montiel 

     and Teodoro Cabrera.  Amnesty International has declared the two men 

     "Prisoners of Conscience."  

     

     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We have the profound conviction that the only "crime" committed by 

     these men was to protect the forests by protesting the rampant 

     logging," said Alejandro Queral of Sierra Club. "By organizing to 

     preserve the trees and water supply in their community, Montiel and 

     Cabrera threatened those who would profit from the destruction of the 

     forest."

     

     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the week of April 2, the Sierra Club and Amnesty International 

     will join with Mexican human rights group Centro de Derechos Humanos 

     "Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez" A.C. (PRODH) to run open letter print ads 

     in the news daily Reforma and the newsweekly Proceso, calling on 

     President Ernesto Zedillo to immediately and unconditionally release 

     the two men from prison.  Additionally, Sierra Club and Amnesty 

     International are sending observers to Mexico to meet with Mexican and 

     U.S. officials. 

     

     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Montiel, one of the founding members of the Organización de Campesinos 

     Ecologistas de la Sierra de Petatlan y Coyuca de Catalan, A.C. 

     (Organization of Farmer Environmentalists of the Sierra de Petatlan 

     and Coyuca de Catalan), has been organizing farmers to oppose the 

     rampant, and possibly illegal, logging in these mountains in Guerrero, 

     Mexico.  On May 2, 1999, Montiel and Cabrera were arrested by members 

     of the 40th Infantry Battalion of the Mexican Army, who beat them, 

     threatened them at gunpoint and allegedly tortured the two men, </font>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">forcing them to confess to trumped-up charges of drug trafficking and 

     illegal possession of weapons. The Sierra Club and Amnesty 

     International believe that these charges were created to imprison </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Montiel and Cabrera for their environmental activism.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     

      

     "These are serious allegations of human rights abuse," said Diego 

     Zavala of Amnesty International. "Those responsible for the harm 

     inflicted on Montiel and Cabrera must be held accountable.  We must 

     send a strong message that we will not tolerate human rights abuses 

     against those who peacefully defend the Earth."

     

     </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This case is part of a pattern of human rights violations in Guerrero. 

     Most recently, Maximino Marcial Jaimes, another member of the </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">environmental organization, was reportedly abducted on March 13 by 

     members of a paramilitary group.  Amnesty International is concerned 

     for his safety.  

     

     </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year the Sierra Club and Amnesty International launched a joint 

     campaign, "Defending Those Who Give the Earth A Voice." The case of 

     Montiel and Cabrera was one of the first cases taken on by the new 

     campaign.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Founded in 1892 by John Muir, Sierra Club is the oldest and largest 

     non-profit grassroots environmental organization in the world, with 

     more than 550,000 members, 65 chapters and 400 local groups.  The 

     Sierra Club actively promotes conservation by influencing public 

     policy through grassroots activism, public education, lobbying and 

     litigation.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amnesty International, founded in 1961, is the world's largest 

     grassroots human rights organization, whose one million members are 

     dedicated to freeing prisoners of conscience, to gaining fair trials 

     for political prisoners, to ending torture, political killings and 

     "disappearances," and to abolishing the death penalty throughout the 

     world.</font></p>
