- February 3 - Former Maryland

Congressman Michael D. Barnes was chosen on Feb. 1 by unanimous



vote of the Boards of Directors of Handgun Control and the Center



to Prevent Handgun Violence to succeed Robert Walker as Chief



Executive Officer of both organizations. Mr. Barnes will formally



join the organizations as President on March 1, after resigning



from his partnership at the law firm of Hogan &amp; Hartson and his chairmanship of several national and regional policy organizations.

<p>Best known for his advocacy of human rights and democracy as

chairman of the House Sub-Committee on Western Hemisphere Affairs



during the Central American civil wars of the 1980's, Mr. Barnes



also led the national fight against drunk driving and worked



closely with MADD to establish more stringent legal standards and



penalties for driving under the influence. At that time Mr. Barnes



was named "one of the two dozen most influential Members of the



House" by the Almanac of American Politics and as the "most



influential member of Congress from Maryland or Virginia" by the



Washington Post. A graduate of the University of North Carolina,



a J.D. from George Washington University Law School and a student



of international economics at the Graduate Institute of Higher



International Studies in Geneva, Switzerland, Mr. Barnes also



served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1967-69.

<p>After leaving the House in 1986, Mr. Barnes continued to involve

himself in foreign policy as a private attorney, serving as the



principal international advocate for the successful restoration of



democracy in Haiti, and serving as counsel for the governments of



Chile, Cyprus, Panama and South Korea. Mr. Barnes also currently



serves as Chairman Emeritus of the Center for National Policy; as



Co-Chairman of the NAFTA Congressional Caucus and Forum; as



Co-Chairman of the U.S. Committee for the United Nations



Development Programme; as Chairman of the U.S.-Panama Business



Council, and as Chairman of the Maryland Economic Growth, Resource



Protection and Planning Commission.

<p>"Like most Americans, I am fed up with the tragedy of gun

violence which kills tens of thousands of our citizens every year,"



said Mr. Barnes. "In my home state of Maryland, more people die



from gun violence than from traffic accidents. We clearly need to



take common-sense steps to control guns in order to protect all



Americans, particularly our children. I am honored and excited to



be able to play a role in this crucial effort to save lives."

<p>Mr. Barnes was selected as HC/CPHV president after a national

search process initiated when current president Robert Walker



decided to leave the organizations last summer. At a time when the



gun control issue has regained political and public urgency, the



Directors looked for a candidate with significant national



political and management experience.

<p>"Michael Barnes' stature and experience with important national

and international political issues made him the inevitable choice



to lead Handgun Control and the Center at this critical time," said



Sarah Brady, who chairs both organizations. "As we work towards



the next generation of sensible gun laws, we need a leader with



vision, with understanding and with the courage to take on the gun



lobby. Michael Barnes is that leader, and I am overjoyed to



welcome him to our crusade."

Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, is the nation's largest

citizens' gun control lobbying organization. Based in Washington,



D.C., HCI works to enact stronger federal, state and local gun



control laws, but does not seek to ban handguns. Founded in 1974,



HCI has more than 400,000 members nationwide and works with local



groups around the country to enact and protect reasonable gun



control laws. More information about HCI and its affiliated



organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, can be found



on the web site at <a href="http://www.handguncontrol.org">www.handguncontrol.org.</a>

<p>------

<br>

The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, chaired by Sarah Brady,

was founded in 1983 to reduce gun violence through education, legal



advocacy, research, and outreach to the entertainment community.



Based in Washington, D.C., CPHV's national initiatives include



prevention programs for parents and youth on the risks associated



with guns, legal representation for gun violence victims, work with



the entertainment community to encourage deglamorization of guns in



the media, and research of the risks associated with guns and the



efficacy of gun control laws. More information about CPHV and its



affiliated organization, Handgun Control, can be found on the web



site at <a href="http://www.cphv.org">www.cphv.org</a>.
