- May 23 - The Clinton Administration decided today to extend an arms export license

exemption to the United Kingdom and Australia that would allow American

weapons manufacturers to ship unclassified weapons, technology and services

to these two allies, and potentially more, without applying for an export

license from the U.S. government.



<p>Over the long term, the President's decision will have negative

consequences for U.S. national security, including:



<p>a) opening the door to retransfers of U.S. weapons and technology to U.S.

adversaries or to states ineligible to receive U.S. equipment;



<p>b) eliminating a license documentation paper trail which helps the U.S.

conduct end-use monitoring and tracing of diverted equipment;



<p>c) making it virtually impossible to stop unwanted arms sales to the United

Kingdom and Australia.



<p>The only other country to enjoy this type of exemption was Canada which

lost the privilege in April 1999 because government regulators learned that

Canadian firms had retransfered U.S. military technology to Iran and China.

The U.K. and Italy - U.S. NATO allies - also have retransfered weapons

illegally, but the Administration did not learn an important lesson: even

our closest allies do not have export controls that provide adequate

oversight to prevent the retransfer of U.S. equipment. 



<p>Extending export exemptions to these allies is the opening salvo in a

two-year long Department of Defense-led effort to grease the flow of

weapons and technology to NATO allies.  The effort, which also includes 15

other reforms, could eventually dismantle the current system of restraint

which has worked for many years to keep U.S. weapons out of the wrong

hands.  The Administration also proposes to grant allies, that agree to

certain conditions, blanket third party U.S. arms retransfer authority.

This would further increase the global proliferation of U.S. weapons.  



<p>In an effort inspired by the U.S. weapons industry to increase U.S. arms

sales to close allies the U.S. is inadvertently destroying the export

system it is trying to reform. This effort is the equivalent of tearing

down a house to add a back porch.  We hope that Congress takes action to

reverse this unfortunate U.S. policy.
