- October 20 - Consumers Union,

          Friends of the Earth, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group

          today demanded that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

          not re-register Bt corn crops until it has conducted fundamental

          allergy testing available to the agency for over a year. The

          EPA is concluding three days of hearings regarding the crop re-registrations

          today.

          </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Groups demanding the delay in

          the Bt corn re-registrations pointed to a study showing a potential

          risk to farm and mill workers and the fact that EPA has the ability

          to test. Funded in part by EPA itself and co-authored by Donald

          L. Doerfler, Biostatistics and Research Support Staff, National

          Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. EPA,

          the study concludes, &quot;&#133;future clinical assessment [of

          allergenic sensitivity] is now feasible because of the availability

          of reliable Bt skin and serologic reagents developed during the

          course of the investigation.&quot;</font>

<p>

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;EPA scientists have the allergy test, so they should use

          it,&quot; said Michael Hansen, Ph.D., Research Associate at Consumers

          Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, who discussed the study

          in testimony at EPA today. The study, entitled &quot;Immune Responses

          in Farm Workers after Exposure to Bacillus thuringiensis Pesticides&quot;

          appeared in the July 1999 issue of Environmental Health Perspectives

          published by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

          Farm and mill workers may be

          most at risk for developing allergies, according to the study.

          The study looked at whether conventional Bt pesticide sprays

          might lead to allergic sensitivities in farm workers. The study

          found 2 out of 123 workers who picked and packed vegetables on

          a farm where Bt is used exhibited reactivity to the Bt pro delta

          endotoxin. This natural pesticide has now been introduced via

          genetic engineering into some 20 percent of the corn grown in

          the United States today. The Bt delta endotoxin is present in

          genetically engineered corn at a level at least 50 times that

          found in the conventional sprays in the study, according to Hansen.</font>

<p>

          

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This study raises serious

          questions about the safety of farm and mill workers who are breathing

          large amounts of Bt corn pollen or corn flour every day,&quot;

          said Larry Bohlen, Director of Health and Environment Programs

          at Friends of the Earth, the group that first detected the presence

          of Starlink corn in taco shells.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The EPA should not allow

          Bt corn to be planted next year unless they can assure millworkers,

          farmers and rural residents that they will not develop allergies

          and respiratory problems. Farmers could be affected and not even

          know the reason why due to the EPA's failure to test for health

          impacts.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups urged EPA to immediately

          use the tools developed over a year ago in this study to assess

          allergic sensitivity in a wide sample of workers who breathe

          genetically engineered corn flour.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study said it was &quot;unlikely&quot;

          that the Bt endotoxin present in corn would cause allergies in

          consumers who eat it. However the reagents developed in the study

          make it possible to address this question, as well as effects

          on farmers and mill workers.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

          To date, the EPA has said it has had &quot;no confirmed reports&quot;

          of allergic reactions to Bt endotoxin. It based its evaluation

          of Bt's allergenicity on several general indicators of allergenic

          potential, such as digestibility and heat stability.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In testimony at today's hearing,

          Friends of the Earth pointed out significant flaws in the allergenicity

          studies submitted by StarLink registrant Aventis CropScience,

          including many breaches of basic scientific protocol. The group

          also criticized the EPA for recent statements downplaying the

          health risks of StarLink corn, and for the federal government's

          gravely flawed regulatory system that permitted it to enter the

          food supply in the first place.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The article in Environmental

          Health Perspectives notes that, as of July 1999, &quot;Although

          health risks to pesticides containing Bacillus thuringiensis

          (Bt) have been minimal, the potential allergenicity of these

          organisms has not been evaluated.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This further demonstrates

          the premature rush to commercialize genetically engineered crops

          before full evaluations can be made of their safety. EPA has

          allowed genetically engineered crops to enter the marketplace

          before independent scientists fully debated their safety and

          efficacy,&quot; said Richard Caplan, Environmental Advocate with

          the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. &quot;At this critical

          juncture when they are re-evaluating the registration of Bt crops,

          they should put the environment and health of the American public

          first.&quot;</font>
