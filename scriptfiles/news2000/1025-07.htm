- October 25 - The Sierra Club today launched independent expenditure

     campaigns in three Congressional races: Washington's second district,

     Ohio's 12th district and Utah's second district. The goal of these

     campaigns is to elect pro-environment candidates in these open seats.

     The Sierra Club is spending approximately $300,000 on these three

     independent expenditure campaigns.

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We need Members of Congress who will clean up our air and water,

     stand up to big polluters and preserve our wild places," said Dan

     Weiss, Political Director, Sierra Club. "By supporting pro-environment

     candidates in these critical districts, we are working to push

     environmental issues to the forefront in the 107th Congress."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The Sierra Club's campaigns will include television and radio ads

     about the records of the candidates; direct mailings; phone banks and

     grassroots Get-Out-The Vote activities.

</font>

     In WA-02, the Sierra Club is campaigning for Democrat Richard Larsen

     and contrasting his support for clean water programs at the local and

     state level against his opponent, State Representative John Koster,

     who has consistently voted against environmental protection programs.

     "John Koster has voted to allow building landfills on top of our

     fragile supplies of drinking water," said Bill Arthur, Regional

     Director for Washington, Sierra Club. "His voting record clearly shows

     that Mr. Koster is no friend of clean water and a healthy environment

     and this is why Sierra Club is supporting Richard Larsen."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Columbus City Councilwoman Maryellen O'Shaughnessy, who the Sierra

     Club is supporting in OH-12, is battling State Representative Pat

     Tiberi. Tiberi has voted to allow more pollution in Ohio's rivers and

     streams and to exempt many Ohio waterways from the Clean Water Act.

     "Ms. O'Shaughnessy's record speaks for itself. She's been a staunch

     supporter of clean water standards and she believes in smart growth,

     not haphazard sprawl," said David Scott, Chairman of the Sierra Club's

     Ohio Chapter.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     And in UT-02, the Sierra Club is backing Jim Matheson in his race

     against Derek Smith. Smith is opposed to the only realistic funding

     for expanded mass transit in Utah's second district and he supports

     the construction of the sprawl-inducing Legacy Highway. "People in

     Utah are very conscious of the environmental threats that sprawl

     brings with it and Jim Matheson understands this. He supports smart

     growth and measures to curb suburban sprawl," said Claire Gardner,

     Political Chairwoman for the Utah

     Chapter of the Sierra Club. "But Derek Smith supports the Legacy

     Highway, a clear threat to our natural environment and our quality of

     life here in Utah."

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In each of these open seat races, there is a stark contrast between

     the environmental records of the candidates," said Weiss.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Through these independent expenditure campaigns, the Sierra Club will

     continue its support of candidates who will support the environment.

     By using independent expenditure campaigns, the Sierra Club may

     legally spend as much money necessary to win these seats. However,

     there can be no coordination or communication between the candidates

     and their staff and the Sierra Club. The Sierra Club closely adheres

     to all federal campaign laws while running independent expenditure

     campaigns.</font>
