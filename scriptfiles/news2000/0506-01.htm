- May 6 - Greenpeace today disrupted a transhipment of tuna caught by the Belize-flagged pirate vessel Jackie 11 in the waters of the Central Atlantic, 400 miles west of Luanda (Angola). The environmental group provided visual evidence of unregulated and unreported fishing operations going on despite the stringent regulations set up by the International Commission for the Conservation of the Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT). 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 10h15 CET, the MV Greenpeace caught the Jackie 11 (flagged in Belize, a notorious flag of convenience country, FOC, and owned by SEVEN SEAS S.A./Singapore) attempting to tranship its catch of tuna onboard the Hatsukary, a Panama-flagged and Japan-owned reefer/cargo vessel. The Jackie 11 is part of a fleet of pirate fishing vessels operating in the Atlantic Ocean catching bigeye and bluefin tuna, swordfish and other "migratory" species. Longline fishing is known to involve the bycatch of sharks, sea turtles and other species.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Hatsukary must stop servicing flag of convenience vessels such as the Jackie 11. These reefers only allow pirate-fishing activities to continue unabated and help pirate vessels to avoid port control measures. Pirate fishing is a threat to marine resources and undermines ICCAT conservation measures. It must stop immediately", said Helene Bours, Greenpeace campaigner onboard the MV Greenpeace.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Hatsukary left Cape Town (South Africa) on the 28th April and is bound for Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain). Both harbours are known to be favourite landing harbours for pirate vessels. In order to counter the more stringent rules imposed on fishing activities to protect endangered stocks, many unscrupulous fishing companies re-flag their vessels in countries who sell their flags with no questions asked. In this way, they can continue to over-exploit fish stocks and evade international control.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace has coined the phrase "pirate fishing" to describe this increasing global phenomenon. Pirates operate the world over, from Antarctic oceans to the Mediterranean Sea, from the North Atlantic to the South Pacific. They move from fishery to fishery taking as much fish as they can pull onboard. They don't care about what impacts, direct or indirect, they have on fish stocks or any other marine species caught or tangled in their fishing gear. Greenpeace estimates that there are over 1,300 flag of convenience vessels fishing worldwide. The four top FOC countries - Belize, Honduras, Panama, St. Vincent and the Grenadines - count for over 1,100 of these vessels.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Both vessels are clearly breaking ICCAT rules. Under international law, the flag state had the primary responsibility to take enforcement action against fishing and support vessels breaking the rules on the high seas. Greenpeace is calling on the governments of Belize and Panama to confiscate this cargo when it reaches port and take enforcement action against the companies involved. In addition, Greenpeace is calling on countries in the region, in particular Spain and other members of the European Union, to deny both vessels permission to off-load their fish. Japan has a responsibility to ensure that the company which owns the reefer abides by the rules as well", added Bours.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pirate fishing continues to be a threat to fish and other marine species worldwide, despite the strict control measures adopted by international bodies such as ICCAT. Greenpeace is calling on the European Union and other governments to:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· close its ports to FOC vessels and fisheries-related support and transport vessels,<br>

· close its market to FOC-caught fish,

<br>

· close EU-based companies which owned or operated FOC fishing vessels and fisheries-related support and transport vessels.
