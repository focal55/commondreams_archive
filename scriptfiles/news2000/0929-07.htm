- September 29 - The

          Christian Coalition's &quot;Road to Victory&quot; Conference, which

          began today in Washington, D.C., is little more than a political rally

          for the Republican Party and George W. Bush, according to Americans

          United for Separation of Church and State.</font>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

          Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United, said that

          the Coalition, led by TV preacher Pat Robertson, continues to claim

          the Religious Right group is non-partisan so it can rope churches into

          a political machine despite federal tax law prohibitions on church

          electioneering.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If

          sleazy politicking were an Olympic event, Robertson would win the gold

          medal every time,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;Robertson is on a crusade

          this year, but it's aimed at filling the White House, not God's

          house.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn

          noted the schedule at the Coalition event featured several GOP

          leaders, including the three top Republicans in the U.S. Congress.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If

          you closed your eyes, you would think you're in Philadelphia at the

          Republican National Convention,&quot; Lynn observed. &quot;It's hard

          to believe Robertson still claims with a straight face that this group

          is non-partisan.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

          Christian Coalition, as part of its election year efforts, is planning

          to distribute 75 million &quot;voter guides&quot; in churches

          throughout the United States. Yesterday, <a href="http://www.au.org/pr92800.htm">Americans

          United announced a nationwide project</a> to contact nearly every

          church in America -- some 285,000 houses of worship -- warning

          religious leaders that tax law prohibits church distribution of

          partisan political materials.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The

          Coalition's so-called 'voter guides' are nothing but deceptive

          partisan propaganda,&quot; said Lynn. &quot;These materials don't

          belong in houses of worship, they belong in the trash.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Robertson

          has been aggressive in drumming up momentum for his favorite

          candidates and touting the importance of the election to the Religious

          Right's agenda.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In

          a letter to supporters this month, Robertson described this year's

          presidential race as &quot;the most crucial election in recent

          history&quot; and noted that voters can &quot;affect the appointment

          of three Supreme Court justices.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Robertson

          also reminded Coalition members that the election results could turn

          the judicial tide on important Religious Right issues such as

          abortion, school prayer, display of the Ten Commandments and gay

          rights.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Concluded

          AU's Lynn, &quot;Robertson and the Religious Right know that the 2000

          election can be a make-or-break contest for their political movement.

          They're pulling out all the stops to try to achieve victory.&quot;</font></p>
