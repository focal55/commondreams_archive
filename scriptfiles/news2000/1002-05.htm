- October 2 - Attorney General Janet



Reno, U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Andrew



Cuomo, talk show host Rosie O'Donnell, Senator Frank Lautenberg,



and attorneys general, mayors, police chiefs, college and



graduate school students, moms, doctors, lawyers, social



workers, civic leaders, and thousands of others joined forces



across America today to take a stand for common sense gun laws.



First Monday 2000: Unite to End Gun Violence is a national day



of education and action, and the beginning of a two-year



campaign to stop gun violence.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Events were scheduled for 50 major cities and 300 colleges



and schools of law, medicine, nursing, public health and social



work. The first Monday in October is a day when Americans



traditionally focus on justice, as the Supreme Court begins its



new term. First Monday 2000 is coordinated by the Alliance for



Justice, in conjunction with Physicians for Social



Responsibility.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The centerpiece of every event is the powerful new



documentary, "America: Up In Arms," by award-winning filmmakers



Rory Kennedy and Liz Garbus. It focuses on three people who lost



their lives to guns: robbery victim Songha Willis of



Philadelphia, who died at age 28; Kenzo Dix of Berkeley, who



died as the result of an accidental shooting at age 15; and



19-year-old Sean Woods of Houston, who committed suicide using



a handgun.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In every one of these stories, I saw my own children and



grandchildren, and the danger to all American families," said



actor Martin Sheen in closing the film. "That's why First Monday



2000 is so important. We're fighting the gun lobby by proposing



simple, sensible solutions."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"First Monday 2000 is generating a new wave of activism for



common sense gun laws," said Alliance for Justice President Nan



Aron. "Ten children die each day in the U.S. from gun violence.



A new generation of activists is sending a message that



lawmakers can't ignore. We want guns regulated more closely than



tires, and the gun industry scrutinized more closely than the



entertainment industry. We are determined to stop gun violence."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Attorney General Reno and Secretary Cuomo helped announce the



campaign in July, along with Members of Congress from both



political parties. "It is easier in this society to buy a gun



than it is to buy a McDonald's hamburger," Secretary Cuomo said



in discussing the issue. "There are seven times more gun dealers



than there are McDonald's -- 12,000 McDonald's; 84,000 gun



dealers. We have to do something about it."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The First Monday 2000 campaign will help mobilize Americans



to stop the scourge of gun violence. I am proud to support this



important campaign," Senator Edward Kennedy said last week.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Gun violence in the United States is a true public health



epidemic," said Robert K. Musil, PhD, Executive Director and



CEO, Physicians for Social Responsibility. "It's time to save



lives, re-set our priorities, and hold the gun industry



accountable."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First Monday 2000 co-sponsors include the National Education



Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Bar



Association, American Public Health Association, Children's



Defense Fund, Family Violence Prevention Fund, Million Mom



March, National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related



Institutions, National Association of Social Workers, National



Black Police Association, and United States Student Association.
