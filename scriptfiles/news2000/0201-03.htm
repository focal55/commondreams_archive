<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 1 - The following is a 

statement by Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood 

Federation of America, on the Michigan "Infant Protection Act": </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of two obstetrician-gynecologists and the six Planned Parenthood affiliates in Michigan and their patients, have asked the U.S. District Court in Detroit to prevent the so-called &quot;Infant Protection Act&quot; from taking effect and to declare it unconstitutional.<br>

<br>



The Act, passed by the Michigan state legislature last year is slated to take effect on March 10, 2000, that would <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/library/ABORTION/abortban_fact.html">prohibit abortions</a> at any stage of pregnancy and impose severe criminal penalties on physicians providing abortions as well as other medical procedures. <br>

<br>



The Act is unconstitutional and would set a dangerous legal precedent by allowing a state legislature to substitute its medical judgment as to the appropriate care of pregnant women for the medical judgment of a trained physician.<br>

<br>



 The Act is unconstitutional in three respects: <br>

<br>

</font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<li> It would impose an undue burden on the right of a woman to choose an abortion prior to fetal viability; <br>

<br>

<li> It does not adequately protect, and affirmatively endangers, the <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/library/ABORTION/HealthBenef.html">lives and health</a> of pregnant women; and<br>

<br>

<li> It fails to specify what actions are prohibited, violating the rights of medical practitioners to fair notice about what medical procedures they may legally perform.<br>

<br>



The Act is a thinly disguised attempt to deny access to <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/abortion/abortquestions.html">abortion</a> &#151; period. In pursuing an anti-choice agenda, Michigan’s legislators have shown their callous disregard for women.  This Act has no health exception as mandated by <i><a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/library/ABORTION/Roe25.html">Roe v. Wade</a></i>, and it would strip women of their right to seek many reproductive health care services, exposing them to unnecessary risks. <br>

<br>



The decision to terminate a pregnancy is one that should be made, in private, by a woman in consultation with her doctor.  Medical decisions, including decisions about what <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/library/ABORTION/howabort_fact.html">abortion procedures</a> to use, should be made by the patient and her doctor with the best interests of the patient as the paramount concern.  These are not decisions that belong to state legislatures, the federal government, or an extremist minority seeking to impose a narrow social agenda on the country at large.<br>
