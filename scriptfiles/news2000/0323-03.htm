- March 23 - Taxpayers will pay



more than $26 billion in the next five years for polluting energy



programs that benefit the oil, gas, coal, and nuclear industries,



according to a report released today by a coalition of taxpayer



and environmental groups.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Paying for Pollution, How Taxpayers Subsidize Dangerous and



Polluting Energy Programs," a report by the Green Scissors Campaign,



led by Friends of the Earth, Taxpayers for Common Sense and the



U.S. Public Interest Research Group, calls for the elimination of



big tax breaks for the oil and gas industry, special programs to



assist nuclear power utilities, and research programs for coal



consumption.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our tax dollars are pumping up the pockets of polluters," said



Erich Pica of Friends of the Earth. "And comparatively little is



being spent on cleaner, more efficient alternatives for America's



future."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the companies that benefit from the Department of



Energy's fossil fuel and nuclear programs are large corporations



responsible for polluting air and water, and threatening public



health. In 1997 alone, the coal industry mined over 900 million



tons of coal that, when burned, contributed 51 tons of mercury and



2 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the air and water.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Taxpayers should be outraged," said Cena Swisher of Taxpayers



for Common Sense. "While these industries received billions in



government handouts, prices for gas and heating oil have soared."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the subsidies to the oil, gas, coal and nuclear industries



are outdated and were instituted decades ago during wartime or



economic depression to increase economic development. The



beneficiaries of these tax breaks and subsidies are some of the



largest, most prosperous corporations in the nation, earning a net



income of $29.8 billion in 1997.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The oil, gas, coal and nuclear companies identified in this



report as benefiting from a subset of federal energy programs



(including the Fossil Fuel Research and Development Program, the



Clean Coal Technology Program the National Ignition Facility and



the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative) made $39 million in



Political Action Committee (PAC) and soft money contributions to



congressional campaigns from 1993 to 1999, and received an



estimated $7.3 billion in subsidies. The companies thus received



186 times more than they contributed.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The focus of the 30th Anniversary of Earth Day on April 22 this



year will be the Earth Day 2000 Clean Energy Agenda, which calls on



Congress, in part, to clean up dirty energy and address the



problems of air pollution and global warming. The "Clean



Investments" plank of the Earth Day Clean Energy Agenda calls on



Congress to end coal, oil and nuclear subsidies.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Congress should not be using our tax dollars to subsidize



pollution," said U.S. PIRG Staff Attorney Lexi Shultz. "By cutting



dirty energy subsidies, Congress can help prevent air pollution,



curb global warming, and protect taxpayers," she added.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For seven years, the Green Scissors coalition of taxpayer and



environmental groups, led by U.S. PIRG, Friends of the Earth and



Taxpayers for Common Sense, has targeted energy programs that both



waste tax dollars and contribute to health and environmental



problems. Since 1994, the Green Scissors Campaign has helped to



cut $17.4 billion from these wasteful and polluting projects.



Polluting energy programs that were not cut have cost taxpayers at



least $26 billion in the last seven years.
