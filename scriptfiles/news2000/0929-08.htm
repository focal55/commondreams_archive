- September 29 - Calling George W. Bush’s energy proposal 

                short sighted and a significant threat to the environment, the 

                League of Conservation Voters (LCV) today rejected Bush’s false 

                premise that clean air, clean water and the nation’s natural treasures 

                must be sacrificed in order to have a successful energy policy.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush’s energy policy is fueled by concern for protecting oil 

                and gas interests, not the interests of the majority of voters 

                who want stronger clean air and water protections, said LCV President 

                Deb Callahan.  His proposal would do little to reduce the nation’s 

                reliance on oil, while posing a serious threat to one of North 

                America’s last-remaining pristine wilderness ecosystems.  His 

                call for the development of clean coal technologies is nothing 

                more than an oxymoron.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the League, Bush’s plan would open Alaska’s Arctic 

                National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development.  Often referred 

                to as America’s Serengeti, the Arctic refuge is home to nearly 

                200 species of wildlife, including polar bears, caribou, wolves 

                and more than 100 species of migratory birds.  Habitat destruction 

                associated with oil development, not to mention air and water 

                pollution and oil spills could irreversibly compromise this globally 

                important wilderness area.  </font></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plan also offers ineffective long-term 

                solutions for reducing U.S. oil dependence.   While Vice President 

                Al Gore’s energy plan would offer tax breaks, grants, low-interest 

                loans and other financial incentives to increase the reliability 

                of the nation’s electricity grid and spur the use and development 

                of cleaner technologies, Bush’s plan continues to press for short-term 

                drilling solutions.</font></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush’s announcement is bad news for 

                public health and bad news for the environment, Callahan said.  

                We face a clear choice on the environment and energy in this presidential 

                election.  While Bush and Richard Cheney are busy satisfying the 

                oil and gas interests that have lined their campaign coffers with 

                more than $1.5 million, only Gore and Joe Lieberman are busy addressing 

                the energy and environmental problems facing the nation.  American’s 

                deserve a president that will look for long-term solutions to 

                both our energy and environmental needs, not one who is focused 

                on short-term economic solutions that ignore the environment completely.
