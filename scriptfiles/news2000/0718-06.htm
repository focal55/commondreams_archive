- July 18 - As Priests for Life launches their anti-abortion electoral 

  media campaign today, Feminist Majority Foundation and <a href="http://www.institutefordemocracystudies.org" target="_blank">Institute 

  for Democracy Studies</a> together call attention to Fr. Frank Pavone's ongoing 

  relationship with militant and extreme elements of the anti-abortion movement. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just two weeks ago, Pavone addressed the National Right to Life Committee convention 

  and his organization, Priests For Life, distributed a booklet entitled <i>Our 

  Media is the Streets</i>. Highlighted in that booklet is Pavone's support for 

  anti-abortion extremists and their tactics. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Notably, Pavone justifies criminal trespass at abortion clinics: "Rescues are 

  not acts of civil disobedience or protests primarily meant to get a message 

  to the public.…Breaking a law of trespass to prevent killing is <b>perfectly 

  justified</b> in this and other circumstances," <i>Our Media is the Streets</i>, 

  by Fr. Frank Pavone, National Director, Priests for Life, n.d. (emphasis added). 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the same booklet, Pavone also praises convicted federal racketeer Joseph 

  Scheidler, noting the "outstanding success of his efforts," efforts which a 

  federal jury, in NOW v. Scheidler, found to constitute a nationwide campaign 

  resulting in 21 acts of extortion, which included threats of physical violence. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pavone's <i>Our Media is the Streets</i> additionally includes a declaration 

  of anti-abortion leaders across America, a substantial number of whom have been 

  jailed for criminal violations relating to abortion clinic harassment and terrorism. 

  These leaders advocate going beyond harassment at clinics and also call for 

  harassment at the homes and neighborhoods of doctors and clinic staff.

</font>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We highlight Pavone's ties to extremists today - only one week after yet 

  another abortion provider was the victim of violence," said Smeal, referring 

  to the July 11 stabbing of Vancouver abortion provider Dr. Garson Romalis. "We 

  hope that Priests For Life's announcement making choice a priority in voting 

  is a turn of strategy from harassment at clinics. We welcome voters making abortion 

  a top priority in the upcoming presidential election," added Smeal. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pavone, who has been directly referred to as Pope John Paul II's "Vicar for 

  Life," is also a member of the Vatican's Pontifical Council of the Family. "As 

  our recent research report on Priests for Life shows, all Americans need to 

  be concerned about what is concealed by this organization's carefully coiffed 

  mainstream image," says Alfred Ross, IDS president. </font>
