- October 23 - The Feminist Majority Foundation's (FMF) National Campus 

  Program launches a non-partisan effort to increase voter turnout among women. 

  FMF's Get Out HER Vote effort will ignite widespread participation among young 

  women on college campuses in the upcoming elections. "Women's health care, abortion 

  rights, women's rights, affirmative action and pay equity are all issues of 

  great importance to young women and they are on line in the elections. We must 

  get the message out that women's future independence and equality hang in the 

  balance," said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation. 

  "Women will determine the outcome of these elections," added Smeal. </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Get Out HER Vote will kick off nationwide on campuses on Monday, October 23, 

  2000. Women's issues, such as reproductive rights, affirmative action, the gender 

  gap, pay equity, and gay and lesbian rights, will be central to delivering young 

  women to the polls on November 7th. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Trained FMF campus organizers will travel to new campuses each day from now 

  through November 7th and staff at FMF's DC office will reach out to even more 

  students nationwide. Organizers will recruit a team of Get Out HER Vote Deputies 

  on each campus and conduct Get Out HER Vote Training Sessions to assist campus 

  leaders in mobilizing women to get to vote on November 7th. Organizers will 

  also distribute non-partisan voter education literature that emphasizes the 

  potential of the women's vote and the vulnerability of women's rights during 

  this crucial election period.</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Young women insist on making an impact in these elections. Our lives are 

  at stake with the potential appointment of two to three Supreme Court Justices 

  whose decisions will affect the rest of our lives," said Sarah Boonin, FMF's 

  National Campus Program Director. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Get Out HER Vote Action Kits will be distributed nationwide and contain leaflets, 

  stickers, and flyers, as well as effective strategies to deliver women to the 

  polls. A Get Out HER Vote Hotline (866-444-3652) is in place to assist students 

  in their efforts. More information on FMF's Get Out HER Vote campaign can be 

  found on the Web at <a href="http://www.feministcampus.org/hervote.asp">www.feministcampus.org</a>.
