- October 24 - Relentless forest activists floated a giant Boise Cascade T-Rex 

          balloon over downtown this morning, donning a massive sign on its chest 

          that announced: &quot;I LOVE LOGGING OLD GROWTH!&quot; The 120 - foot 

          inflatable balloon at 13th and Front Streets towered over Boise Cascade 

          headquarters and circled the heart of downtown Boise beginning at 8:00 

          AM.

</font>&quot;Boise Cascade is the dinosaur of the logging industry.&quot; 

          explained Michael Brune, Old Growth Campaign Director for Rainforest 

          Action Network. &quot;However, the age of predatory logging is over. 

          If Boise Cascade does not adapt to the emerging values in the new economy, 

          it will not be able to survive in the modern marketplace.&quot; The 

          past few years have seen a wave of heavy wood users, home builders and 

          home improvement retailers commit to eliminating the use of old growth 

          wood and give preference to alternatives. Nearly twenty-five percent 

          of the U.S. lumber market has pledged to transform its use of wood and 

          paper products. Many of these companies, including Home Depot, Wickes 

          Lumber, and Centex Homes, are some of Boise Cascade's largest customers.

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While the American public demands an end to logging 

          on national forests and protecting our roadless areas and old growth 

          forests, Boise Cascade continues to flaunt the fact that it is the largest 

          purchaser of federal timber in the U.S.,&quot; stated Jake Kreilick, 

          Campaign Coordinator for the National Forest Protection Alliance. He 

          added, &quot;To add insult to injury, Boise Cascade is giving the U.S. 

          a bad name abroad with its devastating logging operations in British 

          Columbia, Mexico and Chile.&quot; 

        

</font>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coalition of environmental groups have a renewed focus 

          on Boise Cascade, targeting the company's operations in the U.S., Canada, 

          Brazil, Chile, as well as its old growth sales from endangered forests 

          in the Amazon Basin, Southeast Asia, Russia, and elsewhere. More than 

          three quarters of the world's old growth forests have already been logged 

          and degraded, much within the past three decades. In the United States, 

          less than five percent of our original forests remain.
