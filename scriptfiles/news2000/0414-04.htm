- April 14 - Physicians for Social 

Responsibility welcomes the news that the Russian State Duma has 

voted for ratification of the START II nuclear arms reduction treaty. 

The START II treaty would reduce the strategic arsenals of the U.S. 

and Russia to 3,000-3,500 warheads, a long overdue step which sets 

the stage for real deep cuts in nuclear forces to begin. Global 

security requires much deeper cuts in nuclear arsenals, and the 

de-alerting all missiles that currently threaten the world with 

nuclear disaster. 



<p>"These cuts help reduce the lethal legacy of the Cold War, 

although much remains to done," said Anne Gallivan, PSR's Associate 

Director of Security Programs. "Both the U.S. and Russia retain 

enough nuclear weapons to destroy each other several times over." 



<p>START II has taken seven years to ratify, and all further 

negotiations for deeper nuclear weapons cuts have been held up by 

this lack of progress. While the Duma has now ratified START II, it 

will not yet enter into force. The U.S. Senate must still approve 

the 1997 protocols extending deadlines for START II implementation 

and clarifying the ABM Treaty. Meanwhile, Republicans on Capitol 

Hill remain deeply hostile to arms control. Further, the Duma has 

made implementation of START II conditional on maintenance of the ABM 

Treaty, which is threatened by U.S. plans to deploy a National 

Missile Defense system. Other conditions of ratification insist on 

strict US observance of START II, and the non-deployment by NATO of 

nuclear weapons in new member states (Hungary, Poland, the Czech 

Republic). 



<p>The implementation of START II, and negotiations for START III and 

beyond, will require vigilant pressure from citizens and citizens 

groups, including PSR. To this end, PSR is cooperating with 

colleagues in the International Physicians for the Prevention of 

Nuclear War (IPPNW) to work for deep cuts. In May, PSR will host 

Russian colleagues for the next round of Dialogue with 

Decision-Makers, a forum which has given PSR and IPPNW 

representatives the opportunity to press the case for the reduction 

and elimination of nuclear forces with all nuclear weapon states 

governments. 



<p>PSR is disappointed in the current administration's lack of 

progress on arms control, noting that it is the first in 30 years to 

fail to conclude a new nuclear arms control agreement with Russia. 

PSR supports swift agreement of a START III Treaty, at the lowest 

possible level of nuclear warheads, and urges Congress to support the 

President in pushing for this important treaty. 



<p>"All the nuclear weapon states promised in the 1968 nuclear 

Non-Proliferation Treaty to abolish nuclear weapons," said Robert K. 

Musil Ph.D., Executive Director of PSR. "Thirty years is time enough 

for them to make good on that legal obligation. START II must be 

implemented without delay and without condition, as a step towards 

the final abolition of all nuclear weapons."
