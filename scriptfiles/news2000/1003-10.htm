- October 3 - In a move Ralph Nader called “the beginning of the end

of the Commission on Presidential Debates,” the debate commission, along

with three uniformed police, refused to admit Nader to the presidential

debate viewing auditorium Tuesday night, even though Nader had a ticket

to the event.



<p>Nader was given the ticket to the Lipke Auditorium by a Northeastern

student. As soon as Nader got off the bus en route to the auditorium, he

was met by a representative of the debate commission and three police

officers.



<p>The debate commission representative told Nader he had been instructed

by the Commission on Presidential Debates to tell Nader he was not

invited onto the premises even with a ticket.



<p>“Imagine that, a private company -- controlled by the two major parties

and funded by beer, tobacco, auto and other corporations -- misused

police power to exclude me from the premises, even though I had a ticket

to enter issued by the debate commission themselves,” Nader said.



<p>The CPD representative refused to provide his name or a reason for

excluding Nader from the debate auditorium.



<p>“On top of many other serious blunders, mistakes and demonstrations of

arrogance generated by this corrupt debate commission, which is

controlled by Al Gore and George W. Bush, this unlawful exclusion will

be the beginning of the end of the debate commission monopoly that is

obstructing millions of Americans from access to the presidential

candidates in a multi-candidate debate forum,” Nader said. “I was

excluded on political grounds and no other considerations were

communicated.”



<p>“In future elections, this country will be rid of the Commission on

Presidential Debates once and for all,” Nader said.



<p>Nader received the ticket from Northeastern student Tod Tavares, 21, who

got the ticket from his roommate. Tavares told the Associated Press that

giving the ticket to Nader was “a small sacrifice for the good of the

nation.”
