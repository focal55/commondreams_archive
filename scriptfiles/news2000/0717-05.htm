- July 17 - Today, Monday, July 17, the Violence Policy Center (VPC) released <a href="http://www.vpc.org/studies/pockcont.htm">Pocket Rockets:  The Gun Industry's Sale of Increased Killing Power.</a>  The 25-page study details how the gun industry has increased the lethality of its products by producing larger caliber, higher capacity and more readily concealable handguns in order to boost sales in a stagnant market.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Tom Diaz, VPC senior policy analyst and author of <i>Making a Killing:  The Business of Guns in America</i> was joined by U.S. Representative Rod Blagojevich (D-IL) to release the study at a news  conference today in Chicago. </font>

<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Pocket rockets are a dangerous new ingredient in America's firearms brew," VPC Senior Policy Analyst Tom Diaz said today. "These deadly weapons are the latest example of the gun industry's insatiable quest for a higher profit margin, regardless of the number of lives lost in their greedy and deadly venture."</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Reports by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and others show that handguns move relatively quickly from the legal trade in firearms into the hands of criminals and youths.  Predictably, crime gun tracing data show that as manufacturers have heavily marketed pocket rockets, these tiny but deadly pistols are moving into criminal use at a dramatically increasing rate.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



These handguns inflict incalculable human anguish and impose a substantial burden on the nation's health care system.  On average, the medical cost of each gunshot injury is about $17,000 and taxpayers end up paying for 49 percent of the lifetime costs of those injuries.
