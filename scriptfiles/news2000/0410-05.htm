- April 10 - Citing serious environmental concerns, the Sierra Club

     today announced opposition to permanent normal trade relations (NTR)

     with China. To persuade Congress to reject permanent NTR, the Sierra

     Club is launching a grassroots campaign in cooperation with the

     AFL-CIO.



     <p>"We are once again confronted by a trade agreement that fails to

     protect workers, their families and the environment," said Carl Pope,

     Executive Director of Sierra Club.  "The United States must retain the

     leverage afforded by annual review of our commercial relationship with

     China in order to ensure fair trade, clean trade, and green trade.  By

     fighting to improve U.S. trade policy toward China, the Sierra Club

     and AFL-CIO proudly continue our efforts working in unity to make

     trade clean, green and fair."



     <p>AFL-CIO President John Sweeney also praised the growing movement among

     environmentalists and labor to work together to improve U.S. trade

     policy.



     <p>"It's good news for working families that the Sierra Club is joining

     the campaign," said Sweeney.  "We will be successful together because

     concerns about the impact of a corporate-driven global economy on our

     people and our planet are inseparable."



     <p>In the coming weeks, Sierra Club activists around the country will be

     mobilizing to pressure Congress to vote against permanent NTR.  Some

     of these actions will be done jointly with the AFL-CIO.  Additionally,

     the Sierra Club is sending a letter to members of Congress which

     reads, in part: "Regrettably, the WTO/permanent NTR package fails to

     address impacts on working families and the environment.  Congress

     should reject permanent NTR with China as the minimum step toward

     preserving its leverage in the fight for socially just and

     environmentally sustainable trade policies."



     <p>Several concerns have led to the Sierra Club's opposition to permanent

     NTR for China:



     <p>*  Human Rights and the Environment -- Chinese environmental activists

     are already targets of abuse.  Such abuse could grow as China seeks

     competitive advantage in international markets.  By rejecting

     permanent NTR, Congress could oppose human rights abuses through its

     annual review process.



     <p>*  WTO Reform -- Given China's political system, it is likely to

     oppose democratic reform of the World Trade Organization.   By

     rejecting permanent normal trade relations, Congress will retain

     leverage with China in pressing for WTO reforms.



     <p>*  Endangered Species -- China's illegal trade in animal parts now

     threatens Asian tigers, African rhinos, and North American black

     bears.  Increased trade flows under permanent NTR and entry into the

     WTO could increase traffic in contraband animal parts.
