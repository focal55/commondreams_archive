- October 3 - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has legalized the

irradiation of fruit, vegetables, meat and eggs while ignoring federal safety regulations

and relying on dozens of tests that the agency&#146;s own expert scientists have dismissed

as invalid, a new report from Public Citizen and the Cancer Prevention Coalition reveals.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For 17 years, the FDA has knowingly and systematically ignored its own testing

protocols -- protocols that must be followed before irradiated food can be legalized for

human consumption,&quot; said Mark Worth, senior researcher for Public Citizen&#146;s

Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program. &quot;The FDA&#146;s record of regulating

food irradiation is an utter embarrassment. The agency&#146;s failings should outrage

everyone concerned about the wholesomeness of our food supply.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The scientific sleight-of-hand perpetuated by the FDA -- year after year,

decision after decision -- sets a new standard for governmental misfeasance,&quot; said

Dr. Samuel Epstein, chair of the Cancer Prevention Coalition, and professor of

environmental and occupational medicine at the University of Illinois Medical

Center-Chicago. &quot;The FDA should be held accountable for abdicating its regulatory

mandate to comply with standard testing procedures, while ignoring substantive evidence of

public health hazards.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The day will soon come,&quot; Epstein said, &quot;when international opposition

to American exports of irradiated food will surpass that of genetically engineered food.

If Congress fails to ban irradiated food, American farmers, ranchers and the economy could

pay a devastating price.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new report, <i>A Broken Record: How The FDA Legalized</i><b>&#151;</b><i>And

Continues To Legalize</i><b>&#151;</b> <i>Food Irradiation Without Testing It For Safety</i>,

was released today by Public Citizen and the Cancer Prevention Coalition. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report reveals how the FDA over the past 17 years has ignored its own rules for

certifying the safety of irradiated food; relied on more than 100 occasions on research

declared &quot;deficient&quot; by FDA toxicologists, and, along with other federal

agencies, misled Congress about the safety of irradiated food. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, the FDA has systematically dismissed evidence that irradiated food may not be

safe for human consumption. Much of this evidence suggesting that irradiated food can

cause mutations of genetic material and be toxic resulted from government-funded research

submitted to the FDA and members of Congress as early as 1968.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen and the Cancer Prevention Coalition are calling for the revocation of

all food irradiation permits and a full congressional investigation into the FDA&#146;s

role in regulating irradiated food. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;FDA bureaucrats must abide by their legal and moral responsibilities to ensure

that American families have safe food on their tables,&quot; said Wenonah Hauter, director

of Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program. &quot;Regulatory

systems at the FDA have broken down completely. It is no wonder that most Americans do not

trust their government to do the right thing. We should never see another fiasco like

this.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This report underscores the need for a ban on the sale and distribution of

irradiated food, which I have proposed in my home state,&quot; said New Jersey Assemblyman

John Kelly (R-Essex). &quot;I hope that other states -- and Congress -- will follow our

lead.&quot;</font></p>

Resource Action Center for the Environment; Felicia Nestor, Esq., of the Government

Accountability Project; and Kitty Tucker, Esq., of the Institute for Health and Energy.</font>
