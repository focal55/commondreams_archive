<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MARTIN A. LEE, (707) 431-7932, <a href="mailto:devlee@ap.net">devlee@ap.net</a>

The author of "The Beast Reawakens," a recent book about neofascism and

right-wing extremism in Europe and the U.S., Lee said today: "The inclusion

of Jorg Haider's Freedom Party, a movement with openly fascist roots, in the

national governing coalition in Austria is one of the most dangerous

developments in contemporary European politics. Holocaust-deniers and

neofascist ideologues are influential figures within the Freedom Party, and

its dramatic rise to power has coincided with a sharp increase in racist

violence in Austria, where shocking levels of anti-Semitism persist. There

is reason to be concerned about a spillover effect on German politics."

Coordinator of Voices in the Wilderness, Kelly and her colleagues have been

on a fast in front of the Capitol for nearly three weeks. They have been

threatened with fines and imprisonment for unauthorized delivery of medicine

and toys to Iraq. She said: "Yesterday, the Red Cross confirmed the findings

of each of our 30 delegations to Iraq -- hundreds of thousands of Iraqi

children are unjustly paying the price for the U.S./UN economic sanctions."

Also this week, 70 members of Congress sent a letter to President Clinton

(prepared by Reps. Tom Campbell and John Conyers) calling for an end to the

economic sanctions.

<br>

Rockler, a former prosecutor at the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials and the

first head of the Nazi-hunting unit of the Justice Department, said today of

attempts by Canadian attorneys and other lawyers to prosecute NATO

officials: "NATO policymakers clearly are guilty of war crimes in

Yugoslavia, but the prosecution staff of the [International Criminal]

Tribunal [for the Former Yugoslavia] is not independent, so they are not

going to charge those who effectively appointed them. It's like asking

administration officials to jail their boss."

Former editor of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and coordinator of

the U.S. Campaign to Free Mordechai Vanunu, Day said: "Yesterday, due to the

efforts of Issam Makhoul, a Palestinian member of the Knesset, the Israeli

people were exposed to the truth of the massive Israeli nuclear arsenal by

one of their own. But it was a dark day for the Knesset, which refused to

listen as Makhoul was cut off by the assembly speaker halfway through his

presentation. Makhoul noted that Israel is sitting on a time bomb, something

that could trigger a nuclear holocaust in the Mideast and could cause an

environmental disaster."
