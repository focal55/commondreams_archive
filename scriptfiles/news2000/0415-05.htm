<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- April 15 -Capping a day of police harassment against activists, 

at least 500 peaceful protesters were arrested this evening at 20th and 

K St NW.  The crowd had just completed a rally for justice in the prison 

system.  As of 8pm, activists were still being arrested.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The activists unexpectedly encountered a police blockade at which time 

they were surrounded and confined for "at least one hour."  During the 

hour activists made several attempts to negotiate their release.  According 

to multiple eyewitness reports, police refused requests by the protestors 

to immediately disperse and return home.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After refusing to communicate with protesters, additional police arrived 

on the scene – some in an armored vehicle – dressed in riot gear.  Lt. 

Jeff Harold of the DC Police addressed the crowd with a bullhorn, informing 

them that they would be arrested for "parading without a permit". Only 

press displaying credentials were allowed to leave. Riot police then began 

to advance on the crowd from both directions.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is obvious to us that this is an outrageous attempt by the police to 

block our first amendment rights and to prevent as many people as possible 

from making their voices heard tomorrow," declared Richard Becker of the 

International Action Center in San Francisco, an organizer of the rally. 

 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Despite police attempts throughout the day to intimidate nonviolent protesters, 

hundreds of new activists were trained today in church basements around 

the city," said Ilyse Hogue of the Mobilization for Global Justice.   "No 

matter how many of us are arrested today, we are resolved to carry our 

message to the streets tomorrow."
