- February 1 - Pacifica

Network News (PNN) is disappointed by the actions of a few individuals to

instigate a reporters’ boycott. The actions are misguided and will not bring

about any resolution of current disagreements within the Pacifica network. What’s more, it is unclear why the

organizers have chosen to attack PNN and its stringers.

</font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p>Contrary to the organizers' press release, the journalists

on the published boycotters list are not PNN's &quot;top reporters&quot; many

of the names on the list are unknown to the PNN staff. Others file stories only

occasionally. Still others on the list have told Pacifica staff they are not

taking part in the boycott and never signed on. In other words, the list is in

large part misinformation.</p>

Organizers of this boycott are calling it a “strike.” PNN is unionized and the bargaining

unit is represented by AFTRA. There is no strike underway as the boycotters

claim. And PNN has not been informed of any labor action by any other union

representing other bargaining units within Pacifica. It is misleading and

irresponsible for the boycotters to publicly proclaim a &quot;strike&quot; when

no such action exists and when the unionized staff has not been consulted. 

<p>This supposed boycott is only serving to drive more wedges between various members

of the Pacifica staff. As for the

network’s freelance reporters, many have claimed organizers have harrassed

them, pressuring them to take part in an effort that attempts to punish

innocent bystanders. In addition,

freelancers have been asked to sacrifice their income while many of the

organizers have full time jobs, some within Pacifica itself.</p>

<p>Pacifica Network News does not censor reporter’s work. Any charges of censorship within Pacifica are misleading and have

nothing to do with the network news. Every news organization decides what to publish or broadcast; that is

called news judgment and should not be swayed by any organization or group of

“boycotters” insisting on what should be covered.</p>

<p>

Those reporters taking part are attempting to deny Pacifica's audience the benefit of

the network's unique perspective on the world's events. That is not the purpose

of this network. We are here to inform. And with or without those reporters, we will

continue to provide our listeners with information and analysis.</p>

<p>

Pacifica

stations and affiliates should not be concerned about the effect of any

boycott. PNN will continue to broadcast

award wining news reports to Pacifica’s five stations and the more than 60

affiliates. PNN's nightly newscast is stronger than ever with reports coming in from around the

world and from next door</p>

<p>Pacifica

Network News is moving forward and we would like all our reporters to join us.

Pacifica will continue to develop its national news service with journalists

who adhere to the highest professional standards of performance and ethics.
