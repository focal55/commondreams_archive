          - February 16 - At a Capitol Hill press conference today members of 

          Congress called for the lifting of economic sanctions against the people 

          of Iraq and announced new measures to combat the sanctions. A spokesperson 

          from the office of Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) announced a series of legislative 

          initiatives related to easing the sanctions. These would:</font>

              conference Reps. David Bonior (D-MI) and Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), 

              and spokespersons for Reps. Tom Campbell (R-CA) and John Conyers 

              (D-MI) joined 11 Arab American and American Muslim organizations 

              in calling for an end to the sanctions. The conference follows a 

              letter sent by 70 members of Congress to President Clinton on Jan. 

              31 appealing for the lifting of sanctions against Iraq. At today's 

              press conference, Rep. Bonior said that the sanctions are &quot;not 

              just a moral outrage but a strategic blunder. We refuse to close 

              our eyes to the suffering of innocents.&quot; He said that sanctions 

              constitute &quot;Infanticide raised to the level of policy.&quot; 

              Rep. Kucinich said that the sanctions are &quot;not just counterproductive, 

              but immoral.&quot; He added that &quot;You can be opposed to the 

              Iraqi regime and opposed to the sanctions at the same time and we 

              must do that.&quot; A spokesman for Rep. Campbell said that &quot;We 

              simply call on the President to do what is right - lift the economic 

              sanctions.&quot; He said that the anti-sanctions movement &quot;is 

              truly a bipartisan effort on Capitol Hill. </font></p>
