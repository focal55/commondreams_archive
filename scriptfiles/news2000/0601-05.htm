- June 1 - A total of 8.2 percent of ExxonMobil shareholders have voted in favor of adding sexual orientation to the company's written non-discrimination policy, a 35 percent increase over last year. Proponents of the measure termed the vote a success, noting that it is sufficient to bring the issue before stockholders again next year.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This vote shows shareholders with millions of dollars of ExxonMobil stock are concerned about ExxonMobil's substandard equal employment opportunity policies," said Diane Bratcher, chair of the Equality Project, a coalition of lesbian and gay shareholders that coordinated Wednesday's successful vote. "ExxonMobil is falling behind the Fortune 500 and its oil industry peers by not barring sexual orientation discrimination. This is a business issue and ExxonMobil needs to move forward like General Electric, McDonald's, American Home Products, Johnson & Johnson and hundreds of other major corporations have in the last few years."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shareholders voted on the measure Wednesday at ExxonMobil's annual stockholder meeting in Dallas. The non-discrimination issue garnered a higher percentage of votes than any of the other eight measures on the shareholder ballot with the exception of electing the board of directors and approving the company's accounting firm. None of the several hundred attendees at the meeting spoke against the non-discrimination measure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Principal sponsor of the measure was the New York City Employees Retirement System (NYCERS).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lee R. Raymond, ExxonMobil's chairman and chief executive officer, defended ExxonMobil's position, saying legislative forums were the proper place for deciding which groups of workers should be protected from discrimination. He accused a supporter of the resolution of  "pitting one group against another" to win coverage for sexual orientation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"ExxonMobil has gone on record as opposing innovation in this area and letting the government set the pace and agenda of change," said investment analyst Shelley Alpern of Trillium Asset Management Corp., a co-sponsor of the proposal. "That's a fine strategy for letting your competitors get out ahead of you."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A similar resolution by the Equality Project received the support of 5.9 percent of votes cast at last year's Exxon stockholder meeting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Human Rights Campaign and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force supported the non-discrimination measure this year, and urged their members before Wednesday's meeting to contact their mutual and pension fund managers to lobby them to vote in favor of the proposal. Because the Human Rights Campaign is a shareholder, an HRC representative attended the meeting, voted HRC's shares and spoke in favor of the non-discrimination measure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By refusing to add the words 'sexual orientation' to its non-discrimination policy, ExxonMobil continues to subvert its own mandate to be on the 'leading edge of the competition in every aspect of our business,'" noted Kim I. Mills, HRC's education director. "ExxonMobil's key competitors already have this policy in writing, as do 70 percent of the Fortune 100 corporations. Not only does ExxonMobil deal in fossil fuels, it is becoming a fossil with respect to its employment policies." </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chevron, BP Amoco, Sunoco, Shell and Texaco ban discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation, and BP Amoco, Shell and Chevron offer same-sex domestic partnership benefits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Equality in the workplace for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered employees represents the very essence of a fair and democratic society," said Elizabeth Toledo, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. "ExxonMobil's rejection of  equality sends a chilling message to its customers, its stockholders and its potential investors about the values it embraces."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ExxonMobil shocked Mobil employees, the gay and lesbian community and civil rights groups in December when, following Exxon's merger with Mobil Corp., it rescinded the former Mobil non-discrimination policy that specifically included sexual orientation and chose not to extend Mobil's domestic partner benefits policy to employees of the new company. ExxonMobil is the first company to remove protection agains sexual orientation discrimination from its equal employment opportunity policy. The company was flooded with angry phone calls, faxes, e-mails, letters from Congress and protests outside its Houston office, which prompted managers to early on Jan. 28.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ExxonMobil has been unwilling to change its policies despite separate meetings with the shareholder coalition and the Human Rights Campaign. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Co-filing the proposal with NYCERS were Equality Project stockholders Dr. Ellen Birenbaum, Marianne Weil, Steven Strauss and other individual shareholders represented by Trillium Asset Management, a socially responsible investment firm.</font></p>
