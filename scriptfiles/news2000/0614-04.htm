- June 14 - High prices at the gas pump have translated

to windfalls for oil companies, which saw first-quarter profits in 2000 rise nearly 500

percent over the same period in 1999, a Public Citizen report shows.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Texaco&#146;s first-quarter profits jumped 473 percent over 1999, while Conoco&#146;s

profits skyrocketed 371 percent and Phillips saw its rise 257 percent. The numbers, which

were compiled for 10 major oil companies, were based on company data. ExxonMobil, Conoco,

BP Amoco, Coastal and Shell saw record first-quarter profits, according to their own press

releases.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oil companies likely will continue to rake in high profits as oil prices that dipped in

April begin to rise again.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Oil companies are ripping off the public and picking consumers&#146; pocketbooks

clean,&quot; Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook said. &quot;It&#146;s daylight

robbery, and it&#146;s threatening the economy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Imported crude oil cost just under $28 per barrel in March, dropped to $24 in April and

is back to $28 barrel this month.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One thing that could help conserve oil is to boost the fuel efficiency of vehicles, but

Congress has been loathe to do so. For years, fuel economy standards have remained

virtually unchanged for light trucks (which include sport utility vehicles (SUVs)). This

is in part because of a rider attached annually to the federal DOT appropriations bill

that bars the government from even studying the idea of raising fuel economy standards for

these vehicles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rider applies to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, passed in

1975 to conserve oil and improve the nation&#146;s gas mileage. The standards for cars

increased to 27.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 1985, doubling the fuel economy of the fleet.

The standards have helped cut pollution, improve air quality and enable polluted regions

to achieve the goals of the Clean Air Act.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today or Thursday, the Senate, led by Sens. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.), Dianne Feinstein

(D-Calif.) and Richard Bryan (D-Nev.), is scheduled to decide whether to reject the rider

contained in the House bill. If the rider is kept off the final bill, it would give the

government a green light to raise fuel economy standards and therefore help make cars and

light trucks go further on a gallon of gas. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current fuel efficiency standards are 20.7 mpg for light trucks and 27.5 mpg for cars.

If light trucks got the same gas mileage as cars, we would save 1 million barrels of oil

per day, according to <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/">Sierra Club</a> estimates. If

standards were raised to 45 mph for cars and 34 mpg for light trucks, we would save 3

million barrels of oil daily, the Sierra Club calculates. That&#146;s more oil than we

import daily from the Persian Gulf (1.8 million barrels) and far more than would be

generated by proposed Arctic refuge drilling (.3 million barrels daily) and California

coastal drilling (.25 million barrels daily).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The House leaders should stop kowtowing to the auto industry and blocking

technological changes essential to protecting society,&quot; Claybrook said. &quot;If

vehicles got better gas mileage, we would not be as dependent on foreign oil and would not

be victims of collusive pricing and high gas prices. The balance of payments would be

reduced with fewer imports, the environment would be cleaner, consumers would save money,

and we would not even be discussing drilling in valuable habitats to find more oil.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen&#146;s report notes that oil company political action committee (PACs)

contributed $859,000 to Republicans and Democrats in 1999 and 2000. Oil companies spent

$1.9 million in soft money contributions to both parties during the same time period and

in 1998 spent $31 million lobbying Congress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oil prices climbed in 1999 after historic 1998 lows because OPEC and other oil

producers collusively cut back on supplies in an attempt to raise prices. That prompted

oil companies to buy less crude oil and make less gasoline.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, Americans used more gasoline and oil products such as diesel fuel during

1999 than ever before, according to the Energy Information Administration, a branch of the

U.S. Department of Energy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In March, OPEC agreed to boost crude oil production, but the added oil was not enough

to meet an ever-growing demand. OPEC members are scheduled to meet June 21 to discuss the

possibility of a further production boost, but with summer travel creating a higher demand

for gasoline, the federal government expects crude oil and gas prices to continue to rise

and not level off until late summer. The government already is predicting there may be

shortages of diesel fuel and heating oil next winter.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The oil industry is generating these gargantuan profits by creating artificial

shortages,&quot; said</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wenonah Hauter, director of <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/">Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass

Energy and Environment Program</a>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Unfortunately, consumers are the big losers.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further exacerbating the situation is that new standards for reformulated gasoline,

which helps reduce smog, took effect in January. Low inventories of gasoline, plus low

inventories of the chemicals needed to make reformulated gasoline, are leading to higher

gas prices in some areas of the country. This is particularly the case in Chicago and

Milwaukee, where shortages of gas and those chemicals are acute.</font></p>

<p>



<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Solutions exist, Hauter said. They include:</font></p>

<blockquote>



<blockquote>

  

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Increasing the efficiency of cars (not increased for a decade) and light

    trucks (barely increased for two decades);</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Increasing investment in mass transit, including subways, light rail and trains;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Forcing oil companies to create adequate reserves of gas, diesel fuel and heating

    fuels; and</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Imposing an excess profits tax to remove any incentive for the oil industry to make

    windfall profits.</font></p>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some politicians have suggested cutting the federal gas tax, which would be

counterproductive because that money is used to maintain roads and support mass transit.

Others have suggested opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and increasing coastal

drilling, both of which would threaten the environment, and providing tax subsidies to

domestic oil producers, a bad idea because it would be a gift to the oil industry at

consumers&#146; expense, Hauter said.
