- October 16 - Big money in politics has dirtied up the

American democratic process, and Green Party presidential candidate

Ralph Nader is today launching a fleet of vans to help clean up the

problem.



<p>Dubbed the “Corporate Influence Clean-Up Crew,” the cleaners will cross

the country in a fleet of vans to draw attention to the problem of dirty

money in politics and offer solutions. The vans were launched from

Washington, D.C. today.



<p>“As part of our pledge to bring the campaign to every area of the

country, the vans will travel throughout the south spreading the word

about how corporate influence is undermining our democracy,” said Nader

2000 campaign manager Theresa Amato.



<p>Campaign finance reform is a major theme of Nader’s candidacy. Nader –

who this week announced that his campaign has already reached its $5

million fundraising goal -- accepts no corporate soft money

contributions and no political action committee contributions. The $5

million and counting has been raised entirely through individual

contributions averaging less than $100 each.



<p>Nader is the only major presidential candidate who supports full public

financing of public elections. “Year after year, big business invests in

politicians and political parties by giving them millions of dollars,

and in return, those businesses get corporate welfare, weak law

enforcement and tax breaks worth billions of dollars. The biggest single

obstacle to honest, just government action – government of, by and for

the people – is the corruption of special-interest money in our election

campaigns,” Nader said.



<p>Al Gore and George W. Bush Al Gore and George W. Bush have both

benefited from millions of dollars in corporate soft money and PAC money

contributions. Neither candidate supports full public funding of

elections.



<p>Nader’s Corporate Influence Clean-Up Crew will travel through 12

southern states throughout the remainder of the campaign to call

attention to the perils of cash-register politics. Armed with janitorial

props and thousands of bars of soap, the three vans will travel to

Kentucky, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana,

Missouri, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Florida. The vans will

make two to three stops per day, conducting events including street

theatre, rallies, meetings with local supporting groups and the

occasional political prank.
