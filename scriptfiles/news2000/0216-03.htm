          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - February 

            16 - Dear Mr. Tafel, We are thoroughly disappointed in the recent 

            press release your organization issued condemning the Human Rights 

            Campaign (HRC) for our presidential endorsement of Al Gore. We found 

            the Log Cabin Republican's (LCR) negative attack to not only be unnecessary, 

            but also a willful distortion of our record and emblematic of the 

            infighting that has divided our community in the past. Name-calling 

            and misrepresentation for political gain is counterproductive and 

            helps no one except our adversaries on the extreme right. Your organization 

            - often the recipient of ad hominem attacks - should be acutely aware 

            of this, and therefore know better. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HRC has long supported 

            the mission of LCR because we recognize that the passage of laws banning 

            discrimination requires bipartisan support. We applaud your organization 

            for working within the Republican party to gain backing for such measures. 

            LCR has been an agent of change, and HRC is grateful for your group's 

            past contributions in helping to create a world where gay and lesbian 

            Americans can live openly, with dignity and respect. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, we take 

            great exception to LCR's accusation that our endorsement of Gore "perpetuates 

            HRC's long-cited image as the voice of the Democratic establishment, 

            not the 'bipartisan' organization it claims to be." As you know, HRC 

            has supported and continues to support candidates who champion our 

            issues regardless of party affiliation. We dream of a day when presidential 

            candidates from both the Republican and Democratic parties vie for 

            the support of gay and lesbian Americans. When this occurs we will 

            have essentially won our fight - at least on the political front - 

            for equality. It is clear, however, that today is not that day. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LCR argues that 

            HRC should have endorsed Bradley because he supports amending the 

            Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sexual orientation, and for his 

            early endorsement of ending the ban on gays in the military. If LCR 

            finds these positions laudable - which they are - then where is their 

            indignation and outrage over the fact that no GOP candidate supports 

            these views. We find it strange that LCR would split hairs over the 

            differences between the exemplary records of both Democrats, while 

            remaining silent on the anti-gay policy positions of both Bush and 

            McCain - not to mention Alan Keyes. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this election 

            cycle there are clear-cut differences between the Democratic and Republican 

            presidential candidates. Al Gore has a long history of support for 

            our community and we believe he is our best bet for achieving equality 

            and acceptance in the new millennium. Gore has been in the forefront 

            of advancing gay and lesbian issues, as well as fighting against the 

            spread of HIV/AIDS. While Gore spoke at a Human Rights Campaign press 

            conference last week, Bush was speaking at Bob Jones University, and 

            McCain was defending the flying of the Confederate flag over South 

            Carolina's capitol building. This clearly symbolizes which voters 

            each party's candidates are trying to reach. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is hardly HRC's 

            fault that the rhetoric and records of both Democratic presidential 

            candidates is undeniably superior to that of their Republican counterparts. 

            As the group representing gay Republicans, we understand your organization's 

            obvious disappointment and frustration with this year's crop of GOP 

            presidential candidates. It has left you with the dubious options 

            of supporting either Pat Robertson-backed George W. Bush or Gary Bauer-backed 

            John McCain, who recently said that homosexuality "is a lifestyle 

            I don't approve of." Nevertheless, your disenchantment with the GOP 

            field is no reason to assail HRC for endorsing the best candidate, 

            who simply happens to be a Democrat. Instead of attacking HRC, we 

            urge you to continue the worthy endeavor of educating the GOP leadership, 

            and narrowing the current disparity between the two parties on our 

            issues. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sincerely, </font></p>

            GORE ENDORSEMENT UNDERMINES HRC's CLAIMED MISSION<br>

            </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perpetuates 

            Image of HRC as the Voice of the Gay Democratic Establishment; Bradley 

            Better on Issues Checklist, No Credible Educational Effort on Republican 

            Side</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> (WASHINGTON) 

            In the wake of a unanimous vote of the board of the Human Rights Campaign 

            to endorse Vice President Al Gore (D) for President on February 9, 

            the nation's largest gay Republican organization expressed no surprise 

            at the decision, adding that the move perpetuates HRC's long-cited 

            image as the voice of the gay Democratic establishment, not the "bi-partisan" 

            organization it claims to be. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HRC Executive 

            Director Elizabeth Birch told the Associated Press on February 10 

            that while HRC waited to endorse then-Governor Bill Clinton (D) in 

            1992 until after he had clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, 

            the Gore campaign contacted her group a few weeks ago and asked for 

            an early endorsement this year. Birch admitted that the unusual timing 

            of the endorsement was deliberate as the crucial Super Tuesday primaries 

            on March 7 were approaching, the first in which gay Democratic votes 

            will be large enough to significantly influence the race. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We thought we 

            better make a decision while it is valuable and relevant," AP quoted 

            Birch as saying. "Our candidate needs us." </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Birch also told 

            AP that Democratic challenger Bill Bradley, who has been better than 

            Gore on key gay rights issues, was "late in the game" with his support 

            of gay rights. Bradley has called for the inclusion of "sexual orientation" 

            as a protected class for employment, housing and other protections, 

            while Gore supports limited legislation focused only on employment. 

            </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bradley has for 

            years called for gays to serve openly in the military, while the Clinton-Gore 

            administration authored the "don't ask, don't tell policy," which 

            Gore staunchly defended until he changed his position in December 

            to match Bradley's. Gay Democratic clubs around the country have been 

            divided between Bradley and Gore, even after decisive wins by Gore 

            in New Hampshire and Iowa, where the gay vote is seen as less influential 

            then in Super Tuesday states like California,New York, Ohio, Massachusetts 

            and Georgia. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"If you were a 

            single issue gay Democratic organization, you'd have little choice 

            but to support Bill Bradley. So, it is no surprise when a gay Democratic 

            establishment organization makes an early and unanimous endorsement 

            of the Democratic establishment candidate," said Rich Tafel, executive 

            director of Log Cabin Republicans. "It is especially unsurprising 

            after they publicly admit it was timed to do the most damage to Bradley, 

            who scores better on many of the key issues on HRC's overall issues 

            checklist. What is surprising, however, is that HRC still claims to 

            be a bi-partisan organization. HRC has made some important inroads 

            into the Democratic Party, and would be better off embracing its hard-won 

            position as a powerful player there and not hold out the myths of 

            bi-partisanship and that their issues checklist governs endorsements." 

            </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In their press 

            release on the decision, HRC pointed to a number of items they said 

            prove that "Al Gore understands words create dreams, but actions create 

            results." Among them, HRC said Gore "fought within the Clinton administration 

            to expand Medicaid coverage for people with AIDS," when in fact Gore 

            announced the initiative in a fundraising speech in 1997 and never 

            gave another address on the subject, nor were any steps taken by Gore 

            or his administration to enact it. HRC credited Gore with committing 

            to "provide money for better, life saving [AIDS] drugs," when in fact 

            the Republican Congress has been forced to appropriate millions of 

            dollars in additional AIDS drug funding every year since 1995 (increases 

            supported by Bradley in 1995 and 1996) because the Clinton-Gore AIDS 

            budget requests have consistently been inadequate. HRC also prominently 

            cited the fact that Gore and his wife visited and read names at the 

            AIDS Quilt and that his wife chaired the Washington, D.C. AIDS Walk 

            as the first examples of how "Gore and his wife Tipper have been in 

            the forefront in the fight against AIDS and the spread of HIV at home 

            and abroad." </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HRC did not hold 

            their decision until holding a formal meeting with Senator John McCain, 

            who has prominent openly gay elected officials in senior campaign 

            positions and publicly reached out to gay Republican voters early 

            in the campaign. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"If HRC were bi-partisan, 

            they would have put a premium on having the courtesy of sitting down 

            in a formal meeting with Senator McCain before making an endorsement, 

            but it's clear that internal Democratic Party politics were more crucial 

            to them," Tafel said. "The Republicans on HRC's board who voted to 

            join in this internal Democratic Party struggle forfeited any credible 

            opportunity to change HRC's image. The dramatic struggle going on 

            right now in the Republican Party, which has captured the nation's 

            attention, is likely to have a much greater impact on the future of 

            gay Americans, and HRC has written off any chance of playing even 

            a minor role in it." </font></p>

            local chapters nationwide, a full-time Washington office and a federal 

            political action committee. </font></p>
