- June 26 - A new World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report, <a href="http://www.wwf.org/news/attachments/right_whales.doc">Right Whales: The Most Endangered Great Whale in the World</a>, warned today that the northern right whale will become extinct in the Atlantic, unless the United States and Canada take urgent action.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Considered the most endangered of the world's great whales, northern right whales are estimated to number at fewer than 1000 globally.  Although a League of Nations agreement banned right whale hunting in 1935, right whale numbers currently are falling by about 2.5 per cent each year in the North Atlantic, which is home to what may be the only potentially viable population of the species that remains. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The whales migrate up and down the East Coast of North America, between feeding grounds off New England and Nova Scotia and calving grounds off Florida and Georgia, where the last several years have witnessed steep declines in birth rates. Only six new calves were recorded in 1998 and three in 1999. Only one calf was spotted during the 2000 calving season. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

While their declining birth rates are deeply troubling, the whales are also threatened by collisions with ships. Indeed, ninety per cent of all unnatural deaths are a result of right whales being struck by ships.  

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Northern right whales were the first victims of commercial whaling, and they took such a beating that they're still on the brink of extinction even after six decades of protection," said Karen Baragona, cetacean conservation program officer for World Wildlife Fund. "It's one step forward, two steps back for these whales--safe from whaling, they're now getting pounded by shipping and fishing activities."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Right whales, so called because whalers considered them the easy targets and thus the "right whales" to hunt, swim slowly and spend much of their time near the surface of the water.  The northern right whales live and breed in one of the busiest shipping routes in the world, and are therefore particularly vulnerable to being hit by ships.  Another major threat is entanglement in fishing gear, which can cause debilitating injury and a slow death. Nearly 60 percent of North Atlantic right whales bear scars from fishing gear.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

WWF is urging the US and Canadian governments to introduce modifications in fishing gear and seasonal restrictions in related fisheries to help reduce the unacceptably high death rate, and to develop ship collision prevention systems. Increased federal funding for right whale conservation is also urgently needed, and WWF is requesting that Congress appropriate an additional $1 million to find solutions to the problems driving the decline of this species.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

With the opening of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) on July 3 in Adelaide, Australia, WWF is calling on the 40 IWC member governments to take strong action to ensure a future for northern right whales.  WWF is also urging governments responsible for right whale habitat to develop ship free zones and a system of protected areas to cover all major breeding, calving and feeding grounds.
