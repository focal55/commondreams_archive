- October 2 - Two new studies highlight the impact on young adults of

George W. Bush’s partial-privatization plan, which would require substantial

cuts in Social Security benefits, such as raising the retirement age and

reducing Social Security disability and survivors insurance payments.



<p>The Economic Policy Institute and 2030 Action will release the reports at a

panel discussion on Monday, October 2 at 1:30 p.m. at the National Press

Club in Washington, D.C.



<p>In order for workers to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes,

Bush would divert at least $1 trillion out of Social Security over the next

ten years – a severe shortfall that, experts say, would lead to cuts in

Social Security benefits.  Governor Bush has not specified any source of

funding to offset this $1 trillion shortfall.



<p>Raising the Retirement Age: The Wrong Direction for Social Security, by EPI

economist Christian Weller, shows that if cuts to Social Security were

achieved by raising the retirement age – which Bush specifically has not

ruled out – then today’s 33-year-olds would work until they were nearly 74

before collecting full benefits. The report also finds that those who rely

most on Social Security would suffer most if the retirement age rises.



<p>Young Social Security Beneficiaries in the Fifty States, by 2030 Action

Director Hans Riemer, shows that 4.3 million Americans under age 40 receive

Social Security checks each month, largely through Social Security’s

disability and survivors insurance programs.  The report argues that the

shortfall in Social Security funds caused by the Bush privatization approach

would lead to significant cuts in disability and survivors benefits. A

different report is also available for each state.
