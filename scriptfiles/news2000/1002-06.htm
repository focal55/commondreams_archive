- October 2 - As the Senate/House



Conference meets to finish action on the Fiscal Year (FY) 2001



Defense Authorization Act, Physicians for Social Responsibility



(PSR) is appealing on behalf of its 20,000 physician members to the



Republican leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives not to



reject a package of aid for workers made ill during their



employment in the nuclear weapons complex. The plan would provide



compensation and medical care for workers with illnesses from



exposure to radiation, beryllium and silica.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The package was included in the Senate version of the FY2001



Defense Authorization Bill, but not by the House of



Representatives. Despite active lobbying by Republicans and



Democrats in the House and Senate, as well as the Department of



Energy, unions and non-governmental organizations including PSR,



Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and others in the House Republican



leadership have refused to allow the plan to go forward. They were



only prepared to allow yet more study of the worker's situation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These workers have been irradiated and poisoned in the course



of producing nuclear weapons, and the nation now owes them at least



the minimum of healthcare and financial support proposed in the



Senate plan," said Douglas Mains, MD. "Illinois workers suffering



from health effects of their work including berylliosis need help.



Speaker Hastert should be doing all he can to get them that help,



not trying to block this crucial funding."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PSR has long campaigned for DOE to remedy the situation of



nuclear weapons workers, publishing an in-depth report on the



Department's neglect in 1992. Only in April 2000 did the DOE admit



responsibility for the illnesses of the workers who built the



70,000 nuclear weapons the US has deployed. Balking at paying



compensation estimated at as little as $1.7 billion to $3 billion



over ten years (in FY2001 alone the nuclear weapons budget is some



$35 billion, the defense budget is over $310 billion), the House



Republican leadership has ignored members of its own party in



blocking the compensation deal. Representatives Lamar Smith



(R-Texas), Ed Whitfield (R-Ky.), and Senators Jim Bunning (R-Ky.),



Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) have all worked



hard in support of compensation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Congress must act today to right past wrongs," said Robert K.



Musil, Ph.D., executive director and CEO of PSR. "Republicans and



Democrats must come together to vote for this compensation



package."</font>
