- October 2 - News Advisory:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A new poll, conducted by the Center on Public Attitudes, a



social science group associated with the University of Maryland,



reveals that despite a robust stock market, Americans



overwhelmingly want the Presidential candidates to debate issues of



basic equality and fairness that are largely ignored in the current



elections. "As our new poll reveals, the American public is deeply



concerned by issues including labor rights and environmental



considerations in international trade, the gap between the rich and



the poor, and excessive military spending. Issues which will be



largely ignored by tonight's debate duopoly by the Republican and



Democratic parties," said John Cavanagh of the Institute for Policy



Studies.

Debates are Illegal

<br>

Oct. 2 at 9 p.m.

<br>

Harvard Law School, 101 Hauser Hall

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speakers include:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Jamin Raskin, director of the Appleseed Commission on



Electoral Reform at American University and a leading scholar on



the history and current structure on the Commission on Presidential



Debates.

<br>

-- Chuck Collins, executive director of the Boston-based United



for A Fair Economy, a non-partisan citizen organization working to



reduce economic inequality and increase shared prosperity.

<br>

-- Amy Quinn, Institute for Policy Studies, an independent



research organization, to outline the new poll results

<br>

&nbsp;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speakers will address:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- How the exclusion of third party candidates will lead to one



of the lowest debate viewerships and voter turnout in years<br>

-- How the current funding and operational structure of the



Commission on Presidential Debates is illegal under Federal



Election Commission rules

<br>

-- Why the first Presidential debates of the new millennium will



be met by public frustration and protest as citizens feel locked



out of debate forums

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Given the tremendous impact debates can have on elections, it



is a crime that they have been entrusted to the private Commission



on Presidential Debates which is entirely controlled by the two



major parties and their corporate sponsors", said Jamin Raskin,



head of an independent task force on Presidential Debates convened



by American University. "A more inclusive approach to the debates



would allow any candidate who has 5 percent support in national



polls or who national polls show a majority of the public wants



included."</font>
