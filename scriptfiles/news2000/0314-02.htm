- March 14 - 56% of Drinking Water Right to Know Reports surveyed by a coalition of consumer, environmental and public health organizations met or exceeded federal requirements and provided consumers straightforward information about their drinking water, according to a report released today. However, 44% of the reports received grades of &quot;D&quot; or &quot;F&quot; in a first ever nationwide survey of &quot;Consumer Confidence Reports&quot; required under the Safe Drinking Water Act.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Good reports can provide a fountain of knowledge about drinking water quality,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Staff Attorney Grant Cope. &quot;Unfortunately, we are concerned that, when it comes to informing the public, far too many reports leave people with misleading or inadequate information.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Campaign for Safe and Affordable Drinking Water surveyed 430 Drinking Water Right to Know Reports (also called Consumer Confidence Reports) from water utilities that serve over 40 million people in 20 states and the District of Columbia. The 1996 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act require most water utilities to produce these annual reports that describe the drinking water source, contaminants detected in the drinking water, and the health effects and sources of those contaminants. &quot;The reports are valuable new tools that will help consumers make appropriate health decisions about drinking water and support efforts to improve water quality<i><b>,&quot; </b></i>said Paul Schwartz of the Clean Water Fund.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A major area of concern for the groups was the use of unqualified reassurances of safety, such as &quot;Your Water Is Safe.&quot; 45% of the reports examined contained such unqualified statements. The report points out that, while such reassurances may be true for some people, they are not true for those persons more vulnerable to drinking water contaminants such as infants, the frail elderly, and people living with HIV or AIDS. Further, the groups pointed out that such statements do not reflect that some federal drinking water standards are woefully out of date and not protective of even healthy adults. EPA discouraged such unqualified statements of safety in its March and August 1999 Guidance documents to utilities and states.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">26% of the reports surveyed received bonus points for prominently displaying required warnings to vulnerable populations. &quot;Making this warning easily found and understandable fulfills the central purpose of the reports by providing vital information to those who need it,&quot; said Diana Neidle of the Consumer Federation of America. &quot;Information about health risks should be prominent, not hidden in the fine print,&quot; she concluded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 44% percent of the reports that received grades of &quot;D&quot; or &quot;F&quot; generally missed important federal requirements. For example, 7% failed to list <u>only</u> detected contaminants in the table, forcing the reader to comb through a confusing list to determine what was actually detected. About 4% omitted or edited the required warning to vulnerable populations about susceptibility to drinking water contaminants. 8% did not include possible sources of detected contaminants, while others omitted or drastically reduced the EPA-supplied text that describes the types of contaminants. &quot;Utilities, states and EPA must work together to address why many reports missed one or more of the regulatory requirements,&quot; said Lynn Thorp of the Campaign for Safe and Affordable Drinking Water.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Almost all utilities complied with the requirement to identify the source of drinking water; 23% received &quot;bonus points&quot; for including both maps and narrative descriptions of source water. &quot;For many consumers, these reports provide the first opportunity to actively consider that drinking water comes from anywhere other than 'the tap'&quot;, said Paul Schwartz of the Clean Water Fund. &quot;When these reports begin to name polluters of source water, they will become critical links between downstream water users and upstream efforts to stop the contamination of our drinking water,&quot; he continued.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumer Federation of America is a non-profit association of some 240 pro-consumer groups that was founded in 1968 to advance the consumer interest through advocacy and education.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CSADW graded 430 reports in 20 states and the District of Columbia: Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Virginia. Surveys are also available from California and New York, but data from these states is not included in the national report due to different state requirements for the Reports. State contacts for obtaining detailed findings from each state can be found by consulting the &quot;State Contacts&quot; section of the report or one of the individuals listed above. Two fact sheets, &quot;Making Sense of Right to Know Reports&quot; and &quot;Are You More Vulnerable to Drinking Water Contaminants&quot; are also available from the contacts listed above.</font></p>
