- February 14 - "We are putting the four major networks on notice: <a href="http://www.now.org/nnt/winter-2000/watchout.html">Watch

Out, Listen Up!</a>&nbsp; And, move over Nielsen, feminists across the

country will be tuning in with a critical eye and announcing our own ratings,"

said National Organization for Women (NOW) President <a href="http://www.now.org/officers/pi.html">Patricia

Ireland</a>.

<p>Watch Out, Listen Up! is NOW's campaign to create a more socially responsible

and diverse U.S. media.&nbsp; Teams of Feminist Field Analysts will monitor

prime-time network programming during the February Sweeps Month.&nbsp;

While Nielsen rates television shows based on popularity, NOW will evaluate

them based on content.&nbsp; The feminist analysts will rate programs by

documenting the amount of violence, stereotypes, sexual exploitation and

social responsibility.

<p>"The release of NOW's program ratings will be a moment of truth for

the networks.&nbsp; Feminist viewers across the country will decide if

ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC measure-up when it comes to treatment of&nbsp; women,"

Ireland said.&nbsp; NOW will analyze the results of the feminist television

surveys and issue a report of the survey's findings at the beginning of

the May Sweeps period.

<p>"<a href="http://www.nowfoundation.org/communications/tv/">Media activism</a>

is crucial in the fight for women's rights.&nbsp; Watch Out, Listen Up!

is another step toward making television more relevant to women's lives

and more responsive to women's needs," Ireland said.&nbsp; "Stay tuned

to NOW to find out if the networks will get cheers or jeers from women!"
