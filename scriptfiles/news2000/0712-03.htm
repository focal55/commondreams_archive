- July 12 - To reduce childhood obesity, Commercial Alert, child advocates, public

health professionals, food safety groups and media scholars today asked

key Members of Congress to get the public schools to stop promoting junk

food to schoolchildren.



<p>The letter to Senate and House Agriculture Committee Chairmen Richard

Lugar (R-IN) and Larry Combest, (R-TX) and Ranking Members Tom Harkin

(D-IA) and Charles Stenholm (D-TX) says that in thousands of schools

"corporations and school administrators have joined together to market

high-calorie, caffeinated, high-sugar candy and soda pop to

impressionable children," which contradicts the purposes of the National

School Lunch Program.  The letter follows.



<p>Dear Chairmen Lugar and Combest, and Ranking Members Harkin and

Stenholm:



<p>When he signed the National School Lunch Act into law in 1946, Harry

Truman said that "no nation is any healthier than its children."  Later

that year, Truman expanded on this theme. "The well nourished school

child is a better student," Truman said.  "He is healthier and more

alert.  He is developing good food habits which will benefit him for the

rest of his life.  In short, he is a better asset for his country in

every way."

	

<p>Congress enacted the National School Lunch Act to achieve the goal that

President Truman articulated so well.  The Act established the National

School Lunch Program "to safeguard the health and well-being of the

Nation's children."  



<p>After extensive hearings, and reviews of statistical surveys of

students, Congress concluded that children learn better on a healthy

diet.  In its report on the bill, the House Committee on Agriculture

wrote: "The educational features of a properly chosen diet served at

school should not be underemphasized. Not only is the child taught what

a good diet consists of, but his parents and family likewise are

indirectly instructed." In its own report, the Senate Committee on

Agriculture noted that "proper nutrition is essential for the health and

well-being of a child and for his growth and development as a citizen."



<p>For decades, the School Lunch Program has served this nation well.  It

has provided tens of billions of healthful meals to the nation's

schoolchildren.  In recent years, however, the goals of the School Lunch

Program have come under increasing attack, and the culprits are the

recipients of these federal dollars -- that is, the public schools.  



<p>In Fiscal Year 1999, schools happily accepted $7.4 billion in taxpayer

funds to carry out the federal school food programs. Yet thousands of

those schools have openly defied the intent of the Senate and House

Agriculture Committees, and Congress as a whole, in providing those

dollars, by encouraging school children to eat junk food.  In these

schools, corporations and school administrators have joined together to

market high-calorie, caffeinated, high-sugar candy and soda pop to

impressionable children.



<p>Propaganda touting the consumption of junk food is now commonplace in

the nation's schools. About 12,000 schools show Primedia's Channel One,

an in-school marketing program disguised as a news show, which features

a parade of ads for junk food and soda pop to a contractually obligated

captive audience of about eight million school children. In recent

months, Channel One has used the public classrooms to promote Snickers,

Twix, M&M's, Pepsi, Hostess Cakes, Milky Way, Doritos, Mountain Dew,

Nestle's Crunch, Skittles and others.



<p>This propaganda campaign for bad nutrition is intensifying. Soda pop is

an example.  Advertising Age reported last year that "In the last 18

months alone, the number of exclusive soda contracts in school districts

has increased nationwide 300%, to 150." According to Channel One's Teen

Fact Book 2000, schools sell soda pop as their "top beverage product,"

and the top food products sold are potato chips, tortilla chips and

cookies. 



<p>It is probably no accident that childhood obesity has become a major

public health problem in the United States.  An article in the October

27, 1999 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association notes

"alarming increases in obesity among children and adolescents," and an

accompanying editorial remarks on the role of the "marketing of snack

foods" in the obesity epidemic.  In 1998, Surgeon General David Satcher

observed that many young people in America today are "starting out obese

and dooming themselves to the difficult task of overcoming a tough

illness." 



<p>These young people will subject themselves and the whole society to

enormous costs.  One recent study estimates that the total annual cost

of obesity in the United States is nearly $100 billion, for diseases

such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, as well as extra

visits to doctors, bed-rest and lost work days.



<p>This is exactly the kind of result that Congress intended the School

Lunch Program to avoid.  It sought to promote healthful eating habits so

that young Americans could grow up to be contributors to society, not

medical burdens upon it.  Yet that is what the public schools -- schools

that accept millions of dollars in Lunch Program funds -- are

promoting.  		



<p>To its credit, Congress wisely reserved for itself full authority over

the educational aspects of the Lunch Program.  It specifically prevented

the Secretary of Agriculture from getting involved in this area.  In

other words, the ball is in your court, and if you do not act now, the

problem will likely grow worse.  Of course, local school administrators

can put commercial propaganda in their schools if they wish.  That's for

them to decide.  



<p>But it's for Congress to decide whether it will continue to lavish

hundreds of millions of dollars in school lunch funds upon schools that

are violating the very purpose for that program -- for money.   School

administrators shouldn't be allowed to have it both ways.  They

shouldn't be able to take federal money for school lunches, and then

take money or products from corporations to subvert the purposes of the

lunch program. 



<p>Actions have consequences, and that applies as much to school

administrators as to anyone else.  If these people are not willing to

abide by the purposes of the School Lunch Program -- that is, the

"improvement of the health and well-being of the Nation's youth"-- then

perhaps they should pay for their own lunch program.  Federal taxpayers

deserve better, and so do the nation's youth.
