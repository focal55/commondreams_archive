<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- January 31 - As the second session of the 106th of Congress begins, the Sierra Club

     is preparing for some tough battles.  At stake is the clean water we

     drink and the ability for our communities to adequately clean up toxic

     waste sites.  During the State of the Union Address, President Clinton

     laid out a bold agenda to safeguard our National Forests, stop sprawl,

     make communities more livable, protect open space and parks and curb

     global warming.  But Clinton is not waiting for Congress to act, he is

     already using his executive powers to establish new national monuments

     and protect our wild forests.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite overwhelming public support, anti-environmental forces in

     Congress will likely spend most of this coming year trying to undo or

     override these and other popular environmental initiatives.  Below are

     some of the actions the Sierra Club expects to see in this year's

     Congress.  We hope you will use this information to monitor the

     environmental movement in Congress and we encourage you to contact our

     issue experts for any additional information you need.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*  Last year, President Clinton announced a plan to protect America's

     wild forests. This initiative could protect up to 60 million acres of

     unspoiled areas in National Forests from logging and other destructive

     uses. Congress is likely going to try to halt the plan with

     legislative amendments.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*  This month, using his authority under the Antiquities Act,

     President Clinton  announced the designation of three national

     monuments. This is the first set of what we hope will be a series of

     national monument  designations this year.  Congress is expected to

     fight to block each monument designation.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*  Most Congressional action regarding the environment will come in

     the form of riders on the must-pass funding bills. The practice of

     attaching anti-environmental riders proved very popular among enemies

     of the environment in 1999 and we expect this trend to continue. Along

     with introducing new anti-environmental legislation, riders are also

     often used to cut or underfund good programs such as management for

     forests, wilderness, fish and wildlife, recreation, and curbing global

     warming. Riders to    derail the wild forest protection plan and halt

     monument designations are very likely.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*  Another likely legislative vehicle could be an omnibus public lands

     bill that rolls together many measures that have been considered by

     the Committee but have not seen floor action. These omnibus bills can

     be very dangerous to the environment, as a handful of popular measures

     are held hostage by destructive amendments.  The final package will

     likely still contain some damaging measures.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*  Because it is an election year, Congress has scheduled only 114

     legislative working days, the remainder of the year will be devoted to

     "district work periods."  This almost guarantees that Congress will

     not take up much new environmental legislation or reauthorize major

     environmental statutes





     Following are more actions and bills we anticipate, broken down by

     specific issue:





     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wildlands/Forests



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*  One bill that has some chance of seeing congressional action this

     year is the Conservation and Reinvestment Act-- a bill that would

     mandate a permanent source of funding for the Land and Water

     Conservation Fund which provides money to protect land, wildlife,

     recreation and coastal areas.  A compromise version of  this bill

     passed out of the House Resources Committee last year. Conservation

     organizations want this bill to move forward, but will pursue

     amendments on the floor to correct several critical flaws in the

     committee bill.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*  Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Larry Craig (R-ID) are backing a bill

     that would force the Forest Service to increase logging to generate

     more money -- or else make up for it by taking away money

     budgeted for fish and wildlife conservation.  By allocating 25 percent

     of the money to local schools, the bill holds schools hostage to

     logging interests and creates a perverse incentive to log.  Now the

     bill is headed for the Senate (S. 1608) and could be voted on in the

     next month.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pollution



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*  Congress may attempt to weaken the Clean Water Act's requirements

     for cities to clean up sewage overflows that occur during rainstorms.

     Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO) dump raw sewage,           untreated

     industrial wastes, and contaminated urban runoff into waterways,

     closing beaches and shellfish beds, and causing public health

     problems.  Both houses of Congress held hearings last year on

     legislation to allow cities virtually unlimited time to clean up their

     sewage overflows.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*  Congress may attempt to weaken the Superfund waste clean-up law by

     lowering cleanup standards that protect health and natural resources,

     undermining "polluter pays" provisions, and eliminating the federal

     safety net that protects against shoddy cleanups at abandoned urban

     brownfield sites.  House committees passed bills to weaken Superfund

     last year.

     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sprawl



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*  Congress can act to curb some of the ill effects of suburban sprawl

     by passing the Community Open Space Bonds Act, S 1558 in the Senate,

     and HR 2446 in the House. If passed, these bills would allow

     communities to carry out their own conservation priorities by using

     zero interest bonds to purchase open space, protect water quality,

     improve access to parks, and help communities redevelop abandoned

     industrial city centers.

     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Global Warming



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*  Since 1996, Congress has attached a rider to the Transportation

     Funding bill that has frozen the fuel economy standards and has even

     prevented the U. S. Department of Transportation from examining the

     need to raise the these standards. This year, Reps. Boehlert (R-N.Y.),

     Dicks (D-Wash.), Greenwood (R-Pa.), and Waxman (D-Calif.) are

     circulating a letter in support of higher fuel economy standards.

        The letter urges the President Clinton to work with Congress to

     implement the law setting automotive fuel economy standards.  Raising

     fuel economy standards is the biggest single step the United States

     can take to curb global warming



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*  Additional riders that could restrict the prevention of global

     warming could end up in most of next year's appropriations bills.

     Attacks on funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy are also

     likely.

     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Population/Family Planning



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*  Last year Congress greatly reduced funding and increased

     restrictions on U.S. aid to international family planning agencies

     through the "global gag rule."  We expect a tough battle during the

     appropriations process to remove the restrictions and restore funding

     for international aid to 1995 levels.
