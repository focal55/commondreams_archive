<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JONATHAN KING,  <a href="mailto:jaking@mit.edu">jaking@mit.edu</a>, <a href="http://www.gene-watch.org">www.gene-watch.org</a>

<br>

Professor of molecular biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,

King is on the board of the Council for Responsible Genetics. He said today:

"The determination of human gene sequences represents the outcome of 50

years of public investment in basic biomedical research. The publicly

released gene sequence data provide important inputs into understanding the

biological basis of human health and disease.... Our genes were inherited

from our parents through their parents and previous generations; their

sequences are not inventions of corporate or any other scientists. The

patenting of human genes by Celera, Human Genome Sciences and other

companies and institutions represents an egregious expropriation of our

human heritage. The requirement to pay license fees to access our own gene

sequences is a barrier that can only retard biomedical progress. Congress

needs to instruct the Patent Office to cease granting patents on human gene

sequences and to exclude living creatures, their genes or components from

the patent system."

<br>

Director of the Consumer Project on Technology, Love said today: "The

mapping of the human genome is a great opportunity for science, but also a

very big challenge for public policy makers. Commercial interests are

seeking to stake claims on very basic scientific results. There is a growing

risk that scientific research and the development of new therapies will be

confronted with endless lawsuits over intellectual property rights. The

disputes over the licensing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene patents are examples of

the types of issues that will be facing policy makers. How much power and

discretion will we give to patent owners when it comes to controlling access

to new health-care related inventions? How can we prevent the land rush for

new gene patents from blocking academic research? This is the beginning of a

very important debate."

<br>

Communications director of the Nebraska Farmers Union, Herrin said today:

"The purchase of Nabisco by Philip Morris, owner of Kraft Foods and the

largest U.S. food processor, is hardly good news. Spokesmen for Philip

Morris concede that consumers will not benefit with lower costs. The food

processing industry is already one of the most highly concentrated sectors

of our economy. Further concentration of power into the hands of the nation's

largest food company is not good for family farmers or ranchers, the folks

who produce the raw material food. Agricultural producers cannot control the

price of what they produce, because unlike most industries, hundreds of

thousands of sellers (individual farm and ranch families) must sell to only

a handful of buyers -- four or five large food processors."</font>
