- April 21 - Greenpeace today called on the United States to immediately follow the lead of the Russian Duma which just ratified the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty banning nuclear weapons tests.  Greenpeace warned that the failure of the U.S. Senate to ratify the treaty last October made the United States a rogue state.

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We hope that the action of the Russian Duma will shame the United States into ratifying this nuclear test ban.  Russia will arrive as an acknowledged leader at next week's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in New York, while the United States will be the skunk at the picnic," said Damon Moglen, Greenpeace disarmament campaigner.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Russia ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and of START II earlier this week will increase pressure on the United States, the largest nuclear weapon state, at next week's NPT meeting. The US will be under fire not only for refusing to ratify the CTBT, but also for its controversial plans to develop a ballistic missile defense system.  U.S. refusal to contemplate nuclear disarmament measures is creating dangerous new tensions in the international non-proliferation and disarmament regime.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Greenpeace warned that ratification of the CTBT alone would not end the threat of nuclear weapons.  The U.S., Russia and other nuclear weapon states are now spending millions of dollars on so-called "sub-critical" tests, which use computer simulations, lasers and other high-tech equipment to replace the nuclear tests they conduct to verify new nuclear weapons designs.

</font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There are still more than 30,000 nuclear warheads in the world and new nuclear weapons are still being developed," said Moglen.  "The vast majority of the world's non-nuclear states want more from the nuclear weapon states than ratification of a 30 year old pledge. The real challenge is to remove the threat of nuclear annihilation by agreeing to ban all nuclear weapons tests and to complete nuclear disarmament by all nations."

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

For three decades Greenpeace has campaigned against nuclear weapons tests around the world, including dramatic direct actions in China's Tiananmen Square and at Russian, French and United States test sites. <br>

<br>

Editors: One hundred and fifty-five states have signed the CTBT since it was opened for signature in September 1996. Forty-four nations must ratify the treaty for it to enter into force. Of these, 14 have yet to ratify, including the US, China, India, Pakistan, as well as Algeria, Colombia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, and the Ukraine. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Russia has proposed START III negotiations that would cut strategic nuclear arsenals down to 1500 nuclear warheads; the United States insists that this is too low a level. The US has also opposed the formation of a nuclear disarmament committee at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament, and has the largest nuclear warhead maintenance and development program of all the nuclear weapon states.
