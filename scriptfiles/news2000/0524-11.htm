- May 24 - Today&#146;s vote on China&#146;s

trade status represents one of the most dramatic and potentially damaging sellouts to big

business in recent congressional history, Public Citizen representatives said today.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook attributed the vote&#146;s outcome to an

intense advertising and lobbying blitz by corporations and the White House. Business trade

associations, such as the Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and their

member corporations, spent tens of millions of dollars on lobbying, political donations,

and TV and radio advertising in a legislative campaign they

have declared was their costliest ever. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congress has sold out to corporate interests to help them rake in even bigger

profits by giving China a blank check,&quot; Claybrook said. &quot;When American

businesses look to China, they see dollar signs. They ignore the misery brought by

China&#146;s continued human rights violations and inhumane treatment of workers.

Lawmakers have dealt Americans a sharp slap in the face.&quot;</font></p>

<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She noted that a Harris poll last month showed that 79 percent of Americans oppose

the policy approved today.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coalition that opposed the bill -- including Chinese dissidents, consumer,

environmental, human rights, family farm, religious and labor groups -- will keep up

pressure, said Lori Wallach, director of <a href="http://www.citizen.org/pctrade/tradehome.html">Public Citizen&#146;s Global Trade Watch</a>. </font></p>

<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Members of Congress who supported permanent,

unconditional access for goods from China will rue this day as China&#146;s human rights

conduct worsens, saber rattling against Taiwan intensifies and U.S. jobs are lost,&quot;

Wallach said. &quot;The China trade vote was a case study of the corrosive effect money

can have on the political process and will be a case study of the corrosive effect

political betrayal can have on Election Day.</font></p>

<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The same forces who stopped Fast Track in 1997 and 1998, tanked the MAI

negotiations in 1998, and halted the planned WTO expansion in 1999 will intensify our

never-ending campaign for fair trade by ensuring those who voted with their constituents

against China PNTR are rewarded and those who betrayed their voters at home face

accountability in November,&quot; Wallach said. </font></p>

<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Government Accounting Office found the White House violated laws that prohibit

spending federal dollars to lobby Congress on legislative matters, Claybrook and Wallach

noted. Also, unable to secure a majority on the

merits, Clinton twisted the arms of lawmakers by offering pork barrel deals, such as

environmental approval for a controversial, environmentally dangerous pipeline in Texas

and promises to build weather stations and extend military contracts in target

members&#146; congressional districts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The question of China&#146;s trade status was a skirmish in an on-going,

long-term fight about forcing pro-consumer, pro-human rights, pro-democracy rules for

globalization. Globalization is a defining phenomenon of our time and we are in this fight

for the long term,&quot; Claybrook said.</font>
