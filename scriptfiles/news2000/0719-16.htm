- July 19 - 1490 AM KWAB may not be the biggest hitter on the dial, but the 1000-watt 

station is making waves. The Boulder-based broadcaster is the only radio 

station in Colorado to broadcast live from the Republican National Convention 

July 31-August 4. KWAB kicks off 55 hours of coverage at 6 a.m. MDT July 31. 

Listeners from around the world can tune in to KWAB by clicking on 

<a href="http://www.radioforchange.com">www.radioforchange.com</a>. The year-old station, owned by Working Assets, 

already averages over half a million hits a month. 



<p>Listeners can tune in to 1490 AM KWAB for an in-depth understanding of the 

Republican platform, interviews with key players, and nightly political 

analysis. They can catch the keynote speeches by Elizabeth Dole, Condoleezza 

Rice, and Ret. General Colin Powell, as well as the Roll Call of the States 

on Thursday, August 4!  KWAB's convention charge is led by morning host Bob 

Harris, former Pacifica news chief Laura Flanders and political coordinator 

Glen Galaich. 



<p>Harris' daily reports are one part critical journalism, one part humor. After 

making his break as a standup comedian, Harris became a record five-time 

Jeopardy champion. What's the cross between a walking encyclopedia and 

graduate in applied physics? A radio host, of course!



<p>The British-born host of "The Laura Flanders Show" wears her attitude in the 

studio. Flanders spent a decade as executive producer and host of the weekly 

news watchdog "Counter Spin." She came to KWAB from Pacifica Network News, a 

daily national and international news magazine aired on 70 public radio 

stations.



<p>"Between the Lines" host Glen Galaich leads a spirited discussion of today's 

political and social issues. His incisive analysis is backed by an advanced 

degree in political science and a firm belief that Americans must take 

responsibility for the shape of our democracy. 



<p><i>KWAB is an offering of Working Assets (<a href="http://www.workingassets.com">www.workingassets.com</a>), the 

long-distance, credit card, Internet services and broadcasting company that 

has donated over $20 million in revenue to progressive nonprofits since its 

inception in 1985. Working Assets also generates funds for nonprofits through 

its ShopForChange.com and GiveForChange.com Web sites.
