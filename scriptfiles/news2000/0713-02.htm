- July 13 - New rules for diesel trucks and buses currently under consideration by the Environmental Protection Agency could prevent thousands of premature deaths each year, and save millions of dollars, according to a report released today by U.S. PIRG.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Dangers of Diesel&quot; projects the health benefits that Americans can expect if the EPA adopts strong new emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles like trucks and buses, most of which run on diesel fuel.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Anyone who has ever been stuck behind an idling bus knows that it&#146;s time to clean up the dirty diesel trucks and buses,&quot; said report author Angie Farleigh of U.S. PIRG. &quot;The American public has been choked by diesels for too long,&quot; continued Farleigh.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In May, the EPA proposed new emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles that would reduce smog-forming pollution by 95 percent and soot pollution by 90 percent from new diesel vehicles. The EPA estimates that the diesel rule, which would go into effect in 2007, will reduce emissions of smog-forming pollution by 2.8 million tons per year and will reduce particulate or &quot;soot&quot; from these vehicles by 110,000 tons per year, starting in 2030 when all vehicles on the road meet the new standards.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Dangers of Diesels&quot; documents the health risks that would be avoided each year in each state by the time the diesel rule is fully implemented in 2030. Major findings of the report are that, nationally, the EPA&#146;s diesel rule would prevent:</font></p>

<ul>

							

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 4,000 premature deaths each year;

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nearly 3,000 hospital admissions each year;

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 6,300 total respiratory emergency room visits; and

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 5.6 million &quot;minor restricted activity days&quot; nationwide each year; and

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 650,000 work loss days, nationwide, saving more than $67 million a year.

						</font>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Washington, DC region (DC, MD, VA), the report projects the rule will prevent:</font></p>

<ul>

							

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">102,732 tons of smog-forming NOx pollution and 2,029 tons of particulate pollution each year;

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">197 premature deaths each year;

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">295 total respiratory emergency room visits and 143 hospital admissions each year;

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">259,986 &quot;minor restricted activity days&quot; yearly; and

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 31,290 work loss days saving over 3.2 million dollars.

						</font>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While heavy-duty trucks and buses make up only 2 percent of all vehicles on the road, they are responsible for more than one-third of all smog-forming nitrogen oxides and nearly two-thirds of all particulate pollution emitted by all on-road vehicles, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Diesel pollution is especially dangerous because it contains more than 40 toxic substances, and more than 30 health studies have linked diesel exhaust to cancer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The EPA&#146;s diesel rule is a necessary step to cleaning up these filthy polluters. We must take immediate action to protect public health,&quot; said Farleigh.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To counter pressure from the oil and trucking industries to weaken the diesel rule, the state PIRGs are conducting a nationwide campaign demonstrating overwhelming public support for cleaner trucks and buses. During the EPA&#146;s public comment period, which ends August 14, the state PIRGs plan to collect thousands of comments in favor of a strong rule for diesel pollution. U.S. PIRG called on the EPA to protect public health and strengthen the proposed standards, urging them to:</font></p>

<ul>

							

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Make low-sulfur diesel fuel available nationwide. </b>In order to achieve the necessary emission reductions, the engines must run on cleaner fuels. U.S. PIRG urged the EPA to resist pressure from the oil industry to weaken the rules, and adopt diesel sulfur levels (for on-road and off-road vehicles) with a cap of no more than 15ppm sulfur by 2006, as it proposed in May.

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Clean up big trucks and buses as soon as possible</b>. The EPA&#146;s current proposal gives engine manufacturers until 2010 to fully clean up these vehicles. U.S. PIRG called on the EPA to strengthen its rule to require reductions in smog-forming pollution by 95% and particulate pollution by 97% from big trucks and buses by no later than 2007.

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ensure that big trucks are meeting the emission standards on the roads, not just during the engine tests. </b>U.S. PIRG called on the EPA to strengthen its rule by requiring in-use emission tests and on-board diagnostic for <b>all</b> heavy-duty trucks before 2007.

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Increase the use of diesel alternatives such as electric buses and other advanced technology vehicles. </b>U.S. PIRG called on EPA to include a provision in the heavy-duty rule that would increase the use of these cleaner, efficient vehicles throughout the heavy-duty fleet. U.S. PIRG supports the EPA&#146;s proposed &quot;Blue Sky&quot; program as a first step toward commercializing advanced heavy-duty technology.
