A Guide to Giving Your Money For Social Change<br>

By Chuck Collins, Pam Rogers and Joan P. Garner



</font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

We’re hearing a lot about the “new philanthropy” of young high-tech 

entrepreneurs    eager to use their newfound wealth for social good. The 

longest economic boom in American history--now nine years old--has fueled 

tremendous growth in the assets of private foundations and controversy over 

philanthropic priorities. Americans have just begun an unprecedented transfer 

of personal wealth, as older generations pass on to heirs an estimated $41 

trillion to $136 trillion in wealth over the next half century.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At this historic juncture, a group of people who re-defined philanthropy two 

decades ago with the motto “Change, not Charity,” have written a 

provocative, story-packed guide showing how the “new philanthropists,” 

established foundations, and all kinds of donors can tackle the root causes 

of the problems we face, and not just treat the symptoms. ROBIN HOOD WAS 

RIGHT: A Guide to Giving Your Money for Social Change (W.W. Norton, March 

2000, $27.95) makes a powerful case for channeling funds to fight the 

diseases of poverty, social injustice, environmental hazards and war with 

dramatic examples of successful efforts across the country.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As co-author Pam Rogers observed recently on CNN, “The payoff for social 

change giving is a better, more educated, safer community. Now who wouldn’t 

want that?”

ROBIN HOOD WAS RIGHT co-authors Chuck Collins, Pam Rogers and Joan P. Garner 

have worked with foundations, organizations and individuals on the cutting 

edge of social change for many years. Collins was featured in the December 

1999 issue of Fast Company magazine as one of  “17 leaders, doers, and change 

makers--17 givers--who offer instruction and inspiration on giving back.”



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The book is rooted in the experiences of the Funding Exchange and its network 

of fifteen community-based foundations across the United States. These 

visionary foundations  provided the early money that helped important social 

change movements to grow and are nurturing new movements today--such as 

working to stop domestic violence before most people ever heard of a battered 

women’s shelter or working to end U.S. support for apartheid years before it 

was a popular cause, or providing crucial early support to anti-sweatshop and 

living wage campaigns that have evolved into the most important 

student-community-labor movement to emerge in decades.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year Americans gave more than $190 billion to charity. Only a small 

percentage of that generosity now goes to organizations working to make 

fundamental change. The authors of ROBIN HOOD propose a shift in that 

equation.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN HOOD WAS RIGHT is a unique how-to guide for giving, whether you are 

living paycheck to paycheck or a multimillionaire. The book is a 

nuts-and-bolts primer for taking control of your money, investing, 

understanding tax-wise giving, identifying effective organizations and making 

donations that are right for your wallet and your values.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Robin Hood was right. Tipping the balance of resources to include more of 

humanity is an adventurous, thrilling, and worthwhile pursuit. Charity is 

good, but supporting and creating social change are about power…This book 

trumpets a vital message. No matter who we are, no matter how much money we 

have…we can bring change to the world around us.”

--Alfre Woodard, from the Preface
