- June 14 - Thirty Greenpeace activists today blocked industrial effluent pipes 

  that are routinely discharging tonnes of carcinogenic waste into the Kishon 

  River, Israel. The activists, from Israel, the UK, Germany and Austria, called 

  on the Israeli authorities to take immediate action to stop industries dumping 

  chemicals and other hazardous pollutants into the river. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pollution has been linked to cancers amongst marine commandos whose training 

  required them to dive in the river. The Israeli authorities, concerned about 

  the threat to human health, banned recreational activities and fishing on the 

  river two weeks ago, but failed to stop the toxic discharges. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liad Ortar, Greenpeace Mediterranean campaigner in Israel said: &#147;We are 

  here to do the job that the authorities have refused to take on and stop the 

  pollution. The lack of political will to seriously address this problem is appalling. 

  The unfolding tragedy of the Kishon is a symptom of the plague of toxic pollution 

  entering our global environment.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace research, published on 26th May, reveals that pollution from the 

  effluent pipes of the six main industries in the Kishon reveal high levels of 

  toxic heavy metals and other hazardous substances. The toxic discharges are 

  routinely pumped into the river in direct contravention to the Barcelona Convention, 

  by US owned chemical fertiliser manufacturer Haifa Chemicals, as well as Israeli 

  owned chemical companies such as Gadiv and Carmel Ulipinim and Gadot, together 

  with refineries and municipal sewerage treatment plant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Research published last month by Professor Eli Richter from the University 

  of Jerusalem, concludes that the Kishon pollution is the direct cause of the 

  cancers discovered amongst at least twenty commandos who were required to dive 

  in the polluted waters as part of their routine training.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The marine commandos supported the Greenpeace action today. Yuval Tamir, who 

  served in the navy seals for twenty years and retired as Lieutenant General, 

  said: &#147;The pollution has caused more than enough damage already. Greenpeace 

  is setting the example by taking action to stop the toxic pollution. I am concerned 

  about other, maybe younger people, who might be affected by the Kishon.&#148; 

  Yuval was required to dive into the Kishon Harbour regularly throughout his 

  service. He has been diagnosed as suffering from both skin and cancer of the 

  colon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace alerted the authorities of the threat the Kishon River to human 

  health and the environment in 1995, but no action was taken. Today, the environmental 

  organisation expressed concern that the full extent of the damage to public 

  health and the environment caused by the Kishon River pollution may be greater 

  than is currently recognised. Only the case involving the marine commandos has 

  so far been investigated, but a vast number of people have spent time in and 

  around the Kishon, such as fishermen, divers, sailing clubs and other youth 

  clubs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Greenpeace is accusing the industries responsible of seeking profit at the 

  cost of public health and the environment. It also condemns the approach being 

  taken by the Ministry of Environment to construct a 4.5 km by-pass pipe to direct 

  treated toxic effluents to the sea instead. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This as nothing more than an attempt to evade any real action by deceiving 

  the public with apparent good intentions. The only real solution is a commitment 

  by all the relevant authorities to stop the industries responsible from discharging 

  this toxic pollution,&#148; added Ortat.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ten of the activists have been arrested.</font>
