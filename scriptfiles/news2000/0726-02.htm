- July 26 - An agreement reached yesterday by Smithfield Foods and

     North Carolina Attorney General Mike Easley could lead to a chance in

     how the hog industry across the country manages its waste.

     Yesterday's announcement was applauded by a range of North Carolina

     groups including Environmental Defense, the Southern Environmental Law

     Center (SELC), and the North Carolina Chapter of the Sierra Club.

     North Carolina has led the nation in the explosive growth of

     factory-styled hog operations.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Smithfield, the world's largest pork producer, agreed to fund a

     two-year, $15 million North Carolina State University study to test

     alternative waste treatment technologies on a commercial scale and $50

     million over 25 years for an environmental fund.  Under the agreement,

     this will lead to a phase-out of open air lagoons. Once a

     determination is made of which alternatives meet environmental,

     economic and other standards, Smithfield is required to convert to

     these alternatives on its North Carolina farms within three years from

     that date.

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"What happened in North Carolina today may have major national

     implications down the road," said Ed Hopkins, Sierra Club Senior

     Washington Representative.  "We look forward to an industry-wide

     switch to  improved technology which will result in cleaner air and

     water in North Carolina and around the country."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Second only to Iowa, the state has an estimated 10 million hogs

     located in a handful of counties in the eastern part of the state.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Mike Easley has gone where the General Assembly has feared to tread,"

     said Molly Diggins, state director of the North Carolina Chapter of

     the Sierra Club.  "Easley has taken the most concrete step to date to

     break the impasse over the future of animal waste lagoons.  We hope

     the legislature will follow Easley's lead and require environmentally

     sound waste systems for all large livestock operations."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The vulnerability of the lagoon and sprayfield system was highlighted

     last year when Hurricane Floyd deluged the eastern part of the state

     with its worst ever natural disaster.  State regulators estimate that

     over 180 hog farms are located in the 100 year floodplain.  Media

     accounts of the disaster highlighted hogs trapped on the roofs of hog

     houses and hog carcasses floating downstream.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The agreement applies to hog farms owned by Murphy Farms, Carroll's

     Foods, Brown's of Carolina, and Quarter M Farms, all subsidiaries of

     the Virginia-based Smithfield.  Although the hundreds of hog farmers

     who produce hogs for these companies under contract are not covered by

     the agreement, Smithfield has agreed to provide its contract growers

     with financial and technical assistance to enable them to convert to

     alternative systems.</font>
