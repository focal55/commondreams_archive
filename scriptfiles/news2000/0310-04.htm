<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK 

- March 10 - Labor rights advocates held a march last Saturday to 

celebrate the week of International Women's Day with a march to build 

support for women workers' struggles to organize against sweatshop 

conditions. The activists rallied at stores that sell products made 

in sweatshops with a major focus on Gap, Inc. stores, The Gap,  Old 

Navy, and  Banana Republic, as well as   Guess?, McDonald's (some 

Happy Meal toys are  made in Thailand),   and the NYU bookstore, 

seller of NYU clothing.  The march ended with a rally at Greene and 

Washington Place, the site of the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Fire in 

which nearly 200 women garment workers lost their lives.  Ironically, 

the site is  directly across the street from the NYU bookstore, which 

sells clothes made in sweatshops.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In  discussions with anti-sweatshop groups, Gap has refused to accept 

responsibility for ensuring that workers are paid the necessary 

living wage. In Saipan, a US territory replete with sweatshops, Gap 

does the most business of any  company on the island--over $200 

million a year, contracting in six factories. Whereas these companies 

import without tariff or quota restrictions and label their clothes 

'Made in the USA,' they do not adhere to US labor laws.  In Russia, 

Gap pays factory workers 11 cents/hour and keeps them in slave-like 

conditions.   Honduran Gap factory workers are subjected to forced 

pregnancy tests, forced overtime, exceedingly high production goals, 

locked bathrooms, and wages of $4/day, which only meet 1/3 of their 

basic needs. If workers tried to organize a union or even become more 

informed of their rights, they would be fired. They had never heard 

of Gap's code of conduct, which the company claims ensures worker 

protection.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the final stop on the march route, participants saluted NYU's 

announcement on Thursday that it would join the Worker's Rights 

Consortium,  a non-profit organization that  supports and verifies 

licensee compliance with production codes of conduct. These codes of 

conduct have been developed by colleges and universities  across the 

country to ensure that goods are produced under conditions that 

respect the basic rights of workers.  Activists view this as the 

first step to improving conditions for workers making clothes sold in 

NYU's bookstore and sports center.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1911, a fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company killed 146 garment 

workers in New York City. It became a catalyst that helped to end the 

commonplace abuse of workers in the United States. Days after the 

fire, over 80,000 people took part in the funeral procession up Fifth 

Avenue. Eventually, the groundswell of support led to new workers' 

rights and safer workplaces. In 1993 a fire at the Kadar Industrial 

Toy Company in Thailand killed 188 workers, who like the victims in 

1911, faced locked doors and no fire protection equipment. At 

opposite ends of the century, these two fires share a root cause - 

sweatshops. A sweatshop is defined as any workplace where workers are 

subject to extreme exploitation. This includes hazardous working 

conditions, arbitrary discipline and a lack of a living wage, 

benefits, dignity or basic human rights. In the years since the Kadar 

fire, other stories of exploitation, child labor and tragedy have 

created a new groundswell to stop the abuse.   The anti-sweatshop 

movement has grown massively in recent months, as new anti-sweatshop 

groups are forming on campuses and in communities around the country, 

and more and more companies and universities  are agreeing to 

institute code of conduct for workers producing their clothes.
