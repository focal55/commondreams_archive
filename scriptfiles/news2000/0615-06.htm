- June 15 - The Humane Society of the



United States (HSUS), the nation's largest animal protection



organization, today applauded a federal appeals court ruling that



has, at least for the time being, stopped a controversial whale



hunt by Washington State's Makah Indian Tribe.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco



ruled 2-1 on Friday, June 9, that an environmental assessment done



by the United States government was biased in favor of the hunt and



set aside a lower court ruling that would have permitted the Makah



to continue killing Pacific gray whales.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 9th Circuit Court's decision demonstrates that the entire



process, from the creation of the federal government's



environmental assessment to the claim that the International



Whaling Commission (IWC) authorized this hunt, has been contrary to



the law. The court has vindicated everything we have said about



this case for more than two years," said Patricia Forkan, executive



vice president for The Humane Society of the United States.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its ruling, the Court of Appeals said that the government's



environmental assessment was "demonstrably suspect" and the



government was "predisposed to finding that the Makah whaling



proposal would not significantly affect the environment." The case



now goes back to the same lower court -- U.S. District Court in



Tacoma, Washington, and the same judge -- U.S. District Judge



Franklin Burgess -- who ruled originally in favor of the Makah and



the federal government, for additional proceedings and a new



environmental assessment (EA).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This raises new questions, says Forkan. She notes that the



Appeals panel also asks in its ruling that, "Having already



committed in writing to support the Makah's whaling proposal, can



the Federal Defendants now be trusted to take the clear-eyed hard



look at the whaling proposals consequences required by law, or will



a new EA be a classic Wonderland case of first-the-verdict,



then-the-trial?"

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While the Court of Appeals did not require the completion of a



more thorough environmental review known as an environmental impact



statement (EIS), it is clear that only an EIS will be sufficient to



examine all the issues in a fair and comprehensive way. We urge the



federal government, despite their prior actions, to act honorably



and prepare just such a statement," said Forkan.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Makah, a coastal Indian tribe who live near Neah Bay in



northwest Washington State, claim whaling rights under an 1855



treaty with the U.S. government. The tribe had not hunted whales in



more than 70 years until last May when, with the permission of the



federal government, the Makah harpooned and killed a juvenile gray



whale in the waters outside Neah Bay. A similar hunt organized this



spring has not been successful.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Commercial whalers hunted the gray whale to near extinction by



the 1920s. In recent years, gray whale stocks have rebounded,



leading federal officials to remove them from the Endangered



Species List in 1994. The gray whale remains threatened with



populations worldwide estimated at only 23,000.
