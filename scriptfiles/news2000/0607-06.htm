- June 7 - Conservationists predict



that voters will make the environment a top-tier voting issue in



the 2000 elections. To make that claim a reality, the League of



Conservation Voters Education Fund (LCVEF) will launch a $613,000



"Vote Environment" advertising program in the Sacramento media



market.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sacramento advertising effort is part of a $7.4 million



national advertising, polling, and grassroots public education



effort designed to encourage candidates running for all levels of



public office to address environmental issues and to urge voters to



find out where the candidates stand on such issues.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ads, airing on Sacramento television stations from June 7



through July 12, highlight children's needs and clean water and



inform viewers that "Who We Elect Matters," urging them to "Vote



Environment." LCVEF also launched ads in Washington, D.C., Austin,



Texas, Seattle, Wash., Nashville, Tenn., Atlanta, Ga., Columbus,



Ohio, Lansing, Mich., Minneapolis, Minn., and will soon air ads in



Billings, Mont.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Throughout the country, voters are paying more attention to



issues that directly affect the quality of their lives, from the



safety of the water they drink and the quality of the air they



breathe, to suburban sprawl that is eating away at green space and



increasing traffic congestion," said Deb Callahan, LCVEF president.



"This is the year when the environment will emerge as a critical



election issue-an issue that candidates seeking all levels of



elective office will be well-served to address."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a key component of the public education effort, LCVEF also



launched a <a href="http://www.VoteEnvironment.org%20">www.VoteEnvironment.org</a> Web site that houses the



television ads and encourages visitors to take an on-line pledge to



ask the candidates where they stand on environmental issues and to



"Vote Environment."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Web site also contains the group's extensive environmental



polling data. Over the course of the year, LCVEF is evaluating the



saliency of environmental issues and how they influence voter



participation. Working with state environmental groups and a



variety of pollsters, the group this year will conduct 23 state and



three national polls on environmental and conservation issues and



their relationship to civic participation. The polling analysis



will be available over the Internet.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Al Quinlan, president of Greenberg Quinlan Research Inc.,



conducted the first national poll. About the findings Quinlan



said, "Political candidates, regardless of political party, can



benefit by including environmental issues in their campaigns. Not



only do environmental issues, especially clean air and water,



appeal directly to the quality of life and health concerns of



voters, but candidates who embrace these issues are viewed in a



significantly more positive light by voters."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Callahan added, "This useful research, coupled with the 'Vote



Environment' program will encourage voters to find out where



candidates from the state house to the White House stand on



environmental issues and urge those candidates to actually address



the issues."
