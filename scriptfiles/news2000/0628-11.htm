- June 28 - In response to the Supreme Court's ruling today allowing a Louisiana school district to use public funds to purchase computers and other 'instructional equipment' for private and religious schools, People For the American Way Foundation made the following statement:

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Court's ruling only further blurs the church/state line, adding to the confusion already experienced by school districts and taxpayers," said Ralph G. Neas, president of People For the American Way Foundation. "This ruling increases the risk that citizens will be forced to subsidize a school's religious mission, violating the First Amendment's prohibition against government establishment of religion."

    </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

      Responding to claims that the ruling may have implications for vouchers, Neas said, "The key vote on vouchers remains Justice O'Connor. She is still holding all her cards, she did not tip her hand."

    </font></p>

      People For the American Way Foundation recently released a report, "Courting Disaster," that documents the devastating impact that a further rightward shift on the U.S. Supreme Court would have on Americans' fundamental rights and freedoms. The report outlines how adding just one or two Justices who share Scalia's and Thomas' far-right legal philosophy could tip the balance on the Court for decades to come. Cases decided this term have reinforced this conclusion, and PFAWF will be releasing an analysis of this term's decision the end of this week.
