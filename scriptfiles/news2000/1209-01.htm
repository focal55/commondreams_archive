- December 9 - Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. today issued the following statement

regarding the Supreme Court's ruling that put a stop to counting

ballots throughout Florida and calling for oral arguments on Monday

at 11am.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congressman Jackson said, &quot;The basis of politics and legal authority

in the United States is the Constitution.  The first words in the

Preamble are &quot;We the people.&quot;  We the PEOPLE are the ultimate source

of power and authority for our government.  The people express their

will through their vote.  Democracy, as expressed through the

peoples' vote, cannot be compromised over some narrowly conceived,&quot;strict constructionist&quot; interpretation that is technical in nature,

nitpicking, and based on questionable legal technicalities.  The 

will and intention of the voter, as best it can be discerned by

machines, bipartisan hand counters and accompanying public witnesses

must be the legal standard.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In a democracy every vote counts and every vote must be counted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;All Americans can live with votes counted for Gov. George W. Bush.

But our democracy cannot live if the votes of the American people

are not counted.  An uncounted vote says to the American people

that THEY don't count.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If the Supreme Court's actions -- whatever that may ultimately

turn out to be -- in the end, prohibit all votes cast from being

fully, fairly and inclusively counted (to the degree humanly

possible), then the Supreme Court will have discredited itself,

lost much of its moral and legal authority, the Justices

themselves will have contributed mightily to undermining the very

institution they represent, and undermined the rule of law that

they are sworn to uphold on behalf of the American people,&quot; Jackson

concluded.</font></p>
