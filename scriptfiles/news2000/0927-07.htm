- September 27 - On October 17, 2000 in St. Louis, Missouri, only two of the major contenders

for the office of President of the United States will meet for a debate

organized by the corporately funded Commission on Presidential Debates.&nbsp;

The o17 Coalition (See enclosed list of over 40 student, community and

national organizations.) will hold its "Where’s the Debate?" Rally outside

this debate.

<p>Members of the coalition believe the Democratic and Republican candidates

have either ignored or share the same positions on fundamental issues concerning

race, economics, military and foreign policy and the environment. (See

enclosed Issues Statement). O17 organizers point to the corporate funding

of the Democratic and Republican parties as a primary source of their refusal

to address these issues.

<p>The "Where’s the Debate?" Rally is designed to provide citizens with

a forum to exercise democracy, call for an open debate and place fundamental

issues before the public and candidates.

<p>The "Where’s the Debate?" Rally will be held on October 17 from 4-8

PM on a field overlooking the Washington University Field House, the debate

site, (SW corner of Big Bend and Forsyth).&nbsp; Participants will march

to the rally sight at 3:30 PM from Grace United Methodist Church (Skinker

and Waterman).&nbsp; March route will be announced in subsequent releases.

<p>As the rally outside concludes and the ‘debate" inside begins, rally

participants will then dawn gags, some reading "justice silenced," and

placards naming the issues and people excluded from the debate.&nbsp; They

will march away from the debate in silence and candle-light.&nbsp; The

proposed route is south on Big Bend, then east on Wydown, ending in Forest

Park.

<p>During the week prior to the "Where’s the Debate?" Rally, the o17 Coalition

and it member organizations will sponsor nonviolent direct actions and

forums addressing fundamental issues excluded from the debate. A schedule

of the actions and forums will follow in a subsequent releases.

<p>Key organizers of the 017 Coalition’s "Where’s the Debate?" Rally are

available for interviews and appearances. Call contact persons listed above

to arrange interviews and appearances.&nbsp; On October 4 and 10, the O17

Coalition will release "issue based" evaluations of the presidential debates

in Boston and Winston-Salem, along with updates on the St. Louis rally,

featured speakers, and related events.

<p><b>O17 Coalition Issues Statement</b>

<p>On October 17, 2000 in St. Louis, Missouri, only two of the major contenders

for the presidency will meet for a debate organized by the corporately

funded Commission&nbsp; on Presidential Debates. They will stand behind

podiums sponsored by a large local corporation.&nbsp; And they will say

only what their campaign contributors have paid them to say.&nbsp; Because

the Democratic and Republican candidates and their debate commission share

the same corporate sponsors, they lack the will to differ on fundamental

issues concerning race, economics, military and the environment.&nbsp;

It’s up to citizens to exercise democracy and place those issues before

the public and candidates.&nbsp; Here are some crucial examples:

<p>Where is the debate on racism and justice…

<br>

&middot; The war on drugs has resulted in the incarceration of millions

of people of color. Over three-quarters of those imprisoned for drug offenses

are African Americans, even though there is no difference in drug use across

races. Meanwhile, the corporate prison-industrial complex profits from

the building and operating new prisons. Who will end this war against poor,

young Americans of color, and order the release of 400,000 nonviolent drug

offenders from U.S. prison?&nbsp; Who will stop building prisons and invest

in a massive expansion of drug rehabilitation programs?

<p>&middot; Two-thirds of death row inmates who are eventually found innocent

are African Americans. People of color are the primary victims of police

abuse. Meanwhile corporately-funded candidates manipulate fears of crime

and racial stereotypes for political gain. Who will call for the complete

overhaul of this racist criminal justice system that has been condemned

by human rights group and democracies around the world?&nbsp; Who will

call for the abolition of the death penalty?

<p>&middot; Millions of African-Americans continue to suffer economic disadvantages

as the result of over 300 years of legalized slavery and segregation in

the U.S. Today the average assets of white U.S. families are $60,000 while

the assets of the average African American family are $8,000. Meanwhile

corporations continue to benefit from the wealth produced by that legacy

of slavery and continued discrimination .&nbsp; Who will support John Conyers’

House Resolution which seeks official acknowledgment of these long-standing

inequities and establishes a commission to explore remedies?

<p>Where is the debate on economic injustices…

<br>

&middot; Forty-five million are without health care insurance, while

corporations privatize and consolidate their control over health care delivery.&nbsp;

Who will call for a universal single-payer health-care system, guaranteeing

equal access to all?

<p>&middot; Tens of millions work in factories and fields for wages that

don’t pay the bills, while global corporations authorized by free trade

agreements and World Trade Organization rules roam the world in search

of the lowest possible wages, working conditions and environmental standards.

Who will call for a living wage at home and challenge sweatshops abroad?

Who will allow the workers and indigenous people to control the impact

of globalization on their lives? Who will link trade to human rights compliance?

<p>&middot; Dozens of poor countries spend more money servicing their debts

to banks than they spend on education and health, while global corporations

benefit from conditions placed on these debtor nations by the IMF or World

Bank. Who will call for debt relief for the world’s poorest countries?

Who will insist that any conditions attached to new loans be designed to

break the cycle of poverty, not perpetuate it?

<p>Where is the debate on just foreign and military policies…

<br>

&middot; Over 500,000 children have died of malnutrition and curable

diseases as a result of a decade of economic sanctions on Iraq, while U.S.

corporations continue to enjoy favorable access to Middle Eastern oil.&nbsp;

Who will lift economic sanctions on Iraq?

<p>&middot; In the past five years, over 3,000 civilians, many from indigenous

communities, have been killed by paramilitary forces linked to the Colombian

military, while U.S. corporations drill for oil on indigenous land throughout

Colombia. Who will halt all U.S. aid to the Colombian military and its

paramilitary collaborators?

<p>&middot; A proposed U.S. missile defense system increases the likelihood

of a new nuclear arms race.&nbsp; The U.S. continues to be the world’s

largest arms merchant, while corporate military contractors vie for lucrative

deals to develop and build new weapons. Who will halt research and production

of missile defense programs and suspend foreign military sales?

<p>Where is the debate on environmental threats…

<br>

&middot; Our food, air and water is endangered by genetic engineering,

environmentally reckless trade polices, and the building of new highways,

while corporations profit from patents on seeds, the absence of environmental

standards in global trade, and the heavy reliance on automobiles.&nbsp;

Who will stand against genetic engineering of food, crops, and seeds, insist

on global clean air and water standards, and devote more resources to mass

transit?
