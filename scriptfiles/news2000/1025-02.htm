- October 25 - With 13 days before the election, national religious leaders gathered in Washington to issue a warning to political campaigns and special-interest groups: Do not use houses of worship to distribute partisan political materials, including the Christian Coalition's deceptive voter guides.  



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our spiritual homes and nation's religious leaders should not be treated as pawns or political bosses in a partisan battle for elected office," said the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of The Interfaith Alliance. "Religious leaders have the right to educate congregants but should not be deceived or coerced into distributing partisan materials which direct congregants to vote for particular candidates under the guise of "education" - to do so is immoral and undermines the integrity of the proper role of religion in politics."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Calling on the presidential candidates Governor George W. Bush and Vice-President Al Gore to ask houses of worship to denounce the distribution of partisan voter guides, the Rev. Gaddy reminded the candidates that, "gaining a vote is not worth compromising the integrity of the faith community."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Focusing on the important role of people of faith in the elections, religious leaders of The Interfaith Alliance unveiled details of their national non-partisan voter-education campaign, Call To a Faithful Decision 2000, aimed at educating people of faith and religious leaders about their proper role in the election and warning religious leaders of partisan attempts to use houses of worship. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clergy leaders around the nation have been actively working to encourage people of faith to participate and to safeguard houses of worship from partisan manipulation.  Local clergy in 16 states, including California, Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Minnesota, sent "Dear Clergy" letters to 50,000 congregations alerting that "organizations claiming religious ties but manifesting strong partisan biases, or representatives of candidates for public office, may ask you to distribute voter guides in your church." The local clergy requested fellow religious leaders to decline this request for ethical and legal reasons.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our goal is not to simply warn but to educate, encourage and empower people of faith to be involved in the upcoming elections in a responsible and informed manner," said the Rt. Rev. Jane Holmes Dixon, president of The Interfaith Alliance and Suffragan Bishop in the Diocese of Washington.  "We are calling on faith leaders to urge congregants to fulfill their civic duty and moral obligation by casting an informed ballot on November 7th."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Interfaith Alliance Foundation has set the weekend of October 27th - 29th as Call To a Faithful Decision Weekend, enlisting religious leaders to send a powerful message from the pulpit that voting is a civic duty and moral obligation.  Thousands of religious leaders from every state have agreed to participate in this weekend's Call To a Faithful Decision Weekend activities.  To assist religious leaders in preparing sermons, The Interfaith Alliance Foundation has made available an interfaith worship guide which is also available online at <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/tiaf/aeygfhow.html">http://www.interfaithalliance.org</a>.  



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As religious leaders we have an obligation to encourage thoughtful understanding of the issues at stake in this election without favoring a political party or endorsing a candidate.  The integrity of our houses of worship should not be put at risk by distributing partisan voter guides offered by the Christian Coalition," said Dr. A. Knighton Stanley, Senior Minister of Peoples Congregational United Church of Christ in Washington D.C. and Board Member of The Interfaith Alliance. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speaking at today's press conference Dr. Stanley explained in detail the ethical and legal concerns with the Christian Coalition's voter guides that were unveiled at a press conference in St. Louis over the weekend. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Waiting until the Sunday before the election to distribute the guides leaves candidates with only 2 days to respond before voters head to the polls -- this is not by accident," said Dr. Stanley. "While the Coalition calls these guides voter education tools, by waiting until the very last minute as they do, voters do not have a chance to study the guides and make their own judgments. They are in fact voter indoctrination tools." 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having examined the Coalition's website where voter guide issues appear, Dr. Stanley came to the conclusion that "as a person of faith, these questions and their evaluation of them do not meet my credibility test for faith-based voter education tools." 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Addressing the Christian Coalition's policy positions, Dr. Stanley noted that more than "once this year, the Christian Coalition has found themselves on opposite sides of the faith community when it comes down to the official denominational positions of the religious community." He asked, "…by what faith-based criteria are they evaluating the candidates?" 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's events were part of The Interfaith Alliance's commitment to encourage religious leaders to participate in civic life in a meaningful and constructive manner that fosters civility and understanding. Alliance activities include voter registration drives, candidate forums, issue forums, clergy outreach and voter guide warning letters to clergy.
