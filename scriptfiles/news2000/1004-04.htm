- October 4 - A federal appeals court



has granted expedited review of a case brought by Green Party



presidential candidate Ralph Nader and voters challenging the



corporate financing of the presidential debates. The lawsuit,



filed in federal district court in Boston in June, seeks to



strike down Federal Election Commission regulations which have



allowed a small handful of U.S. corporations to contribute millions



of dollars to help stage the debates. If successful, the case



could have a dramatic impact on the structure of the remaining



presidential debates this month.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Sept. 1, U.S. District Court Judge Patty Saris ruled



that the FEC regulations were permissible despite a century-old



federal law prohibiting corporate contributions to political



candidates. Nader and his voter-supporters are appealing that



ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. A



three-judge panel will hear the appeal on Thursday, Oct. 5, at



9:30 a.m., at the U.S. Courthouse in Boston.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thursday's hearing comes just two days after the first



presidential debate between the Republican candidate George W. Bush



and the Democratic candidate Al Gore. Two other debates between



Bush and Gore are scheduled for Oct. 11 and Oct. 17.



A debate between the Republican and Democratic vice-presidential



candidates is schedule for Thursday night.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Corporate money has no place in presidential debates," said



Scott Lewis, a partner at the Boston law firm of Palmer &amp; Dodge,



which is co-lead counsel with the National Voting Rights Institute



on behalf of the plaintiffs. "Under current corporate financing,



the debates this fall look like the Bud Bowl. Federal law requires



an overhaul of this process."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Commission on Presidential Debates, a non-profit corporation



which organizes the presidential debates, announced in January that



Anheuser-Busch will serve as one of the national financial sponsors



this year, as well as the sole national sponsor of its



Oct. 17 debate in St. Louis, Mo. The company is paying $550,000



to underwrite the St. Louis debate. Other corporate sponsors in



prior presidential election years have included IBM, J.P. Morgan &amp;



Co., and the Philip Morris Companies. The lawsuit alleges that the



CPD is continuing to raise and solicit additional corporate



contributions for its debates.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1907, federal law has barred corporations from making



contributions or expenditures in connection with political



campaigns for federal office. The law allows only three exceptions



to this prohibition, covering internal corporate communications,



internal voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns, and the



administration of a corporate political action committee. The law



does not create an exception for the financing of debates.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By definition, debates are partisan events which showcase the



positions of those candidates selected to participate," said Greg



Luke, an attorney with the National Voting Rights Institute. "FEC



regulations which allow corporate money to finance such events



directly violate federal law."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lawsuit asks for a court order invalidating the FEC



regulations. Such an order could result in a potential FEC



enforcement action against the Commission on Presidential Debates



for financing its debates with illegal corporate money and could



re-open the question how the presidential debates should be



organized.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to Nader and his campaign, the plaintiffs include



actress Susan Sarandon, former television talk-show host Phil



Donahue, and other voter-supporters of the Nader candidacy. The



Association of State Green Parties and Green Party USA also serve



as plaintiffs. The lead plaintiff in the case is Heidi Becker, an



undecided voter and a student at the University of



Massachusetts-Boston, the site of the first presidential debate.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note to Press: The federal appeals court hearing in Becker vs.



FEC will take place on Thursday, Oct. 5, at 9:30 a.m. before a



three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First



Circuit, 7th Floor, 1 Courthouse Way, Boston. Attorneys for the



plaintiffs will be available for interviews immediately before and



after the hearing.</font>
