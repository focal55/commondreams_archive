- April 12 - Today 

          15,000 working women and men from dozens of unions rallied on Capitol 

          Hill to tell their members of Congress "No Blank Check for China" at 

          a rally organized by the national AFL-CIO. Throughout the day, union 

          members, national and state officers from the AFL-CIO, and presidents 

          of national unions lobbied members to urge them not to scrap the current 

          system of annual reviews of China's human rights and trade record.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Speakers at the rally included Wei Jingsheng; Representatives David 

          Bonior, Nancy Pelosi, and Christopher Smith; AFL-CIO President John 

          Sweeney, Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka and Executive Vice President 

          Linda Chavez-Thompson; American Federation of Teachers President Sandra 

          Feldman; Steelworkers President George Becker; Teamsters President James 

          Hoffa; AFSCME President Gerald McEntee; and UAW President Steve Yokich. 

          Also featured at the rally were Roona Gopa, a student at the University 

          of Pennsylvania and a leader of Students Against Sweatshops; Brent Blackwelder, 

          President, Friends of the Earth; and Reverend Seamus Finn, Director 

          of Justice and Peace, Mary Immaculate.</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Until there are no more broken treaties, until there are no more 

          dissidents in prison, until there is no more environmental destruction, 

          and no more torture, and no more executions, there will be no blank 

          check for China," said AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney. </font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"China has repeatedly violated all of its trade agreements with the 

          U.S. over the past ten years, and Chinese leaders already say they have 

          no intention of honoring the deal they cut with President Clinton last 

          year. Our workers are forced to compete with prison labor and sweatshop 

          workers making as little as 13 cents an hour. And while we are losing 

          hundreds of thousands of jobs, China is setting new records for violations 

          of human rights and polluting the environment," he continued.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While 61 percent of voters &#151; including union members 

          &#151; say they support foreign trade, 65 percent say that permanent 

          trade access for China should be contingent on China engaging in fair 

          trade and meeting real standards for human and workers' rights," said 

          AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson, citing a national 

          survey of registered voters conducted by Peter Hart Research and Associates. 

          "And the voters who were surveyed sent a clear message to the elected 

          representatives we are visiting this afternoon &#151; by a four-to-one 

          margin, they say they would be less likely to vote for a member of Congress 

          who supported free trade with China."<br wp="BR2">

        </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The survey also found that 63 percent of Democrats, 57 percent of 

          Independents, and 75 percent of Republicans oppose permanent normal 

          trade relations with China.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Rally and Lobby Day highlights:</font></p>

<ul>

          

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 4,400 UAW members, 4,000 Teamsters, 2,000 Steelworkers 

            and 1,100 AFSCME workers joined in the rally.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 100 Chinese-American textile workers from UNITE local 2325 

            were among the 1,500 members from UNITE.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Events in support of the rally and lobby day on Capitol Hill took 

            place in cities across the country. In <strong>Knoxville</strong>, 

            Tenn., 100 working men and women will form a human billboard at the 

            city's busiest intersection during the evening rush hour. In <strong>Albuquerque</strong>, 

            N.M., union members held a rally outside the Honeywell Corporation, 

            one of the leading proponents of permanent free trade status for China. 

            And in <strong>Cambridge</strong>, Mass., on April 13, working families 

            are planning to demonstrate at Harvard University, where U.S. Trade 

            Representative Charlene Barshefsky is meeting with business leaders 

            who support giving China a blank check. </font></li>

</ul>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This isn't a fight between American workers and Chinese workers, 

          this is a fight on behalf of all workers in both our countries, a fight 

          for free speech, free assembly, the right to join a union &#151; it's 

          a fight about international economic justice," said AFL-CIO Secretary 

          Rich Trumka. "And this isn't a debate about who should and shouldn't 

          be our trading partners &#151; how can we call ourselves 'partners' 

          with a totalitarian government that puts people in prison for union 

          organizing, that beats and tortures members of religious groups, a country 

          that condones mass kidnaping of women for sale into prostitution or 

          marriage?"</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The AFL-CIO's campaign against permanent normal trade relations for 

          China is the first front of a major new multi-year campaign to make 

          the global economy respect people, not just profits. The campaign consists 

          of four key components: educating union members and the general public 

          about the global economy, fighting for workers' rights in the global 

          economy, building global solidarity among working families and holding 

          multinational corporations accountable for their role in speeding up 

          the race to the bottom.</font>
