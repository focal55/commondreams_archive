- April 13 - Promising to hold 

elected officials accountable on the environment, the bipartisan 

League of Conservation Voters (LCV) today announced a $6 million 

effort to inform the public about the environmental records of 

members of Congress and federal candidates. 



<p>With today's announcement, LCV launched the most aggressive, 

most bipartisan campaign program ever undertaken by an 

environmental organization. 



<p>According to LCV president Deb Callahan, the 2000 elections will 

see the emergence of the environmental issue as a top-tier election 

issue. LCV plans to build on heightened environmental attention 

generated from the 30th anniversary of Earth Day on April 22, and 

maintain that environmental momentum through Election Day on 

November 7. 



<p>"The time is right for environmental issues to move to the 

forefront of this year's campaigns," Callahan said. "The nation is 

enjoying relative peace and prosperity and voters can afford to 

focus on issues that pertain to their quality of life. Voters are 

beginning to understand that Congress has been chipping away at our 

environmental laws. No other issue more completely affects each 

American -- from the quality of the water we drink and air we 

breathe, to the health of our communities and the legacy we leave 

our children -- than the issue of environmental protection." 



<p>As part of its "Earth Day to Election Day" campaign strategy, 

the LCV Action Fund, LCV's political action committee, unveiled a 

new "Environmental Champions" campaign to promote the strong 

environmental records of select Republican and Democratic 

congressional candidates in tight races. U.S. Reps. Chris Shays 

(R-Conn.), Joseph Hoeffel (D-Pa.) and Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) were 

named the first "Environmental Champions" of 2000. 



<p>About being named an "Environmental Champion" Shays said, 

"During my service in Congress, I've tried to maintain a healthy 

respect for the world we inhabit and I've worked with my colleagues 

to fight attempts to rollback laws that protect our environment. 

I'm honored the League of Conservation Voters has recognized that 

effort. We were only given one Earth on which to live and if we do 

not cherish it we may very well lose it." 



<p>In 1998, Congressman Inslee witnessed the power of LCV's 

campaigns when his opponent, then Rep. Rick White (R-Wash.) was 

named to the Dirty Dozen and was ultimately defeated. Said Inslee, 

"I feel honored to be recognized today as a champion for the 

environment. I hope this event marks the beginning of a legacy of 

lawmakers who are expected to protect our natural environment, 

rather than singled out for their actions." 



<p>About Hoeffel's environmental record, Callahan said, 

"Congressman Hoeffel is an outstanding example of how effective and 

courageous a first-term member of Congress can be. He consistently 

votes to protect the environment and has numerous bills to preserve 

open space and farmland, combat the effects of suburban sprawl and 

protect taxpayers from paying the bill for environmentally harmful 

government subsidies." 



<p>By employing a variety of tactics and strategies, the LCV Action 

Fund will aggressively campaign to inform voters about the 

"Environmental Champions'" leadership and record. The 

"Environmental Champions" list will ultimately grow to about eight 

to ten candidates. 



<p>LCV is perhaps best known for its Dirty Dozen campaigns that 

target for defeat Congressional candidates with poor environmental 

records. Since 1996, LCV has campaigned against 25 Dirty Dozen 

candidates, helping to defeat 16. In 1999, the average LCV score of 

defeated Dirty Dozen designees was 19 percent, their replacements 

averaged 84 percent. The only candidate to be named to the Dirty 

Dozen so far in 2000 is U.S. Rep. Jim Traficant (D-Ohio). LCV ran 

television ads in March to publicize his votes against the 

environment and to highlight the strong environmental record of 

his primary challenger Bob Hagan. Other Dirty Dozen designees will 

be named in June and September. LCV will dedicate nearly $3 million 

to the 2000 Dirty Dozen campaign. 



<p>In addition to tough campaign programs, LCV also provides direct 

candidate support. Through the EarthList program, the LCV Action 

Fund generates contributions for the campaigns of strong 

environmentalists who are in competitive races. Reps. Jim Ramstad 

(R-Minn.), David Bonior (D-Mich.), Marge Roukema (R-N.J.), Sherwood 

Boehlert (R-N.Y.), Mark Udall (D-Colo.), Rush Holt (D-N.J.) and 

Sen. Jim Jeffords (R-Vt.) are currently named to the 2000 

EarthList. Three more candidates will be added before October. 



<p>The LCV Action Fund also publicly endorses candidates. Current 

endorsements include: <p>

By October, LCV will endorse about 100 Republican and Democratic 

pro-environment candidates running for the U.S. House or U.S. 

Senate. <br><br>



"This is the third election cycle we've run direct campaigns and 

we've learned that our presence in a race can make the difference," 

said Callahan. "Our board, our staff and our members are committed 

to supporting environmental friends, defeating environmental foes, 

and most importantly, giving citizens the resources to make 

informed environmental decisions on Election Day." <br><br>



While LCV has not made a presidential endorsement at this time, 

the group did produce in-depth environmental profiles of each 

presidential candidate that are available over the Internet at 

http://www.lcv.org/presidential. LCV updates the information weekly 

with the most recent environmental news from the campaigns. 

Callahan predicts that environmental issues will rise to the top of 

the agenda for the presidential candidates as the race heat up. <br><br>



The bipartisan League of Conservation Voters is the political 

voice for the environmental and conservation community. The League 

is a nonprofit organization dedicated to informing the public about 

the environmental records of federally elected officials. For each 

session of Congress, LCV produces the National Environmental 

Scorecard that rates the environmental voting records of U.S. 

Representatives and Senators. All campaign material and the 

Scorecards are available to the public through the LCV Web site,
