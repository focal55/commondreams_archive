- May 3 - The National Day of Prayer has

          become little more than a propaganda vehicle for the Religious Right

          to rewrite American history and attack church-state separation,

          Americans United for Separation of Church and State charged today.</font>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans United asserts that the

          event is dominated by ultra-conservative Religious Right activists who

          are using it to bash church-state separation and advance an erroneous

          view of the United States as a &quot;Christian nation.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The American people don't need

          Congress, the president or any government official to tell them when

          and how to pray,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director

          of Americans United. &quot;The National Day of Prayer is a reckless

          mixture of church and state that should be shut down.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NDP is an annual event that was

          established by an act of Congress in 1952. Originally a &quot;floating

          holiday,&quot; the NDP was officially designated the first Thursday in

          May when Congress amended the law in 1988. Most NDP events are

          coordinated by the National Day of Prayer Task Force, a private group

          headed by Shirley Dobson, wife of Focus on the Family founder and

          Religious Right political activist James C. Dobson. The task force

          urges prayer events in government facilities and schools across the

          nation.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn said a manual put out by the

          task force to promote the event gives an erroneous view of U.S.

          history. &quot;The National Day of Prayer Task Force's materials imply

          that Founders like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison were 18th

          century versions of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson,&quot; Lynn said.

          &quot;In fact, these founders strongly supported church-state

          separation, a fact completely missing from these materials.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn also faulted the materials for

          promoting a non-historical view of America as an officially

          &quot;Christian nation.&quot; He noted that the manual calls on NDP

          volunteers to &quot;let our hearts follow Christ as we intercede for

          our nation and its leaders and reclaim America in this new century for

          Him.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Asserted Lynn, &quot;It's ridiculous

          for Religious Right activists to talk about 'reclaiming' America. The

          Religious Right can't 'reclaim' America because they never claimed it

          in the first place. The United States was founded to be a secular

          republic, not an officially Christian nation.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concluded Lynn, &quot;The National

          Day of Prayer has become a platform for the Religious Right to blast

          the separation of church and state – ironically, the very principle

          that guarantees their right to worship in the first place. The NDP

          task force ought to be ashamed of itself.&quot;</font></p>
