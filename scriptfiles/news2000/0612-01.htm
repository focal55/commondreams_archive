- June 12 - The overall process of Beijing + 5 has proved to be a disappointment,

     Amnesty International said as the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on

     Women concluded.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The way a handful of governments have been allowed to hold hostage the review process

     illustrates the broader reality for women: when it comes to women's human rights there is a

     persistent lack of political will."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The negotiation process to draft the outcome document of Beijing + 5 illustrated that certain

     governments are still unwilling to fulfil their commitments towards women's human rights, or

     even to admit that they have a responsibility to do so.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This document was supposed to provide a blueprint for further action to ensure the full

     implementation of the commitments made in Beijing – instead in too many instances

     governments were not willing to even re-state what had been said five years ago," Amnesty

     International said. 

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Consequently the document will do little to assist, in practical terms, governments and civil

     society to move forward in realizing women's human rights."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Nevertheless those governments that have been genuinely committed to the Beijing + 5

     process will continue to implement and move forward on these issues. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     In addition, women's and human rights groups at all levels will continue to use the Beijing

     Platform for Action, adopted five years ago, to guide their work, while also making use of

     the positive aspects from this review process.
