<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- March 10 - Although the upcoming census has no questions that explicitly

ask about sexual orientation, there is a way for GLBT couples to be counted.

The Human Rights Campaign will join several other groups in urging same-sex

couples living in the same household to mark the "Unmarried Partners" option

when asked to describe their relationships.

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The Human Rights Campaign is urging same-sex couples who share a household

to answer the U.S. Census honestly because this data will be used to track

important changes in the American family," said HRC Executive Director

Elizabeth Birch.

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HRC is supporting "Make Your Family Count," a national public education

campaign being sponsored by the Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic

Studies and the Policy Institute of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.

"Make Your Family Count," will try to let all GLBT couples know that they

can be counted by marking the "Unmarried Partners" box on the census mail

forms that will be sent to every household in the United States in March and

April. The campaign has also launched a website, <a href="http://www.wecount.org">www.wecount.org</a>,

with information about the census and guidance to GLBT couples on answering

the census forms.

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The category "Unmarried Partner" appeared for the first time on census forms

in 1990. Only 150,000 households were counted as consisting of same-sex

unmarried partners - clearly a severe undercount. Since then, the census has

revised its figures upward, to 5.9 million unmarried partner households in

1998, of which approximately 28 percent, or 1.7 million households, were

unmarried partners of the same sex.

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"While the census question isn't about sexual orientation or identity, it is

nevertheless an important opportunity for our community to be counted," said

Birch. "However, because of fear of discrimination many people may not feel

safe enough to answer honestly and this may lead to an undercount.  We look

forward to the 2010 census when more discriminatory barriers will have

fallen and questions about sexual orientation can be asked more directly and

answered more honestly."

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For each same-sex couple who describes their relationship as "unmarried

partners" on the census short form, researchers will also be able to

determine demographics including race, age and number of children in the

household. For the households that receive the long form, researchers also

will be able to determine education, citizenship and income, among other

things.

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Human Rights Campaign is the nation's largest national lesbian

and gay political organization with members throughout the country.  HRC

effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the

public to ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and safe

at home, at work and in the community.
