- October 11 - Sea-based and boost-phase alternatives to national

missile defense (NMD) would be expensive and could not be deployed until

2014, according to a report released today by the Council for a Livable

World Education Fund. The 48-page report, Taking National Missile Defense

to Sea: A Critique of Sea-Based and Boost-Phase Proposals, concluded that

deploying a sea-based NMD system would cost between $30 and $36 billion and

could be detrimental to other Navy operations. 



<p>"Developing and deploying a global sea-based NMD system would not be cheap,

quick or easy, and installing NMD interceptors in AEGIS ships would compete

with other Navy fleet ... requirements," according to the report, written

by defense analyst Rodney W. Jones. 



<p>Taking National Missile Defense to Sea assessed the cost of building and

deploying a global sea- based NMD system against long-range missiles, as

well as recent proposals for boost-phase missile defenses.  The report

concluded that:



<p>Sea-based NMD would not be cheap.  A conservative cost estimate of even a

‘limited' sea- based NMD places the price tag between $30 and $36 billion,

or an estimated $43 billion with the inclusion of additional AEGIS ships to

cover simultaneous geographic threats.



<p>Sea-based NMD would not be quick. The technology for sea-based strategic

missile interceptors has not been designed or developed. Even a system that

uses upgraded Navy theater missile defense technologies could not be

deployed before FY 2014, while full deployment could not be completed until

FY 2020. 

<p>

Sea-based NMD would not be easy. Altering AEGIS ships to launch strategic

interceptors and upgrading ship-based radars would be expensive and could

pose new safety hazards. Moreover, installing boost-phase interceptors on

VLS modules would be impractical.



<p>Sea-based NMD would compete with other Navy requirements. The system would

either degrade the scope of routine naval operations or require more ships,

or both.



<p>"Before the next administration moves any distance down the paths of global

sea-based NMD or regional boost-phase interceptor systems, it should

demonstrate conclusively that the technologies will work and make public

what the costs will be," the report recommends.



<p>"Endorsing sea-based or boost-phase defenses without a thorough

understanding of the difficulties and costs is a grave mistake," said John

Isaacs, president of Council for a Livable World.

will also be available on the Council's website:
