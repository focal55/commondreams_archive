- March 8 - Today the Center for



Marine Conservation (CMC) applauded a survey of the cruise line



industry by the General Accounting Office (GAO) for the House of



Representatives' Committees on Commerce and Government Reform. The



GAO undertook the study to look at the status of the cruise ship



industry in light of recent illegal discharge violations.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The GAO survey of the cruise line industry is just the first



step to address the big problem confronting sensitive ocean and



coastal resources from this fast-growing industry," said Roger



Rufe, president of CMC. "Without additional funding for Coast Guard



monitoring, removal of current MARPOL exemptions for select



government vessels, and increased penalties for illegal discharge



violations, our oceans are not being protected adequately."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently, the U.S. Coast Guard has the responsibility for



enforcing compliance with the standards for MARPOL and the Clean



Water Act. Unfortunately during the years that the GAO report



covers, the industry grew by almost 50 percent and Congress



significantly reduced the funding available to monitor compliance.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The cruise industry has made significant improvements in how it



handles ship-generated wastes," said Rufe. "But with inadequate



funding for monitoring, how can we expect our Coast Guard to detect



all the violations? We cannot depend on violations caught by chance



-- that is unacceptable."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the increasingly difficult task of monitoring the



cruise line industry for violations, MARPOL standards are not



unilaterally applied to government vessels. The MARPOL exemptions



to the U.S. Navy and other government vessels need to be lifted so



that we can ensure all U.S. ships will not harm the marine



environment and are held to the same high standards.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Just because a ship belongs to the U.S. government does not



mean that its discharges are less harmful than discharges from



cruise ships," said Rufe. "We want zero tolerance for pollution



from any ship -- the U.S. government should not be exempt."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GAO report also failed to review current monetary penalties



for MARPOL violations. Many fines are so low that it is sometimes



more cost effective for ship owners to take their chances on being



caught rather than making necessary changes in equipment and



legally disposing waste on shore.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The GAO tackled some very difficult issues related to the



safety and environmental impact of the cruise line industry,"



concluded Rufe. "Now it's time to think about how to effectively



monitor and regulate this largely unregulated industry, an industry



that is growing by leaps and bounds."
