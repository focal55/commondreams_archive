- June 12 - Concerned citizens kicked off this week's much

anticipated demonstrations at the World Petroleum Congress (WPC) by

installing a state-of-the-art solar and wind energy system in front of the

conference center where oil industry heavyweights opened their oil

congress.  Two 400-watt wind turbines flanked two 350-watt solar panels

below a banner reading "Sunshine's Free,  What's Oil Costing Us?"  The

clean energy system powered a PA system for speakers and music as well as

videos of petroleum's damaging impacts.



<p>Meanwhile, the festive and peaceful "Rally for Oil Accountability and

Responsibility" of some 2500 people traveled through downtown Calgary and

arrived at Olympic Park where the renewable energy system was installed.

Marchers carried colorful banners depicting the repression, social and

environmental injustice suffered in the interest of oil companies by

communities around the world, from Ogoni of Nigeria to the Lubicon of Canada.



<p>"Clean energy solutions, such as this solar and wind unit, are ready and

available," explained local Calgarian Tak Dirks.  "It is time for Big Oil

to get out of its business of global warming, human rights violations and

environmental degradation and see that better energy options for society

exist."



<p>"Oil Corporations continue to destroy the health and well-being of

communities around the world," said Leslie Weigl, from Edmonton who helped

install the solar power system.  "The Calgary demonstrations are part of a

global movement to demand that Big Oil stop exploiting human rights and the

environment."

  

<p>The World Petroleum Congress, an organization of more than 50 member

nations which account for some 90 percent of global oil production and 85

percent of oil consumption, is meeting in Calgary this week. The WPC serves

as a top industry forum for charting the future of petroleum as well as

brokering key oil and gas deals.  Oil ministers, corporate CEOs and some

3000 other industry leaders are in Calgary for the Congress.



<p>Local, national and international activists have organized a week of

non-violent protests, speakers forums and teach-ins to coincide with the

WPC in order to draw critical attention to the damaging climate, human

rights and environmental impacts of society's unnecessary dependence on

fossil fuels.  Protestors wish to send a peaceful and clear message to the

industry and public: End injustice and climate change caused by oil.  The

time is now to move beyond petroleum and invest in readily available,

renewable energy solutions.
