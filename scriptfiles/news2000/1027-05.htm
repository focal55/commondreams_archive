<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WILLIAM HARTUNG, <a href="mailto:hartung@newschool.edu">hartung@newschool.edu</a>, 

<a href="http://www.worldpolicy.org/projects/arms">www.worldpolicy.org/projects/arms</a>, <a href="http://www.progressive.org">www.progressive.org</a>

President's fellow at the World Policy Institute, Hartung said today: "When 

Gore and Bush have addressed the Pentagon budget, they have talked about 

how much to increase it, not whether to do so. That is remarkable if you 

consider that at $311 billion per year, the United States is already 

spending more on its armed forces than the next seven largest military 

powers combined. After dropping under the Bush administration and the 

beginning of the Clinton administration, the Pentagon budget has increased 

for the last several years. We are currently spending 22 times the combined 

military budgets of the so-called rogue states: Iran, Iraq, North Korea, 

Syria, Libya and Cuba. Our military budget is almost ten times that of 

China. Gore and Lieberman have underscored that they plan to increase the 

military budget by $10 billion per year, while Bush-Cheney plans 'only' a 

$4.5 billion per year boost for the Pentagon. Meanwhile, the two major 

parties have raked in millions from military contractors. January 2001 is 

the 40th anniversary of President Dwight Eisenhower's farewell address to 

the nation in which he warned of the 'undue influence' wielded by the 

'military industrial complex.' His warning is even more apt today."

<br>

Co-founder and program director of the Colombia Support Network, 

Zarate-Laun said today: "Both Bush and Gore agree on spending $1.3 billion, 

mainly for military hardware, for the Colombian military. Ostensibly, this 

is to fight against drug trafficking, but if you look closely, they are 

ignoring the northern part of Colombia where the headquarters of the 

paramilitaries -- which are heavily involved in drug trafficking themselves 

-- are located. Instead, the U.S.-backed military effort is focusing on the 

south of the country, where leftist guerrillas -- who only indirectly 

profit from drug production -- control the territory. The U.S. is in fact 

backing a counterinsurgency war."

Former editor of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Day said: "Bush and 

Gore are for more military spending, only Nader is for decreasing the 

military budget. Similarly, both Bush and Gore favor the continued bombing 

of Iraq and the sanctions which are killing thousands of innocent Iraqis. 

Bush wants a more vigorous missile defense program than Gore, while Nader 

is against it altogether. Both Gore and Bush have been unflinching in their 

backing of Israel... Gore is in favor of the comprehensive nuclear test ban 

treaty; Bush is against, but has not talked about it much since foreign 

policy has been marginal in the campaign."</font>
