- May 1 - Led by television talk-show



host Rosie O'Donnell, five Hollywood celebrities have donated their



voices for a new ad campaign sponsored by Handgun Control and the



Center to Prevent Handgun Violence dramatizing the problem of



children and guns and garnering support for the Million Mom March



Across America this Mothers Day, May 14.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new ads, featuring voice-overs by celebrity moms Rosie



O'Donnell, Susan Sarandon, Whoopi Goldberg, Gloria Estefan and



Sarah Jessica Parker, will premiere on the Rosie O'Donnell show



today (Monday, May 1), and will begin airing in at least a dozen



markets on cable networks the same day. The ads were produced by



Rosie O'Donnell and Laughlin, Marinaccio &amp; Owens Advertising.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ads use home video footage of six American children who died



at the hands of guns and urges parents who are concerned about the



high levels of gun violence in our nation to participate in Million



Mom March events across the country. The children featured in the



ads are:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Ryan Williams, Muncie, Ind., age 14, accidentally shot and



killed;

<br>

-- Zachary Clements, Houston, Texas, age 13, accidentally shot



and killed by a friend;

<br>

-- Alex Stasenka, Fairfield, Calif., age 14, shot and killed by



a friend accidentally;

<br>

-- Louis D. Brown, Dorchester, Mass., age 15, murdered on his



way to a Christmas party of "Teens Against Gang Violence," a local



anti-violence organization he had joined;

<br>

-- Zachary Borgman, Battle Creek, Mich., age 2, shot



accidentally with his father's handgun;

<br>

-- Omar Soto, Deltona, Fla., age 11, shot and killed



accidentally by a neighbor.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Million Mom March Across America is a citizens' grass-roots



movement which began after a mother from New Jersey watched on the



news about the Granada Hills day care shooting only a few months



after the nation's worst school shooting in our history at



Columbine High School. The images of terrified children, about the



same age as her own, being led in a line by police from the carnage



that had just taken place inside sparked her into action. She came



up with the idea of a movement of mothers like herself who are



concerned for the safety of their children when it comes to guns,



and she decided to mobilize these mothers in a nationwide



demonstration called the Million Mom March.



&nbsp;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Million Mom March and Handgun Control share long-term goals:



support for gunowner licensing, gun registration, and closing the



loopholes that allow children and criminals easy access to guns.



Handgun Control is a primary sponsor of the Million Mom March and



the new ads will recruit concerned parents across the country into



long-term activism for common-sense gun policies.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are very grateful to Rosie and to the other celebrities who



lent their voices to this important effort," said Sarah Brady, HCI



Chair. "Their determination to prevent the unnecessary deaths of



children from gun violence and accidents will help us call



attention to the Million Mom March in the two weeks leading up to



Mother's Day. And those thousands of moms who show up on Mothers



Day will help call attention to this cause as never before."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 1, Handgun Control will honor Rosie O'Donnell for her



leadership and dedication at a special salute in New York City,



where we will be joined by Sen. Charles Schumer, Rep. Carolyn



McCarthy and Nita Lowy, actress Lauren Bacall, and other special



guests.

Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974 by



Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. "Pete" Shields, two victims of gun



violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law



enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups across



the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and local gun



control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI has more than



400,000 members nationwide, making it the nation's largest



citizens' gun control lobbying organization.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Handgun Control's sister organization, the Center to Prevent



Handgun Violence, was founded in 1983 and is also chaired by Sarah



Brady. It seeks to reduce gun violence through education, legal



advocacy, research, and outreach to the entertainment community.



The Center's national initiatives include violence prevention



programs for youth, education programs on the risks associated with



guns, legal representation for gun violence victims, reform of the



gun industry, and research on the risks associated with guns and on



the efficacy of gun control laws. More information about both HCI



and CPHV can be found on the websites at <a href="http://www.handguncontrol.org">www.handguncontrol.org</a>
