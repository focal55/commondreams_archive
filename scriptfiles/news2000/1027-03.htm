- October 27 - Despite predictions that National Missile Defense would

play a significant role in the 2000 campaign, the $60 - $120 billion Star

Wars system has been invisible as an election issue, Council for a Livable

World reported today.

	

<p>For instance, during the four presidential and vice presidential debates,

there was not a single question on missile defense.

	

<p>Neither George W. Bush nor Al Gore have done more than give passing mention

to the issue.  When it came to spending millions on campaign

advertisements, the candidates have highlighted education, health care,

social security and prescription drug prices.  They have not spent a dime

on missile defense.

	

<p>"Almost no one is willing to put their money where their mouth is," argued

John Isaacs, President of the pro-arms control Council for a Livable World.

 "Republicans who have claimed missile defense is a vital issue have

refused to back their words with action."

	

<p>The same is true for congressional races across the country.  While a few

candidates for Congress have mentioned the issue in a speech or debate,

when it comes to spending hard campaign dollars, missile defense has been

ignored.  Only Rhode Island Democratic Senate primary loser Richard Licht

spent money to run an advertisement and it was critical of the program.  

	

<p>For many months, President Clinton was believed to be under heavy political

pressure to announce in favor of deployment in order to protect Vice

President Gore from charges that the Administration had left the country

vulnerable to attack.  

	

<p>Yet when President Clinton announced on September 1 that he would put off

deployment to the next Administration, Members of Congress and the public

yawned.  In fact, a poll conducted September 8 - 10 by The Mellman Group

showed 58% of the public supported the President's decision while only 30%

opposed it. 

	

<p>Since that time, only the three most devoted congressional disciples of

missile defense — Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Sen. John Kyl of

Arizona and Rep. Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania — have taken to the Senate and

House floors to criticize the President's decision.  

	

<p>"It's difficult to make a case for missile defense when the Secretary of

State is posing for pictures with Kim Jong Il," added Isaacs.
