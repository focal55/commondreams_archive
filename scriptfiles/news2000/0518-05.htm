- May 18 - Texas produces more animal waste than any other state and is

creating a public health and pollution hazard, concludes a new report released

today by the Sierra Club and Consumers Union Southwest Regional Office.

According to "Animal Factories: Pollution and Health Threats to Rural Texas,"

Texas, unlike many other livestock producing states, provides little oversight

or regulation of these facilities. The result is polluted air and water and a

public health risk.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The new report shows that Texas produces more animal waste than any other state

- approximately 220 billion pounds, and this number is rising. Current estimates

show that Texas is producing 280 billion pounds or 40 pounds of manure per Texas

resident per day. "We already knew that Texas leads the nation in toxic air

pollution from manufacturing industries, and now we have the dubious honor of

holding the number one spot in manure production," said Ken Kramer, director of

the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club in Texas. California holds the number

two spot in manure production, but produces only half of the amount - 110

billion pounds of waste - that Texas does.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Unfortunately, Gov. George W. Bush and the Texas Natural Resources Conservation

Commission (TNRCC) have failed to protect Texas citizens from industrial

livestock waste," Kramer continued. "While this animal waste pollutes our air

and water, Gov. Bush and the TNRCC are welcoming factory farms into the state

and inviting them to pollute. They should be implementing tougher standards that

would combat this pollution problem."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The report describes how weak state environmental regulations and lax

enforcement allow Texas' factory farms to pollute, often for years, before any

enforcement action is taken. The pollution is taking its toll on local waterways

- impairing 388 miles of streams and more than 23,000 acres of lakes. Stretches

of Wright Patman Lake, Black Bayou, and the Upper North Bosque River are so

polluted from industrial livestock waste that they cannot support aquatic life.

Additionally, the areas of the North Bosque River and Leon River are

contaminated to the point that they can no longer support recreation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Air pollution from factory farms is also taking its toll on human health. For

instance, a child lived adjacent to a cattle feedlot and had to be air-lifted to

a nearby hospital because of severe respiratory distress caused by the large

amount of fecal dust emitted from the facility. This family and others have

moved from their homestead rather than live with the constant odor and dust.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While Texas residents suffer from manure pollution, Governor Bush and Texas

agencies refuse to keep factory farm waste out of Texas' air and waterways,"

said Ed Hopkins, Senior Washington Representative of the Sierra Club.  "Other

states have addressed environmental concerns and implemented effective

solutions. Texas should follow in their footsteps and protect our environment."

</font>

<p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Many states are beginning to take necessary steps to protect the public from air

and water pollution. Overwhelmed by the health and environmental threats posed

by industrial livestock operations, officials in both Mississippi, North

Carolina and Oklahoma have placed moratoria on all new operations. Kansas, Iowa,

and Georgia have all adopted new rules regarding waste application. And

Minnesota has applied air standards to safeguard neighbors from

health-threatening emissions. Meanwhile, despite overwhelming evidence of the

pollution problems Texas is merely studying the issue, allowing hog, chicken,

and cattle waste to continue polluting the state's air and water.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's time for Gov. Bush and the TNRCC to take notice of the damage that has

been caused by industrial livestock facilities in Texas," Hopkins concluded.

"They should protect Texas' health and waterways and stop livestock factories."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The report lists specific areas where the TNRCC has not done its job in

protecting Texas citizens from factory farm pollution, and offers

recommendations on how to increase protections. The report is available on the

web at <a href="http://www.consumersunion.org">www.consumersunion.org</a>.</font>
