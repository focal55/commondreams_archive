- June 6 - Today's action at FOX's Washington,

DC affiliate is the third since NOW named FOX a Network

of Shame.&nbsp; I am pleased to announce that it appears FOX may be

prepared to address our concerns about how women are portrayed on television.

As a result NOW has agreed to review Fox's fall line-up to evaluate the

network's improvement.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One week ago, on Tuesday, May 30, I had an encouraging dialogue in Los

Angeles with Gail Berman, who will take over as president of Fox Entertainment

on July 5th. Ms. Berman seemed open to NOW's

critique of primetime television and promised to work from within to

address feminist concerns, such as violence, gender composition/stereotypes,

sexual exploitation and social responsibility.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. Berman's record at Regency Television, where she spearheaded shows

like "Malcolm in the Middle," "Angel" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," suggests

that she is committed to programming with strong, fully drawn women characters.

On her watch at Fox, we hope to see more woman-positive shows that reflect

the rich diversity of women in our society.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, we can only be cautiously optimistic about the impact Ms. Berman

will have at FOX; it remains to be seen whether other top executives share

Ms. Berman's commitment. After all, Ms. Berman reports to Fox Entertainment

Group Chair Sandy Grushow, who is by reputation a hands-on executive.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clearly, Ms. Berman and other women in television face a real challenge.&nbsp;

We will do everything we can to support Ms. Berman in her efforts to change

what we see on tv.&nbsp; NOW activists will continue to monitor all of

the networks.&nbsp; And we will continue our efforts

to lobby for quality television programs. We will have discussions

with interested network executives as we work to make improvements.&nbsp;

We will also take our concerns to advertisers as we encourage them to support

programs that are women-friendly.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And this fall, as new shows are released along with new episodes of

returning shows, feminists will be watching, and we will let you know who

makes the grade.</font>
