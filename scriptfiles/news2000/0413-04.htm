- April 13 - Greenpeace called on BP Amoco

today to act on a historic vote at its annual general meeting calling on

the company to cancel its Arctic expansion plans. Specifically, the

resolution called on the company to abandon its controversial offshore

Northstar oil project in the Beaufort Sea, stop lobbying to open up the

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development and redirect funds into

its solar subsidiary BP Solarex.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Today's initial proxy vote, displayed at the BP annual general meeting,

showed 9.5 billion shares against the resolution and 1.491  billion shares

in favor, or 13.5 per cent of the vote. This was one of the highest votes

for an environmental shareholder resolution ever recorded. Votes of the

shareholders attending today's meeting have yet to be counted.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;BP Amoco cannot ignore this message from its own investors,&quot; said 

Greenpeace energy policy analyst Iain MacGill. &quot;BP Amoco's board must

immediately outline a strategy on how it now intends to make the

transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.  Either the company

delivers or it faces a reputation meltdown.&quot;  Despite claims it is

concerned about global warming, BP Amoco's oil and gas investments

represent 99.9 per cent of its total energy investments.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Meanwhile, at the Northstar construction site on the frozen Arctic Ocean

two Alaskans were arrested this morning for entering BP Amoco's "No

Trespass Zone" while holding a sign reading: &quot;BP: Global Warming Starts

Here.&quot;  Altogether, eleven activists have been arrested at the site this

week.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Both Alaskans and the company investors are sending a very strong message

that BP Amoco must stop fueling global warming and risking the Arctic

environment,&quot; said Greenpeace campaigner Melanie Duchin from the

Greenpeace camp near the Northstar site.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Greenpeace challenged the BP Amoco Board to develop a series of options

with different levels of capital investment in oil exploration and

renewable energy and let shareholders decide which level they want.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The resolution, filed by Greenpeace, the US Public Interest Research Group

and Trillium Asset Management of Boston, was publicly backed by a large

number of individual and institutional shareholders in the US and the UK.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This resolution represents a warning bell for BP Amoco; this issue will

not go away.  The BP Amoco board can ignore this resolution but they will

expose the company later to the risk of stringent regulation and possibly

consumer boycotts,&quot; said Simon Billenness, senior analyst for Trillium.
