- February 23 - A month ago, Andreas Toupadakis held a classified position at the Lawrence

Livermore National Laboratory. But he resigned his post, voicing criticisms

of U.S. nuclear policy. Interviews are available with Dr. Toupadakis and

other nuclear policy analysts:

<br>

Prior to joining the staff at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's

"Stockpile Stewardship" program on nuclear weapons, Toupadakis worked at Los

Alamos National Laboratory. Shortly after resigning, he issued an open

letter which reads in part: "I have seen how easy it is for nuclear

contamination to occur, and how hard it is to clean it up.... Do nations

possess nuclear, chemical and biological weapons because of fear of attack

from some other nation, or is it mainly because without them the stronger

cannot otherwise exploit the weaker?" He cited a manifesto issued by Albert

Einstein and Bertrand Russell: "People can scarcely bring themselves to

grasp that they, individually, and those whom they love are in imminent

danger of perishing agonizingly." (See:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, Toupadakis, a native of Greece and a U.S. citizen who received his

Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, said: "Our nuclear policy is based on

irrational fears driven by a tiny group of elites who shape public opinion.

We scientists have to use our skills for humanity, not for a machine we have

no control over. Scientists are enticed into comfortable positions, grow

dependent on the security and then they are tormented, playing tricks on

their own minds to justify continuing to work on the weapons. Labs must

institute an informed consent upon hiring -- and they should stop luring

students to visit the labs."

<br>

Executive director of the Western States Legal Foundation, Cabasso said: "A

scientist in the prime of his career has never before left a high-paying

permanent position in the nuclear weapons program to wholeheartedly join the

peace movement." Toupadakis has begun to teach part-time and is making a

small fraction of his former salary, and is without health insurance.

<br>

An architect for decades of the U.S. nuclear program, including at Los

Alamos, and now a critic of U.S. nuclear policy, Taylor said: "I applaud

Toupadakis. He was hired to work on environmental problems associated with

getting rid of nuclear weapons. But our government's policy is not to get

rid of nuclear weapons -- it is to perpetuate them through the

euphemistically-called 'stockpile stewardship' program."</font>
