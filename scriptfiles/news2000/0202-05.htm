- February 2 - In a hard-fought pro-choice

victory, the Senate today passed an amendment that ensures that



perpetrators of abortion clinic violence cannot escape judgments



against them.

<p>The amendment to the Bankruptcy Reform Act (S. 625) offered by

Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) ensures that criminals who commit acts



of violence against abortion clinics, women and doctors cannot avoid



paying fines and penalties by declaring bankruptcy. The Schumer



Amendment makes clinic violence-related debts "non-dischargeable"



under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

<p>"This is a major victory for the women of America and the doctors

who serve them," said NARAL President Kate Michelman. "Today, the



Senate has taken an important step to ensure that those who harass



and intimidate women and commit acts of violence against clinics are



held accountable for their crimes."

<p>Until the final vote, it was unclear whether the Schumer amendment

would pass. The vote count appeared to be so close that the



Democratic Leadership called Vice President Gore yesterday to ask him



to revise his campaign schedule and journey to Washington today to



cast a potentially tie-breaking vote. After the Vice President's



arrival and a press conference featuring Gore and the amendment's



supporters, including NARAL, Sens. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and Orrin



Hatch (R-Utah) instructed their majority to vote for the Schumer



amendment, which subsequently passed by a vote of 80-17.

<p>"Clearly, the anti-choice majority in the Senate, fearful of

handing the Vice President and Democrats a key campaign issue, caved



in to political pressure and chose to support the same amendment they



had been debating against all morning," said Michelman. "Without the



Vice President's willingness to stand up for the health, safety, and



reproductive rights of American women, this vote would never have



been possible."

<p>"Manipulation of the bankruptcy code is now a regular tactic in

the wider campaign by anti-choices forces to intimidate and threaten



women seeking abortions and the physicians who provide them,"



Michelman added. "The Bankruptcy Code is intended to give law-abiding



Americans a second chance when faced with overwhelming debt. But



individuals whose debt is the result of repeated violations of the



law are not 'honest debtors' and should not be allowed to use the law



for essentially criminal purposes.

<p>"Sen. Schumer is to be applauded for ensuring that the promise of

FACE is not undermined and for his leadership and principled stand

on



this important issue."
