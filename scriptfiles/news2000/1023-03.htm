- October 23 - Greenpeace called on the



Clinton/Gore administration today to fully implement the



recommendations of an independent EPA investigation and shut down the



most controversial hazardous waste incinerator in the United States.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a report released late Friday, the EPA's National Ombudsman



urged the agency to stop operations at the WTI incinerator in East



Liverpool, Ohio by "halting the feeding of waste to the incinerator



for a period of no less than six months," and requiring incinerator



re- testing and a new risk assessment. The Ombudsman said his



investigation found that WTI's original operating permit was based

on



faulty test burn data, unreliable air monitoring and a flawed risk



assessment. (1)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its discussions with the administration, the EPA has told



Greenpeace it accepts all the Ombudsman's findings but refuses to



shut down the incinerator. Meanwhile, Katie McGinty, an environmental



advisor to the Gore campaign speaking at a journalism conference in



Michigan yesterday, said the Vice President supports all the



Ombudsman's recommendations, including the shut down of the



incinerator.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Greenpeace hopes that this time Al Gore can be trusted to use his



power to convince the EPA to shut down WTI," said Greenpeace



campaigner Rick Hind. "Eight years ago the Vice President made



similar promises. The Ombudsman's report now gives him every reason



he could possibly want to keep his promise on WTI this time around."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both immediately before and after the 1992 presidential election



Vice President Gore promised a Clinton/Gore administration would



block operation of the WTI incinerator, which releases highly toxic



substances into the air and is located just 400 yards from an



elementary school and 320 feet from the nearest home. (2) Despite



Gore's promise and more than 130 violations of its permit, the WTI



incinerator continues to operate.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, new results from Greenpeace's testing of soil samples



taken from the East Liverpool school playground located near the WTI



incinerator reveal dioxin levels six to nine times the national



average. (3) These levels are equivalent to, or greater than, those



found near a Columbus, Ohio incinerator that the EPA shut down in



1994 after widespread community opposition. The Greenpeace results



also show elevated levels of lead and arsenic.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Residents of East Liverpool, who have been fighting the WTI



incinerator for over a decade, are increasingly frustrated by the



Clinton/Gore administration's failure to make good on its promise and



shut down WTI. In an October 18 letter to the Vice President, a



delegation of citizens from East Liverpool said they were headed to



Washington this week to engage in civil disobedience.
