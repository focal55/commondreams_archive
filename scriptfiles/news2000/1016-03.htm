- October 16 - The proposed merger of Chevron and Texaco sets up another lose - lose -

lose scenario for American consumers, democracy, and the

environment.&nbsp; Consumers will continue to lose from the lack of

competition.&nbsp; Democracy will lose, as these mega-companies will

exert more and more influence over the political process. And the

environment will lose as both companies&nbsp; but especially

Chevron&nbsp; have an aggressive anti-environmental agenda.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

We urge the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to block this proposed $35

billion merger.&nbsp; It’s time to stop the oil industry merger mania.

<br>

<br>

One of the consequences of the rash of oil industry mergers has been a

lack of competition&nbsp; and record high gas prices&nbsp; for consumers.

This merger would make a bad situation even worse.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

The new ChevronTexaco would also contribute to an excessive concentration

of political power in a small number of huge corporations.&nbsp; The

original authors of the antitrust laws sought to avoid excessive

concentrations of political power by the oil industry.&nbsp; That is one

of the reasons Standard Oil was broken up into 34 companies in 

1911.<br>

<br>

This new oil giant would undoubtedly use its increased political clout to

push environmentally dangerous drilling plans in Alaska and Florida.

Chevron is actively lobbying Congress to allow oil and gas drilling in

the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge and is trying to drill the first

offshore drilling well 30 miles off of Pensacola Beach in Florida.&nbsp;

<br>

<br>

We call on the FTC, the Clinton Administration, and Congress to block the

proposed Chevron&nbsp; Texaco merger and reject these environmentally

disastrous proposals.&nbsp; <br>
