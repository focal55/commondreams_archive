<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

June 26, 2000 will mark 25 years since a shoot-out at Oglala on the

Pine Ridge Indian Reservation would culminate in the deaths of two FBI

agents and one member of the American Indian Movement.  Still today, a

quarter century later, the incident remains vivid in the hearts and minds of

all who were affected.  On June 26, 2000 members of the American Indian

Movement who resided on the Jumping Bull Ranch where the incident occurred,

and local residents of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, will gather in

Oglala to call for healing.  This will be the first time many have seen each

other or discussed the incident since it occurred.  In the early morning,

ceremonies will be held for AIM member Joseph Killsright Stuntz and FBI

agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams, all of whom were killed during the

fatal shoot-out.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jean Day, an AIM member who lived on the ranch, invited the families of the

agents to the ceremonies.  “They share a common grief with us.  We too lost

many of our loved ones during that time.  We are not enemies,” she said.

Between 1973 and 1976, 64 people affiliated with the American Indian

Movement were murdered, but virtually no prosecutions were brought against

those responsible.  Those participating in the gathering are asking that the

loss of their loved ones also be recognized so that reconciliation can

begin.  They say that the tragic deaths of the FBI agents were amongst

numerous tragedies that occurred during the era, mostly against local

traditionalists.  They are also asking for the release of Leonard Peltier

who has served some 24 years for the deaths of the agents despite the

government’s admittance that they do not know who shot them.  His release

they say, would be the first step in balancing the scales of justice and

closing a chapter of history wrought with conflict.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those participating will attend strategy meetings to develop ways to bring

both truth and reconciliation to what was a very violent and turbulent time

on Pine Ridge. “You will find that governments all over the world, from

South Africa to Germany, are admitting past mistakes in an effort to bring

peace and closure to prior conflicts,” said Bruce Ellison, former Wounded

Knee Legal Offense/Defense Committee attorney, “now we are asking the US

government to do the same.”
