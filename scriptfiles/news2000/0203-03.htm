- February 3 - A letter, leaked by Greenpeace today, from the US State Department to the European Union (EU), reveals that the US is demanding that the EU drops its current commitment to elimate some of

the world’s most toxic chemicals. 

<p>The debate centres on US attempts to break EU support for developing

countries (G-77) that are aiming to eliminate synthetic chemicals that are by-products of industrial processes, such as dioxins, that are known human carcinogens. The US is urging the EU to vote with them and do no more than reduce toxic emmissions at the next negotiations of the global persistent organic pollutants (POPs) treaty, meeting in Bonn, March 2000.

<p>"This letter exposes a cynical attempt by the US to bully other countries into allowing toxic emmissions to continue. The question is whether the EU can publicly defend becoming the willing puppet of the well known US negotiation technique, and watch it watering down international treaties and then refusing to ratify and follow them," said Greenpeace toxic campaigner, Wytze van der Naald. "Whilst toxic chemical pollutants remain the main problem of the negotatiations,  the US is fast becoming the major obstacle to international solutions," he added.

<p>Contrary to what the US states in the communique, G-77 countries have an interest to follow the EU-commitments on elimination as is the case with the African Group (INC3 CRP34) and other members of the G-77 group, that are calling for elimination, not only for pesticide POPs, but also for POPs, such as dioxins, that are produced unintentionally, as a by-product. 

<p>On Monday 7th  February, the US will be meeting with EU and other 

OECD countries at the OECD headquarters to informally discuss the EU

position on POPs. "The EU must refuse to be manipulated and continue to forge ahead and phase out toxic pollution as they committed themselves to under European agreements, such as OSPAR," added van der Naald.
