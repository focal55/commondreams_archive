The full-page ad in Teen People's June/July 2000 issue read: "4 out 5 girls you hate ask for it by name. Stop hating them. Start being them. With original Sun-In ®."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

In a July 13 letter to Dads and Daughters, Chattem Chairman and CEO Zan Guerry wrote: "The word 'hate' was used in a lighthearted teenage vernacular, and certainly not in a mean spirited manner.  Unfortunately it is apparent that this ad has been misunderstood, for which we take full responsibility. The purpose of communication is not to communicate so you can be understood, but so you can't be misunderstood.  Clearly, we failed in this measure as the ad did not convey to some people what we intended. This ad ran briefly at the beginning of the summer and we have no plans to run it in the future."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Earlier this month, individual DADs members began writing Guerry to protest the ad. DADs wrote: "We never want our daughters aspiring to become something or someone they hate.  We hope that you will respond responsibly and promptly pull this advertisement, apologize for using it, and reexamine your strategies of marketing to children."

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are happy that Chattem responded swiftly and positively," DADs executive director Joe Kelly said. "It's an outrageous thing to tell any child to become the thing they hate, and Mr. Guerry acted responsibly to recognize this and drop the ad. We are also happy to again show how responsible consumer activism by fathers gets results that benefit girls."

<i>Dads and Daughters is the national nonprofit membership group for fathers and daughters.  DADs helps strengthen father-daughter relationships and transform the pervasive messages that value girls more for how they look than who they are.  DADs acts against marketers who undermine girls to sell their products, and applauds those who don't.  In its most recent action, DADs sparked a national protest of the Simon & Schuster Interactive CD-ROM game Panty Raider.  Chattem Inc. (NASDAQ symbol CHTT) is the international manufacturer of products like Dexatrim, Ban, Pamprin, and Phisoderm. </i>
