- April 12 - The following was released



today by the Violence Policy Center:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Smith &amp; Wesson has made public its interpretation of the



"landmark" March 17, 2000 agreement between the handgun maker, the



Department of Housing and Urban Development, and some cities suing



the gun industry. The document candidly states that the agreement for



the most part merely codifies the company's current business



practices. It also shows that many of the initial claims surrounding

          

the March 17 pact were false or wildly exaggerated. The document also



confirms that dealers will be required to only meet the terms of the



agreement with respect to Smith and Wesson products, not-as many



originally assumed-for all guns sold by the dealer. The annotated

edition of the pact (posted on Smith &amp; Wesson's web site located

at



<a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com">www.smith-wesson.com</a> and

also available in PDF format at the Violence



Policy Center's (VPC) web site located at <a href="http://www.vpc.org">www.vpc.org</a>)

shows that

 

Smith &amp; Wesson's "clarification" nullifies any potential positive



impact of the agreement.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VPC Director of Federal Policy Kristen Rand states, "Following the



agreement, Smith &amp; Wesson's Ken Jorgensen told the press, `It doesn't



change a lot of things in terms of how we do business....But it is



going to save us a lot of money on the legal side.' Jorgensen's



right. Smith &amp; Wesson wanted something for nothing and they got

it.



From Smith &amp; Wesson's perspective this agreement was never about



saving gun victims' lives, it was about saving gun manufacturers



money."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three of many examples where Smith &amp; Wesson has interpreted the



document to render its impact meaningless include:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Agreement: Smith &amp; Wesson authorized dealers will, "Make no sales



at gun shows unless all sales by any seller at the gun show are



conducted only upon completion of a background check."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Smith &amp; Wesson's Interpretation: "This applies only to Smith &amp;



Wesson product and does not apply to private sales."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Agreement: Smith &amp; Wesson authorized dealers will enact new



security measures, including: 1) "(d)isplay cases shall be locked at



all times except when removing a single firearm to show a customer"



and "(a)ll firearms shall be secured, other than during business



hours, in a locked fireproof safe or vault in the licensee's business



premises or in another secure and locked area," 2) "(a)mmunition



shall be stored separately from the firearms and out of reach of the



customers," and, 3) "persons under 18 years of age (are) to be



accompanied by a parent or guardian when they are in portions of the



premises where firearms or ammunition are stocked or sold."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Smith &amp; Wesson's Interpretation: The storage requirement "applies



to Smith &amp; Wesson Firearms only." The ammunition requirement "applies



to dealers, and pertains to centerfire handgun ammunition only where



physically possible." As regards the age requirement, "This may be



accomplished by posting a sign that states persons under 18 years of



age must be accompanied by an adult in the area where firearms or



ammunition are stocked or sold." Smith &amp; Wesson promises to supply



the signs.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Agreement: Smith &amp; Wesson authorized dealers will transfer



firearms only to "individuals who have demonstrated that they can



safely handle and store firearms through completion of a certified



firearms safety training course or by having passed a certified



firearms safety examination."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Smith &amp; Wesson's Interpretation: "This applies to Smith &amp; Wesson



products only" and "Smith &amp; Wesson will provide simple-to-use



training aids, handout materials, videos and any forms required to



assist dealers in meeting these requirements at the point of sale."



Smith &amp; Wesson also states,"Courses such as NRA Basic Pistol, Hunter



Safety or State Conceal Carry Courses will also likely fulfill this



requirement."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The document reveals that other much-touted components of the



agreement do not represent any changes in behavior on the part of the



gun maker. For example: the company had already been supplying



trigger locks with all handguns (and had been lauded for doing so by



the Clinton Administration at an October 1997 Rose Garden ceremony);



all of its current handguns meet the minimum size and quality



standards outlined in the pact; and, it had already been working on



"smart" gun technology.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adds Rand, "Smith &amp; Wesson's actions are only the latest evidence



of the futility of relying on promises made by the gun industry. The



only way the gun industry will ever change its deadly manufacturing



and marketing practices is if it is forced by federal or state



regulation to do so."
