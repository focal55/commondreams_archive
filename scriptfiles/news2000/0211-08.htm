- February 11 - In its FY 2001 budget,



released Monday in Washington, the Clinton administration proposed



a reduction in the number of refugee admissions to the United



States and decreased assistance overseas in almost all regions of



the world.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responding to the budget announcement, Ralston Deffenbaugh,



president of the Lutheran immigration and Refugee Service and chair



of The Refugee Council USA, remarked, "In this era of unprecedented



American prosperity, it is with deep regret that we find the



Clinton administration proposing to reduce the numbers of those



eligible for resettlement to the United States."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the midst of America's unprecedented post-Cold War boom, a



new global anarchy has spread, producing nearly 14 million refugees



and more than 17 million internally displaced persons. Many of



those driven from their homes will never be able to return; a small



number of these are resettled annually in developed countries. The



United States has long been the world leader in welcoming such



refugees to its shores. But during the past eight years, refugee



admissions have declined over 40 percent. Refugee agencies and



congressional supporters have advocated returning admissions to



their historic levels of more than 100,000 per year.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The juxtaposition of American affluence and spiraling global



misery should spur the Administration to reassert U.S. leadership



and re-energize its commitment to refugees and the displaced.



Instead, a reduction in the number of admission signals a



further retrenchment by our government. "The U.S. government can



and should do better in meeting the world's grave humanitarian



challenges," remarked Mark Franken, head of the U.S. Catholic



Conference/Migration and Refugee Services. "This budget has us



going in the wrong direction."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year Congress approved a reduction in the Migration and



Refugee Assistance account. But that was in the context of a



substantial supplemental bill that provided funds for refugees



from Kosovo. This year there is no supplemental on the horizon. That



means that once again the needs of millions of refugees living under



harsh conditions worldwide will feel the effects of the funding



shortfall.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Europe, refugees in the Balkans continue to face daunting



challenges of repatriation or permanent resettlement, and political



tensions in Montenegro are cause for alarm. In Southeast Asia,



secular violence and separatist movements will likely continue to



produce refugees in Indonesia and Burma. In the Middle East,



millions of refugees still cannot return home safely to



Afghanistan, and progress toward permanent Arab-Israeli peace will



ultimately require a solution to the region's refugee situation. In



the Americas, intensified warfare in Colombia could produce



sizeable new refugee populations, and Haiti remains politically



fragile.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Africa poses the greatest need for improved refugee assistance



funding. Twenty-two African countries have suffered armed conflict,



serious social tensions or received significant new refugee



populations in the past year. A murderous, almost 30-year war continues in Sudan, with 2 million dead and more than 4 million



uprooted. Peacekeeping forces are being deployed in Sierra Leone,



where more than 300,000 refugees and thousands of amputees await



assistance and stability. A regional war threatens to re-ignite in



the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where hundreds of thousands



have already been displaced and pushed from their homes, many into



neighboring countries. There are currently 10 million children



orphaned by AIDS in Africa and 40 million are expected by the end



of this decade.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"On a continent with 10 percent of the world's population, 50



percent of the world's wars, and an AIDS epidemic ravaging millions



of lives, we simply must do better. This is only one vivid example



of the many desperate refugee situations around the world which



call for a more generous American humanitarian response,"



concluded Deffenbaugh.
