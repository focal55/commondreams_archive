- March 31 - Heralding a major shift in the conscience of the U.S. construction industry, 

two of the nation’s largest homebuilders  -- Centex Homes and Kaufman &amp; 

Broad – this week agreed to stop using wood from endangered old growth 

forests in new home construction, making them the first in the nation to do 

so.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These agreements signal a trend that is irreversible" declared Michael 

Brune, Old Growth Campaign director for Rainforest Action Network (RAN).   

"A new ethic is emerging in which old growth logging is no longer 

acceptable. The entire home construction industry will be compelled to meet 

or beat this new market standard."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The revolutionary promises by Centex and Kaufman &amp; Broad – made in letters 

dated March 30 and March 29 respectively -- are the result of lengthy 

negotiations and pressure from RAN, the Coastal Rainforest Coalition, the 

Natural Resources Defense Council and other groups. Nationwide protests 

against the two builders had been scheduled for April 1, but were called off 

after the companies’ last-minute capitulations.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Loggers operating in endangered forests -- from British Columbia to the 

Southeastern U.S. and from Alaska to Indonesia – will be forced to transform 

their logging practices or they will find their markets will quickly 

disappear," said Brune.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Centex Homes pulls in some $5 billion in annual sales and boasts more than 

400 developments nationwide, and Kaufman &amp; Broad builds some 22,000 homes 

annually, making the two the largest volume homebuilders in the nation.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. homebuilding industry is the country’s largest user of wood 

products, using a whopping 72 percent of the lumber consumed nationwide to 

build an estimated 1.2 million new homes annually. The average new home in 

the U.S. uses well over 16,000 board feet of lumber.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most homes built today contain dozens of wood components that originate in 

the world's last remaining old growth forests: Cedar for tongue-and-groove 

planking and shingles; Douglas Fir for dimensional lumber; Hemlock for 

molding and trim; Lauan/Meranti for hollow-core doors, plywood and paneling; 

Mahogany for decorative exterior doors.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Old growth forests are home to some of the planet’s oldest and largest 

trees, some as old as 4,000 years. These forests are also home to more than 

200 million indigenous people worldwide, provide habitat for a majority of 

the Earth’s plant and animal species and are critical to moderating the 

effects of climate change. In the U.S., less than 4 percent of our original 

ancient forests are still standing, and worldwide, logging and other causes 

of deforestation have fragmented all but 20 percent.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The announcements from Centex and Kaufman &amp; Broad are the latest in a wave 

of corporate commitments against the use of old growth wood. RAN worked with 

a coalition of grassroots groups, including American Lands Alliance, 

Free-The-Planet, Student Environmental Action Coalition, Sierra Student 

Coalition, Rainforest Relief, Earth Culture, Action Resource Center, and 

dozens of other organizations in a two-year campaign to convince retail 

giant Home Depot to phase out endangered forest products. Following Home 

Depot’s compliance last August, other major retailers, from Ikea to Wickes 

Lumber, have followed suit.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Building on that success, RAN launched its campaign with homebuilders Jan. 

14 at the National Association of Homebuilders convention in Dallas, Texas, 

where activists inflated a giant balloon shaped like a chainsaw during 

opening remarks by Newt Gingrich, hung two giant banners from convention 

center rafters and projected giant slide messages onto the sides of 

buildings.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Just as Home Depot shook the foundations of the home improvement industry 

by vowing to eliminate products from endangered forests last summer, this 

commitment by Centex and Kaufman &amp; Broad brings us one step closer to a 

permanent end for old growth logging," Brune said.</font>
