- July 4 - Greenpeace warned that the future of whales in  the South Pacific is uncertain after the proposal by the governments of Australia and New Zealand to establish a South Pacific Whale Sanctuary failed today at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in Adelaide, Australia.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed sanctuary had the backing of all the South Pacific island states whose waters it would have covered and the majority support of countries at the IWC meeting. It failed to be adopted because Japan,  adamantly opposed to it, influenced the votes of six East Caribbean  countries, to which it gives significant economic aid.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It’s of deep concern that such an important step towards the  conservation of whales can be blocked by the economic leverage of one country. The future of whale populations in these waters is now  uncertain. Why would Japan go to such expense and put so much effort  into defeating the sanctuary proposal if it didn’t intend to hunt in the South Pacific?" said John Frizell of Greenpeace International. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These countries, together with Norway, which has no economic interest in whaling in the South Pacific, prevented the proposal from getting the three quarters majority it needed to pass. Three votes in favour of the sanctuary, from countries such as New Zealand, Australia and the France are neutralised by a single vote against it from an East Caribbean  country, such as Dominica. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are deeply disappointed that the East Caribbean nations have  ignored the wishes of South Pacific islands and have allowed their vote  to be bought by a country that wants to commercially exploit whales  thousands of miles away from its own shores," said Sakiusa  Qereqeretabua from Greenpeace Australia Pacific.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This vote should have been about conserving the world’s remaining  whale populations, not about short term economic gain. A South Pacific Whale Sanctuary would have stimulated sustainable industries and  economic independence for developing island states by providing a  strong foundation for the emerging whale watching industry," he added. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the proposal’s defeat today, Greenpeace is encouraged by the  strong support for the South Pacific Whale Sanctuary this year and  welcomes the continued support of the governments of Australia and  New Zealand to return with this proposal at next year’s IWC meeting. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This may have been a victory for Japan’s vote buying has not seen an end to this proposal. This year has formed a strong foundation for the  sanctuary's success in the future,” concluded John Frizell. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Notes to Editors: </b>
