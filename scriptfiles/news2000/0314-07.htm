- March 14 - Taxpayers, schoolchildren and the environment will benefit from new Minerals Management Service (MMS) oil valuation rules to be finalized tomorrow.  Effective June 1, 2000, the rules will force the largest oil companies to stop underpaying by at least $66 million a year the royalties they owe the American public for drilling on public lands.  The revenues collected from the royalties will go to environmental programs, like the Land and Water Conservation Fund, to the federal treasury, and to state governments, many of which use the money to fund public education. 



<p>“When Big Oil underpays royalties, taxpayers, schoolchildren and the environment lose,” said Lexi Shultz, U.S. PIRG staff attorney.  “The new MMS rules put the public interest over multi-billion dollar polluting special interests,” she added.



<p>Oil companies are required by law to pay a royalty for the privilege of drilling on public lands, but the largest oil companies, like BP Amoco, Chevron, Mobil, and Exxon, evade paying their fair share for the billions of dollars of oil they extract by setting the price of the oil below market value.   The Minerals Management Service (MMS) drafted an oil valuation rule to stop this practice in 1996, but Congress blocked this rule five separate times through five “riders” attached to spending bills.  The most recent of the riders, attached to the fiscal year 2000 Omnibus Appropriations bill, prohibited the MMS from finalizing the rules until March 15, 2000.



<p>“With oil prices so high, oil companies should not be allowed to gouge taxpayers the way they’ve been gouging consumers,” said Shultz.  “After four years of putting roadblocks in the way of public interest protection, the oil industry should now allow these new oil royalty rules to go forward without further obstruction,” she added.  



<p>The oil companies that have benefited from the delay in the MMS rules earned $9.2 billion in the first six months of 1999 alone.  These companies have been using some of those profits to make campaign contributions to their congressional allies, donating more than $16 million to all congressional candidates from 1993 to 1998.  Senator Hutchison (R-TX), the top Senate recipient of oil money,  received $1.2 million during that time.  Senator Domenici (R-NM) was the sixth highest Senate recipient, receiving $186,289.  Both of those Senators were instrumental in achieving the legislative delays of the new oil royalty rules.



<p>“The oil industry has been wielding its influence in Congress to get special deals,” said Shultz.  “The oil royalty riders are just one example  oil companies also benefit from research handouts and tax breaks that cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars annually,” she added.



<p>“U.S. PIRG applauds the efforts of Senator Boxer (D-CA) and the MMS to end oil royalty ripoffs,” said Shultz.  “Now it’s time for Congress to put an end to all taxpayer handouts for this polluting industry,” she concluded.
