- February 22 - Amnesty International USA



(AIUSA) condemns the decision by the Texas Board of Pardons and



Paroles to proceed with the execution of Betty Lou Beets despite her



history of abuse at the hands of her husband.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an open letter to Gov. Bush last week, AIUSA's Women's Human



Rights Program and national and state domestic violence groups drew



attention to the repeated sexual, physical and emotional abuse Beets



endured throughout her life. Neither this history nor the abuse by



her husband were presented at her trial.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unless Gov. George W. Bush grants a 30-day stay, Betty Lou Beets



will be executed on Thursday, Feb. 24.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Gov. Bush must ensure that Texas does not commit the final act of



violence against this woman. We ask the governor to act on his stated



concern for the victims of domestic violence and demonstrate his



compassion by staying the sentence of Betty Lou Beets," said Sheila



Dauer, director of AIUSA's Women's Human Rights Program.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This case demonstrates how poorly the legal system protects



against unjust executions. Gov. Bush should grant a 30-day stay and



consider commuting this sentence to prevent a fatal miscarriage of



justice in this case," said Dr. William Schulz, executive director

of



AIUSA. "We urge Gov. Bush to acknowledge that the application of the



death penalty in Texas is flawed and also halt all executions



pending a broad review of the death penalty."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Legislatures around the country have recognized the role of



domestic and sexual violence as mitigating factors in capital cases.



Governors in states such as Maryland, Ohio, Illinois, California and



Florida have commutted the sentences of battered women.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 3,600 men and women remain on death row across the



United States. Four countries -- the United States, China, Saudi



Arabia and Iran -- lead the world in use of the death penalty.</font>
