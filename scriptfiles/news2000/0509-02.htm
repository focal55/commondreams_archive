- May 9 - Six months after being asked by President Clinton to

     protect the remaining wild pockets of America's National Forests, the

     U.S. Forest Service has laid out a range of options to accomplish this

     vision.  While some options in the draft plan could offer real

     protection for our wild forests, the agency's preferred alternative

     would fall short of the President's bold vision and squander this

     historic opportunity.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Three out of four Americans want their wild forests protected.  But

     no one option recommended today will provide lasting protection to our

     National Forests' remaining wild areas," said Sierra Club Executive

     Director Carl Pope.  "The good news is that the Forest Service has

     recommended ending road building and has included policy options that

     could -- if added together -- realize the President's vision."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Two gaping loopholes glare in the draft plan.  First, the preferred

     alternative does not end logging in unspoiled forest areas, but only

     prevents roadbuilding.  While a ban on roadbuilding makes logging more

     difficult, it does not halt destruction of these lands.  Second, the

     preferred option delays until 2004 any decision on protecting Alaska's

     Tongass National Forest, allowing logging to continue to destroy the

     Earth's largest intact temperate rainforest while the agency stalls.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Noting that the release of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement

     (DEIS) kicks off an unprecedented round of nearly 400 public hearings

     across America, Pope urged Americans to "speak up and demand a final

     plan that protects our forests for our families and for our future.

     This fight isn't over yet and we have every reason to hope that we can

     end logging in the wild fragments of our National Forests and protect

     Alaska's Tongass National Forest right now.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Delay means decimation for the Tongass," Pope said.  "In our hands,

     we hold the key to protecting this majestic wonder: Go to the public

     hearing in your community and demand that the final rule, due out this

     year, include an end to logging in this land of wild salmon, ancient

     trees and grizzly bears."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Polling shows most Americans want to ban logging, mining, off-road

     vehicles and other destructive activities from unspoiled areas in our

     National Forests.  The Republican firm American Viewpoint found 76% of

     voters nationally favor that goal, with only 19% opposed.  That poll

     found support held across geographic region (80% support in the East;

     73% in the South; 78% in the Midwest; and 72% in the West), sex (78%

     of women and 73 % of men support) and party lines (86% of Democrats,

     78% of independents and 62% of Republicans support).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     To fully safeguard the unspoiled areas of our National Forests, the

     final plan must protect all roadless areas larger than 1,000 acres

     from logging and other destructive activities, and must immediately

     provide this protection for Alaska's Tongass National Forest as well.</font>
