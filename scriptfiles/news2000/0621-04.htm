- June 21 - The Sierra Club and the



New York Public Interest Research Group filed suit in federal court



today in an attempt to force the Environmental Protection Agency to



strengthen air pollution regulations in 35 states, the District of



Columbia, and the Virgin Islands. The groups charge that the agency



has illegally allowed the states to operate weak air pollution



permit programs for more than six years, and that EPA must instead



take over the permit programs in these states.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The permit programs are required by amendments to the Clean Air



Act signed by President Bush in 1990. The law requires that major



air pollution sources be regulated under detailed permits



(sometimes called "Title V" or "Operating" permits) that are



enforceable by citizens and EPA in federal court. The permits must



spell out pollution limits, monitoring requirements, compliance



schedules, and other provisions to implement clean air laws.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The amendments required states to adopt permit programs by 1993,



but EPA found programs in many states to be deficient.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Defects found by EPA in the state permit programs include



illegal waivers and exemptions, inadequate requirements for



emission limits, lenient penalties, and improper barriers to



citizens' ability to challenge weak permits. Other deficiencies



allow polluters to assert improper defenses, evade disclosure of



violations, and avoid compliance with emission limits. A number of



states fail to adequately provide for public notice and other



public participation rights in the permit process. Interim approval



allows all these deficiencies to remain uncorrected.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead of rejecting these programs, however, EPA simply used a



provision in the law that allowed a one-time interim approval that



should last no more than two years. At the end of the two-year



period, unless the states had come up with an adequate set of



regulations, EPA was to take over the program itself. Nonetheless,



on May 22, EPA issued another blanket extension of the inadequate



regulations in 37 separate jurisdictions the fourth such extension



since 1995.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Clean Air Act explicitly prohibits these delays," said



Earthjustice attorney David Baron, who represents the plaintiffs in



the new lawsuit. "The law required correction of all deficiencies



years ago, and it's inexcusablenot to mention illegalto allow



continuation of these weak programs. Clean air is essential for the



health of every living thing. To play fast and loose with the law



is deplorable."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The states and territories affected by the suit are: Alabama,



Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut,



Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho,



Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,



Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey,



New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas,



Vermont, Virgin Islands, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and



Washington.
