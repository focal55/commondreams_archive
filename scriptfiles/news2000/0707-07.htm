- July 7 - The 13th International Conference on AIDS will be held in Durban, South

Africa from July 9 to 14. The following analysts are available for

interviews:

</a>Co-director of Essential Action, Weissman said today: “While Africa is

experiencing an epidemic that ranks among the worst in world history, the

multinational drug companies -- which produce the drugs that can treat and

extend the lives of those with HIV/AIDS -- are focusing not on the

humanitarian tragedy but on their bottom lines. There’s plenty of blame to

go around for the HIV/AIDS epidemic, but certainly high up on the list are

the drug company executives who prioritize protecting their intellectual

property and guarding their profits over saving people’s lives.”

</a>Executive director of Doctors Without Borders, USA, Tanguy said today: “For

the first time, the International AIDS Conference will be held on the

African continent and in a country where a significant proportion of the

population has HIV/AIDS. People with HIV/AIDS in South Africa -- and in all

developing countries -- are facing a severe crisis of access to the

life-saving medications.” She added: “The antiretroviral drugs that have

transformed HIV/AIDS from a death sentence to a chronic disease in developed

countries are largely unavailable in developing countries, priced beyond the

means of most people.”

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PETER LURIE, M.D., <a href="mailto:plurie@citizen.org">plurie@citizen.org</a>, <a href="http://www.citizen.org">http://www.citizen.org<br>

</a>Deputy director of Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, Lurie has until

now attended every International AIDS Conference since 1992. He said today:

“The greatest tragedy of the AIDS epidemic today is how much could have been

done to reduce its toll and how little was done.  Short courses of

antiretroviral drugs that cost as little as four dollars per mother can

reduce mother-to-infant HIV transmission by a third or more. Yet large parts

of sub-Saharan Africa do not enjoy a stable supply of pharmaceuticals. We

should be treating sexually transmitted diseases which, left untreated,

increase HIV transmission rates. Allowing African countries to make or

purchase their own pharmaceutical drugs through compulsory licensing and

parallel import proposals can save many lives, but have been opposed by the

big drug companies....  In exchange for loans from the World Bank and the

IMF, these institutions have imposed structural adjustment policies on

developing countries. These export-oriented economic models undermine the

public sector and health services in ways that are detrimental to

controlling HIV/AIDS. Debt relief is therefore a necessary component of any

strategy addressing HIV/AIDS.”
