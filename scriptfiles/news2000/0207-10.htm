- February 7 - Pfizer Inc. announced today that it plans to buy Warner-Lambert Co. for $90

billion in stock in a deal that creates the world's second largest

pharmaceutical company. Meanwhile President Clinton and others are putting

out proposals on Medicare. The following analysts are available for

interviews on these and other subjects related to the pharmaceutical

industry:

Director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, Dr. Wolfe said today:

"This would be the 29th significant merger in the pharmaceutical industry in

the last decade. There is no evidence that the economies of scale have

resulted in price savings to consumers -- quite the contrary. Also, there is

no evidence that more research will come out of the combined companies than

the two individually. Finally, there is the corruption of the political

process; stronger pharmaceutical companies can push through legislation like

patent extensions and put more pressure on the Food and Drug

Administration."

<br>

A policy analyst on economics and aging issues and a former reporter for

the New York Times, Hess said today: "All the Medicare proposals -- from

Clinton, Gore, Bradley as well as the Republicans -- refuse to address the

question of price controls for pharmaceutical drugs. Also, they don't really

cover the total bill, they just allow someone to buy insurance and that only

covers part of the cost of the drugs. We have people going across the border

to Canada to buy their medication. What's needed is to put a limit on what

these companies are charging. The government gives them a monopoly through

the patent system, and so they can pretty much charge anything they want to.

Also, the government provides a large part of the research funds. For us

retirees who are already covered for some of our pharmaceutical bill, the

current Medicare proposals let our employers off the hook."

<br>

Co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and co-author of

the newly released "Social Security: The Phony Crisis," Baker said: "The

merger is just going to mean higher drug prices and less research. It's hard

not to believe that one of the ways that they're going to economize is to

reduce research where they overlap. There will be higher drug prices because

there will be less competition. The pharmaceutical companies want

prescription coverage in Medicare as long as it doesn't affect their pricing

power; they'll be very happy since that just means more customers, but that

will be incredibly expensive for us. The question is, will Clinton set up

some kind of federal buying entity to keep prices down?"
