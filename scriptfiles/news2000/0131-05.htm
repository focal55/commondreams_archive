<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LONDON 

- January 31 - Human Rights Watch today expressed dismay 

at being denied the right to question the fairness of the procedure used 

to assess Augusto Pinochet's fitness to stand trial. It urged British 

Home Secretary Jack Straw to release to interested parties the medical 

evaluation of the former Chilean dictator.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Today's ruling is an unfortunate setback to principles of  justice," 

said Wilder Tayler, General Counsel for Human Rights Watch.  "Jack Straw 

carries a huge historical responsibility to reach a decision that is 

just, and that respects the rights of Pinochet's victims."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch had joined with five other organizations to seek a 

judicial review preventing the British home secretary from releasing 

Pinochet without taking certain basic steps of procedural fairness. The 

Belgian government had sought a similar review. The High Court in London 

today denied both requests. Human Rights Watch said that it would 

consider all available legal options following today's decision.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The international human rights organization had expressed its objections 

on three main grounds: that the medical examination was cursory and 

performed by non-specialists; that the results of the medical 

examination have not been shared with interested parties; that there has 

been no public hearing on this matter of vital public interest.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The five organizations joining Human Rights Watch in filing this 

application are Amnesty International, The Redress Trust, the Medical 

Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, the Association of the 

Relatives of Disappeared Persons, and Justicia.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tayler noted that the growing number of countries who want Pinochet 

extradited shows that the principle of "universal jurisdiction" is 

gaining wider acceptance. In addition to Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, 

and France have also requested Pinochet's extradition.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Pinochet's crimes were so terrible, he can be prosecuted for them 

anywhere," said Tayler. "Despite this setback, enormous progress has 

been made in establishing that principle."
