- May 15 - Arguing that a safety net



for all generations is more important than investment accounts, 2030



Action, an advocacy organization for young adults, launched a



campaign to educate the public about the destructive potential of



Gov. Bush's Social Security privatization and tax cut schemes.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Gov. Bush delivered a key speech in Southern California



outlining his principles for Social Security privatization, an



airplane towing a banner sponsored by 2030 Action circled the skies



above. It read: "DON'T PRIVATIZE SOCIAL SECURITY, <a href="http://WWW.2030.ORG" target="new">WWW.2030.ORG</a>".

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hans Riemer, Director of 2030 Action (a 501(c)4 non-profit,



non-partisan organization affiliated with the 2030 Center, founded

in



1997), made the following statement in response to the Bush speech:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush wants funds that should go into Social Security to go into



the stock market instead. So where will he get the money to continue



paying Social Security benefits? He doesn't say. In truth, benefits



will have to be cut and the retirement age will have to be increased.



And the cuts will be biggest for today's young workers. But



guaranteed benefits for all generations are more important than



private accounts.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now is the time to put Social Security on sound financial footing



for the future. If we reduce the debt and credit the savings to



Social Security, we can guarantee solvency-and full benefits for all



workers-until the year 2050. Making the payroll tax fairer by



applying it to all income up to $150,000, instead of just $75,000,

as



now, would get us to 2065. Why gamble on privatization and a



colossal tax cut instead?

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Young workers could get slammed by Bush's plans. Social Security



privatization on top of a huge tax cut risks a budget nightmare-a



massive Social Security bailout-that would make the deficits of the



80s and early 90s look like petty change. Our actions throughout



this campaign will demonstrate our concerns.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to the Bush speech, 2030 Action mobilized activists in



California and Pennsylvania, and joined a coalition event in



Washington calling on Bush to "sign the pledge" to protect Social



Security (<a href="http://www.signthepledge.com" target="new">www.signthepledge.com</a>).

Following are several key



arguments designed to clarify debate about the future of Social



Security and its impact on young workers:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ECONOMICS OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND YOUNG WORKERS

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The core idea of privatization is that some workers will stop



paying their full Social Security contribution, and invest instead

in



the stock market. While the idea has superficial appeal, it courts



disaster for younger generations.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- If young workers stop paying into Social Security so they can



invest in stocks, somebody has to pay the piper. Despite reducing



Social Security's income dramatically, Bush promises no cuts for



current and "near" retirees. If these obligations were kept, a



"modest" privatization plan like Bush's would cost an extra one



trillion dollars over the next 10 years (Center on Budget and Policy



Priorities). Of course, Bush has already spent the budget surplus on



a colossal tax cut.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Privatization risks a massive government bailout-financed by



today's young workers. A plan like Bush's has only a 60 percent



chance of remaining solvent under "ideal conditions" (Employee



Benefits Research Institute). If economic projections turn out



differently, the entire house of cards will collapse-just as the



boomers retire-and today's young workers get the bill (benefit cuts,



massive debt, and a shredded safety net).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Benefit cuts for today's young workers will be enormous.



Investing one-sixth of payroll taxes into private accounts leaves



Social Security at least 20 percent short on its benefits (CBPP).



Since Bush does not propose cuts for current retirees, cuts will be



much higher than 20 percent for today's young workers and the



retirement age may also have to increase (Bush says he would consider



raising the age).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Privatization can never match what Social Security provides-a



rock solid guarantee that promotes economic security for everyone.



Social Security is our most important safety net-it's not just for



people who are lucky or know how to invest. Without Social Security,



millions of seniors, people with disabilities, survivors, and



children would live in poverty. Even with "average returns," many



will lose under privatization-and it's not fair to "average out" the



lives of real people.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PUBLIC OPINION ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND YOUNG WORKERS

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 2030 Center, a 501(c)3 affiliate of 2030 Action, has conducted



two polls with the national survey research firm Peter Hart Research



Associates. Important findings from a recent poll:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Young adults support using the surplus to strengthen Social



Security over paying for a tax cut. Young people want Social



Security to be there for them: 59 percent prefer strengthening Social



Security to providing a tax cut. Yet Gov. Bush's massive tax cut



leaves no funds for Social Security.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Young people place more importance on providing guaranteed



benefits than receiving a "higher rate of return" on their payroll



taxes. Young people say that "making sure that people receive a



decent, guaranteed monthly retirement benefit" is a higher priority



than "making sure that people receive a better rate of return" (55



percent vs. 39 percent). Yet Gov. Bush would trash the safety net



for privatization.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Privatization's benefit cuts are very unpopular with young



people. While some are attracted to the idea of private accounts in



isolation, they strongly oppose the reductions in Social Security's



guaranteed benefits that are required if young people stop



contributing fully to the Trust Fund. 76 percent of young Americans



oppose making a 20 percent reduction in guaranteed monthly benefits,



and 81 percent oppose raising the eligibility age for receiving



benefits. Gov. Bush must explain how he will finance promised



benefits.
