- June 7 - Twenty-five cruise lines received a survey today from the environmental group Bluewater Network, with 84 questions about how they handle the titanic amount of waste generated on their ships. The <a href="http://www.earthisland.org/bw/finalsurvey.pdf">Cruise Industry Environmental Information Survey</a> seeks to hold cruise companies, many of which have been caught illegally polluting the seas, accountable for their waste. The survey will also contribute to a process now underway at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to address pollution by cruise ships. </font>

The survey asks detailed questions about what types of management procedures and technologies are employed on their ships to handle and process wastes, and what, if any, specific environmental policies and strategies the cruise lines have implemented. The survey inquires about how each category of waste generated onboard, including sewage, solid waste, hazardous waste, air pollutants from ship smokestacks, oily bilge water, and "gray water" (waste water from showers, sinks, galleys and laundry), is treated and when and where it is discharged.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bluewater Network has been chipping away at the cruise industry to clean up its act in the wake of a rash of incidents of illegal dumping of oil, garbage and hazardous wastes into the ocean. Part of the organization's efforts have focused on bringing the problem of cruise ship pollution to the attention of the EPA. In March, Bluewater Network and 58 other environmental groups filed a petition with the EPA to address the numerous loopholes and exemptions in environmental laws that should be controlling pollution by cruise ships and to come up with ways to better monitor and regulate the renegade cruise industry. The EPA responded quickly by forming an interagency work group on cruise ship pollution, publishing a white paper on options to address the problem, planning public hearings for later this summer, and possibly issuing an Advance Notice for Proposed Rulemaking on regulation of cruise ship wastewater by the end of the year. The survey was designed to assist the EPA and the public in better understanding how the cruise industry is preventing the illegal dumping that has occurred far too frequently, and what further action may be required to ensure that it does not continue.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cruise industry has launched a public relations blitz to tout its improved environmental performance, but concerned organizations such as Bluewater Network want proof. Kira Schmidt, Bluewater Network's Cruise Ship Campaign Director, says "Our survey calls on individual cruise companies to 'show us the money.' If the cruise lines reply honestly and openly to our survey, it will be an important step towards rebuilding the industry's credibility in environmental matters, as well as providing invaluable information on an industry which has eluded public and regulatory scrutiny for too long." It will also show which companies are employing the best practices and technologies and establish a baseline from which the bar of cruise ship environmental policies can be raised. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bluewater requested the 25 cruise companies to return the completed survey by June 30. Bluewater will produce a report analyzing the results of the survey and issue a press release detailing its findings and recognizing those companies that participated. </font></p>
