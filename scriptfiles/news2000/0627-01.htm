- June 27 - By relying on an inappropriate test to award state college scholarships,

Michigan is denying deserving students whose race, ethnicity, and educational

disadvantages are factors in lower test scores, a coalition of civil rights organizations

charged today in a federal lawsuit. </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coalition, which includes the American Civil Liberties of Michigan, represents five

graduating seniors and the Michigan State Conference of the NAACP.  They are calling for

the State of Michigan to revise its selection criteria, allowing for a fairer method that

considers grade point average and other measures of achievement. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The State of Michigan has a chance here to fix or compensate for some of the problems in

our educational system," said Kary L. Moss, Executive Director of the ACLU of Michigan.

"Instead, officials are making it worse by using a selection criteria that everyone knows will

help least those who need it the most." </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's lawsuit is only the second such action in the nation challenging the use of

standardized tests as the sole criterion for making scholarship awards, Moss noted. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moss said the coalition is seeking an injunction requiring the state to immediately discontinue

use of the Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP) High School Test as the

sole criterion for awarding Michigan Merit Award Scholarships.  Others in the coalition are

the state NAACP, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and Trial

Lawyers for Public Justice. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lawsuit charges that the use of MEAP test scores discriminates against high school

students on the basis of race, ethnicity, and educational disadvantage.  The MEAP test has

never been validated as a means of assessing individual student achievement but rather was

designed to measure school performance. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By relying on the MEAP test to award scholarships, the state of Michigan is misusing the

test," Moss said. "All students should be judged fairly, by looking at the range of their

accomplishments as individuals, in the same way that college and universities evaluate

applicants." </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 34 percent of eligible white students qualified for scholarships in 1999, only 7 percent

of African American students, 20 percent of Hispanic students, and 19 percent of Native

American students taking all four MEAP tests qualified. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That is, 1 in 3 white test takers received a scholarship, whereas only 1 in 14 African

American test takers, 1 in 5 Hispanic test takers, and 1 in 5 Native American test takers

received a scholarship. Disparities also occurred among the state's school districts, with

students of wealthy suburban school districts consistently reporting higher test scores than

those in large urban or smaller rural districts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first lawsuit to bring such charges, <i>Sharif v. New York State</i>, challenged New York's

practice of using the Scholastic Achievement Test scores to grant the prestigious Regents

and Empire awards.  A federal court agreed that the practice violated Title IX of the 1964

Civil Rights Act because it had a discriminatory effect on girls and directed the state to

devise a non- discriminatory method of selection. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In today's case, <i>White v. Engler</i>, the groups are charging that the selection process violates

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits recipients of federal funding from

engaging in race discrimination, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth

Amendment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups are asking a federal district court to order the State to discontinue use of the

MEAP test to award merit scholarships, adopt new procedures for selection, and

reevaluate the scholarship eligibility of those students denied scholarships this year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They emphasized that they are not asking for those students who have been announced as

winners to lose those scholarships.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anita White, who lives in Ypsilanti, attends Belleville High School, and was denied a merit

scholarship, said that she wants all kids who deserve it to get scholarships to attend college.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A scholarship would have made a big difference in my choice of a college," said Ms.

White.  She  has a grade point average of 3.4, ranked 53 out of a class of 345, is a member

of the National Honor Society, and will be attending Central Michigan University in the fall. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Donald E. Heller, Assistant Professor of Education at the University of

Michigan, and an expert witness in the case, "The evidence is clear that the Michigan Merit

Award Scholarship program will do little to further the legislation's stated goal of increasing

access to higher education in Michigan." </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Based on what we know from existing research," he added, "a great number of these

awards are likely to go to students who will attend college anyway.  Many of these students

come from relatively wealthy school districts that already send a large percentage of their

high school graduates on to college." </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Michigan Merit Award Scholarship Program was created by the Legislature in 1999

and is funded by the state's share of revenues from the multi-state settlement agreement with

tobacco manufacturers.  Scholarship awards of $2,500 are available to graduating seniors

attending in-state colleges, and $1,000 to students attending out-of-state colleges.  Winners

are selected on the basis of obtaining minimum scores on the MEAP test.  The first

Michigan Merit Award Scholarships were based on the MEAP High School Tests

administered in Spring 1999; scholarship awards were announced last month for students

who will begin their post-secondary education in the Fall of 2000. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The students in the case are represented by Kary Moss, Executive Director, and Michael

Steinberg, Legal Director, of the ACLU of Michigan; Leonard Mungo, of the Michigan

State Conference of the NAACP; Pat Mendoza and Marta Delgado of the Mexican

American Legal Defense & Educational Fund; Michael Pitt, Peggy Goldberg Pitt, and Judy

Martin, as Cooperating Attorneys for the ACLU of Michigan, and Adele P. Kimmel of

Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, P.C. </font></p>
