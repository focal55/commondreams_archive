<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK  

- January 31 - The United Nations must act without delay on the

recommendations of its own Commission of Inquiry(COI) to set up an

international mechanism to investigate and try those responsible for

gross human rights violations in East Timor, Amnesty International said

today.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The human rights organization welcomed the recommendations of the

Commission of Inquiry on East Timor, which were officially released

today.The COI has asked the UN to set up two bodies, an independent

international investigatory body, and an international tribunal to deal

with cases of those accused by the investigators.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This is a step forward -- a long overdue one -- in the struggle for

justice for East Timorese victims," Amnesty International said.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The organization urged the international community to provide the

political and financial backing needed to support rapid and effective

implementation of the COI’s recommendations.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It is now over four months since East Timor was destroyed and its

people forced to flee. Each day brings new evidence of killings, rapes,

forced expulsions and other crimes committed during that period. But

those responsible remain at large, and free to repeat these atrocities

elsewhere," the human rights organization pointed out.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Therefore, investigations that provide a full account of the truth and

which determine individual criminal responsibility must take place as a

matter of urgency," it said.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The proposed investigatory body must include criminal investigators and

experts in forensics, ballistics, gender-based violence and issues

relating to children. It must also must be provided with sufficient

logistical, financial and political support, to carry out its work under

the auspices of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East

Timor (UNTAET), the human rights organization said.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Once sufficient evidence and testimonies have been gathered by

investigators to form the basis of prosecutions, the UN should establish

an international tribunal to bring the perpetrators to justice," Amnesty

International said.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While welcoming the willingness of Indonesian human rights investigators

to fix responsibility for crimes committed in East Timor, the human

rights organization appealed to Jakarta to cooperate with international

investigations.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"By participating in an international process of accountability,

Indonesia will strengthen its new and fragile democratic institutions,

and show the world that it is firmly committed to shedding its

authoritarian past."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Indonesian and international efforts to investigate crimes in East

Timor should not be seen as mutually exclusive, but as supporting and

reinforcing each other,"Amnesty International said.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Apart from East Timor, there are thousands of victims, both current and

past, of killings, "disappearance", torture and arbitrary arrests in

Aceh, Papua and elsewhere in Indonesia, Amnesty International pointed

out.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Their search for justice must not be forgotten by Indonesia. For long

term peace, stability and development, the new Indonesian government

must take immediate measures to improve the human rights situation and

to address all these issues of accountability," Amnesty International

said.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background:<br>

Following the orchestrated violence by pro-Indonesian militia and

Indonesian security forces against the people of East Timor, after they

had voted overwhelmingly for independence, a special session of the UN

Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution, on 27 September 1999,

calling upon the UN Secretary General to establish an international

Commission of Inquiry on East Timor.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The COI was asked to investigate possible violations of human rights and

acts which might constitute breaches of humanitarian law.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After a number of delays, the five members of the COI visited East Timor

and Jakarta from 25 November to 8 December 1999 and submitted a report

to the Secretary General a few weeks later. That report was made public

today.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An investigation team was also established in September 1999 by

Indonesia’s National Commission for Human Rights (Komnas HAM). This

body, called the Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations in

East Timor (KPP-HAM), also submitted its report and recommendations to

the Indonesian government today. It is reported to have recommended that

33 people, including six generals, should be further investigated by

Attorney-General Marzuki Darusman for their role in the mass violence in

East Timor.
