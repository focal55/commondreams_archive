- February 1 - News Advisory:

<p>WHAT:

<br>

'Polar bears' will be demonstrating outside the FTC because of

their concerns that the BP Amoco-ARCO merger increases Arctic



environmental threats and fuels global warming.

<p>WHERE:

<br>Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

<br>Pennsylvania Avenue at Sixth Street N.W.

<br>Washington D.C.

<p>WHEN:

<br>

1:30 p.m., Wednesday, Feb. 2, prior to the FTC Commissioners'

2 p.m. meeting, where it is expected they will vote on whether to



oppose BP Amoco's proposed merger with ARCO.

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, 10 Greenpeace activists dressed as polar

bears will demonstrate outside the Federal Trade Commission because



of their fears that the BP Amoco-ARCO mergers threatens yet greater



oil expansion into the arctic. The FTC is expected to be voting on



whether to oppose the merger. BP Amoco has, itself, declared that



a major reason for its mergers is "... increased opportunities for



the merged enterprise in remote regions of the world which have



recently become accessible to the international exploration and



production industry."

<p>The "polar bears" will carry placards reading: "Paws off the

Arctic", "Stop the Polar Meltdown", and "Go Solar", referring to a



shareholders resolution that Greenpeace, US PIRG and socially



responsible investors have forced to a shareholder vote at the next



BP Amoco Annual General Meeting in London on April 13.

<p>BP Amoco's oil expansion plans directly threaten the Arctic.

Their proposed Northstar project is the first-ever offshore oil



project in the Arctic Ocean using untested sub-seabed pipelines in



waters that ice up for some ten months of the year. Northstar poses



a one in four chance of an oil spill according to environmental



impact assessments.

<p>Arctic oil drilling and the increased burning of fossil fuels

particularly threaten polar bears. Because of global warming the



ice they live on is literally melting away. BP Amoco is one of the



world's largest fossil fuel producers, and hence a major



contributor to global warming.

<p>"Greenpeace hopes the FTC does not turn its back on Arctic

environmental concerns and cave in to pressures from BP Amoco,"



said Dr. Iain MacGill, senior analyst for Greenpeace.
