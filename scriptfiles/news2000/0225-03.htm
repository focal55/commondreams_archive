Editor of The Progressive, Rothschild said: "Bradley doesn't represent a

real alternative to Gore or McCain or Bush. He supports the death penalty.

He favors tougher sanctions on Iraq.  Along with Gore, he has been a leading

proponent of NAFTA and the World Trade Organization; and he, like Gore, has

carried water for the pharmaceutical companies. Bradley's health plan is a

far cry from universal care, and he leaves the insurance companies firmly in

command. He voted for aiding the contras in 1986. Bradley -- like Gore,

McCain and Bush -- is for bloated Pentagon spending and has not renounced

first use of nuclear weapons. While Bradley has been outspoken on issues of

race and poverty and welfare, he's toed the establishment line on almost

every other issue."<br>

Executive director of Clean Elections Institute, which was founded to

ensure that Arizona's 1998 landmark Citizens Clean Elections Act would be

implemented, Bozack said: "McCain's talk of breaking the iron triangle of

money, lobbyists and legislation is disingenuous. In 1998 he was absolutely

silent on the clean elections law here in his home state. He has since said

that he is not for public funding, which our law speaks to. The Arizona

clean elections law allows a qualified candidate to collect $5 contributions

and receive public funds once they reach a threshold, depending on the

office for which they are running -- for example, 200 contributor/supporters

for state legislature, 4,000 for the governorship. Not all candidates have

to participate in this system, but this allows people without moneyed

backers to actually run for major public office. McCain is not backing true

campaign finance reform since he just wants to limit how much lobbyists can

give to congressional candidates to $1,000. There's no cap on the amount the

candidates can raise or spend. It allows a kitchen cabinet of fundraisers to

line up countless $1,000 contributors. McCain-Feingold would have no effect

on how much McCain, Bush, Gore and Bradley have raised in 'hard money' so

far in this campaign."<br>

</A>Executive director of Citizens for Independent Public Broadcasting, Starr

said: "The influence-peddling scandal that put McCain on the front page last

month revealed more about him than his special relationship with media mogul

Lowell Paxson. The deal McCain pushed on the FCC required the transfer of a

Pittsburgh public television license to an ultraconservative religious

ministry totally unqualified to operate an educational frequency. McCain

blamed a slow-moving bureaucracy for the two-and-a-half-year delay in

approving the transfer applications, but the real reason was enormous

community opposition to the deal, including 40,000 letters and phone calls

to the FCC. McCain has opposed federal funding for public broadcasting so

apparently was not bothered by the consequences of the Paxson deal. However,

the public has a right to know."</font></div>
