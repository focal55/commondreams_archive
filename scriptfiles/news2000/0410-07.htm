- April 10 - As the World Bank braces for mass protests in the

streets of Washington, D.C., one attack is being launched from an

unexpected quarter -- the financial markets. 



<p>The World Bank raises 80% of its funds through bonds which are sold to

investors on private capital markets. Today is the public launch of a

boycott against World Bank bonds, which is being organized in eleven

countries, including South Africa, Ecuador, and Pakistan. Beverly Bell,

Director of the Center for Economic Justice said, "The fact that labor

unions, churches, universities, and municipalities own these bonds gives

ordinary citizens the opportunity to take power away from this destructive

institution." 



<p>"When investors realize that their money is being used to damage the

environment, destroy indigenous communities and trample human rights, they

will move their investments to less controversial projects," says Neil

Tangri of Washington, D.C.-based Essential Action. Even before the

campaign's official launch, several socially responsible investment firms

(including Trillium Assets Management of Boston and Progressive Assets

Management of New York) have pledged not to buy World Bank Bonds. In

addition, the city of Berkeley, California and Local  9423 of the

Communications Workers of America in San Jose, California have passed

resolutions to boycott the future purchase of World Bank bonds. Similar

resolutions have been initiated in communities and institutions throughout

the United States. 



<p>"We need to break the power of the World Bank over developing countries, as

the divestment movement helped break the power of the Apartheid regime over

South Africa; this is why we support the boycott of World Bank bonds," said

Dennis Brutus, a Patron of Jubilee 2000 South Africa and former South

African political prisoner.



<p>"Berkeley was the first city to boycott companies which did business in

South Africa. We led the way in going after corporations which are doing

business in Nigeria and Burma. Today we are proud to speak out against

environmental degradation and other destruction caused by the World Bank

with a similar action," said Pratap Chatterjee, a member of the Community

Environmental Commission of the City of Berkeley.



<p>Kevin Danaher of Global Exchange, the San Francisco based human rights

organization, said: "We aim to go after the World Bank's Achilles' heel,

which is its public reputation. The World Bank has come under increasing

criticism for its record on poverty reduction, human rights and the

environment." 



<p>The bond boycott is only one of multiple initiatives against the IMF and

World Bank, many of which will be launched in this week's protests in

Washington, DC. Also, the Meltzer Commission of the U.S. Congress recently

proposed strictly curtailing the Bank's functions and influence. 



<p>Dr. Vineeta Gupta, a medical doctor based in Punjab, India and one of the

organizers of the boycott, was blunt. "The World Bank is subjugating our

economic and social independence. It's time that we shut 

the Bank down, and this boycott is a great start."
