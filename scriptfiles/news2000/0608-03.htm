- June 8 - Bay Area activists set to speak at a teach-in on the

human rights and environmental impacts of the oil industry were arrested by

Canadian immigration officials last night at Calgary's international airport.



<p>The officials told Carwil James of Project Underground and Amit Srivastava

of the Transnational Resource & Action Center (TRAC) that they were

detained because of their involvement in activities critical of the World

Petroleum Congress-a global oil industry gathering.  



<p>"The Canadian government should be ashamed of itself for pre-empting free

speech in such a heavy-handed manner.  It appears that Canada is more

interested in protecting oil corporations than human rights," said Joshua

Karliner, Director of TRAC.



<p>Using a law that apparently allows them to deny entry to individuals with

two or more arrest convictions, Canadian officials detained James and

Srivastava as they arrived for the Counter Petroleum Congress where they

were scheduled to speak.  Both activists have been convicted of

misdemeanors in the past for engaging in non-violent civil disobedience.

Mr. James was most recently arrested at the demonstrations against the

World Trade Organization in Seattle.  Mr. Srivastava hasn't been arrested

in nine years.



<p>Immigration officials used this pretext to read through and copy paper and

electronic documents the activists carried, including Mr. Srivastava's year

long work plan.  



<p>"This detention is part of a systematic government effort at the behest of

oil corporations--something we are more used to witnessing in dictatorships

like Nigeria," said Danny Kennedy, Director of Project Underground.   "With

free trade, corporations move freely across border; people, especially

those critical of corporate globalization, apparently cannot."



<p>Both activists are people of color (Amit is Indian American and Carwil is

African American).  Other white activists with multiple civil disobedience

charges were apparently let into Canada without any problem. "While this

may be coincidence, we are also concerned that they may have been singled

out as activists of color" said Kennedy.



<p>The activists who were jailed over night and transported in chains and

shackles were given two choices:  either fight deportation and risk a

life-long ban from Canada or withdraw their application to enter the

country and leave immediately.  Mr. James is staying and fighting

deportation, working with Canadian immigration attorneys.  Mr. Srivastava

has withdrawn his application. He should be available to interview from 8

PST onward.
