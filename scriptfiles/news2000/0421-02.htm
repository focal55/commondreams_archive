- April 21 - The following was



released today by Physicians for Social Responsibility:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Physicians for Social Responsibility welcomes the ratification



by the Russian Duma of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).



The CTBT is a vital cornerstone of global efforts to prevent



the proliferation of nuclear weapons and a crucial step on the



road to their elimination.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PSR was founded with a campaign to end nuclear testing. Testing



poses a grave threat to public health by releasing radioactive



elements (such as Strontium-90), leading to the contamination of



babies through their mother's milk. For 40 years, PSR has been a



leader in the global struggle to end all nuclear testing.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CTBT was negotiated in 1996 and approved by overwhelming vote



in the UN General Assembly. 155 nations have now signed. 44 key



states, including the US, must ratify the treaty before it can enter



into force. The treaty bans all nuclear explosions, however small.

It



will be verified with a global monitoring regime that would increase



global security.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Russia is the third nuclear power to ratify the Treaty, after the



UK and France. Only the US and China, among the five acknowledged



nuclear weapon states, have failed to ratify the Treaty. This



ratification, along with ratification of START II by Russia and the

beginning of START III negotiations between Russia and the US will

be



a major boost for the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review



Conference that starts in New York on April 24.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the U.S. will now come under strong international



pressure to live up to its obligations and ratify the CTBT.



The U.S. Senate notoriously voted against ratification of the CTBT



in October 1999. The Senate's action undermined 40 years of



US policy to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. As a result,



the U.S. will be isolated at the NPT, alongside nuclear holdouts



India, Pakistan and Israel.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PSR, along with the international community of nations, regards



the CTBT as vital. This treaty will prevent current nuclear weapon



states from developing new generations of nuclear weapons. It will



also discourage potential nuclear proliferators from developing

weapons of mass destruction. Both are significant steps along the



road to fulfilling the mission of the NPT: the abolition of nuclear



weapons.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The public health consequences of nuclear testing have been



disastrous, so Russia must be congratulated for ratifying the CTBT,"



said Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., CEO and executive director of PSR.



"U.S. Senators who defeated the Treaty last year should hang



their heads in shame. The U.S. has forfeited its position as a



global leader in the reduction of nuclear dangers. Instead,



the Senate risks becoming a leader of rogue states in a nuclear



weapons free-for-all."
