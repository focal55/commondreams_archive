Professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts,

Dartmouth, former board member of Amnesty International and author of "The

Obstruction of Peace: The U.S., Israel, and the Palestinians," Aruri said

today: "The approach of Syria's Hafez Assad toward Israel was based on

equality, land for peace, an international framework, and normalization with

Israel after it fully withdraws from occupied territory. By contrast, Arafat's

approach -- despite lip service to the contrary -- is open-ended. It would

bypass the international framework; it involves the creation of a state

without sovereignty or contiguity, legitimizing apartheid, no return for the

refugees and no sharing of Jerusalem. With Assad's passing, the U.S. and

Israel feel that it will be easier to nudge Arafat towards even more

concessions. However, this falls short of the consensus of the 7.7 million

Palestinians in the world who are likely to consider such a settlement to be

illegitimate and non-binding. Arafat's disregard for Palestinian opinion is

also reflected by his trampling of the rule of law -- for example, his jailing

people for signing petitions talking about the corruption of his regime."

Executive director of Justice and Equality in Palestine/Israel, Hanauer said

today: "A viable, just peace must be based on international law, human

rights and relevant UN resolutions. On each of the major issues -- 

settlements, refugees, borders, Jerusalem, land and water -- the Palestinian position is

based on these laws, resolutions and rights. Rather than giving billions of

taxpayer dollars yearly to Israel, the U.S. needs to lead international

pressure on Israel to abide by international law, human rights and UN

resolutions which would achieve total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied

territories, equitable sharing of Jerusalem, the abolishment of most, if not

all, illegal Israeli settlements and the internationally recognized right of

return for 3 or 4 million Palestinian refugees who have been denied their

rights for 50 years by Israel. In the short run, Israel should stop house

demolitions, confiscation of Palestinian land and denial of water

resources."</font>
