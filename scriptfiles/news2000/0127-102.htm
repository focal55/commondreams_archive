- January 27 - The National Parks

Conservation Association (NPCA) sued the Bureau of Land Management



(BLM) today in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of



California for promoting the establishment of the nation's largest



landfill on the border of Joshua Tree National Park.

<p>"If constructed, the Eagle Mountain landfill will bring up to

20,000 tons of garbage per day to the doorstep of Joshua Tree



National Park, and do so for 117 years," said Brian Huse, NPCA's



Pacific Region Director. "I can think of no greater insult to our



nation's natural heritage." Despite strong opposition from the



National Park Service, BLM transferred public lands neighboring the



park to the dump developers and issued rights-of-way that allow



garbage to be hauled by train and truck across other BLM lands



critical to the survival of the threatened desert tortoise.

<p>BLM ignored the dangers the dump poses to its national park

neighbor, asserts NPCA's attorney. "Had the BLM done an honest job



of assessing the impacts these deals will have on Joshua Tree



National Park, the project would never have made it off the drawing



board," said Deborah Sivas, of Earthlaw. "BLM has fundamentally



ignored its responsibility to the public trust."

<p>The proposed Eagle Mountain dump would be surrounded by Joshua

Tree National Park wilderness. Established in 1936, Joshua Tree



protects some of the most pristine desert habitat in the world. So



unique is its flora and fauna, it is recognized as a United Nations



Biosphere Reserve. The dump is expected to degrade this sensitive



desert region, undermine wilderness protection, jeopardize the desert



tortoise, spoil views, and shatter the natural quiet. "The National



Parks System is considered the crowning conservation achievement of



our nation, and Joshua Tree is one of the jewels," said Huse. "BLM's



actions will not only tarnish Joshua Tree, but also the entire park



system."

<p>The specter of Eagle Mountain has loomed over Joshua Tree for

more than a decade. The site, a former iron mine owned by Kaiser



Steel, has remained dormant since 1983. Rather than reclaim the mine



site, as required by law, Kaiser is attempting to turn the mine site



and more than 2,000 acres of pristine desert into what could be the



nation's largest landfill.

<p>To be profitable, Kaiser and its subsidiary the Mine Reclamation

Corporation required additional land beyond the mine site. BLM



agreed and recently transferred 3,500 acres of public land



surrounding the mine to the developers in exchange for several



smaller Kaiser-owned parcels. In addition, BLM granted rights-of-way



for the transport of garbage across even more public land.

<p>NPCA is asking the Court to invalidate the environmental analysis

of the project, acknowledge that BLM has violated its own



regulations, and block the land exchange and rights of way.

<p>The National Parks Conservation Association is America's only

private nonprofit citizen organization dedicated solely to protecting



the U.S. National Park System. "Protecting Parks for Future



Generations," NPCA was founded in 1919 and today has more than



400,000 members. Earthlaw is a public interest, non-profit



environmental law group dedicated to defending the West's natural



resources. A library of national park information, including fact



sheets, congressional testimony, position statements, press releases



and media alerts, can be found on NPCA's World Wide Web site at
