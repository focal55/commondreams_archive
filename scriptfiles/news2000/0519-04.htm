- May 19 - The Peace Voter Fund will



begin airing hard-hitting anti-Star Wars television and newspaper ads



on Monday, May 22, as part of a campaign through Nov. 7 to educate



voters about the danger of building the $60 billion anti-missile



system.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The over $100,000 ad campaign on cable television and in daily



newspapers coincides with President Clinton's trip to Russia and



nationwide events organized by the 70,000-member grassroots



organization Peace Action.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The paid media's campaign encourages citizens to contact



candidates and incumbents, including Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.),



Rep. Jim Rogan (R-Calif.), candidates Mark Kirk (R) and Lauren Beth



Gash (D) in Illinois' District 10, Rep. Bob Franks (R-N.J.) and New



Jersey Democratic senatorial rivals Jim Florio and Jon Corzine. All



are asked to "pledge to vote no on Star Wars and to invest that money



in our schools, health care and kids."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The television ads begin with the earth surrounded by lasers,



followed by shots of failed missile tests and a voice-over: "There's



a nation at peace that's building new nuclear weapons and that



refuses to stop nuclear testing. No, its not a rogue nation. It's



the United States. And now the same Congress that voted against the



nuclear test ban wants to waste 60 billion dollars on the Star Wars



missile system -- a system top scientists say won't protect us, won't



work and the majority of Americans don't want."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Van Gosse, director of the Peace Voter Fund, said, "When President



Clinton and Congress speak about criteria for their decision on Star



Wars, they regularly disregard public opinion -- a factor we won't



let them ignore. We are building upon the opposition of the majority



of Americans and demonstrating our strength in states where our



members will have a big impact on the election." A recent ABC News



poll of 1,004 adults showed that 53 percent of Americans oppose



building even a limited missile system.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that even a limited



"National Missile Defense" would cost $60 billion. So far the



Clinton administration and Congress have committed nearly $13 billion



to the NMD program. "Considering the U.S. has spent $122 billion



over the past 30 years on Star Wars programs with zero results, new



money thrown at this proven boondoggle defies all common sense," said



Gordon Clark, executive director of Peace Action. "In the real world



there are greater priorities. The U.S. could meet critical needs in



healthcare and education by cutting off this spending spree."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Claims the proposed weapons system won't work stem from a recent



study by MIT and the Union of Concerned Scientists. The report



concluded that simple counter measures, like deploying decoy aluminum



balloons around incoming warheads, creating hundreds of targets,



would confuse anti-missile interceptors. (<a href="http://www.ucsusa.org">http://www.ucsusa.org</a> for



more information).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Peace Voter Fund is a political committee authorized by Peace



Action. To receive copy of the commercial in VHS or BETA format,
