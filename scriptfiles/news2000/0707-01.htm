- July 7 (6:00 AM PT) - The  

international environmental organization Greenpeace has just announced that 

a team of activists has entered Vandenberg Air Force base where the 

Pentagon is scheduled to test its proposed Star Wars missile system later 

today.  The activists, moving on foot, entered the base near the launch pad 

for the Minuteman II, scheduled for blast off at 19:01 this evening.



<p>The missile cannot be launched with the activists in this part of the base. 

 Equipped with survival gear and supplies for several days, they intend to 

stay inside the area as long as possible.



<p>Meanwhile the MV Arctic Sunrise continues its course toward waters offshore 

from Vandenberg Air Force base.  The captain and the crew are prepared to 

enter one of five hazard zones designated in a Notice to Mariners (NOTAM) 

on Tuesday.  Reuters news agency reports the U.S. Air Force as saying that 

the approaching vessel will be "dealt with".



<p>In 1989, a U.S. navy ship rammed the MV Greenpeace off the coast of Florida 

when it was challenging a Trident missile test.



<p>"Under the Law of the Sea Greenpeace has the right to peacefully protest 

the complete irresponsibility of the Star Wars program," said John Sprange 

aboard the Arctic Sunrise. "We will continue to use everynon-violent means 

to convince President Clinton to Stop Star Wars."



<p>Should it proceed, the Star Wars program will destroy existing nuclear 

disarmament treaties.  It will also provide additional justification to 

Russia and China to retain their existing nuclear arsenals, while 

developing new nuclear weapons that can penetrate any future missile 

shield.



<p>NOTE TO EDITORS:<br>

The Greenpeace activists inside the base are currently attempting to 

transmit footage and photos from their location inside the base. These will 

be offered to international news agencies.
