- May 16 - The following was released



today by the Violence Policy Center:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National Rifle Association (NRA) Executive Vice President



Wayne LaPierre has once again demonstrated the core values of



the NRA's leadership: hypocrisy and racism. As a guest on CBS



News' Face the Nation this past Sunday, LaPierre was asked about



a recent column he wrote for American Rifleman in which he stated:



"There are many politicians willing to sacrifice the Second



Amendment as the first step in the homogenization of American



culture."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Denying that the statement contained "racial overtones," LaPierre



claimed that the NRA "has a proud relationship with the



African-American community." Research by the Violence Policy Center



(VPC), however, finds that LaPierre's "homogenization" concerns are



simply the latest in a long line of racist statements by NRA



officials. For example:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Current NRA President Charlton Heston, in defending "white



pride" in a speech before the Free Congress Foundation, urged the



audience to "draw your sword and fight" against a variety of



opponents, including "blacks who raise a militant fist with one hand



while they seek preference with the other." He told his listeners,



"Mainstream America is counting on you."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Current NRA Board Member Jeff Cooper, in dismissing urban gun



victims - the majority of which are young black males - wrote in



Guns &amp; Ammo that "the consensus is that no more than five to



ten people in a hundred who die by gunfire in Los Angeles are any



loss to society. These people fight small wars amongst themselves.



It would seem a valid social service to keep them well-supplied



with ammunition." Cooper also refers to persons of Japanese



ancestry as "Nips" and has suggested calling black South Africans



from the Gauteng province "Oran-gautengs."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Current NRA Research Coordinator Paul Blackman, echoing



Cooper's views, has written that "studies of homicide victims --



especially the increasing number of younger ones -- suggest they are



frequently criminals themselves and/or drug addicts or users. It is



quite possible that their deaths, in terms of economic consequences



to society, are net gains."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Current NRA Board Member Ted Nugent, commenting on South



Africa, has observed that "apartheid isn't that cut and dry. All men



are not created equal."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If the NRA's leadership, with their new ad campaign, is trying to



prove they are America's mainstream, they have failed miserably. The



NRA officials' extremist rhetoric only proves that racism is still



alive and well in the top ranks of their organization," VPC Executive



Director Josh Sugarmann said today.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NRA will conduct its annual meeting in Charlotte, NC, this



weekend, from May 19-23. For more information visit the VPC's web



site at <a href="http://www.vpc.org">www.vpc.org.</a>
