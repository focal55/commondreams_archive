Republican primary this weekend - a state rocked by controversy over the

Confederate battle flag's presence over the state house - evidence is

mounting of a questionable relationship between Bush and far-right

neo-Confederate groups, according to an article published today by a leading

Southern journal.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The story, published on the website of Southern Exposure magazine,

<a href="http://www.southernstudies.org/southernexposure.asp" target="_new">http://www.southernstudies.org/southernexposure.asp</a>, and which will be featured in the print version of the

magazine in early March, reveals that Governor Bush has "long-standing close

ties with - and offers financial support to - neo-Confederate groups and

causes."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among the evidence of Bush's questionable associations documented in the

story:



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* * * Governor Bush is listed as a donor to the Museum of the Confederacy,

based in Richmond, Virginia, as a supporter of the Museum's annual ball - an

event held in a slave hall, which has drawn fire for its celebration of the

Southern Confederacy.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* * * A letter on Texas Governor stationary, dated January 1, 1996, shows

Gov. Bush congratulating the 100th anniversary of the United Daughters of

the Confederacy - a group known for glorifying the Confederate past, and

which has been criticized for sponsoring books by extreme-right authors who,

among other claims, downplay the harms of the slave trade.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* * * Bush also penned an official state letter honoring the Sons of

Confederate Veterans in 1996, a group which claims to be mainstream, but

which has repeatedly offered a platform for avowedly white supremacist

organizations like the Council of Conservative Citizens.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This puts Bush's silence on the South Carolina battle flag controversy into

perspective," says editor Chris Kromm, editor of Southern Exposure and

author of the story. "Gov. Bush has gone out of his way to embrace the

agenda of the Old South - a position that, if made public, would alienate

most forward-looking Southerners, not to mention the rest of the country."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most disturbing, Kromm says, is Bush's support for the Museum of the

Confederacy ball, held at the Tredgar Iron Works in Richmond, Virginia,

where slaves worked to build war material for the Confederate Army. Each

year, the ball draws hundreds of all-white guests in period costume to a

hall festooned with Confederate flags.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1996, the ball drew "astonishment and outrage" from black leaders in the

city - which is 55% African-American - according to the New York Times.

Backers said the ball was designed "not to celebrate the era of slavery, but

to tell a story," the Times reported. But detractors note the Museum and the

ball show clear sympathy for the Confederate cause. The title of the 1996

event, "Bonnie Blue Ball," was an open celebration of the Bonnie Blue flag,

the flag of secession of the Confederacy.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Critics also point to the Museum's selling of far-right literature, and the

appointment of leading new-Confederate ideologue Ludwell Johnson as a museum

fellow in 1993 - author of "Is the Confederacy Obsolete?" and other calls

for the revival of the old Southern system.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Documents made available to Southern Exposure show that Bush was listed as a

"Donor to Fund Raising Events" in the Museum's Annual Report. The Museum has

clarified that Bush did not actually give money, but that he did write a

fundraising letter to garner funds for the ball.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Bush not only endorsed the pro-Confederate ball," Kromm observes, "he

offered to raise money for it - one of the strongest signs of support a

public figure can offer."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush's support for the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of

Confederate Veterans also comes under fire in the article. While these

groups claim a mission of promoting "heritage, not hate," the magazine

offers examples from the groups' histories that support the view of Dr.

James McPherson - a Yale historian and Civil War expert - that "[These

groups] are dedicated to celebrating the Confederacy and rather

thinly-veiled support for white supremacy."
