- April 3 - On April 4, thousands of activist students around the nation will 

          participate in solidarity actions to support workers who are standing 

          up for a living wage, fair working conditions and a voice on the job. 

        </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Their actions are part of a firestorm of support for working people's 

          issues among university students &#151; one which is historically significant 

          and important to today's unions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Student activism itself is certainly not new. Students have always 

          shown an ability to hold a mirror up to society, and force it to face 

          the truth about its flaws. What is new is that today's students are 

          organizing and mobilizing for workers' rights and on issues of economic 

          justice. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The students have chosen the anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King's 

          death for their day of action. Dr. King died while supporting Memphis 

          public works employees like L.C. Reed.<strong> </strong>Reed was part 

          of a sanitation strike that began shortly after two workers were crushed 

          in a malfunctioning dumpster. In a still-segregated South, Reed's and 

          his co-workers' struggle grew out of the same impulses that fueled the 

          civil rights movement's overall drive for economic and racial justice. 

          Workers wanted a fair pay system, equal treatment, and a safe workplace, 

          guaranteed in a union contract.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This week, students will mobilize across the nation to support workers 

          who, like Reed, want to improve their lives by standing together. Students 

          will rally behind another group of sanitation workers in Richmond, Indiana 

          who are fighting the same fight as the Memphis workers, thirty years 

          later. They will back Sedexho Marriott workers who want a voice at work 

          &#151; workers they see every day, serving food in their school cafeteria. 

          They will sleep-out for a living wage for local workers, march against 

          sweatshops, and serve lunch and coffee to university employees to express 

          their gratitude for their service. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Today's campus activism is at the heart of today's union movement. 

          The AFL-CIO strongly endorses this day of action, and applauds the students' 

          efforts. Their energy, enthusiasm and idealism are an inspiration to 

          us all.<br>
