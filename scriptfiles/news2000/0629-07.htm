- June 29 - The Senate&#146;s approval of a House bill to force the

disclosure of contributions and expenditures used by so-called &quot;Section 527 Stealth

PACs&quot; to influence elections represents a move toward a more accountable campaign

finance system, but Congress still has a long way to go, Public Citizen representatives

said today.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill, which the House passed early Wednesday morning, was approved by the Senate

this morning by a vote of 92-6. The bill will now be presented to President Clinton.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill targets those new vehicles formed under Section 527 of the federal tax code

that collect secret, unlimited contributions and have the declared primary purpose of

influencing elections. Scores of these tax-exempt private groups, which come from all

sides of the political spectrum, are raising and spending tens of millions of dollars to

influence the 2000 federal elections without publicly reporting their existence,

sponsorship, receipts, contributions or expenditures. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not only private groups (from the prescription drug industry&#146;s Citizens for Better

Medicare to the Sierra Club), but even the candidates themselves are getting into the act.

For example, in this election cycle, dozens of congressional and presidential candidates

have formed section 527 &quot;State Leadership PACs&quot; to collect unlimited &quot;soft

money&quot; checks that candidates are prohibited from receiving via their campaign

committees and federal Leadership PACs. Much of this money is being used to influence

federal elections through phony issue ads that really favor or oppose candidates, partisan

voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, political polling and travel, and

transfers of funds to national party soft money accounts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is an important -- but modest -- first step on the road to comprehensive campaign finance reform,&quot; said Frank

Clemente, director of <a href="http://citizen.org/congress/">Public Citizen&#146;s

Congress Watch</a>. &quot;Congress still has a long way to go to clean up the campaign

finance mess. The next step is a comprehensive ban on soft money, which it ought to

accomplish before it closes up shop in the fall.&quot;</font>
