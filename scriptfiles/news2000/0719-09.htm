- July 19 - In a move believed to be unprecedented in post-Soviet Russia, the FSB

     (Russia's secret police and the KGB's succesor) has appealed the

     Supreme Court acquittal of environmentalist Aleksandr Nikitin to the

     full presidium of the Supreme Court.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Nikitin is in Washington, DC, where he had planned to celebrate his

     recent victory over charges of espionage with the international groups

     that had aided him throughout his trials, and to meet with U.S.

     officials about the continuing environmental problems in Russia.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Nikitin will be available to the press at three events on Thursday,

     July 20.  In the morning, there will be a breakfast briefing at Radio

     Free Europe and a briefing for Commission on Security and Cooperation

     in Europe in the Rayburn House Office Building. In the afternoon,

     Sierra Club will be giving Nikitin and the Bellona Foundation it's

     highest international honor, the Earthcare Award at a reception hosted

     by Congressman Sam Gejdenson.

     The Sierra Club and Amnesty International are extremely concerned for

     Nikitin and for the message this move by the FSB conveys about the

     prospects for democracy and environmental protection in Russia. Sierra

     Club, Amnesty International and the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews

     are hosting Nikitin's visit to Congressional and Administration

     officials in Washington this week.

     Nikitin was arrested when he wrote chapters of a Bellona Foundation

     report detailing the environmental consequences of Russia's aging

     fleet of nuclear submarines.  The FSB attempted to charge that Nikitin

     had divulged state secrets. he was first acquitted in a St. Petersburg

     court on December 29, 1999, a ruling that was upheld this April by a

     three judge Supreme Court panel.  His new hearing is scheduled for

     August 2.</font>

Nikitin case goes to Supreme Court

Nikitin not informed about hearing date

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

July 19, 2000 -- After being rebuffed four times by various Russian courts,

the Prosecutor General's office is trying again to convict internationally

renowned environmentalist Aleksandr Nikitin.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

In a surprise appeal received by Nikitin today, the Prosecutor General's

office (Attorney General) requests that the case be re-investigated, after

more than four years of investigations, harassment and legal proceedings. The

prosecutors revisited Soviet-era laws to resuscitate this case.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Nikitin had been acquitted by the St. Petersburg City Court on December 29,

1999, and the verdict was confirmed on appeal on the April 17 this year by a

three-judge panel of the Supreme Court. The City Court had previously

criticized the investigators -- Russia's secret police and KGB successor FSB

-- for shoddy work and rejected the indictment in October 1998. This verdict

was upheld by the Supreme Court in February of 1999.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The verdicts in favor of the former submarine captain has been historical, as

it vindicates his work of mapping the dramatic nuclear situation in North

West Russia for the Bellona Foundation, against the treason charges of the

state security apparatus.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The case started in October of 1995, when Bellona's office and Nikitin's

apartment were ransacked.  On February 6, 1996, the secret police stormed in

early in the morning and arrested Nikitin, who had to spent the next 10 month

in an FSB prison in St. Petersburg.  Subsequently, the case was sent back and

forth between courts and the FSB for further investigations eight times. Six

court hearings, including two for procedural matters at the Constitutional

and City Court level and the four mentioned above, dealt with the case.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The Supreme Court panel's verdict is a landmark step forward for the Russian

legal system, as it evaluated the law rather than rubber-stamping the charges

of the secret police. The Supreme Court also rejected the use of secret

decrees and laws enacted after the alleged criminal activities had occurred.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Niktin's passport was returned to him only one month ago, after the Supreme

Court verdict upholding his acquittal. He arrived in the United States last

week to receive his Goldman award, often called the Nobel Prize for the

Environment, awarded to him in 1997, when he was not allowed to travel to the

ceremony.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

This week, Nikitin will meet with a number of Members of Congress, State

Department and Clinton Administration officials.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

He learned about the appeal during a Wednesday meeting in Washington with

Amnesty International, Sierra Club and the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The Prosecutor General's appeal will be heard August 2, 2000. He claims the

case should be sent back for further investigation. If approved, Nikitin

will face many more rounds in court in this Kafkaesque process.
