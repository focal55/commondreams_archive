<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- May 3 - A coalition of progressive, conservative and consumer organizations,

media scholars and child advocates sent a letter today to President Bill

Clinton urging him to cancel his appearance on Primedia's Channel One,

scheduled for May 4.  The letter follows.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear President Clinton:



	</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 4th, you are scheduled to conduct a televised "Webside Chat" on

Primedia's Channel One, an in-school marketing company that promotes

violent entertainment and other commercial fare to its captive audience

of about eight million schoolchildren.  Your appearance on Channel One

is a tacit endorsement of that corporation's efforts to infuse the

nation's classrooms with the degraded values of the commercial culture,

violent entertainment included.  We urge you to reconsider.



	</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent months, for example, Primedia's Channel One has shown ads for

violent movies such as Supernova, The Mummy and The World is Not

Enough.  It uses the public schools and the compulsory schooling laws to

corral a captive audience of impressionable children for these

commercial enticements.



	</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following the school shootings in Pearl, West Paducah, Jonesboro,

Springfield and Littleton, many parents are worried about school

violence.  The last thing they expect is that the public schools will

become amphitheaters for the promotion of violent movies. 



	</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. President, you have rightly criticized the marketing of violence to

our children, and have asked the Federal Trade Commission and the

Justice Department to investigate it.  



	</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We know we can prevent more youth violence if we work together," you

said on June 1, 1999.  "Of course, the responsibility begins at home. It

must be reinforced and supported at schools..."



	</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Channel One directly contradicts this effort.  It uses the public

classrooms to promote body obsession and materialism as well as

violence, which are huge problems for children.  Few parents send their

kids to school each day with the hopes they will be subjected to such

values.



	</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is not fitting for you, our nation's chief executive, to so publicly

embrace this corruption of the purpose of the public schools.  Please

reconsider your appearance on Channel One, for the good of our children.



</font>
