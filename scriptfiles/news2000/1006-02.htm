- October 6 - Long-time consumer advocate and Green Party

presidential candidate Ralph Nader today joined a long list of farmers,

consumers, environmentalists, and scientists demanding a moratorium on

the use of genetically engineered (GE) products in food.



<p>“Genetic engineering of food has far outrun the science that must be

its first governing discipline. Many unknowns attend the insertion of

genes across species, from ecological risks to food allergies. These

unknowns beg for investigation,” stated Nader in a recent letter to the

Sierra Club.



<p>The call to action, initiated by the Genetically Engineered Food Alert—a

coalition of environmental and consumer groups—demands that genetically

engineered food ingredients or crops should not be allowed on the market

unless:



<p>1) Independent safety testing demonstrates they have no harmful effects

on human health or the environment;



<p>2) They are labeled to ensure the consumer's right-to-know; and



<p>3)  The biotechnology corporations that manufacture them are held

responsible for any harm.



<p>Nader suggested that a fourth condition be added to the list, that

genetically engineered food ingredients or crops should not be allowed

on the market unless “there are significant benefits for human needs not

available outside this technology.”



<p>“Genetic engineering represents nothing less than a

going-out-of-business sale on genetic diversity,” said Nader.



<p>In addition to outcry from consumers, a growing number of farmers and

farm organizations have been voicing opposition to GE foods. In November

of last year, the National Family Farm Coalition issued a ‘Farmer's

Declaration on Genetic Engineering in Agriculture’ which calls for many

of the same demands. “For too long farmers have had their management

practices dictated by corporate agribusiness. Consolidation in

agribusiness has led to fewer options for seed and inputs and fewer

markets for farmers to sell to.” said Nader.

<p>“The Clinton-Gore Administration has been extremely cozy with the GE

industry and Bush promises only to be more so. Why is an inadequately

tested technology—with so much potential for causing irreversible

environmental harm—being imposed on an unwilling public and foisted upon

a dis-empowered farming community? This is yet another example of

corporate agribusiness interests pitting farmers against consumers,”

added Nader.



<p>Coalition members of the Genetically Engineered Food Alert include: the

State Public Interest Research Groups, the National Environmental Trust,

the Center for Food Safety, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade

Policy, the Organic Consumers Association, Friends of the Earth, and the

Pesticide Action Network of North America.
