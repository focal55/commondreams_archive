- May 4 - Results from a recent poll commissioned by the Council for a Livable World

show that national missile defense is an extremely low priority for

Americans.  Indeed, defense issues in general are not salient.  Moreover, a

majority of Americans also prefer waiting until testing of a missile

defense system is complete before deciding whether to deploy it.  



<p>Missile Defense Is A Relatively Low Priority For Most Americans



<p>At a time when missile defense is at the tip of every Republican

politician's tongue, it appears that once again, the American public has

shown that it does not care.  It is clear that defense issues in general,

and missile defense in particular, are low priorities for Americans.

Improving education (28%), protecting Social Security and Medicare (14%)

and improving health care coverage (14%) are all significantly higher

priorities than defense-related matters.  Even fighting crime/drugs (13%),

maintaining economic growth (8%), cracking down on illegal guns (6%), and

cutting taxes (6%) rank higher than missile defense and a strong military

on the nation's list of priorities.  



<p>Only 4% of Americans believe that maintaining a strong military is the

nation's top priority, and a mere 1% believe building a national missile

defense system to be the most important issue.



<p>A Large Majority Support Postponing Deployment Until Testing Has Been

Completed



<p>After arguments both for and against deploying a national missile defense

system this year were presented, a majority support waiting until after the

19 tests are completed.  59% (43% strongly) favor waiting until testing is

complete while only 20% (16% strongly) favor deciding this year.

One-in-five are undecided (21%).  Support crosses demographic lines, with

large majorities of both men (59%), women (58%), whites (59%), and

non-whites (63%) favor completing tests.  



<p>Findings at Odds with Political Grandstanding



<p>The polls findings are ironic, given how the Republicans are trying to use

the issue to paint the Democrats as soft on defense, and the Democrats are

reacting as if the public cares.  In fact, one of the main reasons

President Clinton may decide in favor of deployment this fall is protect Al

Gore from this "soft on defense" attack.  Clinton should wake up and smell

the coffee; the American public will not abandon the Democratic party

because of this issue.



<p>Additionally, not only do Americans not vote on missile defense, but the

majority do not actually want it.  A new ABC.com poll shows that a narrow

majority (53-44%) do not think the U.S. should build a national missile

defense.  This is further evidence that politicians have little to fear

from taking a strong stand against this costly, unworkable, security

damaging system.



<p>Complete poll data and analysis will be posted shortly at: <a href="http://www.clw.org/bmd.html">www.clw.org/bmd.html</a>
