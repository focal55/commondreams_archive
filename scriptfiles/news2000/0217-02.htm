          YORK - February 17 - </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amnesty 

          International today called for a new trial in the case of Mumia Abu 

          Jamal on the basis that his original trial was deeply flawed. </font> 

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is not 

            about an issue affecting the life of just one man. This is about justice 

            -- which affects us all. And justice, in this case, can only be served 

            by a new trial," Amnesty International said. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> After many years 

            of monitoring the case and an exhaustive review of the original documents, 

            Amnesty International has concluded that the proceedings under which 

            Mumia Abu-Jamal was tried, convicted and sentenced to death fail to 

            reach the minimum international standards for fair trials. </font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Amnesty International 

            has chosen this moment to publish the results of their painstaking 

            review of the case because Abu-Jamal's life and the fairness of the 

            judicial system are now, more than ever, in the balance," the organization 

            said. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Without a new 

            trial, the federal courts are Mumia Abu-Jamal's final opportunity 

            to have many of the troubling issues in his case addressed. However, 

            the 1996 Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act severely limit 

            the federal courts' ability to guarantee a defendants' rights. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amnesty International 

            fears the act has increased the number of executions that were in 

            violation of international laws and standards governing the use of 

            the death penalty. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The organization 

            is also alarmed that the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police Officers 

            is actively campaigning for the execution of Mumia Abu-Jamal. </font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Police officers 

            and their representatives should be impartial enforcers of the law. 

            Amnesty International understands the anguish officers must feel when 

            a fellow officer dies in the line of duty but their attempt to pressure 

            the judicial system to execute Mumia Abu-Jamal is inappropriate," 

            the organization stressed. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Abu-Jamal's case 

            illustrates broader problems in the judicial system, particularly 

            those that involve the administration of the death penalty. </font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Given the contradictory 

            and incomplete evidence in the trial transcript, Amnesty International 

            cannot take a position on Abu-Jamal's guilt or innocence," Amnesty 

            International said. "In calling for a new trial we are not ignoring 

            the pain of the relatives and colleagues of Officer Daniel Faulkner, 

            for whom we have the greatest sympathy."</font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Nevertheless, 

            Mumia Abu-Jamal's inadequate legal representation at his 1982 trial, 

            the fact that the judge appeared more concerned with expediting the 

            trial than with ensuring justice, the politisation of the judicial 

            process, and the possible bias of the appeal courts has lead Amnesty 

            International to conclude that only a new and fair trial could prevent 

            the execution of a man who has not been proved guilty in a fair trial," 

            Amnesty International stressed. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The prosecution 

            of Mumia Abu-Jamal was built upon three pillars:</font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> the testimony 

            of eyewitnesses; </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ballistics evidence; 

            </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and an alleged 

            confession by the accused. After a thorough study of original trial 

            documents, Amnesty International has determined that the veracity 

            of each of these three pillars is in sufficient doubt to make a new 

            trail essential.</font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Key concerns</b><br>

            톂he three prosecution eyewitnesses substantively altered their description 

            of what they saw between their original statements to police and their 

            trial testimony. </font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">톂he witnesses 

            were confused and unclear about the height of the shooter, what clothes 

            he was wearing, in which hand he held the gun, and whether he ran 

            away from the scene.</font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">톂he alleged 

            confession, reportedly crucial to the jury's decision and sentencing, 

            was first reported more than two months after the shooting.</font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">톂he alleged 

            confession directly contradicted the contemporaneous notes of one 

            of the alleged witnesses to the confession (a police officer) that 

            "the negro male made no comments." This evidence was not put before 

            the jury.</font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">톂here is also 

            evidence that witnesses were offered inducements to alter their testimony 

            in favour of the prosecution's</font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> version of events. 

            This evidence was not put before the jury.</font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">텹ack of adequate 

            ballistic tests to determine whether Abu-Jamal's gun had recently 

            been fired. It was not determined, for instance, whether there was 

            residue on his hands from firing a gun. </font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> Additional 

            information and background</b><br>

            Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases as a 

            violation of human rights. The organization is therefore calling for 

            a new trial in which should preclude the re-imposition of a death 

            sentence. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Mumia Abu-Jamal, 

            black, was convicted and sentenced to death in July 1982 for the murder 

            of white police officer Daniel Faulkner on 9 December 1981. He has 

            consistently maintained his innocence. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Amnesty International 

            can take no position on the guilt or innocence of Mumia Abu-Jamal. 

            The organization has expressed concern however, over the activities 

            of a government counter-intelligence programme which appeared to list 

            Abu Jamal among its targets. Amnesty International is also concerned 

            that political statements attributed to him as a teenager were improperly 

            used by the prosecution in its efforts to obtain a death sentence 

            against him. </font>
