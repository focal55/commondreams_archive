          - February 15 - Welcome NARAL members, friends, and Vice President Gore. 

          Thank you for being with us today. <br>

          <br>

          We are here because we believe the freedom to choose is a fundamental 

          American right. A right that stands alongside freedom of religion, freedom 

          of speech, and the right to vote as hallmark American values. We are 

          here because that freedom is at risk. It is at risk from an anti-choice 

          Congress and it is at risk from the threat of an anti-choice President. 

          We are here to issue a call to action to every pro-choice voter in our 

          nation: we must work together as never before to elect a pro-choice 

          President. <br>

          <br>

          This Presidential election is a test of values. The value we put on 

          a woman's life&#151;the value we put on her choice to bear a child&#151;the 

          value we put on rearing that child. Values like freedom and equality 

          that are non-negotiable. Values and principles that must bring us together. 

          Values and principles that must guide our votes. Today, these very values 

          and principles guide our endorsement. <br>

          <br>

          We stand here proudly today to announce NARAL's endorsement of Al Gore 

          in the Democratic race for President of the United States. We know that, 

          as President Al Gore will be a strong, effective, and determined leader 

          in the fight to protect a woman's right to choose. He has fought with 

          us on the front lines in the past. We know we can count on him in the 

          future. <br>

          <br>

          Al Gore has fought hard for the rights of women to make their own reproductive 

          decisions. He has stood firm against those who would tear down those 

          rights. In the face of serious threats to reproductive choice&#151;in 

          tough, tough fights, Al Gore stood strong time and time again to defend 

          a woman's right to choose. <br>

          <br>

          Al Gore understands that the freedom to choose is fundamental to the 

          dignity and equality of women and to the health of their families. He 

          understands that choice, and private medical decisions, must be just 

          that, private choices women make without government interference&#151;without 

          violence, harassment, and intimidation. <br>

          <br>

          Every American who has fought to defend this right, every American who 

          believes as we do that we cannot go back to the days before <i>Roe v. 

          Wade</i>, must understand the stark choice in this election. Women's 

          lives, health and rights are at risk. The freedom to choose is far too 

          important to be squandered as merely a wedge between pro-choice candidates. 

          The threat from Republican anti-choice Presidential candidates is too 

          real. <br>

          <br>

          The next President will likely appoint two, perhaps three Supreme Court 

          Justices and countless federal judges. Imagine the appointments made 

          by an anti-choice President: enough to overturn <i>Roe v. Wade</i> and 

          allow states to enact severe and sweeping restrictions on women's reproductive 

          rights. Imagine the Executive Orders. The legislation that would be 

          signed. The Cabinet appointments. The spectre of these threats should 

          compel us to action. <br>

          <br>

          Both of the Republican frontrunners, Senator John McCain and Governor 

          George W. Bush, are anti-choice and the election of either of them would 

          change the course of women's lives. <br>

          <br>

          John McCain, in his own words, said that he believes <i>Roe v. Wade</i> 

          should be overturned and abortion should be illegal. Only three months 

          ago, Senator McCain introduced a bill that would bring back the notorious 

          domestic "gag rule" to deny women information about all of their reproductive 

          health options, compromising women's ability to make fully informed 

          decisions. This year alone, Governor Bush, along with Michigan's Governor 

          Engler, signed more anti-choice provisions into law than any other Governor 

          in the U.S. Women and pro-choice voters must understand that both candidates 

          have publicly stated that <i>Roe v. Wade</i> went too far&#151;that 

          both candidates will use the power of the Presidency to end legal abortion 

          and take away a woman's right to choose. <br>

          <br>

          There is too much at stake in the 2000 elections-the fight for reproductive 

          freedom is the fight for women's equality and rights. The threat to 

          that freedom is too great to be used as a divisive political weapon. 

          The underlying values and principles of choice must be a unifying force 

          in this country. They must be used to energize Americans for the fight 

          ahead to elect a pro-choice President&#151;and our choice is Al Gore.
