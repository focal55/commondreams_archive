          - February 16 - The world's foremost authority on pandas and a coalition 

          of Central American conservation groups are this year's co-winners of 

          the prestigious J. Paul Getty Wildlife Conservation Prize, the World 

          Wildlife Fund announced today.</font> 

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The annual prize, 

            which this year carries with it an award of $100,000, is being shared 

            by Prof. Pan Wenshi, China's leading authority on the conservation 

            of giant pandas, and the Trinational Alliance for the Gulf of Honduras, 

            a coalition of nine conservation groups from Belize, Guatemala and 

            Honduras.</font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Getty Prize, 

            which WWF administers on behalf of the family of the late J. Paul 

            Getty, honors those whose contributions to conservation have been 

            pioneering and substantial - words that certainly describe this year's 

            distinguished winners," said Kathryn S. Fuller, president of World 

            Wildlife Fund-US.</font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Director of the 

            Giant Panda and Wildlife Conservation Research Center at Peking University, 

            Pan Wenshi was chosen both for his cumulative achievements on behalf 

            of panda conservation over a career spanning nearly 40 years and for 

            his most recent efforts to convince the Chinese government to impose 

            a logging moratorium in the Changqing area of the northern Qinling 

            mountains, an important panda habitat.</font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Prof. Pan has 

            contributed enormously to our understanding of the giant panda," said 

            Ginette Hemley WWF vice president for species conservation. "It was 

            Prof. Pan, for instance, who first proved that in contrast to captive 

            pandas, pandas in the wild reproduce at a relatively high rate comparable 

            to that of the American black bear," she noted.</font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> One of biggest 

            threats to the panda today remains habitat loss from logging and other 

            economic activities. But Prof. Pan's successful campaign for a moratorium 

            on logging in part of the Qinling mountains led to the establishment 

            of a new reserve that has secured the survival of the 80 pandas living 

            there. "It has been a long and hard journey to get to the point where 

            we can be guardedly optimistic about the panda's fate in the wild. 

            Prof. Pan has been at the forefront of this struggle from the beginning," 

            Fuller said.</font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Founded in 1995, 

            the Trinational Alliance for the Gulf of Honduras (TRIGOH) has worked 

            tirelessly and successfully to overcome the national divisions that 

            have long stymied effective conservation in the Gulf of Honduras. 

            Consolidating a trinational network of coastal and marine protected 

            areas, the alliance has helped to reduce the risk of hazardous spills 

            in the Gulf of Honduras, promoted ecoregional fisheries management 

            and expanded public awareness of the region's endangered species, 

            particularly the manatee.</font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In only four 

            years, the alliance has had an extraordinary impact on a biologically 

            rich but beleaguered area. And what is so extraordinary about this 

            accomplishment is that it has been done with only modest support from 

            the region's governments," Fuller said. "Working together, the nine 

            private conservation groups that make up the alliance have effectively 

            pooled their resources to protect this wonderfully diverse area," 

            Fuller said.</font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Fuller will present 

            the Getty Prize to TRIGOH at a ceremony in Tegucigalpa on Feb. 17. 

            The formal presentation to Prof. Pan will be held at a later date. 

            Created in 1974 to recognize outstanding contributions to conservation, 

            the Getty Prize is now overseen by Getty's son Gordon and other members 

            of the Getty family. Nominees are chosen by WWF and the winner selected 

            by a jury of eminent conservationists. The award carries with it national 

            and international recognition and a cash prize of $100,000, which 

            this year's winners will split.</font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Previous winners 

            have included Dr. Jane Goodall, British conservationist Sir Peter 

            Scott, Dr. Harold Coolidge, founder of the World Conservation Union, 

            and the Forest Stewardship Council. </font>
