<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jane Henney, M.D. <br>

Commissioner <br>

Food and Drug Administration<br>

5600 Fishers Lane <br>

Rockville, MD 20857 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Dr. Henney: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have obtained new FDA reports concerning 23 additional U.S. deaths since the

beginning of this year from cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac arrest/death associated

with the use of the heartburn drug, Propulsid. These are in addition to the 80 previous

FDA-announced heart rhythm-associated deaths (based on reports received through December

31, 1999) which formed the basis of the announcement on March 23rd to <em>eventually</em>

stop the marketing of Propulsid. The continued occurrence of arrhythmia-associated

fatalities, for a current total of 103 such deaths, further emphasizes the serious public

health dangers of the FDA's going along with Johnson and Johnson's reckless decision to

allow this deadly drug to remain in pharmacies for more than four more months, until

mid-August. We insist that you order the removal of all stocks of Propulsid from retail or

wholesale channels of commerce within the next two weeks in order to prevent additional

people from being killed by this drug. There are numerous safer alternatives to Propulsid.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 23 newly-reported deaths (reported between January 1, 2000 and March 28th) occurred

in people using Propulsid. All involved ventricular arrhythmias, non-specified

arrhythmias, cardiac arrest or sudden death. The death reports included people of all ages

ranging from a 9-month-old male infant to a 77- year-old man. Thirteen of the 23 people,

more than one-half, were under 60 years of age. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the announcement was made on March 23rd that Johnson and Johnson would stop the

marketing and distribution of Propulsid by July 14th and allow it in pharmacies until

mid-August, it was stated that there would be a &quot;limited access&quot; program set up

in order to make the drug available for people with certain disorders such as diabetic

gastroparesis, in which there is an impairment of emptying the stomach of food, and for

other &quot;off-label&quot; conditions. None of these conditions are FDA-approved uses of

the drug since there is not adequate data on the effectiveness of Propulsid for treatment

of these medical problems. The argument for the limited access program was that there are

no other drugs to which these patients will respond. This program will take the form of an

Investigational New Drug Exemption (IND). There would have to be a certification that the

patient had an EKG, had been tried on other alternatives first, and was not taking any of

the 41 drugs which are contraindicated for use with Propulsid because of life-threatening

interactions. There is no excuse, however, for taking so long to set up such a program and

allowing four more months of, in essence, unlimited access to this dangerous drug while

the limited access program is being set up. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1978, after a petition and a lawsuit from Public Citizen's Health Research Group to

immediately ban the diabetes drug phenformin because it was causing a large number of

deaths and there were safer alternatives, the drug was immediately taken off the market.

In a matter of weeks, not months, it was made available under an IND to those patients

whose physicians thought there were no other alternatives. Although there had been

hundreds of thousands of patients using the drug before it was banned, similar to the

number estimated to be using Propulsid, only three or four thousand used it under the

provisions of the IND after it was removed from the market and that number dwindled to

very few within several years. FDA officials have said that there are a similarly small

number of patients who would qualify for Propulsid under the conditions of the new

program. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unless the FDA forces Johnson and Johnson to promptly clear this drug off drug store

shelves, a large number of further preventable deaths are certain to occur in the United

States, mainly in people for whom there are numerous alternatives for the treatment of

gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also referred to as &quot;heartburn&quot;, the

principle medical condition for which the drug is prescribed. We look forward to a prompt

reply to this urgent request. </font></p>
