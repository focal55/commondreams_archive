- February 3 - A nationwide coalition of

conservation, fishing and religious organizations is releasing a



new study entitled "Broken Promises of recovery: the Clinton



Administration's 10-Prong Attack on Endangered Species." Written by



American Lands and released in cooperation with Endangered Species



Coalition and GrassRoots Environmental Effectiveness Network



(GREEN), the report shows that the Clinton Administration's record



on endangered species is extremely poor -- and in some cases is



worse than that of prior administrations.

<p>"The Administration has been undermining the Endangered Species

Act for years," said Daniel Hall of American Lands. "There new



refusal to accept species listing petitions across the country,



their efforts to avoid writing real salmon protection rules in the



west, and recent revelations that they denied protection to the



Atlantic salmon at the behest of a former Maine Senator are just



the latest chapter in this sad tale."

<p>"This is the untold story -- what's really happening with

implementation of the ESA, and why wildlife populations and



ecosystems are going to continue crashing until agency officials



start doing their jobs," continued Brock Evans of the Endangered



Species Coalition.

<p>"This administration has taken the old game of sacrificing

endangered species for politics to new levels by creating entirely



new ESA programs that put business before biology," stated Roger



Featherstone of the GrassRoots Environmental Effectiveness Network.



"'No Surprises,' HCPs, non-listing agreements, the focus on



delisting, attacks on agency whistleblowers -- it's all part of a



bigger trend.

<p>"It's all well and good to designate new national monuments

before an election," continued Featherstone, "but this won't help



most endangered species, the majority of which depend on



non-federal lands. The administration needs to stop handing out



large-scale ESA exemptions to timber companies, developers and other



vested interests."

<p>A new administration policy states that petitions to grant

imperiled species official "threatened" or "endangered" status will



not be accepted if the species are already considered "candidates"



for listing. The problem, point out Peter Galvin of the Center for



Biological Diversity, is that without listing petitions, the



administration tends to leave candidate species in bureaucratic



limbo. The center plans to challenge the policy.

<p>New federal rules are also supposed to conserve West Coast

salmon and steelhead trout. According to Daniel Hall, the rules



fail to provide real protection measures, fail to give salmon a



good chance of recovery, and provide landowners with broad ESA



exemptions. "Everyone knows that top National Marine Fisheries



Service officials will only protect salmon if someone hauls them



into court," said Hall.

<p>Atlantic salmon have continued sliding towards extinction while

the administration refused to list the fish, contrary to the



recommendations of its own biologists. A recent expose also



documented that Secretary Babbitt prevented the salmon from being



protected at the request of then-Senator Cohen of Maine.

<p>The report, which was prepared as a discussion paper and draws

upon the experience of wildlife activists nationwide, indicates



that the administration has been:

<p>-- Refusing to identify and "list" imperiled species as

"threatened" or "endangered," denying these species the benefits of



the Endangered Species Act (ESA);

<br>

-- Refusing to designate "Critical Habitat" areas for listed

species;

<br>

-- Refusing to develop basic protection measures for imperiled

species;

<br>

-- Allowing developers, timber companies, the Forest Service and

other federal agencies to continue destroying wildlife habitat;

<br>

-- Supporting legislation and other policies that directly

weaken the ESA; and

<br>

-- Attacking agency biologists who reveal what's really

happening.
