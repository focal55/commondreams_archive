- February 21 - The Iowa Green Party now has four candidates to choose 

from for the Green Party presidential nomination in the 2000 election. Today, 

consumer advocate and former Green Party nominee Ralph Nader joined Steven 

Gaskin and Joel Kovel in the contest for the party's selection. Jello Biafra (<a href="http://www.greens.org/jellobiafra/">http://www.greens.org/jellobiafra/</a>) is 

also on the ballot in two states. An endorsement from the Iowa Green Party is 

expected at the middle of March.

<P>Once a nominee is chosen, the Greens will focus on getting qualified ballot 

status in Iowa, alongside the Democrat and Republican parties. 1500 signatures 

are needed from ten counties throughout the state by August 17. </P>

<P>"A presidential campaign presents a great opportunity for the Green Party to 

establish itself as a real alternative to the sound-bite image of the current 

"front-running" candidates," Holly Hart, secretary of the coordinating committee 

of the Iowa City Green Party said. "The issues the Green Party stand for needs 

to be discussed on the national level."</P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Steven Gaskin</b>: <a href="http://www.stephen2000.org">www.stephen2000.org</a><br>

Gaskin is founder 

of "The Farm," the countrie's largest successful commune. His planks include 

universal healthcare, campaign and election reform, choice in education, the 

decriminalization of marijuana and the amnesty of marijuana prisoners not 

involved with guns or hard drugs, and the tenet that a corporation is not a 

person. </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Joel Kovel:</b> <a href="http://www.greenplace.org/pages/kovel_for_president.htm">http://www.greenplace.org/pages/kovel_for_president.htm</a><br>

Kovel, a psychiatrist by training, is 

currently a professor at Bard College, the author of numerous books, and a 

long-time political activist. A member of the New York State Green Party since 

1990, Kovel is campaigning for universal healthcare, a major initiative to 

combat global warming, democratization of the global economy, and far-ranging 

campaign finance and political reforms.</font></P>

Nader's campaign is 

expected to focus on the need to curb the growing powers of corporations, 

promote the adoption of a single payer health care system, oppose the 

multi-billion dollar bailout of the nuclear industry, restore democracy to the 

political and economic process, and support strong environmental protection. 

Unlike his campaign four years ago, Nader plans to do extensive fund-raising and 

campaign appearances.</font>
