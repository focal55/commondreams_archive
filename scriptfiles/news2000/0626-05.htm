- June 26 - The Lawyers Committee for Human

    Rights called on U.S. congressional leaders today to ensure

    that aid to the Colombian armed forces to help fight the

    production and distribution of illegal drugs is accompanied

    by strong human rights conditions. </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In letter addressed to congressional leaders seeking to

    reconcile House and Senate versions of the Colombia aid

    package, announced by the Clinton administration in January,

    the Lawyers Committee highlighted the deplorable human rights

    record of the Colombian armed forces, in particular the

    problem of armed forces collaboration with outlaw

    paramilitary armies linked to massive human rights abuses.

    Much of the $1.3 billion in aid expected to be approved in

    the final compromise bill this week will go to Colombia's

    armed forces. The letter urges adoption of the conditions

    contained in the aid package passed by the Senate last week,

    rather than the much weaker conditions attached to the House

    of Representatives version of the aid package. It states that

    the Senate version would help ensure the U.S. does not

    indirectly support rights violations that are likely to

    persist under existing Colombian legislation and practice. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Good policy options are scarce on Colombia. But

    several decades of U.S. assistance to Latin American military

    forces that are complicit in human rights violations should

    have taught us at least one lesson,&quot; said Rob Varenik,

    Director of Protection at Lawyers Committee. &quot;When the

    security forces get a blank check without meaningful

    accountability, our aid strengthens the armed forces over the

    civilian institutions they are supposed to defend. We may

    intend to safeguard democratic institutions, but we may

    undermine their authority.&quot;</font></p>
