- September 28 - Handgun Control today



released two new issue advocacy ads, featuring Martin Sheen of the



Emmy-award winning drama The West Wing, which criticize the pro-gun



record of Governor George W. Bush and urge viewers to check the



facts on the gun records of other elected officials. Sheen donated



his time and appearance to Handgun Control.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ads, which were produced by York-Zimmerman, Inc., direct



viewers to the bushandguns.com and handguncontrol.org websites to



learn more about the records of Governor Bush and other elected



officials. With an initial buy of several hundred thousand



dollars, the ads will appear in Cleveland, Milwaukee and St. Louis



as well as in the Washington, D.C. market beginning this weekend.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are extremely grateful that a star of Mr. Sheen's stature



would take the time to contribute his appearance to this vital



message," said Sarah Brady, chair of Handgun Control. "Mr. Sheen's



long record of social activism speaks for itself. By speaking of



the need for sensible gun laws at this time, he will help call



attention to those elected officials whose records reflect the



positions and power of the gun lobby."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this month, Handgun Control spent $1.4 million -- a



record for the group -- on another ad about Governor Bush's record.



Additionally, the Handgun Control Voter Education Fund has and will



run ads in key races around the country.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">---

<br>

MEDIA NOTE: Mr. Sheen will not be available for comment or



interviews, and has asked us to let you know that "the ads speak



for themselves."

Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974 by



Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. "Pete" Shields, two victims of gun



violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law



enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups across



the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and local gun



control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI has more than



400,000 members nationwide, making it the nation's largest



citizens' gun control lobbying organization. More information about



HCI and its sister organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun



Violence, can be found on our website at
