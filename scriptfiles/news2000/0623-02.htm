- June 23 - The Othmer Institute at



Planned Parenthood of New York City today released the first in a



series of results of its nationwide poll of American attitudes on

abortion and the soon to be decided Supreme Court case, Stenberg v.



Carhart.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The survey affirms that abortion is a very important issue in this



country. So important that 7 out of 10 Americans are concerned about



safeguarding a woman's right to choose abortion.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further, Americans show little ambivalence when asked who should



decide whether or not an individual woman should have an abortion:

75



percent of Americans believe that the woman should make the decision



herself or in consultation with her doctor. And a strong majority of



Americans support the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the eve of the Supreme Court's decision in the most important



abortion case in the last eight years, Nebraska's Stenberg v.



Carhart, 81 percent of Americans report that they are unfamiliar with



this case.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When asked if they would support or oppose a law such as the one



in Nebraska that prohibits certain kinds of pre-viability abortion



procedures, even though the doctor believes that the procedure is the



safest for the woman, a plurality of Americans said they would oppose



such a law.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further, when informed that if the Supreme Court upholds the



Nebraska law, doctors would be prevented from using the abortion



procedure they consider the safest to protect the life and health of



the woman, opposition to the law dramatically increased to a majority



of Americans -- with a 20 point increase in respondents expressing



strong opposition to the law.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of this survey should serve as a clarion call to



politicians -- that the vast majority of Americans believe in and



support the right of an individual woman to decide whether or not to



terminate an unwanted pregnancy. Anti-choice politicians waste time

and money dividing the country over abortion. They fail to



accurately represent the views of their constituents and undermine



the health and wellbeing of women and their families.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Global Strategy Group conducted the survey during the period of June

9-18.



807 respondents were polled nationwide. The poll has a margin of



error of +/- 3.4 percent.

choose an abortion -- would you say very concerned, somewhat, not



very or not at all concerned.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. As you may know, Roe v. Wade is the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court law



which made abortion legal in the United States. This court decision



made it legal to end a pregnancy before fetal viability -- that is,



before the fetus can live outside the woman's body. The decision



also said that abortions could not be performed after viability



except to save the life or health of the woman. Would you say you



support or oppose this decision? (IF SUPPORT or OPPOSE ASK: Do you



strongly support/oppose or only somewhat support/oppose?)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Which of the following statements comes closest to how you



feel about who should decide whether or not an individual woman



should have an abortion?

<br>

29 percent The woman should decide.

<br>

1 percent Depends on what month / how far along

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you may know, within the next couple of months, the United



States Supreme Court is expected to rule on a case involving the



issue of abortion. The Court will rule on a Nebraska law that



criminalizes certain kinds of abortion procedures that are commonly

<br>

performed during the first and second trimesters of a pregnancy-that



is before a fetus is viable, or able to live outside of the woman's



body. These procedures are used when the doctor believes that such

a



procedure is the safest one for the woman. The Court will decide



whether these restrictions are legal or not.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Have you heard about this Supreme Court case, or not? (IF



CHOICE: ) Would you say you are very familiar, somewhat, not very or



not at all familiar with the case?

12 percent Somewhat familiar

4 percent Don't know/Refused

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Would you support or oppose a law such as the one in Nebraska



that would prohibit certain kinds of pre-viable abortion procedures,



even though the doctor believes that the procedure is the safest for



the woman?

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">21 percent Strongly support prohibiting certain pre-viability abortion

procedures

procedures

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let me read you some information:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. If the Supreme Court upholds the Nebraska law, doctors will be



prevented from using the abortion procedure they consider the safest



to protect the life and health of the woman. Based on this



information, do you believe that the court should uphold this law or
