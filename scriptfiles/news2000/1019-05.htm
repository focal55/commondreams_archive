- October 19 - The

          Senate Republican leadership -- in a last minute, pre-election payoff

          to political supporters in the Religious Right -- is prepared to pass

          legislation granting special licensing rights to religious

          broadcasters.</font>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Senate

          Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) tried to force the

          &quot;Noncommercial Broadcasting Freedom of Expression Act&quot; (H.R.

          4201) through the Senate last Friday, but failed. Congressional

          observers believe it could come to the Senate floor for a vote as

          early as this week as an amendment to a larger bill.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

          legislation changes federal communications law to give religious

          broadcasters virtually unlimited access to noncommercial educational

          radio and television stations that have traditionally been used by

          universities and nonprofit educational organizations.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under

          the measure, the Federal Communications Commission cannot regulate

          religious programming at educational stations and cannot require that

          a portion of time be set aside for educational material.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover,

          the bill exempts religious broadcasters from requirements concerning

          proof of educational programming. As a result, the FCC would be

          required to automatically grant religious programming

          &quot;educational&quot; status.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;Aggressive

          backroom lobbying in support of this bill is being driven by the

          National Religious Broadcasters, a trade association that includes Pat

          Robertson, Jerry Falwell, D. James Kennedy, James Dobson and other

          powerful broadcasters in the Religious Right.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It's

          outrageous that Congress is prepared to replace Bert and Ernie with

          Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn,

          executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and

          State. &quot;This scheme grants special rights to religious

          broadcasters because they're religious.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Unfortunately,

          this bill undermines the whole concept of educational broadcasting by

          allowing religious networks to promote their beliefs under the guise

          of 'educational programming,'&quot; Lynn added. &quot;If this bill

          becomes law, religious broadcasters would be free to buy up stations

          and replace educational programming that benefits an entire community

          with sectarian broadcasts and evangelism.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

          House of Representatives has already approved this legislation. On

          June 20, the House passed H.R. 4201 by a 264-159 vote.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AU's

          Lynn noted that the measure removing requirements of actual

          educational programming makes this legislation particularly

          controversial.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Any

          religious group, no matter how extreme or controversial, will

          immediately qualify for a noncommercial educational license under this

          bill,&quot; Lynn observed. &quot;A TV preacher could run a telethon

          all day, every day, claim that it's educational programming, and

          federal law would let him get away with it if this bill passes.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

          House began consideration of the measure after controversy erupted

          last December over proposed FCC criteria for educational programming.

          The agency ruled that at least half of a noncommercial station’s

          broadcasts must be educational and that preaching and worship services

          would not count as educational. The FCC reversed itself a month later

          after the National Religious Broadcasters, Religious Right leaders and

          their allies in Congress expressed bitter opposition.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congress

          has been noticeably inactive on many of the Religious Right's top

          concerns during this session. With that in mind, many believe that

          this legislation is moving after some behind-the-scenes dealing just

          weeks before Election Day.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I

          know we're getting close to the election, but this kind of religious

          pork is ridiculous,&quot; Lynn concluded. &quot;Existing FCC

          regulations protect educational programming for everyone. For Congress

          to strip these guidelines to curry political support with the

          Religious Right is shameful.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Americans

          United has joined in a broad coalition of groups opposing the

          legislation including Citizens for Independent Public Broadcasting,

          the National PTA and the Minority Media &amp; Telecommunications

          Council.</font></p>
