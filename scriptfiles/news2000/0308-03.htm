- March 8 - Passage of California's Knight Initiative will not stop the forward march of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people toward equality in small towns, large cities and all 50 states, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Executive Director Kerry Lobel vowed today.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is a setback. But there's no turning back," Lobel said. "The movement toward equality is both incremental and inevitable. On issue after issue, in state after state, we are advancing. Like any social justice movement, however, we will suffer defeats along the way.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The activists, organizers, donors and fundraisers who stepped up to the plate in California have done heroic work," Lobel continued. "They raised far more money than anyone thought possible to fight this tough battle. They collected the names of both GLBT and pro-GLBT voters who will help us during the all-important November elections and further down the road. We are also thankful to the millions of voters&#151;both GLBT voters and many allies, new and old&#151;who understood the fundamentally mean-spirited nature of the Knight initiative.  They understood the attack it represented on our families and turned out in opposition. To them we say, yours is a vision of equality that more and more Americans share.  Yours is a vision of equality that will prevail.  Yours is a vote that will be needed down the road as we continue our forward march for justice."

</font>

Lobel noted that the battle for full civil rights for GLBT people will not begin and end in California. GLBT-related ballot measures may be voted on in Dade County, Florida, Sept. 5 and in the states of Colorado, Maine, Nevada and Oregon on Nov. 7. "We already know that the year 2000 will witness a record number of GLBT-related initiatives on both state and local ballots throughout the nation," Lobel said. "Now we must organize for victory on another day. Through continued crucial voter identification and mobilization, we can win every remaining ballot fight that we face in the year 2000. But we must organize early and work to get every last vote out. The work will not always be easy, nor will it be safe. But when the day arrives that anti-GLBT attacks at long last come to an end, we will know that it was worth it."
