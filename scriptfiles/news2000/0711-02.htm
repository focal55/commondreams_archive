- July 11 - Saturday morning's test of the U.S. Anti-Ballistic

Missile (ABM) system showed just how far from deployment the system really

is.  Failing on at least two separate counts, the test garnered nearly no

useful information for the Pentagon because the booster did not separate

from the interceptor, plunging both into the sea.



<p>"This is fundamental technology to the U.S., and we cannot even get that

right," argued John Isaacs, president of the Council for a Livable World.

"After four decades of trying to develop a national missile defense, all

the Pentagon has proved is how far it is from developing a workable

technology. This failure should slow the program significantly." 

	

<p>"The Pentagon claimed the tests were simple (read "dumbed down") because

the system ‘had to walk before it could run,'" claimed Luke Warren, analyst

at the Council for a Livable World Education Fund.  "After the last test, I

think the more appropriate analogy should be that ‘you have to crawl before

you can walk.'"



<p>The test was important since it is the last test of the proposed system

before President Clinton is scheduled to make a decision this fall whether

or not to deploy the system.  Moreover, the results of Saturday's test will

play a large part in influencing the Pentagon's Deployment Readiness Review

decision this summer.  It would be absurd for the Pentagon to try to turn

this failure to issue a recommendation to proceed with a national missile

defense; it is now unlikely that President Clinton will commit to deployment.



<p>However, the President may decide this fall to start construction on a

radar station used in the final NMD system.  Such an action would violate

the 1972 ABM Treaty, which bans defenses of the entire country , thus

likely causing negative reactions among our European allies as well as with

Russia and China, undermining the prospect for further reductions of

nuclear weapons. 



<p>At this point, only three of 19 scheduled tests of the Clinton plan have

been completed, two of them failures and one only a partial success.  As a

result  the debate on the merits of deploying an NMD system is purely

academic. 



<p>"No car manufacturer would decide whether to build a new automobile based

on only three of 19 tests," said John Isaacs. "No new computer system would

be placed on the market with such a paucity of market data," Isaacs

continued.  "The bottom 

line is that national missile defense is still not ready for prime time."
