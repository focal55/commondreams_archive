- July 19 - Activists with INFACT, the national corporate watchdog organization, will be rallying outside of Kraft Foods International headquarters today, challenging the Philip Morris subsidiary over the corporation’s unabashed influence-peddling practices. INFACT representatives will deliver a giant version of an Open Letter signed by 58 religious leaders from across the country to Betsy Holden, Kraft’s newly appointed CEO.  Local INFACT volunteers will display the Human Toll of Tobacco banner and will deliver commitments from thousands of consumers boycotting Kraft to Ms. Holden, challenging the corporation to stop aggressive tobacco promotion and interference in public policy.  The Human Toll of Tobacco is a 200-foot-long banner displaying photos of people who have died from or are suffering from tobacco-related illnesses.

This latest escalation of INFACT’s Kraft Boycott comes in the wake of the recent $145 billion verdict in the Florida class-action lawsuit.  “This landmark decision illustrates the public’s shift from blaming individual smokers to holding tobacco corporations like Philip Morris responsible for spreading tobacco addiction around the world and manipulating public policy in the interest of tobacco profits,” said INFACT Organizer Maggie Scott.  “Consumers across the country are holding Philip Morris directly accountable by boycotting Kraft.  It’s time for Ms. Holden to face the public outrage herself!”

The delivery of the Open Letter to Kraft’s new CEO Betsy Holden today illustrates that Kraft’s image is tarnished among communities of faith.  Open Letter signers including Jane Hull Harvey, Assistant General Secretary of the Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist Church, and Rev. Joseph P. LaMar, Assistant Treasurer of the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers in Maryknoll, New York, are calling on Ms. Holden to use her leadership role within Philip Morris to end the corporation’s abusive practices.

According to the World Health Organization, four million people around the world die each year from tobacco related illnesses.  That number is projected to rise to 10 million by the year 2030, with most of those deaths occurring in developing countries.  Of the one million U.S. teens hooked each year on cigarettes, one-third will eventually die from tobacco-related illnesses.

Mark Jacobs, Green Party candidate for Congress in New York’s 19th Congressional District who has pledged to not accept money from Kraft or Philip Morris, will join today’s protest.  As a result of Big Tobacco’s influence, cigarettes remain among the least regulated consumer products in the U.S.  Philip Morris continues to lead the tobacco industry in massive political contributions and aggressive lobbying against strong public health policies.  With the 2000 elections on pace to shatter spending records set in 1996, INFACT’s growing Boycott is giving voice to the public demand for regulatory action in the U.S. and abroad.
