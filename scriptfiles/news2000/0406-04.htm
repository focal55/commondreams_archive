- April 6 - As new executive compensation figures are revealed this week, 

          the updated AFL-CIO Executive PayWatch website (<a href="/paywatch/index.htm">www.paywatch.org</a>) 

          gives visitors the tools they need to get the real scoop on CEO pay, 

          including 10 shocking examples of CEO pay at major global corporations 

          that are driving down living standards for workers around the globe. 

        </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The expanded website will also allow visitors to compare their pay 

          to updated CEO pay figures at 1500 companies as proxies are filed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CEO pay is growing faster than all major economic indicators &#151; 

          up 23%, according to the <em>New York Times</em>. The 

          average CEO of a major US corporation made $11.9 million in 1999, 

          476 times what the average blue-collar American worker made. That's 

          up from 42 times more in 1980, and 85 times more in 1990. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> US CEO pay dwarfs foreign CEO pay. German CEOs make 13 times more 

          than the average German manufacturing employee. In Japan, the CEO-to-worker 

          pay ratio is just 11-to-1. </font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"What looks excessive in the context of US workers is truly outrageous 

          when viewed globally," said AFL-CIO Secretary Treasurer Richard Trumka. 

          "The global economy is not working for working families when boards 

          of directors hand US CEOs tens of millions of dollars while paying the 

          people who actually do the work less than ten dollars a day."</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GE's Jack Welch, for example, earned 

          over $90 million in 1999, as much as the <strong><em>total</em></strong> 

          earnings of half of GE's Mexican workforce of 30,000. A GE (NYSE:GE) 

          worker in Mexico makes about $2 an hour. GE also operates in China and 

          India, countries where workers are often paid pennies an hour.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Gap CEO Millard Drexlar took home stock options worth $685 million, 

          prompting former compensation consultant Graef Crystal to observe that 

          Drexlar "has been given stock options in dosages that would kill a horse." 

          The Gap (NYSE:GPS) is the largest importer of goods from Saipan, and 

          is one of a handful of retailers that has refused to settle a lawsuit 

          alleging that garments made there, labelled "Made in the USA," are produced 

          by indentured servants. Garment workers in Saipan work 12 hours a day, 

          seven days a week, and sleep in barbed wire barracks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bank of New York CEO Thomas Renyi took home nearly $75 million in 

          cash and stock options in 1999, despite the fact that over the past 

          three years more than $7 billion was illegally funneled out of Russia 

          through the Bank of New York (NYSE:BK). Such capital flight has contributed 

          to falling living standards for working families in Russia as funds 

          stolen from the Russian people &#151; through organized crime and misdirected 

          IMF foreign aid loans &#151; are transferred abroad by Western financial 

          institutions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Mining company Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold (NYSE:FCX) CEO James 

          Moffett has long cultivated close ties with Indonesian dictator Suharto. 

          Human rights monitors say they have seen the Indonesian military arriving 

          in Freeport company helicopters and boats to quell anti-Freeport indigenous 

          protest. Moffett took home $37 million in pay and stock options in 1999. 

        </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Other companies profiled in the global paywatch section include Black 

          &amp; Decker, Unocal, Goldman Sachs, Coca Cola, Citigroup, and Honeywell 

          International. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In addition to such global company profiles, the PayWatch website 

          this year will provide investors, workers and the public easy-to-understand 

          summaries of the pay of the CEOs at 1500 of America's largest corporations, 

          together with interactive tools that allow users to compare their salary 

          and perks with their company's CEO pay. The website also offers "action 

          tools" visitors can use to express concern about runaway executive pay 

          to company boards, the SEC, the IRS and Congress. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Since its launch in 1997, PayWatch has remained among the Internet's 

          most popular sites, with over 8.5 million hits in the last year and 

          nearly 20 million hits since its inception. It was a Yahoo "best pick" 

          in 1997.</font></p>
