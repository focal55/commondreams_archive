- June 27 - "It is unfortunate that Congressman James Rogan's re-election campaign issued false allegations against Mr. Al-Marayati, perpetuating negative stereotypes against Muslims in an attempt to gain political favor. We regret that such an incident occurred, particularly since Rep. Rogan agreed to abide by the principles of The Interfaith Alliance's Framework for Civility for Political Candidates - <a href="www.civility.net">www.civility.net</a>. However, we commend his campaign for recognizing their lack of judgment and issuing a public apology to Mr. Al-Marayati," said the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of The Interfaith Alliance.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In mid-April Rep. Rogan and Adam Schiff, both candidates for Congress in California's 27th District agreed to conduct their campaigns with civility.  Each endorsed the principles outlined in The Interfaith Alliance's Framework for Civility for Political Candidates. The Framework offers ethical and civil guidelines that strongly discourage the use of negative campaign tactics. In signing the Framework, each candidate has promised: <br>

 to avoid personal attacks, demeaning descriptions and innuendo; <br>

 to take full responsibility for the conduct of advisors and allies; <br>

 to refrain from deception and half-truths; and <br>

 to make documentation available for allegations of fact about opponents.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 29th Rep. Rogan sent to The Interfaith Alliance a letter stating that he understood that "the politics of personal destruction has turned people away from the political process and done damage to our public institutions."  In that letter Representative Rogan registered his full support for the principles outlined in our Framework of Civility for Political Candidates and declared that he "will conduct (his) campaign accordingly." </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week, Rep. Rogan's campaign issued public statements attacking opponent Adam Schiff because of Schiff's attendance at an event co-sponsored by Mr. Salam Al-Marayati, executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council.   According to the Los Angeles Times, Rogan's campaign manager Jason Roe stated that Mr. Al-Marayti "seems to be an apologist for Muslim terrorists." Roe went on to question why Adam Schiff  "would feel comfortable, especially as a Jew, to be participating in this event."

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to these published allegations, local interfaith leaders in Glendale, California held a press conference calling on Rep. Rogan's re-election campaign to issue an apology to Mr. Al-Marayati and to meet with faith leaders in the community. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Glendale interfaith community's reaction to the use of religion as a political weapon stems from the unfortunate reality that Muslims in America continue to be stereotyped as terrorists or sympathizers to religious violence. Unfounded accusations against Muslims or an American Muslim organization not only perpetuate prejudice against the religion of Islam and its followers, they undermine the civic voice and contributions that American Muslims make to our political process and communities," said the Rev. Welton Gaddy.  "For too long, American Muslims have been excluded from participating in civil dialogue on public policy matters because of negative and erroneous stereotypes.  Indeed, if working with Muslims makes one vulnerable to the allegation of working with terrorist sympathizers, civic leaders will be less likely to engage members of the Muslim faith community."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On June 23rd, Rep. Rogan met with Mr. Al-Marayati and leaders of the Muslim Public Affairs Council and presented them with a letter stating the lawmaker had seen no statements "indicating you encourage or support terrorism."  On June 26th, Rogan's campaign manager issued a public letter apologizing to Mr. Al-Marayati. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In light of these events, we hope that both Rep. Rogan and Adam Schiff will reflect upon the principles embodied in the Framework of Civility for Political Candidates and guide their campaigns in a manner that can restore the public's faith in the political process," said the Rev. Welton Gaddy.</font></p>
