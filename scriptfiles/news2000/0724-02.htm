- July 24 - After giving the Commandant of the Coast Guard an

"emergency" Gulfstream jet last month, Congress will provide funds to

purchase another luxury plane for the Navy and allocate  millions for

limousines.  



<p>The final version of the fiscal 2001 Defense Appropriations Bill lists the

Gulfstream as a "VP-3 Replacement Aircraft."  A misleading label

considering the VP-3 was a patrol plane last used in the Korean War.  The

bill also provides funding for two unrequested UC-35 Cessna passenger

planes used to transport top military brass.   



<p>"Perhaps they simply forgot to place the ‘I' in between the ‘V' and ‘P',"

claimed John Isaacs, president of Council for a Livable World, "'Very

Important Person' plane would be a more appropriate label." 



<p>Congressional appropriators employed other sleight of hand tricks to hide

the procurement of nearly $5 million in "armored sedans", i.e. limousines.

In the procurement charts accompanying the conference report bill, it

appears that the money from "armored sedan" accounts was taken out.

However, in the actual wording of the bill there language that explicitly

appropriates funds for "vehicles required for physical security of

personnel."  Thus, rather than actually striking the money for the limos

from the conference report, as the charts lead one to believe, the

conferees simply shifted the limo money to some other account where it

could not be found.  



<p>There is a total of 24 such vehicles in the bill at approximately $200,000

a piece.  The Army receives 12 while the Air Force and Navy get one limo

each and "defense-wide" accounts will pay for 10 more.  



<p>"For years Congress has been crying about the growing readiness crisis and

now they have the nerve to waste $5 million on limos," said Isaacs. "Those

members need to take a good hard look at their commitment to meeting the

readiness and quality of life needs of our armed forces."



<p>Isaacs continued to point out that "it would only take $6 million to

finally lift every military family off of the food stamp rolls."

	

<p>The House passed the conference report by a 367-59 margin on July 19.  The

Senate is expected to take up the bill the week of July 24.
