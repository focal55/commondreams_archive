- October 31 - Dozens of 

costumed activists converged outside the headquarters of 

Kellogg’s today to denounce the cereal maker’s continued 

use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their food. 

Members of Michigan Resistance Against Genetic 

Engineering (MIRAGE) were joined by Greenpeace activists 

carrying a giant 25-foot ear of corn with a trick-or-treat bag 

that said, "Kellogg’s: Stop Using Scary Corn."

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Americans know that a breakfast of Kellogg’s cereal is a 

breakfast of contaminated corn," said Greenpeace GMO 

Specialist Charles Margulis, speaking in front of Kellogg’s 

headquarters. "On Halloween, your kids don’t have to dress 

up, because Kellogg’s has already made them guinea pigs 

in this experiment on our food." 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Last week Kellogg’s admitted that it was forced to stop 

production at a Memphis cereal plant over concerns about 

contamination by a variety of GMO corn that is meant only 

for animal feed. The corn, called StarLink, is not approved 

for human food because scientists believe it could trigger 

dangerous allergic responses in some people. According to 

the Des Moines Register, more than half of the two billion 

bushels of corn grown in Iowa could be contaminated with 

StarLink.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Earlier this month, Greenpeace wrote to Kellogg’s asking 

what steps the company is taking to insure that StarLink is 

not contaminating its corn supplies. The company has 

refused to respond. Greenpeace and other leading 

environmental organizations also sent a letter to President 

Clinton last week, urging him to ensure that StarLink is not 

now approved for human food. 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Kellogg’s acknowledges that it uses GMO ingredients in 

their U.S. products, but in a letter to Greenpeace, Kellogg’s 

European division has said that the company is eliminating 

GMOs there, and that "…we hope to have completed this 

process by the end of the year." Kellogg’s tells American 

consumers that its use of gene-altered food is merely a 

matter of "consumer preference." But Greenpeace has 

learned that over 28,000 consumers have contacted 

Kellogg’s in the past month over concerns of GMOs in their 

food.

</font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Americans have told Kellogg’s that they don’t want to eat 

gene altered food," said Margulis. "If Kellogg’s cares about 

American consumers, they will stop using scary corn."</font>
