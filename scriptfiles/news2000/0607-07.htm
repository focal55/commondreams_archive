- June 7 - The proposed $300

          million Animas-La Plata (ALP) water project violates federal law,

          stated Jill Lancelot, Legislative Director of Taxpayers for Common

          Sense, in testimony today before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.<o:p>

          </o:p>

          </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lancelot

          charged that by not accounting for inevitable project cost overruns

          and inflationary costs, and by not identifying the cost local sponsors

          should repay for the project, ALP is in violation of federal

          reclamation law.<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic; font-family: Times New Roman"><o:p>

          </span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At

          a hearing today on S.2508, the Colorado Ute Settlements Act Amendments

          of 2000, Lancelot criticized the bill as “signing a blank check”

          for a wasteful water boondoggle that will harm the American taxpayer

          and the environment. <o:p>

          </o:p>

          </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The

          bill would leave federal taxpayers vulnerable for inflation and

          inevitable cost overruns for the project. “The country is littered

          with water projects that have far surpassed original cost

          estimates,” continued Lancelot.<o:p>

          </o:p>

          </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Animas-La Plata is one of last

          relics from the age of water behemoths,” said Lancelot. “The

          projects cost too much and does too little.” <o:p>

          </o:p>

       </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First

          authorized by Congress in 1968, ALP became a vehicle to settle the

          Southern and Ute Mountain Ute tribes’ water rights in the mid 1980s.

          <o:p>

          </o:p>

          </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Although

          the current version is touted as an Indian-only project, a significant

          portion of the project’s benefits would go to non-Indian

          interests,” continued Lancelot. “The reason why ALP is being built

          is to prevent non-Indian interests from having their water rights

          potentially disrupted.” <o:p>

          </o:p>

          </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lancelot

          testified also that S. 2508 should, but does not deauthorize the

          original massive project. “The Clinton Administration has given

          repeated assurances that they will not support legislation that does

          not specifically deauthorize all of the remaining components of the

          old ALP project; S.2508 fails to do so.” <o:p>

          </o:p>

          </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lancelot

          also testified that the ALP project is a bad investment for taxpayers.

          A recent analysis by an independent economist showed that the return

          to taxpayers could be as little as 22 cents per dollar. <o:p>

          </o:p>

          <b>&nbsp;<o:p>

          </o:p>

          </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The

          project’s limited benefits come at a heavy cost to federal

          taxpayers. ALP’s current price tag is at least $300 million, but

          benefits would amount to as little as $85 million,” continued

          Lancelot. <o:p>

          </o:p>

          </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

          ongoing costs of the project would be substantial. Federal taxpayers

          would pay millions annually for operation and maintenance costs for

          ALP until the Tribes put all of their water to use - even though much

          of the water will not be used for 30-100 years.<o:p>

          </o:p>

          </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lancelot

          also pointed out that the basic need for the water is extremely

          questionable, “It is outrageous that federal taxpayers would

          subsidize golf courses, resort hotels, dude ranches or a coal-fired

          power plant.” <o:p>

          </o:p>

          </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“TCS

          recognizes the commitment to honoring the water rights of the Ute

          tribes. We agree that the obligation to the tribes must be met, but,

          we also believe that there are less costly ways to accomplish that

          goal,”

          concluded Lancelot.</font></p>
