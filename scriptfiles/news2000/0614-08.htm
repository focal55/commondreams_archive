- June 14 - The Transnational Resource & Action Center

(TRAC) has learned that after a year long campaign by environmentalists,

human rights groups, labor unions and other non-governmental organizations

a leading UN agency abandoned its perilous partnership with a group of

transnational corporations whose tarnished human rights, environmental and

development records threatened to rub off  on the world body.



<p>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has canceled plans to

create a Global Sustainable Development Facility (GSDF) in partnership with

about 15 corporations. The GSDF was to include Dow Chemical, mining giant

Rio Tinto, energy conglomerate ABB and biotechnology leader Novartis. 



<p>Through the partnership, known as the Global Sustainable Development

Facility, UNDP had planned to sell global corporations its international

network of offices, high level governmental contacts and its reputation at

a bargain price. 



<p>"The GSDF was fatally flawed and deserved to die," said Joshua Karliner,

Executive Director of TRAC and author of "Perilous Partnership," a report

about the program. "We welcome the news and hope that it foreshadows a more

principled approach to the relationship between the UN and corporations."



<p>UNDP Administrator Mark Malloch Brown informed members of an NGO advisory

panel of his decision to abandon the initiative in late May. The GSDF had

come under fire from many NGOs, including TRAC and some of the members of

the advisory panel.  Last year, over 100 organizations signed a letter to

the previous head of UNDP, Gus Speth, calling for GSDF to be abandoned.



<p>The criticisms of the GSDF included associating with corporate bad actors,

an over-emphasis on the free market ideology of globalization and

development, the danger of "bluewash" by corporations hoping for public

relations benefits from wrapping themselves in the flag of the United

Nations, and failure to abide by the agency's own guidelines in associating

with private companies.



<p><p>The GSDF was just one of many partnerships with the private sector

currently being pursued by the United Nations and many of its agencies.



<p>"Even with the end of the GSDF, we will remain vigilant in tracking other

UN-corporate partnerhip programs," said TRAC's UN Project Coordinator Kenny

Bruno.  "We will also continue to advocate for the UN to monitor corporate

behavior rather than partner with these transnational giants."
