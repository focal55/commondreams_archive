- February 1 - After decades of denial,

the U.S. government has finally acknowledged what Physicians for



Social Responsibility (PSR) and the rest of the nuclear disarmament



community has long held true: the very business of producing



nuclear weapons is harmful to workers and citizens. The next step,



PSR believes, is to curtail current plants to resume nuclear



production and to get out of this hazardous business altogether.

<p>"We've worked hard for years to get this health information into

the public eye," said PSR Executive Director Dr. Robert K. Musil.



"Even if a nuclear weapon never explodes," Musil said, "the effects



of production are like a Hiroshima in slow motion."

<p>PSR believes that the Department of Energy (DOE) must fully

compensate nuclear complex workers whose lives were lost or



threatened by work they performed throughout the Cold War. Many



workers were exposed without their knowledge, and the dangers of



exposure were ignored or minimized by the government for the last



half-century.

<p>PSR and other groups launched the call for responsible and

comprehensive research into the exposure of nuclear complex workers



as the Cold War ended, culminating in the publication of a critical



review of the DOE's radiation work entitled "Dead Reckoning." The



"Dead Reckoning" report exposed severe lapses in the DOE's



protection and monitoring of some 600,000 nuclear complex workers



over the half-century since the dawn of the nuclear age.

<p>"Almost a decade ago, 'Dead Reckoning' came to the same

conclusions and exposed the flawed, defensive studies by DOE that



served to obscure the truth," said Dr. H. Jack Geiger, a PSR



founding physician and co-author of the report. "There simply is no



safe way to produce nuclear weapons. It's time to stop."

<br>Available for interviews:

<br>

H. Jack Geiger, M.D., is the Arthur C. Logan Professor of

Community Medicine at the City University of New York Medical



School and a founding member of Physicians for Social Responsibility.



He served as PSR president from 1986-87 and is the co-chair



of the Physicians Task Force on the Health Risks of Nuclear



Weapons Production. Geiger has authored more than 25 publications



on the medical and biological effects of nuclear weapons and



is featured in several documentary films including "The Last



Epidemic." He is recognized widely for his work in preventing



nuclear war and providing health care for the poor.

<p>David Rush, M.D., is professor of nutrition, community health and

pediatrics, Emeritus, at Tufts University and the Regional Director



of PSR/Greater Boston. He is past president of the Society for



Epidemiologic Research and a member of the editorial board of



Medicine and Global Survival. He is a member of the Department of



Energy's Scientific Advisory Committee on joint U.S.-Russian



studies of the health effects of radiation exposure at former



Soviet nuclear weapons production sites. He has lectured and



written extensively on issues related to maternal and child health,



nutrition and aging, and epidemiology research as well as numerous



topics related to radiation pollution and nuclear war, particularly



the health of nuclear weapons workers and the environment and



health consequences of atmospheric nuclear testing in the United



States. He is co-author, along with Geiger, of "Dead Reckoning," a



1992 PSR publication on the U.S. Department of Energy's



epidemiologic research on worker health.

<p>Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., is executive director of Physicians for

Social Responsibility (PSR), a national nonprofit organization



working to protect public health through education and activism on



issues such as nuclear disarmament, environmental protection and



gun control. Musil has produced several award-winning radio and



video documentaries and authored dozens of articles on military and



foreign affairs. He has served as director or board member of the



Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors, the American Friends



Service Committee, SANE Education Fund, the Center for National



Security Studies, and the Professionals' Coalition for Nuclear Arms



Control.
