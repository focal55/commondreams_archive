- February 4 - Ralph Nader, founder of

the Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) in 1971, which



acts as national air traveller watchdog, and the Six Footer's



Club in 1999, to push for more leg room for tall airline



passengers, today hailed the Feb. 3 announcement of American



Airlines to increase the distance between seat rows by 3 to



5 inches in all coach class seating as "an important first



step."

<p>"For too long cramped passengers have endured discomfort,

loss of circulation, even numbness at times and have been



treated like cattle instead of respected customers.

<p>In a letter to the CEOs of the other major airlines,

Nader urged other carriers to quickly match or exceed



the American Airlines move.

<p>Nader noted, "It's about time airlines realized that

passengers' knees and legs are not excess baggage."

<p>Paul Hudson, executive director of the Aviation Consumer

Action Project, stated, "There are no federal regulations on



leg room. Everyone knows that airlines have been squeezing



more and more into airliners for over 20 years. This may



be a rare example of consumer disgust with bad treatment



and service causing a major shift in airline behavior.

<p>"This action by American Airlines following on the heels

of a more limited announcement several months ago



by United Airlines that it was creating "coach plus" seating



did not come out of thin air. Increasingly business travlers



have been deserting the major carriers whenever they can,



causing a major boom in shared use and charter corporate jets.



Also, ACAP had planned to petition the FAA and DOT to set minimum



leg room standards within the next 30 days. But we will now



wait 60 days to see whether the industry follows American Airlines'



lead in increasing coach class leg room to tolerable levels."

<p>Six-foot-four-inch passenger Ralph Nader invited all tall

airline passengers to become members of the Six Footer's Club



first announced in September 1999. Membership includes a lapel



button and inclusion in a petition drive and other activities



seeking appropriate leg room and accomodations for tall passengers.



Membership applications and information are available by writing



Ralph Nader c/o ACAP at P.O. Box 19029, Washington, D.C., 20036,



or calling 800-588-ACAP, or sending an e-mail to acap71@erols.com.
