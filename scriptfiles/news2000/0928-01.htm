- September 28 - In addition to the mass denial of the legal rights, individuals

have faced extreme brutality in Czech Jails.  Paul Rosenthal from

Seattle Washington who was released this morning from the Olsanska

jail in Prague after forty hours states, "What is happening inside

the Czech jails is more than frightening.  People have no rights,

they are being beaten severely, they are disappearing.  Women

are being forced to strip in front of male guards and perform

exercises.  People with serious medical problems have been denied

help."  The following are accounts confirmed by people that have

been released from jail:



<p> Women have been strip searched by male officers and have been

forced to perform physical exercises for their enjoyment

<p> Many individuals are being denied water, food, and sleep; some

are able to get food only if they pay guards, women and fascists

are more likely to get water

<p> Many people released have reported that before reaching police

stations, officers took individuals to isolated areas and beat

them severely.

<p> Two Norwegians that went to a police station on Prisparni Street

near Vlatavska to report a stolen mobile phone witnessed behind

briefly opened doors that a number of people were handcuffed to

the wall and being beaten severely.  This has also been confirmed

by many reports from released persons that in the processing rooms

groups of 40 to 60 people were asked to spread eagle while they

were beaten, heads were knocked back, legs were kicked in, and

numbers of men had their groins twisted or punched.  Additionally

people handcuffed were tossed down stairs.

<p> There is one report that 22 people were crammed into a 4 square

meter cell.

<p> 30 People were detained at the Olsanska jail in an outdoor courtyard

overnight with no blankets or food.  They were later moved to

Balkova near Pilsen.

<p> Two Germans that were detained in Lupacova, Praha 3 on Wednesday

for approximately eight hours were held with an Israeli, an American,

a German, and an Italian.  The Israeli had been beaten severely,

had difficulty walking, a black eye, and likely had a broken rib.

 He has been denied medical attention

<p> People with diabetes were not fed, people that needed medication

were not given it, the British Embassy had to intervene to get

medication into the jail.

<p> A Norwegian woman held in jail with 30 other women witnessed

a German woman with a badly injured leg where medics were denied.

<p> Right to legal representation and advice, right to interpreters,

right to food and water, right to basic medical attention, and

the right to a phone call have all been ignored on a widespread

scale.

<p> Czechs and Israelis are being beaten more drastically and are

being detained longer

<p> Many internationals are being moved from local stations to Balkova

near Pilsen which has one of the worst human rights records in

the Czech Republic.
