- June 28 - By a razor thin margin, the Supreme Court today struck down Nebraska's ban on so-called "partial-birth" abortion saying it fails to protect women's health and bans safe abortion procedures used prior to fetal viability.  Today's 5-4 ruling calls into immediate question the constitutionality of similar bans passed in 31 states as well as the federal ban twice passed by Congress and twice vetoed by President Clinton.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are cautiously pleased that the Supreme Court has joined with the vast majority of lower courts in striking down these dangerous and deceptive bans," said NARAL Foundation Vice President and Legal Director Betsy Cavendish.  "We have always maintained that such bans are extreme, deceptive, and unconstitutional as they generally lack an exception to protect women's health and could ban a number of safe abortion procedures, including some used in the earlier stages of pregnancy."  

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Supreme Court's 5-4 decision spotlights the judicial branch's role in protecting and preserving the reproductive rights of American women," continued Cavendish.  "<u>In the face of ever-increasing legislative assaults on the right to choose, the courts often must draw the line by striking down laws that threaten the very heart of <i>Roe v. Wade</i></u>."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The ruling also places the Supreme Court itself at center stage in the battle over reproductive freedom and choice.  The next President will likely name two, perhaps three, Supreme Court Justices who could overturn <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> easily enough to allow the next abortion case to go the other way.  Indeed, members of the anti-choice community have said that placing enough justices on the Supreme Court to overturn <i>Roe</i> is a major objective in their support of an anti-choice candidate for president.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Presidential candidate George W. Bush opposes legal abortion and has said, "<i>Roe v. Wade</i> was a reach, overstepped the constitutional bounds as far as I'm concerned."  Bush cites Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court's most virulent opponent of <i>Roe</i> and legal abortion, as his model justice.  In contrast to Bush's position, Vice President Al Gore <u>supports</u> a woman's right to legal abortion and has said he would only appoint justices who share this view.



</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<u>Today's ruling, although encouraging, will not bring about an end to anti-choice legislative assaults on the freedom to choose at the state and federal level</u>," added Cavendish.  "<u>Those who oppose legal abortion will find other ways to impose their agenda on the women of this country</u>.  In the 1980s, it was the repeated introduction of a Human Life Amendment to the Constitution.  In the 1990s, anti-choice assaults came in the form of federal and state restrictions on access to abortion and reproductive health services.  <u>We can be certain that anti-choice groups and lawmakers will continue to develop new and creative ways to chip away at the freedom to choose and the right of American women to make their own reproductive health decisions.  American women and their families must remain vigilant in protecting such a fragile right.</u>"
