- July 25 - Following a violent reaction from 

the crew of the CIC Light, a Danish vessel transporting timber from 

the Amazon, four Greenpeace activists from Germany, Belgium 

and the UK remain in jail and face possible removal from the U.S. 

Activists still in custody are Heike Standigl and Christian 

Jonuschies (Germany), Paul Goyvaerts (Belgium) and James 

Mitchell (UK).  



<p>Yesterday, seven activists were arrested during a protest against 

the importation of  timber illegally harvested  from the Amazon 

rainforest.

<p>Three U.S. activists involved in the protest were released the same 

day. Although the local authorities appeared prepared to release all 

seven activists, the INS intervened, placing each of the four foreign 

nationals under investigation for removal from the U.S.  



<p>"While the real criminals continue to pillage the Amazon rainforest, 

these four people who just want to protect that natural priceless 

treasure from illegal logging are in jail facing deportation," said 

Scott Paul, U.S. forest campaigner.  



<p>The activists originally boarded the ship to protest the lack of U.S. 

action on its international commitment to tackle the illegal timber 

trade.  This commitment was made at the meeting of the Group of 

Eight Nations (G8) in 1997, when they announced an Action 

Program of Forests, which has seen no effective action in the three 

years since its inception.  



<p>The ship was carrying plywood from a Malaysian logging company, 

Rimbunan Hijau, which has been repeatedly fined for possession of 

illegal timber.
