- March 8 - </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new report from the International Financial Institutions Advisory

Commission, created by Congress in 1998, is adding to calls for drastic

reform of the International Monetary Fund. The "Meltzer Commission" report

urges full cancellation of the debts owed by poor countries to the IMF and

the World Bank as well as significant reduction of the role of these

institutions. Congressional hearings on these issues begin this week. The

following analysts are available for interviews:

<a href="http://www.quixote.org">http://www.quixote.org<br>

</a>Co-director of the Quixote Center, Clarke said: "A Congressional Commission

with members across the political spectrum came together with the common

message of 100 percent debt cancellation and an end to long-term lending by

the IMF. This indicates a common disillusionment with the IMF and should be

the starting point for Congressional action."

<a href="http://www.cepr.net">http://www.cepr.net<br>

</a>Senior policy analyst with the Center for Economic and Policy Research,

Naiman said: "The Commission agreed that the debt of the poor countries to

the IMF and the World Bank should be totally cancelled and that the role of

these institutions should be dramatically reduced. The IMF is buffeted by

increasing Congressional hostility and anticipated mass protests at its

April meeting [in Washington, D.C.; see http://www.a16.org]. The U.S.

Treasury Department, which continues to insist that the IMF and the World

Bank must run the economies of poor countries despite the economic and

social destruction they have caused, is increasingly isolated."

<a href="http://www.50years.org">http://www.50years.org<br>

</a>Director of the 50 Years is Enough Network, Njehu said: "It's very

important that the diverse Commission membership was unified in saying that

the debts of the world's most impoverished countries should be simply

cancelled. These debts are literally unpayable, and have been paid in

practical terms by decades of harsh but failed austerity programs imposed by

the creditor institutions, led by the IMF. Even more important is that the

Commission recommended that the IMF cease long-term development lending;

that would prevent the IMF from re-starting its destructive

debt-and-austerity cycle."

</a>Executive director of the Development Group for Alternative Policies,

Hellinger said: "The Commission would correctly circumscribe the influence

of the IMF and the World Bank, but it incorrectly suggests that the

attraction of foreign private capital and the funding of anti-poverty

programs, service delivery and institutional reforms will yield sustainable

economic development."</font></p>
