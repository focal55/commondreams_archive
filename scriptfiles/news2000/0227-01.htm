- February 27 - At its Board

meeting which concluded today, the Pacifica Foundation elected new

leadership which will take charge later this year.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New officers and five new Board members were elected. When

Chairperson Dr. Mary Frances Berry's term ends in September, David

Acosta, current Vice-Chairperson, will succeed her. Ken Ford, a board

member and current member of the Executive Committee, will succeed

Acosta as Vice Chairperson.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both Acosta and Ford were first nominated to the Governing Board

by the local advisory boards of their home stations, KPFT in Houston,

and WPFW, in Washington, D.C. respectively. In recommending their

election, Dr. Berry noted that they have given generously of their

time and energy in service to Pacifica. Berry will work closely with

Acosta and Ford to effect an orderly transition and will focus on

efforts to heal the conflict over management and policy that the

network has recently endured.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Five new Board members were also elected at today's meeting. They

include Bertram M. Lee and John M. Murdock, of Washington DC, and

Leslie Cagan of New York, whose terms begin immediately, and Valerie

Chambers of Houston and Beth S. Lyons of New York, whose terms begin

in June 2000.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Foundation also announced that Lynn Chadwick is resigning as

Executive Director but will remain as a consultant, tracking

litigation, regulatory issues and other matters. Dr. Berry and the

Board expressed their gratitude to Chadwick for her service during

difficult times. Bessie Wash, manager of WPFW FM in Washington, one of

Pacifica's most successful stations, was named Executive Director to

succeed Ms. Chadwick. She will also remain as station manager.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In announcing these changes at the meeting, Berry pointed out

that ``the network is fiscally sound and growing in some sectors.

Greater financial resources for national programming, exploiting the

possibilities of new technologies, and greater attention to community

service remain problem areas. Challenges lie ahead,'' Berry added, ``but

I believe the new leadership team has just the right mix of commitment

and talent to extend the reach of the progressive voice in the new

Millennium.''

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In other business, the latest Arbitron ratings for the five

Pacifica stations were released. For the first time in history, the

Pacifica total cumulative audience has passed 800,000 per week. WPFW

and KPFT have the highest shares in the network and have experienced

the strongest growth, with WPFW at 1.3 and KPFT at 1.1. The cumulative

audience for the five stations is: WBAI - 176,800; KPFK - 177,000;

KPFA - 156,600; WPFW - 182,000 and KPFT - 127,000.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pacifica Foundation, founded in 1946, owns five radio

stations and has dozens of affiliates throughout community radio.

Pacifica's goals are to ``promote cultural diversity and pluralistic

community expression, to contribute to a lasting understanding between

individuals of all nations, races, creeds and colors, to promote

freedom of the press as a forum for various viewpoints, and to

maintain an independent funding base.''
