- May 31 - Hundreds of thousands of



people across America will unite on June 1, 2000 for the fifth



annual Stand For Children Day.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 2,000 local events are planned across the nation focus



on the theme of "Building Safer and Healthier Communities for All



Children." Additionally, more than 200,000 people will participate



in Cyber Stand, the online education and action component of Stand



For Children Day 2000.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Communities are planning violent toy trade-ins and violence



prevention workshops, rallies to encourage decisionmakers to make



children and families a priority, forums on children's health



needs, playground builds and playspace renovations, events honoring



local child care providers, and a variety of other activities. All



events are listed on Stand For Children's web site at



<a href="http://www.stand.org/">www.stand.org</a>. A few examples are:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In Chicago, Ill., a variety of organizations are working



together to organize the Stand For Children Festival of Hope which



will be attended by more than 1,000 people. In addition to



entertainment and educational activities for children, there will



be information on a variety of health and safety issues. Eligible



families will be able to sign up for KidCare, Illinois' State



Children's Health Insurance Program at the event.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In Columbia, S.C., more than 4,000 people will attend "Stand



For Children: Putting the Pieces Together," a statewide rally to



call for increased services for children and families. Each



county's First Steps to School Readiness program is bringing a



decorated piece of a quilt that shows what their county is doing



for children. The pieces will be pinned together to make an outline



of South Carolina.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In Los Angeles, Calif., UCLA staff and students are holding



a violent toy trade-in for hundreds of children. They have



collected used children's shoes to represent the number of children



killed by gun violence in California in one year. Participants will



learn about ways to end violence in their community, write their



legislators about ways to decrease the level of violence, and sign



up for California's low-cost health insurance program.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In Philadelphia, Pa., more than 4,000 people will participate



in the Stand For Children Safety, Health and Literacy Fair. There



will be pavilions for health and safety issues with information on



issues such as poison control, child abuse prevention,



immunization, and Pennsylvania's Children's Health Insurance



Program. The School District is bringing students in kindergarten



through 2nd grade to the Fair.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Cyber-Stand For Children" will take place from May 22 through



June 9 at <a href="http://www.stand.org/">www.stand.org</a>. More than 200,000 people will participate



and learn more about the issues affecting the safety and health of



children and families, send cyber-letters to Members of Congress,



share their thoughts about issues affecting children, take the



Stand For Children pledge, and find out how to take action for



children locally and nationally.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first Stand For Children Day in 1996 drew more than 300,000



people to the Lincoln Memorial in the largest demonstration of



commitment to children in U.S. history. In 1997, 700 events focused



on the health issues, and encouraged legislators to pass the Child



Health Insurance Program. In 1998, 1,200 events focused attention



on issues related to child care, and helped pass the Kerry/Bond



amendment. In 1999, the theme was "Ready to Learn, Ready to



Succeed," and 1,700 events focused on issues affecting children's



ability to achieve in school.
