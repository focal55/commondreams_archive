- June 9 - The following was released



today by Clean Air Trust:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The headlines of the past two weeks have seemed bizarre, to say



the least: "U.S. Facing Dilemma over Super-Clean Gas...Chicago



Drivers Pay $2/Gallon for Gasoline... Wall Street Sees Wide Refining



Margins: Strong 2Q Company Profits."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What the heck is happening to gasoline prices in the heartland?



Who stands to profit? Is the oil industry engaged in piracy at the



pumps?

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here, in brief, is what we know. By June 1, oil companies were



required to begin selling cleaner-burning ("reformulated") gasoline



in certain high-smog parts of the nation - principally the Northeast,



the Gulf Coast, and parts of the Midwest, including Chicago and



Milwaukee. This is the second phase of the cleaner-burning gas



program that began in 1995.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Almost as soon as the new fuel began flowing through the pipelines



in May, prices began to inch up as the oil industry started whining



about "supply problems." (There was a temporary supply shortage in



St. Louis because of a pipeline problem. Because of that, EPA



granted oil companies a temporary waiver from selling cleaner-burning



gasoline in St. Louis. EPA denied similar waiver requests for



Chicago and Milwaukee on the grounds that supplies are adequate.)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As we headed into Memorial Day, prices went up -- and generally



have stayed up. (Footnote: When cleaner-gasoline programs of this



sort begin, prices generally experience a brief bump and then settle



down. EPA has projected the cleaner gasoline ultimately will cost a



penny or two extra per gallon. Prior EPA projections of this sort



have proven accurate or even an overstatement of costs.)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The interesting thing in this case is that cost of cleaner-burning



gasoline is much higher in Chicago and Milwaukee than in the rest of



the nation. Consider the following from the U.S. Department of



Energy's Energy Information Administration:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On June 5, the price of self-serve regular cleaner-burning



gasoline was about two cents a gallon higher than nearby conventional



gasoline in the Gulf Coast. In the Northeast, the price spread was



about seven or eight cents a gallon. But in the Midwest - that is,



Chicago and Milwaukee -- the difference was a whopping 23 cents a



gallon! Wisconsin lawmakers are suing EPA for the right to poison



their constituents with dirtier gasoline, while the U.S. Justice



Department is said to be launching an investigation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here are a few questions that ought to be answered in any probe:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- First and foremost, the oil industry has known for more than



five years that it would be selling the cleaner-burning gasoline by



June 1. Why didn't the industry plan for known supply needs? Is this



some sort of price-gouging scheme?

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The biggest difference between the cleaner-burning gasoline



sold in Milwaukee and Chicago is that it contains ethanol, rather



than the MTBE used in the Northeast and the Gulf Coast. Are big



ethanol producers (like Archer-Daniels-Midland) complicit in some



scheme to drive up prices? (ADM, by the way, was fined this week by



the European Commission for operating an alleged global price-fixing



cartel.)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Recently the Clinton Administration and some members of



Congress have proposed that future gasoline include a national



"renewable" fuels component -- that is, ethanol, including an



increasing percentage produced from biomass. The oil industry is



bitterly opposed to a renewable fuels standard. Is the Midwestern



price problem connected to an oil industry desire to discredit



renewable fuels?

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A few final factoids:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The American Petroleum Institute, the big oil industry trade



association, has gone on record opposing waivers of the



cleaner-burning gasoline requirements.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The respected publication Octane Week reported June 5 that



"Wall Street is already predicting a good showing for the nation's



oil companies" in the second quarter, and that "much of this



quarter's performance stems from healthy refining margins."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In other words, some consumers may be upset, but the oil companies



are doing just fine.
