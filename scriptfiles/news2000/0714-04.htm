- July 14 - Responding to the housing crisis in Minnesota and

throughout the nation, Senator Wellstone today co-sponsored an amendment to the

Estate Tax Elimination Act that would commit $5 billion for the production of

affordable housing.  Republicans unfortunately defeated the measure by a vote of

52-45 while they pushed onward with huge tax cuts targeted exclusively to the

top 2% of wealthiest Americans. In an attempt to increase and preserve the stock

of housing affordable to millions of low-income families in the United States,

the Wellstone amendment sought to provide funds to increase the production of

affordable housing through state matching grants and HUD competitive grants. 



<p>“Housing is one of the most critical needs this nation faces, but Senate

Republicans choose to  ignore it.  Instead, they fight on to help their powerful

friends; the privileged and the special few,” Wellstone said.  “Here in

Washington we congratulate ourselves daily on the good economic times.  Yet, in

1997, 5.4 million households with 12.3 million people paid more than one half of

their income in rent or lived in seriously substandard housing.  Who are these

12.3 million people?  1.5 million are elderly persons, 4.3 million are children

and between 1.1 and 1.4 million are adults with disabilities.  We must make a

commitment to address the shortage of affordable housing in this country, and I

will not give up.”



<p>Over the past five years, more than $20 billion has either been rescinded or

diverted from federal housing programs while the number of Americans who cannot

afford decent housing continues to rise.  A July 1998 study by the Family

Housing Fund reported that there are 68,900 renters with incomes below $10,000

in Minneapolis-St. Paul and only 31,200 housing units with rents affordable to

those families.  



<p>“In my state of Minnesota, a family must earn $11.54 an hour, 40 hours a week,

52 weeks out of the year to afford a fair market rent for a two-bedroom

apartment.  That’s more than double the minimum wage.  In fact, to afford a

two-bedroom apartment at minimum wage, families must work at least 88 hours a

week.  We can afford to do better.  I know we can afford to solve this problem.”

                    

<p>The amendment, introduced by Senator John Kerry, would have placed $5 billion in

a Trust Fund to be made available for state matching grants and to the United

States Department of Housing and Urban Development to award competitive grants

to intermediaries, such as large, national non-profit organizations, who will

then be required to leverage private funds.
