<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- January 30 - In a broadside against the Clinton administration's $1.6 billion anti-drug

aid package to Colombia, two influential senators voiced strong opposition

to the plan weeks before it was announced.  Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT)

and Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA) sent a letter to Secretary of State Madeleine

K. Albright in December questioning the wisdom of pouring billions of

additional tax dollars into the Colombian anti-narcotics sink hole.  The

letter, obtained by Arms Trade Insider, noted that "hundreds of millions of

dollars in assistance to the Colombian security forces, has not reduced

coca cultivation in Colombia, the flow of cocaine or heroin to the U.S.

from Colombia, or the profits of drug traffickers." Despite the

administration's belief that Congressional approval is a given, the

senators' letter revealed a major crack in support for Colombian drug aid.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a recent interview, Leahy went even further by voicing a long-held fear

on Capitol Hill that the aid program is a "counter-insurgency policy in the

name of a counter-drug policy."  The terminology used by both Colombian

President Andres Pastrana and the Clinton administration supports Leahy's

view that this aid is earmarked to fight insurgents.  During his Washington

visit earlier this week, Pastrana tipped the administration's hand,

remarking that "If [the rebels] are in the [drug] business, logically, [the

aid] is going to be used against them."  In Colombia, narco- traffickers

are indistinguishable from insurgents.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is misleading for the administration to suggest that U.S. military aid

will be used only to stop the drug trade.  In a White House fact sheet

outlining the administration's aid plan, the first goal is to help "the

Colombian Government push into coca-growing regions of southern Colombia,

which are now dominated by insurgent guerrillas."  Clearly, providing

Colombia with 30 Blackhawk and 33 Huey transport helicopters, as well as

radar, aircraft and airfield upgrades, will help them fight a war against

insurgents, not just traffickers.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Clinton administration's decision to provide more military aid to the

Colombian armed forces is an escalation of U.S. involvement in Colombia's

civil war.  An erie parallel exists between U.S. involvement in Colombia

today and U.S. involvement in Vietnam in the early 1960's.  The U.S.

already suffered its first casualties in Colombia last July, when five Army

personnel were killed in a  plane crash while providing intelligence and

reconnaissance support for a combined U.S.-Colombian anti-drug mission.

The question to ask is: how long will the U.S. continue to risk American

lives and resources by militarizing the drug war in Colombia.  Rather, the

administration should follow Kennedy and Leahy's advice and "provide

stronger support for diplomatic efforts to strengthen the peace process and

thereby create the conditions necessary for a more effective

counter-narcotics strategy, which should include alternative development

programs."
