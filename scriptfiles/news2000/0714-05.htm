<br>

Editor of the recently released book "Police Brutality: An Anthology," 

Nelson said today: "On the day President Clinton addressed the NAACP, the 

mayor of Philadelphia was not present because a dozen or more of his 

officers were caught on video beating and kicking a suspect. Clearly there 

is a problem when it comes to policing citizens of color and respecting our 

constitutional rights... In the last decade we have seen millions of 

dollars go into beefing up police forces nationally and at this moment we 

have this much-lauded drop in street crime. It is time we look at 

re-imagining and retraining the police as to what their role is in a 

democratic society. We need to take a hard look at the use of deadly force; 

we need to have diversity not just be a sidebar, but who America really is."

Syndicated columnist and author of "Justice: A Question of Race," Rodriguez 

said today: "We focus on police brutality when we have these big video 

cases. Do we just react to each one and say that it's bad or do we take it 

to another level? Police brutality affects whoever is dehumanized, usually 

people of color, but at times, political protesters of all colors. At best 

an officer is fired, but what we really need is a national truth 

commission. Instead, we have politicians addressing the NAACP or the 

National Council of La Raza pretending to speak like the people they are 

talking to. When I grew up, politicians would come wearing a big sombrero 

and eat a taco and somehow that was supposed to make us want to vote for 

them. It's like putting on black face or brown face. Both Gore and Bush are 

guilty of this kind of thing. It's not a coincidence that many people are 

alienated from politics."

<br>

National executive director of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights and 

executive director of Bay Area Police Watch, Jones said today: "Clinton has 

been all rhetoric and little action in getting rid of the problem of police 

brutality. There have been conferences, there has been a meaningless 

executive order against 'Driving While Black,' but there has been little 

done with any real teeth. The Justice Department conducted an investigation 

into corruption in the Philadelphia police department, but obviously 

there's been little progress made."

<br>

Professor of politics at the University of California at Santa Cruz and 

author of "Welfare's End," Mink said today: "With the notable exception of 

affirmative action, the Clinton-Gore administration hasn't tackled the most 

resilient and pernicious manifestations of racism and inequality. And even 

on affirmative action, where Clinton and Gore have held the line against 

GOP assaults, they've also moved the line: their 'mend-it-don't-end-it' 

approach is a concession to conservative critics. This same sort of New 

Democrat concordance with conservatives keeps capital punishment alive and 

brought us welfare 'reform.' No surprise, then, that Gore never mentioned 

welfare, let alone welfare justice, in laying out his civil rights agenda 

to the NAACP."</font>
