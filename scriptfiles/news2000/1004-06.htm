- October 4 - Physicians for Social



Responsibility (PSR), which won the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize for



its citizen-diplomacy work for disarmament, today issued a



challenge to Vice-Presidential candidates Joe Lieberman and Dick



Cheney. PSR called on both to use their debate on Oct. 5 to



show their support for genuine global security through the



de-alerting of the 5,000 Russian and American nuclear missiles



currently on hair trigger alert.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PSR, in conjunction with the Back From the Brink campaign for



de-alerting, has placed a full-page advertisement in the



Danville Advocate-Messenger for the day of the debate. The ad



asks both candidates:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Are you ready to confront the real nuclear missile threat?

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Few people realize that both the U.S. and Russia maintain



thousands of nuclear weapons instantly ready to fire," said



Martin Butcher, PSR's Director of Security Programs. "The U.S. and



Russia are no longer enemies; why do both nations keep up this



capability to wipe each other out? The next administration must



act to ensure American, and global, security by defusing this



deadly missile threat."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PSR will be present in Danville for the debate. Copies of the



newspaper ad will be distributed, together with associated



briefing materials and questions for the candidates. PSR and its



20,000 physician members have built up their expertise on



nuclear weapons and nuclear war over 40 years. In a landmark New



England Journal of Medicine article in 1998, PSR physicians



examined the dangers of accidental nuclear war, concluding there



could be no meaningful public health response to such a tragedy



and recommending de-alerting as the only sensible prescription



for true security for America.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, both campaigns are confronted with the dreadful



reality that accidental nuclear war is more likely than ever. As



the Russian military infrastructure decays and confidence in



their ability to maintain missiles or early warning radar safely



decreases, the need to de-alert nuclear forces increases daily.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This will be the central national security question for the



next administration. It is vital to know where the candidates



for the nations top offices stand," said Robert K. Musil, Ph.D.,



Executive Director and CEO of PSR. "Today we asking the men who



would be a heartbeat from the Presidency, what will you do to



make America safe?"</font>
