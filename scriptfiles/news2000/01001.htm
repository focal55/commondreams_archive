- January 22 - SOA-trained Guatemalan Col. Byron Disrael Lima Estrada 

was arrested, along with his son,

January 21 for the 1998 murder of Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Gerardi. 

According to a declassified US Defense

Intelligence Agency biographic sketch, Lima Estrada took Military Police 

training at the US Army School of the Americas

(SOA) now located at Ft. Benning, GA. Lima Estrada went on to head the 

infamous D-2 (G-2) Military Intelligence agency

at the height of the genocide campaign in Guatemala’s civil war.<br>

<br>



Bishop Gerardi was bludgeoned to death in his home two days after he 

released a human rights report that implicated the

D-2 in human rights atrocities committed during the war. The report, 

"Guatemala: Never Again," based on thousands of

testimonies collected by the archbishop’s office, provided a chilling 

catalog of the mechanisms of violence. In a chapter titled

"D-2: The Very Name of Fear," the report severely criticizes the 

military intelligence agency headed by Lima Estrada from

1983-85. It cited the D-2 for playing a "central role in the conduct of 

military operations, in massacres, extra-judicial

executions, forced disappearances and torture."<br>

<br>

The arrest of Lima Estrada will add to the mounting evidence against the 

US Army School of the Americas. The SOA has

come under increasing criticism by groups in the United States and Latin 

America who cite numerous human rights and US

State Department reports that link SOA graduates to atrocities in Latin 

America. The 78,000- member Leadership

Conference of Catholic nuns and the 13-million member AFL-CIO are two of 

the spectrum of organizations that have called

for the closing of the infamous US Army school. In commemoration of 

another SOA-linked assassination in El Salvador, over

10,000 human rights activists gathered to protest the Ft. Benning combat 

training school last November. Twenty-three now

face six month prison sentences for their nonviolent protest.<br>

<br>

In July 1999 the US Congress voted 230-197 to cut funds to the SOA. The 

measure failed in the conference committee, but

another vote is expected this year. Rep. Joseph Moakley (MA) and Sen. 

Richard Durbin (IL) have introduced companion

bills calling for the SOA’s closing. The arrest in Guatemala will 

bolster their efforts and counter Pentagon and Congressional

supporters who argue that SOA atrocities are a thing of the past.<br>
