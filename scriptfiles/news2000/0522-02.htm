<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coalition Of Women's, Health, Religious &amp; Pro-Choice Organizations



To Announce Multi-Year, Grassroots Organizing &amp; Education Campaign

To



Increase Access To Women's Reproductive Health Care

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A five-year relentless legislative assault on the availability of



reproductive health care has created an access gap making even some



basic medical care inaccessible to many women -- especially



low-income women, young women and women of color. The Campaign



for Access and Reproductive Equity (C.A.R.E.2000), a new initiative



uniting hundreds of national and local organizations from a



broad range of disciplines, will launch a counteroffensive on



Wednesday, May 24, during a news conference in the Lisagor Room



of the National Press Club at 9 a.m.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">C.A.R.E.2000, a two-year grassroots, public education project of



the National Network of Abortion Funds, will recruit, train and



empower women across America to reduce barriers to health care and



increase equality of reproductive health care services for all women.



C.A.R.E.2000 will address an array of the factors contributing to the



inequitable medical care for women of color, young women, and



low-income women, including health care access, welfare reform, and



sexuality education. The Washington news conference launches the



project in the District and Chicago. C.A.R.E.2000 will roll out in



three additional states in July.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the speakers at the news conference will be three women



sharing personal stories about their difficulties accessing



reproductive health care. Researchers from the Alan Guttmacher



Institute will present new data on the difficulty low-income women



face accessing abortion services.
