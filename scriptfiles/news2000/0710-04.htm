- July 10 - "How many times do killings committed by the security forces or their paramilitary

     allies have to be denounced before the Colombian government brings the

     perpetrators to justice?" asked Amnesty International as six men were killed and

     63 families of La Unión have began to flee their homes.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     In the wake of yet another massacre against inhabitants of the Peace Community

     of San José de Apartadó, municipality of Apartadó (northern department of

     Antioquia), Amnesty International urged the international community to stop being

     a bystander and to take effective action to stop the killings.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     At least six men from the village La Unión were shot dead on 8 July 2000:

     Rigoberto Guzmán, Elodino Rivera, Diofanor Correa, Humberto Sepúlveda,

     Pedro Zapata, Jaime Guzmán. On that same day approximately 20 hooded men

     had entered the village, which is part of the Peace Community of San José de

     Apartadó. Reportedly, a helicopter belonging to the XVII Brigade of the army

     had flown overhead and troops attached to the XVII Brigade were camped

     nearby. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The soldiers searched each house in La Unión and took the inhabitants to the

     centre of the village where the men were separated from the women and children.

     After shooting the six men, the community was then ordered to leave: "Tienen 20

     días para desalojar toda la zona, porque esto lo vamos a acabar." ("You

     have 20 days to leave the region, because we are not having any more of this.")

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     While this was happening in La Unión some peasant farmers travelling on the road

     between Apartadó and San José de Apartadó were reportedly detained by the

     army. Two of them were threatened and reportedly told that they were operating

     with paramilitary forces: "vamos juntos y vamos a terminar con todo." ("We

     are together and we are going to finish this off.")

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     On the day of the massacre the military personnel camped around La Unión

     reportedly stated several times that there were guerrillas within the village. Two

     days earlier, in another village belonging to the Peace Community of San José de

     Apartadó, military personnel had stated that: "La Comunidad de Paz es una

     comunidad de guerrilleros. Vamos a ingresar con los paramilitaries." ("The

     Peace Community is a community of guerrillas. We are going to go in with the

     paramilitaries.")

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Military authorities denied having any presence in the La Unión area when notified

     of the massacre by national and international representatives. In response, they

     said they would send Batallón Contra-Guerrilla No. 35 Díaz López

     (Counter-Guerrilla Battalion No. 35 Díaz López).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     On Monday, 3 July a large number of troops belonging to the Batallón

     Bejaranos (Bejaranos Battalion) and Batallón Contra-Guerrilla No. 35 Díaz

     López, both attached to the Brigada XVII (XVII Brigade of the Colombian

     Army), marching along the road between Apartadó and San José de Apartadó

     were observed on their way up the Abibe mountain range (Serranía de Abibe).

     At least two armed men wearing army-style uniforms, but wearing no insignia,

     were also seen amongst the soldiers. 

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Colombian government must urgently bring human rights violators to justice,

     to break the links between the armed forces and illegal paramilitary groups and

     dismantle paramilitary organizations in line with repeated UN recommendations,"

     Amnesty International urged. 

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The human rights clauses built into the U.S.A. military aid package are

     meaningless unless decisive steps are taken immediately. The international

     community must act now before the human rights crisis is deepened by the

     increased military aid. With no controls the increased military aid could deepen the

     human rights crisis by boosting the confidence of the Colombian armed forces in

     the implementation of its counter-insurgency strategy, characterized by the

     widespread and systematic violation of human rights."

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Background Information</b><br>

     San José de Apartadó is made up of 32 communities. It is the community's

     location and the frequent presence of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de

     Colombia (FARC), Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, in the area which

     has resulted in the inhabitants of San José de Apartadó being labelled subversives

     or subversive sympathizers by the security forces and their paramilitary allies.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Faced with the constant threat of forced displacement and further human rights

     violations, the communities sought the support of the Catholic Church and

     Colombian human rights organizations to examine strategies which would enable

     the community to resist forcible displacement. This led to members of 17 of the

     communities of San José de Apartadó declaring themselves a Comunidad de Paz

     (Peace Community) on 23 March 1997. This declaration represented a call to the

     warring factions on both sides of the conflict to respect the right of the civilian

     population not to be drawn into the conflict and to respect the communities' right

     to life. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Over 60 members of the community of San José de Apartadó have been killed by

     members of the Colombian Army, their paramilitary auxiliaries and by the FARC,

     since March 1997. The army and their paramilitary allies have since labelled

     members of the community as guerrilla sympathizers while guerrilla forces have

     accused them of siding with their enemies.</font>
