- March 1 - Congress must intervene quickly to stop an

increasingly used business practice that robs unwitting consumers and employees of their

fundamental right to seek redress in court when wronged by large companies, Public Citizen

President Joan Claybrook told lawmakers today.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem stems from corporations&#146; escalating use of

mandatory arbitration clauses in standard contracts, such as those signed by employees

when they are hired and by consumers when they receive a credit card, get a mortgage, or

buy a personal computer or cell phone, Claybrook said in <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/civjus/arbitration/3100test.html">testimony

submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee&#146;s Subcommittee on Administrative

Oversight and the Courts</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mandatory arbitration clauses require consumer disputes to be argued

in a private, secret dispute settlement system with an arbitrator making decisions that

are final and cannot be appealed. Thus, consumer access to public courts, juries and

judges is blocked. When consumers buy or use the product or services, they sign away their

right to sue the company, usually in ignorance. Arbitration is costly for consumers, and

the outcome usually favors the company. Further, consumers often don&#146;t even see these

clauses because they are usually buried deep in fine print that is presented in a

standard, take-it-or-leave-it contract, Claybrook said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;These clauses are designed to give large businesses

significant advantages in their disputes with consumers, employees and small

businesses,&quot; Claybrook said, &quot;By insisting that consumers and employees waive

their right to their day in court as a precondition to buying a service or product,

corporate America is trying to insulate itself from the consequences of doing business

negligently, recklessly and in violation of the law.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These clauses are fundamentally unfair to consumers, she said in her

testimony. Consumers don&#146;t have equal bargaining power with large companies,

don&#146;t have much experience with arbitration, often do not understand what mandatory

arbitration is, do not realize that they are signing away their right to take the company

to court and don&#146;t have the power to negotiate the arbitration clauses out of the

contracts, Claybrook said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clauses are often lopsided, allowing the corporation to retain

its right to take the consumer to court. Arbitration fees are hefty -- hundreds of dollars

to file for arbitration and thousands for a hearing -- and often must be paid up-front by

the person bringing the dispute. Class actions are prohibited, thereby providing legal

immunity to corporations that gain substantially through small injuries to many people.

Further, arbitration often must be conducted in a place convenient to the corporation but

not for the consumer, and the corporation generally gets to pick the arbitrator, giving

arbitrators who seek repeat business the incentive to issue rulings favoring businesses,

Claybrook said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The impact is to deny consumers a right guaranteed in the Seventh

Amendment of the Constitution, which states that in lawsuits in which &quot;the value in

controversy shall exceed $20, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved,&quot;

Claybrook told lawmakers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Claybrook noted that Public Citizen does not oppose arbitration.

Rather, it should be entered into voluntarily <i>after</i> a dispute arises, and the

consumer or employee should know what rights are being waived, who will arbitrate the

dispute, who will pay for the arbitration, whether discovery will be allowed, what

information will be made public and whether any recourse is available after the

arbitration.</font>
