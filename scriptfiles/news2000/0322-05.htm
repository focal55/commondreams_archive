- March 22 - The Sierra Club today released a new report, <b>Crude 

     Behavior: The Oil Industry's Influence Over Our Nation's Energy 

     Policy</b>, detailing ways petroleum corporations and their Congressional 

     allies have contributed to America's dependence on foreign oil, and 

     outlining paths to energy independence.  Solutions to America's rising 

     gas prices include restoring the ban on exporting Alaskan oil in the 

     short term, and improving automobile fuel economy and reforming the 

     campaign finance system in the long term.

     

     <p>"Some members of Congress are using the oil price hike as an excuse to 

     renew their calls for drilling the Arctic Refuge," the report states.  

     "Clearly, destroying one of the most spectacular places on the planet 

     is too high a price to pay for politics as usual.  Instead of using 

     the last quarter-century to reduce America's oil dependency, Congress 

     has kowtowed to the oil companies and auto industry -- refusing to 

     encourage American car companies to make more fuel efficient cars and 

     voting against research and incentives for alternate energy use."

     

     <p>In early 1989, President George Bush was gung-ho to drill for oil in 

     the fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  And the oil industry's 

     Congressional allies were charging full-steam-ahead to open the area 

     for drilling.  Only the Exxon Valdez disaster on March 24, 1989 

     stopped them dead in their tracks.  Seeing oil-slicked birds, dead 

     otters and blackened beaches gave Americans pause about Alaskan oil 

     exploitation.

     

     <p>Since then, however, America has done little to protect itself.  Our 

     nation's dependence on foreign oil drew us into military conflict in 

     the Persian Gulf.  Fuel economy for our nation's fleet has fallen to 

     its lowest level since 1980.  In each of the past five years, Congress 

     has prevented the Clinton Administration from even considering 

     increasing fuel economy standards.  The oil industry continues to buy 

     influence, donating more than $56 million to political candidates 

     between the Valdez spill and the 1998 election (www.opensecrets.org).  

     And turn over a few rocks on the beach at Sleepy Bay on Alaska's 

     Latouche Island, and oil from the Exxon Valdez will still ooze from 

     the muck.  

     

     

<p><b>Short-Term Solution: Restore the Ban on Exporting Alaskan Oil</b>

     <p> Those clamoring loudest for drilling the Arctic to "lower" prices 

     are the same people who fought to lift the export ban on Alaskan oil 

     in an effort to raise prices five years ago.  

     <p> During the debate five years ago, the Anchorage Daily News reported, 

     "For British Petroleum, the North Slope's largest producer, lifting 

     the oil-export ban is a piece of a larger market strategy to drive up 

     prices." 

     <p> The General Accounting Office found that "lifting the export ban 

     raised the relative prices of Alaskan North Slope and comparable 

     California oils between $.98 and $1.30 higher per barrel than they 

     would have been had the ban not been lifted." 

     <p> The President can restore the ban on exporting Alaskan oil with a 

     stroke of his pen.  This immediate step will provide relief to 

     families and protect our environment.  Members of Congress, led by 

     Reps. George Miller and Peter DeFazio, this week called on the 

     President to exercise that power, and they have introduced 

     legislationto restore the ban, if the President does not act more 

     quickly.

     

     

<p><b>Long-Term Solution: Raise Fuel Efficiency

     </b>

<p> Raising Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards to 45 miles 

     per gallon for cars and 34 mpg for light trucks would save 2 million 

     barrels a day: more oil than we import from the Persian Gulf, 

     mid-range estimates of oil in the Arctic, and off-shore oil combined.

     <p> With hybrid engines, the technology exists today to improve fuel 

     economy without impeding safety or inconveniencing motorists.

     

     

<p><b>Long-Term Solution: Reform Campaign Finance

     </b>

<p> During the 1997-98 election cycle alone, the Big Oil and Automotive 

     lobbies handed out   $33.5 million in political contributions. 

     (<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pubs/bigpicture2000/index.htm">www.opensecrets.org/pubs/bigpicture2000/index.htm</a>)

     <p> Big Money's control over Congress leads to favors such as the 

     Congressional rider forbidding the Department of Transportation from 

     even studying the issue of raising fuel economy.

     <p> Real reform, such as passing the McCain-Feingold proposal, would 

     eliminate the influence of Big Oil's lobby and its allies in Congress 

     whose actions keep America dependent on foreign oil.

     

     

<p>The report will be available at the Sierra Club's Arctic website on 

     Thursday, March 23, (<a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/wilderness/arctic/index.asp">www.sierraclub.org/wilderness/arctic/index.asp</a>).
