- March 15 - The following was



released today by the United Food and Commercial Workers:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Workers keep on winning in their fight to have a voice at



Wal-Mart. Meat and seafood department employees at the Wal-Mart



Supercenter in Palestine, Texas, will have a choice for a voice



as the result of a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) decision



ordering a union representation election.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wal-Mart's union-busting lawyers went bust with their legal



maneuvering before the labor board. The board rejected the union



buster's claim that meat department employees should not be able to



vote because Wal-Mart was planning to change responsibilities for



meat workers at all Wal-Mart Supercenters. The announcement of



Wal-Mart's supposed plan to shift to case-ready meat came after



meat workers at the Jacksonville, Texas, Supercenter voted for



UFCW-representation on Feb. 17.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wal-Mart consistently uses the legal process to delay and try to



subvert the exercise of employee rights. In Jacksonville, Wal-Mart



claimed that meat workers were not a distinct and separate group of



employees, so they should not be able to vote for union



representation. In Palestine, they claimed that the meat



department workers may have different responsibilities at some



future date; therefore, employees should not be able vote on the



union.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The board nor the workers are being fooled. In yesterday's



decision to order an election at the Palestine store, the board



said, "...the mere speculation as to the uncertainty of future



operations is not sufficient to dismiss a petition or decline to



hold an election."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The board raised serious concerns about the veracity of



Wal-Mart's claim that it will eliminate all fresh cut meat products



in its Supercenters. Wal-Mart asserts that it will use all



case-ready meat products in some of its stores beginning in May or



June. The board noted that there are still "critical details



to work out" and that are "no specific dates" indicated in an



agreement with the company's primary meat supplier. Wal-Mart cited



a pilot program as evidence of its intent to move to case-ready



meat. The board noted that "the pilot program is ongoing and that



there are meat processors at these pilot program stores who are



still cutting and processing."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Workers dismissed Wal-Mart's claims as just another attempt to



silence their voices and to deny them their rights under the law.



Wal-Mart workers from Palestine and Jacksonville stood united and



determined at a March 13, 2000 celebration rally in Tyler, Texas.



Workers declared, "We won't back down. We want a union at



Wal-Mart."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National and state union leaders vowed to make Wal-Mart's



anti-worker activity a priority issue with the 13.5 million members



of the AFL-CIO.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We won't stand by and let Wal-Mart take our money at the cash



registers as consumers, then stab us in the back as workers," said



John Sweeney, president of the national AFL-CIO.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meat department workers in the Ocala, Fla., Wal-Mart



Supercenter have also filed a petition for a union representation



election. Wal-Mart is expected to again oppose the right of these



workers to have an election. An NLRB hearing is scheduled for



March 27.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The board will set a date for the Palestine election in the next



few days.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union



is the largest organization of retail workers in North America,



with 1.4 million members. UFCW represents workers at retail



food industry leaders such as Kroger and Safeway.</font>
