- October 31 - Ralph Nader's surging campaign today introduced

his latest radio and television spots.



<p>In the new 30-second television message and 60-second radio spot, both

entitled "Grow Up," different children sarcastically relate what they hope

will be their future when they grow up and are old enough to vote. The spots

are parodies of a popular television advertising campaign that was first

seen on the Super Bowl two years ago.



<p>"While the other candidates continue to attack each other and our campaign,

we want to remind people to focus squarely on what is most important in this

election-the future of our democracy and our political system," said Theresa

Amato, campaign manager for Nader 2000.  "Ralph Nader is the alternative to

the corporate-funded duopoly that is selling our democracy to the highest

contributors."



<p>The new Nader messages will air in up to 30 markets before election day,

according to Bill Hillsman of North Woods Advertising, the company that

created the spots.  For more information, visit the campaign's website,

<a href="http://www.VoteNader.org">www.VoteNader.org</a>.
