- July 5 - Citing bargain-basement



leases to rich developers at the Tampa International Airport, a



national taxpayers organization today awarded the Federal Aviation



Administration (FAA) the dubious distinction of being the first



recipient of the revived Golden Fleece Award.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the famous waste-busting



award, former Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire asked Taxpayers for



Common Sense to revive the Golden Fleece Award. Today's award is the



second time the FAA has received a Golden Fleece for the same



problem. In 1985, Proxmire also awarded the FAA a Fleece for



below-market leases at Florida airports.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A half-billion taxpayer dollars is being hijacked, but the FAA



just says have a pleasant flight," said Ralph DeGennaro, president

of



Taxpayers for Common Sense. "I challenge Transportation Secretary



Rodney Slater and FAA Administrator Jane Garvey to say which side



they are on -- champions of taxpayers or protectors of those who



fleece them?"

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In March 1985, I gave the FAA the award for fleecing taxpayers



out of millions at Florida airports through below-market leases.



Now, independent auditors confirm that over the last 15 years, the



FAA has basically done nothing to fix it," said Proxmire today in a



videotaped statement released at the press conference.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"That is why I am delighted that, 25 years after I originated the



Golden Fleece Award, Taxpayers for Common Sense is reviving it!



Agency bureaucrats and politicians are relentless in dreaming up ways



to waste your money. The Tampa airport rip-off is a textbook example



of why we need the Fleece now more than ever," continued Proxmire.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is the first Golden Fleece award presented since 1988, when



Senator Proxmire retired from the Senate after 31 years. The revival



of the Golden Fleece Award is sponsored by Taxpayers for Common



Sense, a national budget watchdog organization. Senator Proxmire is



Honorary Chair of the group's Advisory Committee.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a 1992 report and a follow-up letter in 1999, the independent



Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of



Transportation (DOT) concluded that there is no justification for the



Tampa International Airport undervaluing this lease. The IG



recommended that the airport should not receive any more federal



funds until it has fixed the problem.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lease in question is a 155-acre tract known as the Boy Scout



site on Tampa International Airport lands. The airport values land



leased to the U.S. Post Office at $12 per square foot. But the



airport values land leased to build a new mall to a private interest



for only 41 cents per square foot. An analysis found that charging



market rent would return about $500 million more to federal taxpayers



over the duration of the lease.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"FCAN objects to any corporation or government agency shifting its



costs of doing business to us the consumers and taxpayers. If FAA's



failure to enforce its own rules and make developers pay their fair



share forces Tampa airport customers to pay higher airport taxes,



then this is totally unfair," said Rosette Walsh, President of the



Florida Consumer Action Network.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Feared by bureaucrats and politicians, and beloved by taxpayers



of all political stripes, the Golden Fleece Award is back to save



money for a new generation of taxpayers," said DeGennaro. "We will



also honor Senator Proxmire's legacy and maintain high standards of



accuracy, fairness and non-partisanship." Taxpayers for Common Sense



initially plans to announce Golden Fleece Awards on an occasional



basis, at least quarterly.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 1975 to 1988, Senator Proxmire issued a monthly Golden Fleece



Award that highlighted a specific example of a "wasteful, ridiculous



or ironic use of the taxpayer's money" in order to galvanize public



opinion against wasteful spending. The awards helped save millions



of dollars by causing targeted programs to be curtailed, modified or



canceled, and by putting government officials on notice to prevent



future waste.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In December 1999, TCS inducted Proxmire and his Fleece Award into



the group's Taxpayer Hall of Fame and issued a 26-page appreciation



and history of the Fleece and Proxmire. For this detailed



information, see www.taxpayer.net/goldenfleece. The report can
