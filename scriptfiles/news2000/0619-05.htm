- June 19 - The Supreme Court today ruled 6-3 that a Texas public school district's practice of opening high school football games with a prayer is unconstitutional. In the case, <i>Santa Fe Independent School District v.Jane Doe</i>, People For the American Way Foundation participated as <i>amicus</i> to uphold the religious liberty of parents and students who protested the school-sponsored prayer.

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Santa Fe school district tried to promote religion by disguising it as neutral free speech, but the Court has unmasked the district's policy for what it is – unconstitutional, school-sponsored, captive-audience prayer," said PFAWF President Ralph G. Neas "This school district has a history of crossing the line, time and again, by favoring, if not coercing, religious expression. But the Court saw through this subterfuge and upheld the Constitution and its guarantee of religious liberty for all Americans, regardless of their beliefs."

    </font></p>

<p>

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The narrowness of this decision is troubling," Neas added, "and it indicates how dramatically one or two more right-wing Justices would shift the balance and redefine Americans' fundamental religious liberty."

    </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

      The school district's history of promoting expressions of certain kinds of Protestant Christian faith and of intolerance toward minority faiths was a part of the evidence presented in this case. The prayer policy struck down today was instituted by the school as a substitute for the previous practice of authorizing students designated as "chaplains" to present Christian prayers over the public address system at home football games. In addition, one of the student plaintiffs was subjected to ridicule by a teacher who characterized her religion (Mormonism) as "non-Christian" and "cult-like," prompting other students to characterize the plaintiff's faith as "evil" and "kind of like the KKK."

    </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

      In addition, court documents show that the district court where the case was initially filed had to threaten the school district with "THE HARSHEST POSSIBLE CONTEMPT SANCTIONS" and/or "CRIMINAL LIABILITY" in order to halt attempts by administrators, teachers, and other employees of the school district "overtly or covertly to ferret out the identifies of the Plaintiffs … by means of bogus petitions, questionnaires, individual interrogation, or downright 'snooping.' " (emphasis in original)

    </font></p>

<p>

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The fact that Justices Scalia and Thomas, the Court's most right-wing justices, would side, along with Chief Justice Rehnquist, with a school district that has so abused individual rights is a sobering reminder of how precarious the balance is that, for now, protects our freedoms," said Neas. "It would only take two more Justices like Scalia and Thomas to turn back the clock for all Americans."

    </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

      People For the American Way Foundation recently released a report,"Courting Disaster," that details the devastating impact that a further rightward shift on the U.S. Supreme Court would have on Americans' fundamental rights and freedoms. The report documents exactly how adding just one or two Justices who share Scalia's and Thomas' far-right legal philosophy could tip the balance on the Court for decades to come.
