- May 19 - </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ROBERT E. SCOTT, <a href="mailto:rscott@epinet.org">rscott@epinet.org</a>,

<a href="http://www.epinet.org/briefingpapers/Chinastates/chinastates.html" target="new">http://www.epinet.org/briefingpapers/Chinastates/chinastates.html</a>

An international trade economist with the Economic Policy Institute and

author of the recently released report “China and the States,” Scott said

today: “In April, the Clinton administration published several hundred pages

of state-by-state ‘opportunity reports’ purporting to show that ‘the passage

of PNTR [Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China]…would open new export

and employment opportunities in all 50 states.’ These reports were issued in

an attempt to persuade Congress to approve the recently negotiated trade

deal with China to ease its entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).

However, these reports not only fail to provide a single estimate of the

jobs to be gained in any of the states, they also totally disregard the role

of imports in trade, focusing only on exports. Ignoring the impact of

imports is like trying to balance a checkbook by counting only the deposits

and ignoring the withdrawals. If PNTR for China is approved by Congress, a

projection of trade trends over the next decade shows that the trade deficit

will expand, resulting in the elimination of over 800,000 jobs in the next

decade, with job losses in every state and in virtually every sector of the

economy.”

<br>

A policy associate at Friends of the Earth, Zdeb said today: “Instead of

taking into account issues like endangered species and global warming, the

trade agreement with China totally ignores environmental issues. China is

the world’s largest importer of endangered species parts; we fear that once

China enters the WTO it will challenge laws protecting endangered species as

‘barriers to trade,’ thus gutting such protections. China is the world’s most

populous nation and is poised to be the leading producer of greenhouse

gases. The U.S. trade representatives should have been negotiating the

transfer of clean, renewable technologies to put China on a more green path

toward development, but instead the 250-page trade agreement prioritizes

benefits to big business and ignores the environment altogether.”

<br>

Assistant to the president of the United Steelworkers of America, Trbovich

said today: “The multinationals are interested in setting up production

facilities where there are low wages just as they have done in Mexico.

People working for a pittance in China can't buy American goods and workers

in America can't compete with people working in prison labor camps in China.

We already have a $70 billion trade deficit with China and this will increase

it. The push for PNTR is an attempt to remove from public view appalling

conditions that the State Department’s own recent human rights report

says are ‘markedly deteriorating.’”
