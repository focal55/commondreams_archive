- June 26 - Moving quickly in the wake of US Senate approval of a military 

          aid package, Colombian armed forces attacked two hundred non-violent 

          U'wa Indians over the weekend. The U'wa have been blockading the road 

          to a site where Occidental Petroleum plans to begin drilling for oil 

          for months. The nonviolent blockades are the latest phase in a nine-year 

          campaign by the U'wa to stop drilling on traditional lands which they 

          hold sacred. 

        </font>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Saturday, June 24 some 300 anti-riot police and soldiers 

          made a surprise, early morning attack against 200 peaceful U'wa people 

          blockading a road near the town of Cubara in northeastern Colombia. 

          The police and soldiers removed the U'wa through the use of tear gas 

          and physical blows. U'wa spokespeople report that twenty-eight people 

          were injured, with some requiring medical attention. One U'wa man received 

          bullet wounds, according to the attending medical physician Dr. Quinones 

          (a facsimile of the doctor's statement available upon request from RAN: 

          415/398-4404). 

        </font>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Sunday afternoon, some 60 soldiers and police made another 

          surprise sweep against a group of U'wa peacefully assembled in the town 

          of Cubara. Several were physically attacked, accused of being "subversives" 

          and 30 were detained. Now reports are emerging today that another 40 

          U'wa have been detained in this systematic effort to break the blockade 

          and allow Occidental to drill on U'wa land. This use of force against 

          peaceful civilians comes on the heels of last week's US senate approval 

          of a $1.3 billion aid package for Colombia, much of which is directed 

          at the police and military. The U.S. is the number one buyer of Colombia's 

          oil."

        </font>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The truth on the ground in Colombia is that a US-backed 

          police and military force is using violent tactics to serve a US company-Occidental 

          Petroleum-against a peaceful community, all in the name of oil," said 

          Carwil James from Project Underground, which has been working in support 

          of the U'wa since 1997. 

        </font>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is the third violent strike in recent months against 

          the non-violent U'wa people in their effort to block Occidental's oil 

          project on their traditional territory. The U'wa are adamantly opposed 

          to the project and have repeatedly stated that they are willing to die 

          to stop the project, which they see as a threat to the spiritual equilibrium 

          of the world, the environment and their physical safety from Colombia's 

          civil war. 

        </font>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, as detailed in today's Washington Times, Vice 

          President Al Gore's family profits are up due to positive returns on 

          his stock investments in Oxy valued at between $500,000 to $1 million. 

          Despite repeated requests from environmental and human rights organizations, 

          Gore has refused to divest his family from Occidental or to support 

          the rights of the U'wa before his family's profits. 

        </font>

<p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Mr. Gore cannot pretend to be any better than Bush when 

          his hands have the blood of the U'wa on them, " said Shannon Wright, 

          of the Rainforest Action Network. "So much for this environmental Vice-President 

          - he would prefer to profit from an oil project in Colombia than to 

          use his influence to protect the human rights and forest home of the 

          U'wa."
