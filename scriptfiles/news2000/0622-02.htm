- June 22 - The U.S. House of Representatives last night voted

     against efforts to reduce the amount of arsenic and radon in drinking

     water, threatening the health of American families. The current

     standard for arsenic levels in drinking water was last updated in

     1942, but under today's vote, the Environmental Protection Agency

     (EPA) will be forbidden from reducing the amount of that poison that

     flows from our taps. In a separate vote, the House approved an

     amendment, which delays the process of cleaning smog hanging over our

     dirtiest cities.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     By a vote of 216-208, the House rejected an attempt to remove harmful

     anti-environmental riders from the EPA budget bill.  The first of

     those riders to the VA-HUD-Independent Agencies Appropriations bill

     prevents the EPA from completing regulations to reduce levels of

     arsenic in drinking water; the second stops the agency from issuing a

     new standard for radon levels in drinking water; the third halts

     cleanup of contaminated sediments in waterways.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Congress defied public opinion and common sense by voting against

     reducing the arsenic and radon in our nation's drinking water and smog

     from our air," said Ed Hopkins, Sierra Club Senior Representative.

     "You don't need a Ph.D. to know that if you can remove arsenic, radon

     and smog levels, you vote yes."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The current arsenic standard was set in 1942, yet the rider "strongly

     urges" the EPA to "cease all actions" enforcing the weak "interim"

     standard.  Several statutory deadlines have passed without the EPA

     able to update the standard.  A 1999 National Academy of Sciences

     report found that the current EPA standard for arsenic in tap water is

     unsafe, and should be revised "as promptly as possible." Uninformed

     Congressional second-guessing of the scientific findings of the

     National Academy of Sciences, EPA scientists, and virtually every

     independent expert on arsenic seriously undercuts public health

     protection.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The radon rider directs the EPA to delay implementation of a drinking

     water standard. In 1996, Congress' Safe Drinking Water Act amendments

     ordered EPA to issue a radon rule for tap water by August 2000. As in

     the case of arsenic, this rider flies in the face of two 1999 National

     Academy of Sciences studies that found that radon is known to cause

     cancer in people, and poses very real risks.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The House's belief that it knows more about safe drinking water than

     the National Academy of Sciences and the EPA is a threat to our

     families' health," Hopkins said.  "Hopefully, the Senate will show

     more concern for our nation's drinking water and remove these harmful

     riders."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     A third rider that would have been removed by the amendment is

     designed to halt EPA's cleanup of contaminated sediments in waterways

     until the completion of an additional report, delaying action that

     could endanger the environment and public health. Significantly, the

     rider is identical to language proposed by the General Electric

     corporation, which has contaminated 200 miles of the Hudson and large

     stretches of the Housatonic River with toxic PCBs.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The rider delaying smog cleanup was co-sponsored by Reps. John Linder

     (R-GA) and Mac Collins (R-GA) and passed by a vote of 226-199.  It

     prohibits the EPA from requiring state and local governments to submit

     lists of counties for smog designations until after the US Supreme

     Court rules on EPA's smog and soot standards case next year.  This

     rider would prevent the EPA from taking action specifically authorized

     by the DC Circuit to name smog areas.  Because smog non-attainment

     designations are the first step in a long process to clean the air,

     this rider sets significantly delays the process.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Millions of children, elderly and people with lung diseases will

     suffer most from this smog designation delay because states will not

     have to acknowledge that many areas have chronic levels of smog that

     put them in danger," Hopkins said.</font>
