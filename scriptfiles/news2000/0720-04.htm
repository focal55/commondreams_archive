<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLEAN AIR BULLETIN

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TO: EDITORS AND REPORTERS COVERING THE ENVIRONMENT

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For Tosco, Does 'Green' Mean Green?

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The nation's major oil companies began reporting the



second-quarter profits this morning. First out of the gate was the



Tosco Corp., which reported that profits jumped 71 percent from the



same period a year ago. The $145 million in second-quarter profits



was nearly double the $74.9 million that Tosco made in the first



three months of this year.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's announcement was in line with recent analysts'



expectations. Based on an analysis of other forecasts, we are



expecting that major oil companies will announce that they



collectively made more than $12 billion in profits in the second



quarter. (Profit announcements will continue into early August.)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tosco, the nation's largest independent refiner, is an outspoken



supporter of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to



clean up diesel fuel in order to clean up diesel trucks and buses.



Not coincidentally, Tosco is the oil company that receives the



highest "buy" rating by stock analysts surveyed by the First Call



Company.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For Tosco, does being "green" (environmentally) lead to green



(money)? There is evidence that it does. For while Tosco has had its



share of environmental problems (for example, it has come under sharp



criticism for emissions from its Linden, N.J. refinery), the company



clearly is positioning itself to profit by tougher standards on fuel.



For example, Tosco recently announced it would purchase a large



refinery in Louisiana. The company noted the purchase would enable



it to supply large volumes of low-sulfur gasoline and diesel



fuel -- and make money. "As a result of these efforts (including



sale of another refinery), Tosco should show strong growth not



only in 2000 but continue into 2001 and beyond," Tosco's chairman



and CEO Thomas P. O'Malley said today.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other oil companies take note: you, too, can clean up and be



profitable.</font>
