- April 26 - Joining a growing list of oil industry shareholders who support protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, seven percent of Chevron shareholders today voted in favor of an Arctic shareholder resolution at the company's annual meeting. Last year, a similar resolution was supported by four percent of Chevron shareholders.



<p>"Today Chevron shareholders joined the growing chorus of Arctic Refuge supporters," said Athan Manuel, author of the resolution and director of PIRG's Arctic Wilderness Campaign. "A record number of oil industry shareholders are on record in support of the Arctic Refuge. Two weeks ago, 13.5 percent of BP Amoco shareholders voted to save the Arctic Refuge from drilling."



<p>Trillium Asset Management of Boston filed the Chevron resolution in concert with the PIRG's Arctic Wilderness Campaign.



<p>On April 13, BP Amoco shareholders voted on a similar resolution calling on BP Amoco to stay out of the Arctic Refuge, abandon their Northstar offshore oil field, and put more emphasis on solar power. BP Amoco and Chevron are two of the companies, along with ExxonMobil, that have expressed interest in drilling in the Refuge. An Arctic shareholder resolution will be voted on at the ExxonMobil annual meeting on May 31.



<p>For the last two years, the PIRG Arctic Wilderness Campaign has targeted oil companies that would like to drill in the Arctic Refuge. The campaign has filed 5 shareholder resolutions and generated more than 35,000 e-mails, phone calls, and letters to Chevron, BP Amoco, ARCO (recently merged with BP Amoco), and ExxonMobil.



<p>"We call on Chevron to acknowledge the growing shareholder support for protecting the Arctic Refuge," concluded Manuel. "We look forward to negotiating with Chevron on canceling their drilling plans for the Arctic Refuge.”
