- May 24 - Human Rights Watch today called on the United

States not to proceed with the proposed sale to Israel of new air-to-ground

missiles until Israel gives assurances that the missiles will not be used

in attacks on civilian targets in Lebanon.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pentagon recently

announced the potential sale of forty-one U.S. AGM-142D missiles and is

negotiating another contract that includes the sale of 480 AGM-114L3 missiles.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Israel has flaunted international humanitarian law by attacking Lebanese

electrical stations three times in less than a year," said Ken Roth, executive

director of Human Rights Watch.&nbsp; In at least one case, the May 5 attack

on the Bsalim electrical station, near Beirut, U.S. supplied Hellfire air-to-ground

missiles were reportedly used to attack a civilian facility.&nbsp; "The

U.S. has not only failed to protest Israel's actions, it is now poised

to sell Israel missiles that could be used in future attacks," said Roth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In the case of the AGM-142, the U.S. manufacturer of the missile explicitly

promotes it as effective against power plants.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is clearly the wrong sale at the wrong time," said Roth. "The

U.S. should not to go forward with the sale of these missiles until Israel

guarantees they will not be used to attack civilians or civilian structures

in Lebanon."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Human Rights Watch

said,&nbsp; "To proceed with the sale in the wake of Israel's attack on

civilian power stations in Lebanon on May 5, 2000 would not only send the

wrong signal, but would also potentially make the U.S. complicit in attacks

prohibited by international humanitarian law."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter states, "The Israeli attacks on Lebanese power stations in

June 24, 1999, February 8, 2000, and May 5, 2000 were clear violations

of international humanitarian law.&nbsp; The stations were civilian facilities

and played no part in Hizballah's military campaign against Israel.&nbsp;

The Israeli attacks have had no discernable effect on Hizballah's military

efforts, and have only punished the Lebanese population.&nbsp; With each

attack, large parts of Lebanon have been plunged into darkness, and the

Lebanese state electrical utility has been forced to ration electricity

to the entire country."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the letter to Sec. Albright, Human Rights Watch released

a backgrounder with additional information on the missiles, the proposed

sales, Israel's attacks, and a legal analysis.
