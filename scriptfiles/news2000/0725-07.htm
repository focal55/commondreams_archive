-  

July 25 - As recycling activists gather in Sacramento to find solutions to solve the

growing piles of electronic waste, the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition's

(SVTC) website is making it possible for everyone to write to

Hewlett-Packard, Apple, IBM, Intel, Compaq and Dell and ask about the

company's computer recycling, and "green design" programs. 



<p>As part of its Clean Computer Campaign, the 4 sample letters

(<a href="http://www.svtc.org/cleancc/4ht_letters.htm">http://www.svtc.org/cleancc/4ht_letters.htm</a>) cover topics computer

recycling, computer takeback, green design, and extended producer

responsibility.



<p>Computer waste is growing at an alarming rate.  More than 315 million

computers will become obsolete during the next four years.  This will

generate more than 1 billion pounds of lead waste. "Computer recycling is

not working.  If everyone one threw out their computers at once, we would

have a one mile high waste mountain of junked computers the size of a

football field, said Leslie Byster SVTC Communications Director.



<p>"We think that computer companies need to hear from consumers about the

desire and need for cleaner product design and take back programs for

recycling", said Ted Smith, Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition Executive

Director and a speaker at the Sacramento conference "Turning Challenges

into Opportunities" sponsored by the California Resource Recovery

Association.  



<p>The conference covers a variety of topics including "Defunct

Electronics--who is responsible?" The debate about who is responsible for

the reuse and the recycling of consumer electronics is not just a local

issue, (such as banning electronic products from landfills or increased

garbage rates) but has gained international attention with the European

Union's Draft Directive on Waste from Electronic and Electrical Equipment

which would require manufacturers to take back their defunct products.  The

US Trade Representative (USTR) -- at the request of the American

Electronics Association (AEA), the largest trade association of the

electronics industry with more than 3000 members -- has been

lobbying against the WEEE Directive. The AEA is using international trade

law and the World Trade Organization as weapons to undermine important and

beneficial initiative and to dictate global health and environmental policy

to protect the economic interests of its members.



<p>"We hope that this letter-writing initiative and will let companies know

that consumers are aware of these issues and will help protect

environmental health and safety by phasing out toxic chemicals in

computers, by promoting computer take back and recycling and by

establishing a framework for Extended Producer Respnsibility," continued

Smith.
