- October 2 - </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the U.S. Supreme Court opened their 2000-01 session



just across the street, a group of national leaders and lawmakers



came together today to sound an alarm for voters: The President



you choose on Nov. 7 may end up choosing Supreme Court Justices



who could drastically curtail or abolish Americans' fundamental



rights for many years to come.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a news conference with the Court as the backdrop, Voters



For Choice President Gloria Steinem and People For the American



Way President Ralph G. Neas were joined by leaders of major



national civil and constitutional rights, abortion rights,



labor, environmental, and gun control organizations and by



national lawmakers in announcing their plans to mobilize



millions of voters across the country to consider the Court when



they cast their ballot.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Supreme Court is widely recognized as among the highest



stakes in this presidential year. Most of the current Justices



are at or past the age when most Americans retire, and



Court-watchers are predicting that the next President could have



the chance to nominate as many as three out of the nine



Justices. It has now been over six years since a new Justice was



named to the Court, the longest interval between appointments in



177 years. With the Court narrowly divided and already edging



toward the far right's position on some issues, George W. Bush's



statements that he would model his nominations after the Court's



two farthest-right Justices, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia,



are especially troubling.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 2000 elections are the most important elections for



choice in two decades because the Supreme Court hangs in the



balance," said Steinem. "The next President will likely appoint



two to three Supreme Court Justices. After the Roe v. Wade



decision, anti-choice leaders implemented a strategy to stack



the Court with anti-choice Justices. The result: today's Court



is very divided. Right now, three Justices support the right to



choose, three Justices consistently oppose the right to choose,



and three Justices are somewhere in the middle. Just one or two



more anti-choice votes could overturn Roe v. Wade."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In this election there are three critically important



issues," said Neas. "The Supreme Court, the Supreme Court, and



the Supreme Court. The Court is the issue that makes this the



most important election in two-thirds of a century. The



Christian Coalition and the rest of the Radical Right know it.



That's why they're mobilizing their voters and we have to do the



same thing."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joining Steinem and Neas at today's news conference were



speakers from the NAACP, The Feminist Majority, American



Federation of Teachers, Americans For Democratic Action, Human



Rights Campaign, United Auto Workers, Handgun Control, the



National Education Association, the National Gay and Lesbian



Task Force, Sierra Club, NARAL, the Interfaith Alliance, and the



American Association of People with Disabilities.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National lawmakers, including Reps. Stephanie Tubbs Jones,



D-OH, Bernard Sanders, I-VT, Frank Pallone, D-NJ, Louise



Slaughter, D-NY, Major Owens, D-NY, and Del. Eleanor Holmes



Norton, D-DC, took time during the closing days of the



Congressional session to join PFAW and Voters For Choice in



kicking off their fall campaign urging voters to take seriously



the future of the Supreme Court when choosing the next president



in November.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas noted that the current Court, led by its right wing, has



already begun turning back the clock by curtailing Congress'



ability to protect American's rights. Neas and the other



speakers urged voters to consider, before casting ballots on



Nov. 7, the future Court's impact on fundamental rights ranging



from free speech and religious liberty to the ability of workers



and minorities to seek and win justice.</font>
