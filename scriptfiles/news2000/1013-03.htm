- October 13 - It's Friday the 13th, the moon is full, and the U.S. Senate just passed a spending bill that contains some pretty scary provisions.  Thanks to special interest lobbyists haunting the halls of Congress, these provisions would erode protections for America's clean air, clean lakes and safe drinking water.  It just doesn't get more frightening than that.&quot;<br>

						<br>

						&quot;These poisonous provisions, which roll back our most fundamental public health protections, were attached to a must-pass spending bill that funds the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies.  These anti-environmental provisions are known as 'riders,' because their supporters, knowing they could never pass on their own, hope they will simply 'ride' along with the must-pass budget bills.&quot; <br>

						<br>

						&quot;More than a dozen of these anti-environmental riders have already been signed into law, jeopardizing our wildlife, public lands and National Forests.  If they are not blocked, about two dozen more threats to the environment could be signed into law before Congress goes home to campaign.&quot;<br>

						<br>

						&quot;Anti-environmental riders are nothing but sneak attacks on our clean air, clean water, and healthy forests and public lands.  These damaging provisions are often attached at the request of polluting industries that have undue influence in Congress thanks to a corrupt campaign finance system.&quot;<br>

						<br>

						&quot;One of the riders that passed the Senate yesterday would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from officially listing localities with unhealthy smog levels until the end of June 2001.  This rider would delay the process of cleaning up our air and denies the public critical information about the quality of the air in their community.  It's 'see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil&Mac226; environmental policy.'&quot;</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A second rider would delay clean ups at a minimum of 6 of the nation's worst hazardous waste sites in five states across the nation.  These sites include rivers and lakes with sediment that is contaminated with PCB's, heavy metals and dioxin. Some of these sites have been contaminated for decades.&quot;  <br>

						<br>

						&quot;A third rider would virtually ensure that some Americans will continue drinking water with dangerous levels of arsenic&#151;a known human carcinogen  by blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from lowering the standard to safer levels.  The current standard is based on data from 1942.&quot; <br>

						<br>

						&quot;The Senate passed all these riders despite Senator Boxer's (D-CA) efforts to remove them from the bill.  Next week, the House of Representatives will get a chance to vote on this bill.  U.S. PIRG urges Representatives to reject these sneak attacks on clean air and clean water and vote down the bill.&quot;<br>

						<br>

						&quot;U.S. PIRG is also extremely disappointed at President Clinton's recent statements approving of this very dirty bill.  We urge the President to stand by past promises to veto bills containing anti-environmental riders and drive a stake through the heart of these ghoulish provisions.&quot;<br>

						<br>

						&quot;With Halloween just a couple of weeks away, let's hope the only scary things our kids will face by then are make-believe ghosts and goblins, rather than the very real threats of crippled environmental and public health protections.&quot;<br>
