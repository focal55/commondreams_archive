<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK  

- February 10 - Human Rights Watch today accused the

Democratic Republic of Congo of violating its promise to the United

Nations not to carry out the death penalty on convicted criminals.

Nineteen people have been executed since January 28, and another

sixty-one people on death row face imminent execution.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a letter to Congo President Laurent Kabila, Human Rights Watch urged

him to abide by his own government's pledges and immediately suspend any

further executions ordered by the Court of Military Order.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"These kinds of wholesale executions should not go forward under any

circumstances," said Peter Takirambudde, the Director for Africa at

Human Rights Watch, "but they should certainly not go forward in light

of President Kabila's repeated promises to suspend the death penalty."

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BACKGROUND REPORT ON THE COURT OF MILITARY ORDER IN THE DEMOCRATIC

REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Court of Military Order was established in 1997 by presidential

decree law No. 019 shortly after President Laurent Kabila's government

seized power in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The Court

initially had a narrow mandate of restoring military discipline in the

capital Kinshasa and its area at a time when criminality and dissent

were on the rise in the army. Following the outbreak of war against the

rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy and its foreign backers in August

1998, the Congolese government expanded both the geographic coverage and

legal mandate of the court with the addition of new chambers at Katanga,

Kasai, and Bas Congo regions, and the establishment of roving courts.

The jurisdiction of the Military Court was further expanded on January

2, 1999 by Decree Law 171, which declared a state of emergency in

regions then controlled by the rebels and their foreign backers. While

the decree law has drawn little international attention, it granted the

military sweeping powers over civilian administration by giving the

military the authority to replace civilian authorities, appropriate

private property, and to forcibly recruit civilians for the "benefit,

directly or indirectly, of national defense and the safeguarding of

public security and interest."





 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The president appoints the judges of the Court of Military Order, and

their decisions could only be reversed by him as the supreme holder of

executive, legislative, and judicial powers in the country. In

contravention of international law, Decree Law 019 establishing the

court does not provide for appeal to a higher jurisdiction. However, the

decree leaves the door open for pleas for presidential pardon in the

case of death sentences. Despite this, many executions were carried out

the same day as sentencing or shortly after, raising doubts as to

whether requests for presidential pardon have been given due

consideration. Since the clemency procedure is secret, it is difficult

to know in how many cases pardon was actually requested and denied.

President Kabila, who alone is empowered to commute the death sentences,

is known to have granted only one pardon: a thirteen-year-old soldier

who had been sentenced to death in late March 1998 for killing a Red

Cross worker in Kinshasa was granted clemency on April 18, 1998. The

second president of the Military Court told Human Rights Watch in a late

1998 interview that under the decree law establishing the court those

condemned to death could be legally executed immediately following

judgment. This violates principles both of the Congolese code of

criminal justice and international norms.   Since its establishment, the

functioning of this court has been marked by prolonged delays, a lack of

due process, and a propensity to impose and execute the death penalty.

In interviews with Human Rights Watch conducted in late 1998, court

officials, including the then acting commander president of the court

and a military public prosecutor, expressed their strong support for

death sentences in order to eliminate "suspected rebels, common

criminals, ill-disciplined military, and collaborators with the enemy."

According to reliable sources on the ground, more than 250 executions

have been carried out by the Court of Military Order since its

inception.



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Court has increasingly been used for political repression, notably

to punish nonviolent opposition and to muzzle outspoken critics of the

government in the media and NGO sectors. Authorities have also used the

court to punish civilians accused of economic crimes such as illicit

dealings in foreign currency.

Your excellency:



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch is writing to you to express its alarm at the

executions in three groups since January 28 of nineteen people condemned

to death by the special Court of Military Order. We are also deeply

concerned about the fate of another sixty-one death row inmates

currently held at Pavilion 2 in the Reeducation and Penitentiary Center

of Kinshasa (former Makala central prison) whose execution appears

imminent according to reports. Your government carried out the recent

executions despite its pledges to suspend capital punishment, conveyed

in a July 1999 letter from the Minister of Human Rights to Mary

Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, and most recently

reiterated by the same minister in his December 10 speech marking the

annual anniversary of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We

urge your government to abide by its own pledges and immediately suspend

any further executions ordered by the Court of Military Order pending

the review of that institution.



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch fears that the execution of the sixty-one death row

inmate presently held at Kinshasa's central prison is imminent. A total

of nineteen civilians and military personnel were executed in three

groups: on January 28 and 31, and on February 2.  Executions took place

at the Provincial Inspectorate of Police and at Tshatshi military camp

in Kinshasa, and at Maluku, about 60 km from the capital.



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your government established the Court of Military Order by presidential

decree in August 1997, shortly after it seized power. The Court

initially had a narrow mandate of trying soldiers accused of

disciplinary and other offences in the capital Kinshasa and its area in

a drive to suppress an upsurge in criminality and dissent in the ranks.

Following the outbreak of war in August 1998 against the rebel Congolese

Rally for Democracy and its foreign backers, your government expanded

both the geographic coverage and legal mandate of the court with the

addition of new chambers at several centers in Katanga, Kasai, and Bas

Congo regions, and the establishment of roving courts. Since its

establishment, the functioning of this court has been marked by

prolonged delays, a lack of due process, and a propensity to apply and

execute the death sentence. The Court has increasingly been used for

political repression, notably to punish nonviolent opposition and to

muzzle outspoken critics of the government in the media and NGO sectors.

Authorities have also used the court to punish civilians accused of

economic crimes such as illicit dealings in foreign currency. Human

Rights Watch urges your government to abolish the special Military Court

and establish an independent judiciary that respects due process.

Regular military courts should only handle cases of military personnel

who are accused of committing military crimes. Trials in military courts

should afford the accused all gaurentees of fair trial enshrined in

international standards and Congolese justice codes, including the right

to appeal and the right to counsel. The government should guarantee the

competence, independence, and impartiality of all tribunals to ensure

that civilians are not tried before military courts. Civilian and

military judges, prosecutors, and other court officials should not be

subject to intimidation or harassment related to their duties.





 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More specifically, we urge your government to abide by the "Safeguards

guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death

penalty," adopted by Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50 of

25 May 1984, that are representing a broad level of consensus by the

international community. The Safeguards provide guidance for those

countries that have not abolished the death penalty. The following

Safeguards are of particular relevance to the aforementioned cases:



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Persons below 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the

crime shall not be sentenced to death, nor shall the death sentence be

carried out on pregnant women, or on new mothers, or on persons who have

become insane.



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Capital punishment may only be carried out pursuant to a final

judgement rendered by a competent court after legal process which gives

all possible safeguards to ensure a fair trial, at least equal to those

contained in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and

Political Rights, including the right of anyone suspected of or charged

with a crime for which capital punishment may be imposed to adequate

legal assistance at all stages of the proceedings.



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. Anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to appeal to a court

of higher jurisdiction, and steps should be taken to ensure that such

appeals shall become mandatory.



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. Anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon, or

commutation of sentence; pardon or commutation of sentence may be

granted in all cases of capital punishment.



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8. Capital punishment shall not be carried out pending any appeal or

other recourse procedure or other proceeding relating to pardon or

commutation of the sentence.





</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanking you in advance for your urgent action on this matter, we

remain,



<br>

Sincerely Yours,<br>
