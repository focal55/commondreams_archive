- June 11 - Today, a group of prominent Russia experts released a letter urging

President Clinton not to endorse deployment of a national missile defense

(NMD).  The letter, signed by 33 scholars, called on President Clinton to

allow more time to assess NMD's impact on international efforts to curb the

spread of nuclear weapons.  Signatories include Timothy Colton and Marshall

Goldman, leading Russia scholars at Harvard; Arthur Hartman, former

Ambassador to the Soviet Union; and John Steinbruner, arms control expert.



<p>"We believe that current plans for the NMD program may undermine U.S.

security and further aggravate U.S. relations with Russia.  More time is

needed to assess NMD's impact on international relations, develop

cooperative approaches to curbing missile proliferation, and avoid

reigniting a new nuclear arms race," the experts advised in their letter.



<p>Because Russia has serious concerns about the viability of their deterrence

force if the U.S. deploys NMD the scholars believe that, "Russia is likely

to reduce its commitment to missile reductions - which could prompt some

nations, particularly in Asia, to consider the acquisition or development

of nuclear weapons."



<p>"We urge you not to endorse deployment at this time," the letter to

President Clinton concluded.



<p>The letter comes one week after President's Clinton and Putin met in Moscow

to discuss modifications to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) and

further nuclear weapons reductions.  No significant agreements were made,

and thus Russia and the U.S. continue to remain at an arms control

standstill.  



<p>This impasse could be costly, as Russia has threatened to pull out of all

arms control agreements if the U.S. deploys an anti-ballistic missile

system in violation of the ABM Treaty.  It is this possibility -- increased

nuclear weapon and missile technology proliferation -- that the Russian

experts are concerned about.



<p>"The implications of this issue extend far beyond the question of

intercepting alleged rogue missiles. Whether or not we admit it, the entire

framework of legal restraint on nuclear weapons is at stake," said John

Steinbruner, Director of the Center for International and Security Studies

at Maryland, University of Maryland.



<p>The full text of the letter and list of signatories is available by request.
