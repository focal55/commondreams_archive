- January 31 - The American Civil Liberties Union is pleased by Governor Ryan's 

    action today suspending application of the death penalty in Illinois. The 

    sad and discredited capital punishment system in this state deserves not only 

    a moratorium, but all-out abolition.



  <p> Today's action should be the first, tangible step towards that ultimate 

    goal of ending sanctioned violence by the State of Illinois. </p>

  <p> We also are gratified that the Governor has taken this courageous step at 

    this time, so the death penalty issue is removed from the legislative arena 

    in an election year. Rather than being driven by politics and the quest for 

    votes, the analysis of how the death penalty system works -- or does not work 

    -- in Illinois can be studied in a more careful, thoughtful and dispassionate 

    manner. </p>

  <p> Finally, it is clear that with today's action, the Governor has set a high 

    standard for the reinstitution and reapplication of the death penalty system. 

    This is important, because the people of Illinois have a right to know that 

    the state will not put to death any innocent person.</p>

  <p><i>Note:</i> The ACLU's "Execution Watch" feature on its national website at <a href="http://www.aclu.org/executionwatch.html">http://www.aclu.org/executionwatch.html</a> 

    monitors the number of U.S. executions since the reinstatement of the death 

    penalty in 1976. Visitors to the site can join the ACLU's e-mail action network, 

    link to other organizations active in the anti-death penalty movement, and 

    easily locate regularly updated information on pending and completed executions.
