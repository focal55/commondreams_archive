- February 3 - Friends of the Earth honored People for U.S. 23 Freeway

Alternatives today with the Winter 2000 "Road Warrior Award" for their successful campaign to delete the planned U.S. 23 highway extension in northeast Michigan from the state transportation budget. The "Road Warrior Award," which salutes grassroots efforts to halt traffic growth and urban sprawl, honors this organization's effort to improve the quality of life and transportation options in northeast Michigan.<P>





"People for U.S. 23 Freeway Alternatives fought valiantly against a poorly-planned project that would have trashed the environment," said Brent Blackwelder, President of Friends of the Earth.  "Their efforts helped protect the quality of life for people in northeast Michigan and keep the region beautiful."<p>



The 100-mile U.S. 23 highway extension would have run between Standish and Alpena in northeast Michigan.  The project would have cost over $500 million in federal taxpayer money.  People for U.S. 23 Freeway Alternatives worked for several years to publicize the negative impacts of the project, which included the "largest single wetland loss within Michigan," according to the U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service.  In 1999, Michigan requested no funding for the U.S. 23 extension in the state five year transportation plan, and instead called for improvements of the existing U.S. 23 and other local roads. <p>



Friends of the Earth, a national environmental organization, awards the "Road Warrior Award" on a quarterly basis to organizations or individuals working to stop destructive and poorly planned road projects that threaten the environment.  The next award will be given in Spring 2000.<p>



The Road Warrior Award recipient was chosen with the help of an Advisory Committee, which consists of: David Hirsch, Friends of the Earth; Hooper Brooks, Surdna Foundation; John Holtzclaw, Sierra Club; Don Chen, Surface Transportation Policy Project; Michael Replogle, Environmental Defense Fund.<p>
