- June 14 - I want to thank the 31,000 members of the California Nurses Association for their  support.  This is a great boost for our campaign from an organization that is known nationally for its advocacy for patients and its promotion of health care and HMO reforms. 



<p>Four years ago, I had the pleasure of working with this association in the successful passage of Proposition 216 in California, the Patient Protection Act, that has become a model for HMO reform.  



<p>I'm very proud to receive this endorsement.  

		

<p>As these nurses know well, health care in the United States is in a crisis.  More than 44 million Americans have no health insurance and many millions more are underinsured.  High co-payments and deductibles lead many citizens to forgo needed care and medication.   	

	

<p>In 1999, the United States spent an estimated $1.2 trillion on health care-12.8 of the Gross National Product or an average of $4,443 per person. 



<p>Clearly, Americans are anxious for change. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll in 1999 found that 67 percent of those polled think the federal government should guarantee health insurance for every citizen.  In another poll during the same period, Kellogg Foundation found that 79 percent of the respondents believed that health care should be a right.
