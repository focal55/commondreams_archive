- February 2 - Today, the Reverend Jesse Jackson,

president and founder of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, released the following

comments upon hearing news that Major

League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig suspension of John Rocker for

inflammatory comments published in Sports Illustrated.

<p>Selig banned Rocker, of the Atlanta Braves, from joining the team until

May 1 because of disparaging comments against homosexuals, minorities and

foreigners. The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition wrote Selig in December after the

comments were made public, asking for clarity.

<p>"What Mr. Rocker said was offensive and embarrassing to baseball," Jackson

said. "The commissioner appropriated punishment to show intolerance with

language that insults players and fans.&nbsp; While we believe that Mr.

Rocker's statements were divisive, we must not separate his statements

from the cultural ideology that fuels (such comments). In this regard his

statements were not out of context.

<p>"Major League Baseball cannot play under a Confederate flag in Georgia

with some expression of indignation and without some affirmation of one

America, one flag.&nbsp; Mr. Rocker's published comments actually reflect

an ideology that must now move beyond the legacy of the Cotton Curtain

of yesterday and embrace the one America of today.&nbsp;

<p>"The Braves should support the removal of the Confederate flag-surely

it is hypocrisy to punish Mr. Rocker for his comments, yet take no position

on having players play under a symbol

that represents bigotry, hatred, sedition and racial supremacy.

<p>"He must not be used as a scapegoat for a crisis in our culture that

deserves healing," he said. "The time has come to remove the Confederate

symbol. We hope Major League Baseball and

the Atlanta Braves would join this effort."
