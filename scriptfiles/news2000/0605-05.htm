- June 5 - The June 4 - 5 summit between U.S. President Clinton and Russian President

Putin was hardly a disappointment:  little was expected, and little was

achieved. A few minor agreements were signed: the elimination of 34 tons of

excess weapons plutonium and the establishment of a joint U.S./Russian

missile detection center.  



<p>At one point, this summit might have been produced arms control agreements

that would eliminate thousands of nuclear weapons in both countries.  It

might have been an opportunity to agree to take nuclear weapons off alert.

It might  have been an opportunity to set the stage for significant arms

control progress in the next Administration.  Unfortunately, the

opportunity has passed for any of these significant deals to be signed and

ratified.



<p>One of the major failings of this summit was the inability of Clinton and

Putin to sign a START III treaty.  START III, originally aimed at reducing

strategic nuclear weapons to 2,000 - 2,500 per side, could have gone as low

as 1,000 - 1,500, as Russia advocates, but the Administration unfortunately

said "no thank you," bowing to Pentagon resistance to deeper reductions. 



<p>The Administration's continued insistence of pursuing deployment of a

national missile defense has served to unite the rest of the world against

U.S. plans.  Russians, Chinese, Germans, French and other leaders made

clear their opposition to U.S deployment (although the President will not

make a deployment decision until later this year).  



<p>An arms control stalemate exists, as a result of the American quest for an

anti-ballistic missile system, driven by politics, not technology.

Significant arms control progress will now rest in the hands of the next

U.S. president.
