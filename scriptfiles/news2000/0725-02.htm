<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- July 24 - The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) today criticized 

        likely Republican vice presidential nominee Richard Cheney's environmental 

        record and said a Bush/Cheney ticket would threaten three decades of environmental 

        progress. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

        &quot;If George W. Bush represents the biggest threat to the environment 

        in the 2000 presidential election, then Dick Cheney is clearly the second 

        biggest threat,&quot; said LCV President Deb Callahan. &quot;A Bush/Cheney 

        ticket means double trouble for the environment. With a 13 percent lifetime 

        LCV environmental voting score, it is apparent that Cheney's priorities 

        do not include protecting the nation's air, water and natural resources.&quot; 

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

        Cheney was elected U.S. Representative from Wyoming in November 1978 and 

        served until March 1989 when he became secretary of state for the Bush 

        administration. While in Congress, Cheney voted to postpone economic sanctions 

        for areas that did not meet Clean Air Act requirements and to reduce funding 

        for the Interior Department. He also voted against a permanent ban on 

        oil and gas drilling in wilderness areas, and against requiring polluters 

        to report any significant emissions of hazardous chemicals. In February 

        1987, Cheney co-sponsored a measure to allow oil drilling in Alaska's 

        Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

        &quot;In addition to Cheney's dismal congressional record, his role as 

        CEO of Halliburton, a Dallas-based energy services company, does not bode 

        well for the environment,&quot; Callahan said. Not only has Cheney and 

        other Halliburton employees donated more than $11,000 to George W. Bush's 

        campaign, but he has also spoken out against the Kyoto Protocol on climate 

        change and advocated for more U.S. involvement in the Caspian Sea region, 

        where already oil development poses threats to water quality and fish 

        and wildlife habitat. &quot;Cheney's likely nomination as vice president 

        might be good news for the oil industry, but not for the majority of voters 

        who want stronger, not weaker, environmental protections,&quot; Callahan 

        said.</font></p>
