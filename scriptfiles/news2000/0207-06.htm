- February 7 - The nonprofit Clean Air

Trust today awarded its clean air "Villain of the Month" award to



a utility industry group that is trying to scare the public into



thinking that pollution cleanup could threaten brownouts.

<p>The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), a

nonprofit corporation whose members include investor-owned electric



utilities and other power interests, raised the brownout specter in



a draft study analyzing a U.S. EPA plan to clean up smog-forming



pollution from electric power plants.

<p>We've heard that "reliability" argument before -- from big

polluters, including many members of the Edison Electric Institute,



that have fought the air pollution cleanup plan tooth and nail.



These scare tactics have been refuted by several studies, including



one done by other power companies.

<p>NERC seeks to posture as an "objective" source of information.

But its new study was initiated and funded by none other than the



very same Edison Electric Institute. The product of this effort



appears designed for use as a lobbying and propaganda tool.

<p>Each month the Trust identifies a company, association, or

individual that it believes should be singled out for opprobrium



for its anti-clean air activities.
