- May 26 - Granting Columbia University a patent extension for a

drug-manufacturing process would lead to higher drug prices for consumers and open the

floodgates for pharmaceutical companies to demand similar special deals, a coalition of 16

groups says.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter sent this week to Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Richard Durbin (D-Ill.),

Public Citizen and an array of groups ranging from Consumers Union and Families USA to the

National Council of Senior Citizens and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (U.S.

PIRG) urged the senators to eliminate the patent extension from the Agricultural

Appropriations bill (S. 2536). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The provision was slipped into the bill by Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H), a Columbia

University alumnus, and has not been debated in any committee hearing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This secretly added provision would be a windfall to Columbia University at the

expense of consumers, who are already paying too much for important drugs they need to

treat heart attacks, strokes, AIDS, cancer and other diseases,&quot; said Frank Clemente,

director of <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/">Public Citizen&#146;s Congress Watch</a>. &quot;This is

a classic example of backroom dealing, and it should be pulled from the bill

immediately.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The provision would grant an extension on a patent for &quot;contransformation,&quot; a

process in which animal cells are used to manufacture proteins for drugs. The patent,

which the university has held since 1983, has brought it nearly $300 million. Taxpayers

funded the research that led to the discovery of the process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the letter, the groups point out that granting the extension would:</font></p>

<blockquote>

  

<blockquote>

    

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Constitute a major rewrite of the Hatch-Waxman Act, 1984 legislation that lays out

    guidelines for patent extensions for drugs -- not manufacturing processes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Cost consumers. A five-year patent extension could give Columbia an additional $500

    million. Not only would drugs currently manufactured with the process cost more, but so

    would new drugs using the process. &quot;Americans are clamoring for Congress to enact

    policies that would substantially reduce the cost of drugs -- not maintain their high

    levels or increase them,&quot; the letter says.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Open the floodgates for drug companies whose patents are about to expire to ask

    Congress for special extensions. In the next few years, patents of 20 blockbuster drugs

    with sales of $20 billion a year are set to expire. &quot;Now is not the time to give the

    manufacturers of those drugs any hope of favorable treatment,&quot; the letter states.</font></p>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter also notes that if Columbia has a legitimate argument, it should be made in

committee hearings, so the provision can be debated publicly rather than being tacked

quietly to the bill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is a sweetheart provision that is good for one entity but bad for everyone

else, and it should be eliminated,&quot; Clemente said.</font>
