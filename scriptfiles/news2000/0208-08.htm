<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 8 - STATEMENT OF COMMON CAUSE PRESIDENT SCOTT HARSHBARGER

ON PRESIDENT CLINTON'S DECISION TO NOMINATE BRADLEY SMITH

TO THE FEC</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> President Clinton's expected nomination of Bradley A. Smith

to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) reeks of the kind

of back-room deal making that turns Americans away from

politics and government.  This decision undermines, rather

than strengthens, a commission already known in Washington

as the Failure to Enforce Commission.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By deciding to nominate Smith, President Clinton has caved

in to an increasingly extreme faction in this country, led

by Senator Mitch McConnell and Majority Leader Trent Lott,

who actually believe that big money in politics should be

increased, rather than reduced.  Just as President Reagan

rejected the nomination of Thomas Harris to the FEC in 1985,

then the choice of Senate Democrats, President Clinton should

have similarly dug in his heels and refused to forward the

Smith nomination.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At a time when the idea that we need to reduce the influence

of big money in our elections and our government is gaining

ground, President Clinton is nominating someone to the FEC

who has complete and utter hostility to the laws he would be

charged with enforcing.  

 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the State of the Union address, President Clinton called on

Congress to pass campaign finance reform.  But by deciding to

nominate Professor Smith to the FEC, President Clinton has even

further damaged his own credibility when it comes to making

reform a reality. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Common Cause will fight a Smith nomination in the Senate.  Any

Senator who supports this disastrous nominee cannot claim to

support campaign finance reform.
