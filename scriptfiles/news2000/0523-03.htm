Author of "Gender and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict," Sharoni is

currently a professor at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.

She said today: "If there is any relationship between the recent mini-intifada

and the negotiations, it is that the two issues that have been central to

the protests -- the Palestinian refugees and the release of political

prisoners -- have not been seriously addressed. Those who are familiar with

the Oslo Accords, its supplements and its rocky implementation should not be

surprised that Palestinians have once again taken to the streets.... If 

Israel's

withdrawal from Lebanon is designed to de-escalate tensions in the region,

one is hard-pressed to understand the increased Israeli attacks on southern

Lebanon in recent weeks."

As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has given commencement addresses

around the country this month, she has repeatedly been met with protests

against the continued sanctions on Iraq. The most notable incident occurred

at the University of California at Berkeley where Rafeedie, the University

Medalist, denounced the U.S.-imposed sanctions in her speech which followed

Albright's. As Albright spoke, 59 protesters were ejected from the hall.

Director of the UCLA African Studies Center, Keller said today: "The

Ethiopians do not want to halt their advance since they are winning and are

well prepared for a very brutal, short war against the Eritreans. We need to

put some teeth in the arms embargo that the UN has imposed. Once again,

the West saw a looming crisis in Africa and did little, wishing it would 

just go

away..."

Burroughs, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee on Nuclear Policy,

monitored the recently completed Non-Proliferation Review Conference at the

UN. Burroughs said today: "The Clinton administration needs to act on the

commitments it made at the conference in negotiating with the Russians and

working with Congress in pursuing arms reductions and ending reliance on the

nuclear threat."</font></p>
