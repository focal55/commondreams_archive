- July 3 - Meeting in his brother Jeb Bush's backyard, activists at NOW's National

Conference in Miami Beach this weekend vowed to beat George W. Bush

in November.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Women won't elect a president who disregards our rights and isn't concerned

with our lives.&nbsp; During the next four months, NOW will shine a spotlight

on Governor Bush's pitiful record in his home state.&nbsp; Under Bush,

Texas has ranked last in the nation in health care, reproductive freedom,

and teachers' salaries and benefits," NOW President Patricia

Ireland said.&nbsp; "At the same time, Texas ranks first in the country

for pollution and percentage of children without health insurance.&nbsp;

Texas rates last in quality criminal defense for poor defendants and number

one in executions.&nbsp; And this man who calls himself a compassionate

conservative mocked death row inmate Betty Lou Beets, sneering that she

begged 'Please don't kill me'."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Bush supported an anti-abortion rights law that even this Supreme Court

rejected," Ireland continued.&nbsp; "In a recent

5-4 decision that upheld reproductive freedom, Bush's favorite justices—Scalia

and Thomas—were in the minority.&nbsp; These are the same two justices

who lead a one-vote majority in gutting the Violence

Against Women Act and other civil rights remedies.&nbsp; With women's

rights at the mercy of such a closely split court, a Bush presidency could

turn the tide against us with even one more politically conservative appointment."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the Conference, NOW defined a strategy to step up get-out-the-vote

efforts for feminist candidates running in presidential battleground states

where votes against Bush are also crucial.&nbsp; NOW will also work with

supporters of Vermont's civil unions legislation, who face tough re-election

campaigns this fall.&nbsp; NOW activists committed to take action on issues

including mifepristone (RU-486), the Violence Against Women Act and the

U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against

Women.&nbsp; NOW pledged to support protests at both the Democratic and

Republican National Conventions this summer, building momentum for the

World March of Women 2000.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"NOW activists are returning to their chapters and states ready to elect

the candidates who support women's rights and challenge head-on those who

don't," Ireland said. "We will unite again on October 15 in Washington,

D.C., for the <a href="http://www.worldmarch.org/">World March of Women

2000</a>, calling for equality and an end to violence against women and

poverty worldwide.&nbsp; Women will take the energy and the issues from

this march to the polls in November."</font>
