- March 29 - New occurrences of misconduct by police officers are in the national news.

The following critics of abuses are available for interviews:



<P><LI>RON DANIELS, <A HREF="mailto:rdaniel@ccr-ny.org">rdaniel@ccr-ny.org</A>

<BR>Daniels is executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights and

author of the essay "The Crisis of Police Brutality and Misconduct in

America: The Causes and the Cure" in the forthcoming book "Police Brutality:

An Anthology". He said today: "Racial profiling and the militarization of

the police are a large measure of the problem. The [New York Mayor Rudolph]

Giuliani model of zero-tolerance policing that goes after petty crimes has

resulted in tens of thousands of innocent people, mostly African Americans

and Latinos, being harassed, sometimes arrested by the police. We have to

move to community-based, constitutionally-compliant policing."



<P><LI>MARY D. POWERS

<BR>Coordinator of the National Coalition on Police Accountability, based in

Chicago, Powers said today: "We've seen a history of police abuse and

torture, particularly of black suspects. Interrogations should be

videotaped. That would also protect good police officers who are falsely

accused.... After community efforts, we have been able to have a few abusive

police officers fired from the [Chicago] department. And local college

students exposed police and prosecutorial misconduct, so innocent people

were released from prison and even death row."



<P><LI>VAN JONES, <A HREF="http://www.ellabakercenter.org">www.ellabakercenter.org</A>

<BR>Jones is national executive director of the Ella Baker Center for Human

Rights. The Center's projects include Bay Area PoliceWatch and New York PoliceWatch. Jones said today: "If you increase police presence, power, budget

and mandate, but don't increase the oversight mechanisms, that's a recipe

for corruption and abuse. That is what we are seeing." On Thursday, Jones

will be in Seattle for a conference on police misconduct, including during

the WTO protests.



<P><LI>ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ, <A HREF="mailto:xcolumn@aol.com">xcolumn@aol.com</A>,

<A HREF="http://www.uexpress.com/ups/opinion/column/cm/">www.uexpress.com/ups/opinion/column/cm/</A>

<BR>Author of "Justice: A Question of Race" and co-author of the syndicated

Column of the Americas, Rodriguez (who won a federal civil rights lawsuit

against the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department for brutality against him) said

today: "In most cases, law enforcement abuses never make it to trial—the

police have their code of silence and the prosecutors work hand in glove

with the police. We need federal prosecutors who are not part of the local

structures. We need a national truth commission. Over 90 percent of people

brutalized by law enforcement are people of color. We have to look at these

abuses in the context of human rights violations and take them to the

Organization of American States and the United Nations."
