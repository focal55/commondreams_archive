- April 27 - The Barbara Lee Family 

Foundation today announced a $200,000 leadership gift to the 

Million Mom March. 



<p>On Mother's Day, Sunday, May 14, the march on the National Mall 

in Washington, D.C. will amplify the voices of concerned mothers 

across the United States in calling for an end to gun violence. 



<p>"More than 11 children in this country are killed by gun 

violence every single day," said activist and philanthropist 

Barbara Lee. "As a mother I believe every child deserves a safe 

community, a safe school, and a safe home. It is time for mothers 

to take the lead on sensible gun control to ensure the safety of 

our children. We must keep guns out of the hands of children and 

criminals." 



<p>The Million Mom March is expected to bring tens of thousands of 

mothers and others from across the United States to the National 

Mall in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, May 14. Marchers and 

supporters are calling for an end to gun violence to ensure safer 

communities. 



<p>"The Barbara Lee Family Foundation initiates projects to advance 

and support women's leadership and improve democracy," said Julia 

Dunbar, the Foundation's executive director. "The Million Mom March 

was started by a concerned mother, Donna Dees-Thomases, who 

believed she could make a difference. We are proud to join 

thousands of women across the nation who are taking leadership 

roles in the critical effort to protect our children." 



<p>"We hope that our participation and this leadership gift will 

inspire other foundations and individuals to get involved and 

contribute to this historic Mother's Day March," said Barbara Lee. 



<p>Recent leadership gifts of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation 

include: count-me-in.org, an on and off-line microenterprise 

financial loan program for women; grassroots outreach to promote 

the 1999 Ken Burn's documentary, Not for Ourselves Alone, the story 

of suffragists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony; the 

Boston Women's Memorial, and a significant gift to build a new 

Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. The Foundation's other 

interests include making the arts accessible to broad and diverse 

audiences as well as protecting the environment.
