- April 16 - Thousands of peaceful protesters have taken to the streets, 

blockading key intersections in the vicinity of the World Bank and International 

Monetary Fund as the opening day of the joint annual meetings of these 

institutions gets underway.



<p>Police on motorcycles and on foot are out in force - many of whom are in 

riot gear. Thus far, there have been no initial reports of arrests and 

 protesters are honoring their commitment to nonviolence. However, police 

have already been viewed using clubs and pepper spray to disperse people..



<p>Rev. Douglas Hunt of the organization Witness for Peace, was among protesters 

who blocked a bus carrying delegates to the meeting on 17th St, by sitting 

down on the ground behind the bus.   According to Rev. Hunt, one of the 

police escorts told the bus driver, "Back up over them if you have to." 





<p>"Today we are sending a loud and clear message to these unaccountable institutions 

that we hold them responsible for devastating the lives of poor people 

around the world in the name of globalization," said Chloe Frommer of the 

Mobilization for Global Justice.  "We stand in solidarity with millions 

of people in the developing world who are demanding to take control of 

their lives out of the hands of the World Bank and IMF, and the powerful 

corporations that are calling the shots."



<p>Reports are streaming in to the Mobilization Media Desk of incidents in 

the street.  Reporters are encouraged to call for up to the minute update 

and interviews with activists in the streets. French, Japanese and Spanish 

interviews are available by calling the media desk.

<p>EVENTS PLANNED FOR TODAY:



<p>11:00 A.M. -- MOBILIZATION FOR GLOBAL JUSTICE SPONSORS A MASS PROTEST RALLY 

AGAINST THE WORLD BANK AND IMF -- At the Ellipse on the National Mall, 

hosted by filmmaker Michael Moore. 

<p>5:00 P.M. - MOBILIZATION FOR GLOBAL JUSTICE PRESS CONFERENCE -- The Ellipse
