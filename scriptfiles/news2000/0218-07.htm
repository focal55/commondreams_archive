- February 18 - <a href="http://www.governor.state.or.us/governor/speeches/s000218.html">Read Governor Kitzhaber's Speech</a>



<p>

Governor John Kitzhaber of Oregon today became the first major political figure to support the removal of four dams on the lower Snake River to save endangered salmon and steelhead. 

<p>

In a speech given to the American Fisheries Society in Oregon, Governor Kitzhaber said that after reviewing the different approaches and trade-offs, removing the four dams is the best option for the salmon, the people, and the economy of the Northwest.

<p>

"Today, Governor Kitzhaber has provided what Snake River salmon most desperately need -- political leadership. Now, it's time for the Clinton Administration and elected officials throughout the region to follow his example and support removal of the four lower Snake River dams to restore this magnificent national treasure," said Rob Masonis of American Rivers.

<p>

The Governor's endorsement of dam removal comes after several weeks of public hearings across the Northwest, where regional support for dam removal has been overwhelmingly positive.

<p>

The Clinton-Gore Administration is legally obligated to decide this year whether to remove the four lower Snake River dams as part of its salmon recovery plan.

<p>

"Congress and the Administration should develop a plan to replace the benefits provided by the dams - through targeted investments in transportation, irrigation, and power infrastructures - so we can save salmon and protect existing jobs and rural communities," said Justin Hayes of American Rivers.

<p>

In addition to calling for dam removal, Governor Kitzhaber also stressed the additional need for more habitat restoration, hatchery reform, harvest practices, and better operation of other dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. He said that there are no easy or cheap solutions to salmon recovery.

<p>

Studies by the National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, State and Tribal fisheries agencies, and independent scientific committees all support dam removal as the cornerstone of an effective salmon recovery strategy.

<p>

Economic studies show that dam removal is less expensive than other salmon recovery options, such as new restrictions on farming, logging, and commercial fishing. Acquiring water from Idaho irrigators and repairing the dams to comply with the Clean Water Act would cost more than $500 million annually and eliminate more than 4,000 jobs.

<p>

Studies also show that the benefits the dams provide can be replaced by investing in highways and rail, upgrading irrigation equipment, and building new sources of clean power.

<p>

Removing the dams will also generate approximately $300 million in recreation-related income for the region. 

<p>

The four lower Snake River dams kill salmon by flooding spawning habitat, interfering with migration of young salmon to the sea-exposing them to predation and disease-and by creating obstacles to adult salmon returning to spawn.
