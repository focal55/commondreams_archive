- June 8 - More than a dozen persons who were wrongly convicted based on

erroneous eyewitness identifications will travel to Houston Monday to

call on Gov. George W. Bush and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles

to intervene to prevent the execution of a man wrongfully convicted of

capital murder.



<p>The Center on Wrongful Convictions at

Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago will sponsor a

"Gathering of Those Who Stand as Living Testaments

to the Fallibility of Eyewitness Testimony"

at 11 AM on Monday, June 12, 2000 in Room 104 of the

Thurgood Marshall School of Law, Texas Southern University

3100 Cleburne Street, Houston, Texas



<p>Featured speakers include:

<p>o Lawrence C. Marshall, Legal Director, Center on Wrongful Convictions

at Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago.

<p>o Kirk Bloodsworth, the first death row inmate to be released based on

DNA

 evidence.

<p>o Dennis Williams, released from Illinois’ death row with the help of

journalism students.

<p>o  Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, professor of psychology at the University of

Washington in Seattle and a leading authority on erroneous eyewitness

identifications in criminal cases.



 <p>Unless Bush and the board act, the state of Texas will execute Graham,

who

 now goes by the name Shaka Sankofa, on June 22. Graham was convicted on

a dubious identification by a single eyewitness who testified to seeing

a stranger's face at night through a car windshield from a distance of

30-40 feet FOR TWO SECONDS. That testimony was the only evidence linking

then 17-year-old Graham to the killing of Bobby Lambert in a Houston

grocery store parking lot in 1981. Six other eyewitnesses have said they

saw another man shoot Mr. Lambert, but no court ever heard from these

witnesses due to incompetent lawyering.





 <p>"We now know beyond doubt that mistaken eyewitness testimony is the

major cause of wrongful convictions," Dr. Loftus said. "Let's recognize

that scientific truth before we execute an innocent person in ignorance

of it."
