- June 30 - U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone, responding to the inflated

prices of life-saving prescription drugs,  introduced an amendment to the

Labor-HHS Appropriations bill  which would require the National Institutes of

Health (NIH) to insure that drugs developed at taxpayer expense are provided to

the public on reasonable terms.  The Wellstone amendment, supported by Senators

Johnson and Levin, and recently passed in the House thanks to the leadership of

Rep. Bernie Sanders,  would make pharmaceutical companies who negotiate

agreements with the NIH to develop and market drugs using taxpayer-funded R&D,

to enter an agreement to sell those drugs at  reasonable prices. The measure

would end the federal government’s give-away of billions of dollars worth of

taxpayer-financed intellectual property to huge, profitable pharmaceutical

conglomerates, while these same corporations price the life-saving drugs beyond

the reach of seniors and working families. 



<p>“I do not think this is unreasonable, from the point of view of ordinary

Americans, people who pay the taxes and support our government, and who feel

ripped off by the prices today.  If we are going to put our tax-payer dollars

into the research and into the support, and then the pharmaceuticals companies

are going to get the patent, at a very minimum, they ought to be willing to sell

the drug to the people in our country at a reasonable price, to be defined by

the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  That’s what this amendment says. 

It’s all about corporate welfare at its worst, its all about being there for

consumers, its all about ensuring people that their tax-payer dollars are

contributing to some research that in turn will contribute affordable

prescription drugs for themselves, their parents and their children,” Wellstone

said.



<p>The National Institutes of Health are the crown jewel of American science,

producing life-saving drugs of enormous value to our nation and the world.  From

1955 to 1992, for example, 92% of drugs approved by the FDA to treat cancer were

researched and developed by the NIH.  



<p>Currently, once NIH has successfully developed a new drug, funded by U.S.

taxpayers, it signs over monopoly commercial rights to big pharmaceutical

companies which can – and do – charge American consumers as much as they want. 

In the case of Levamisole, a profitable pharmaceutical took exclusive rights to

a drug with NIH-discovered anti-colon cancer properties and charged consumers

over one hundred times its cost.  Tamoxifen, a breast cancer drug, which was the

product of 140 NIH clinical trials, is sold to American consumers for $214,

while selling in Canada for $34. 



<p>The Wellstone amendment would require price agreements which are ‘reasonable’ be

included by the NIH in licensing agreements with pharmaceutical companies for

patented drugs based on in-house NIH research; information derived form animal

tests or human clinical trials that are conducted by the Department of Health

and Human Services with respect to a drug; and agreements stemming from

cooperative research and development agreements pertaining to a drug between the

NIH and another entity, but excluding such agreements with universities. 



<p>“Don’t let the pharmaceutical lobby and its PR machine mislead you,” Wellstone

told fellow senators.  “This amendment does not establish a healthcare price

control scheme – it simply re-instates the Bush administration’s reasonable

pricing clause which was the law from 1989-1995.  American taxpayers should get

a return on their investment, not the highest drug prices in the world.”



<p>Last year, the cost of prescription drugs skyrocketed by an estimated 17%. This

year, drug

costs are expected to rise another 18%.
