- February 29 - A unique combination of satellite imagery, 

  geographic information systems (GIS), mapping software, the Internet and on-the-ground 

  observation is giving the general public a clearer picture of the threats to 

  the world’s forests. </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The picture is not pretty: the world’s remaining frontier forests are rapidly 

  being logged over and opened up for development. The maps and reports of Canada, 

  Gabon and Cameroon were released today during the launch of <b>Global Forest Watch</b>, 

  an initiative of the World Resources Institute.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Two years ago, we documented that only a fifth of the world’s historic 

  forest cover remains as frontier forests or large tracts of intact forests. 

  At the current rate of expansion, we estimated that another 40 percent would 

  be lost in the next 10 to 20 years,&quot; said Dirk Bryant, director of Global 

  Forest Watch. &quot;It now looks like we have underestimated those threats in 

  some places.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The maps and reports reveal widespread logging in the forests of the Congo 

  Basin, and extensive mining, energy and road construction projects in the forests 

  of Canada. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For the first time, we are mapping out logging across the Congo Basin, 

  a region that contains the world’s second largest contiguous tropical forest 

  after the Amazon,&quot; said Bryant. &quot;Canada’s intact forests are being 

  opened up for large-scale exploitation, including those in the environmentally-sensitive 

  far northern forests.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reports released by Global Forest Watch today are <i>A First Look at Logging 

  in Gabon</i>, <i>Canada’s Forests at a Crossroads: An Assessment in the Year 

  2000</i> and <i>An Overview of Logging in Cameroon</i>. The reports and the 

  maps are also available in the website, <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org">http://www.globalforestwatch.org.</a> 

  The website currently uses an interactive map server and the cutting-edge software 

  that easily allows the integration of local data with satellite imagery. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Global Forest Watch addresses the perennial problem of the lack of transparency 

  and easy access to information. During the next 5 years, this international 

  network will span 21 countries and cover 80 percent of the world’s remaining 

  frontier forests.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Global Forest Watch combines on-the-ground knowledge with digital and satellite 

  technology to provide accurate forest information to anyone with access to the 

  Internet. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The key is the power of information,&quot; said Jonathan Lash, president 

  of the World Resources Institute. &quot;What Global Forest Watch does is put 

  communities, people, activists, and wood consumers together and provide them 

  with information about what is happening to the forests.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Global Forest Watch identifies and promotes successful forest management practices, 

  enables governments to better manage their forests, and provides local groups 

  with the information they will need to participate in the management of their 

  forests.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WRI board chairman Bill Ruckelshaus said that Global Forest Watch would not 

  have been possible a few years ago. &quot;It is a reality now because of the 

  growth of local citizen’s groups, the expansion of the Internet and other digital 

  technologies and the new partnerships being forged by businesses, governments 

  and environmental groups.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Global Forest Watch has received support from both environmental groups and 

  industry. It currently has 75 partners in 7 countries. Software companies such 

  as Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) and ERDAS, and home furnishings 

  company, IKEA, have given major donations to support Global Forest Watch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have committed that by Sept. 1, we will not use solid wood from natural 

  intact forests. To be able to live up to this, we have to know where the natural 

  intact forests are and which forests need protection,&quot; said Jan Kjellman, 

  president of IKEA North America. IKEA is the world’s largest home furnishings 

  company with 156 stores in 28 countries. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through the donations of ESRI and ERDAS, Global Forest Watch partners will 

  be using the latest software to document and map what has been observed in the 

  field. &quot;Global Forest Watch is a good model of how technology can be used 

  to protect the environment,&quot; said Jack Dangermond, ESRI president. &quot;Thanks 

  to new technologies, we are better positioned to head off further threats to 

  the world’s remaining intact forests.&quot;</font></p>
