- November 1 - "The prospect of waking up on November 8 to a Bush presidency is too dangerous to too many.  Ralph, do not let your candidacy be the reason for that to happen," wrote a number of progressive members of Congress, labor leaders, women rights advocates and others to Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader. They continued, "Ask your supporters to in swing states to vote for Al Gore."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those who signed the letter have worked side by side with Nader for years on consumer safety, labor rights, and environmental protection campaigns in Washington and across the country.  They write that, while they have been "inspired" by Nader for decades, they find it inconceivable that "...[y]ou can disregard, or even relish, the fact that your candidacy may help elect George W. Bush as president on November 7 and may result in control of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives by forces who would turn back the clock on civil rights, economic gains and social justice."

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An Open Letter to Ralph Nader



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">November 1, 2000

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Ralph:



	</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have worked with you and been inspired by you for decades.  So, it is with great sorrow and deep disappointment that we have heard your statements about the upcoming election.  It is simply inconceivable to us that you can disregard, or even relish, the fact that your candidacy may help elect George W. Bush as president on November 7  and may result in control of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives by forces who would turn back the clock on civil rights, economic gains and social justice.

 

	</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The truth is that there are major differences between George Bush and Al Gore on many critical issues.  For people of color, women, children, seniors, low-wage workers, those unable to find meaningful employment, people with disabilities and communities facing environmental threats, the outcome of this election will have real consequences.  The future of affirmative action, a woman's right to choose, funding for public education, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, Hate Crimes legislation, Medicare and Social Security are at stake.  We cannot afford to put them in jeopardy.



	</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The prospect of waking up on November 8th to a Bush Presidency is too dangerous for too many.  Ralph, do not let your candidacy be the reason for that to happen. Ask your supporters in swing states to vote for Al Gore and then join you - and us - in building an ever-stronger movement to promote progressive constituencies and win progressive victories.



</font></p>
