<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK  

- February 4 - In a letter to Acting President Vladimir

Putin, Human Rights Watch today condemned the Russian government for

exchanging journalist Andrei Babitsky for Russian soldiers held by

Chechen rebels, which, according to a Russian government spokesperson,

took place on February 3, 2000.  Human Rights Watch expressed grave

concern for Mr. Babitsky's well-being, as the journalist has not been

seen or heard from since the exchange was said to have taken place.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. Babitsky, a correspondent for Radio Liberty, had been reporting from

the besieged capital of Grozny when Russian forces detained him on

January 15. He was held in incommunicado detention in Chechnya for over

two weeks. On February 3, a Russian government spokesman claimed that

Mr. Babitsky had been handed over to a Chechen military unit in exchange

for two Russian prisoners of war. The spokesman said Mr. Babitsky signed

a statement agreeing to this exchange.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Not only are we concerned about Mr. Babitsky's treatment during his

detention,  we are especially troubled that no one has heard from him

since the reported exchange," said Holly Cartner, director of Human

Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia divsion. "The Russian government

had an obligation to insure his safety and must now provide information

about his release and whereabouts."</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch also urged the

Russian government to provide credible evidence that Mr. Babitsky was in

good health at the time the exchange was said to have taken place.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch charges that if Mr. Babitsky was indeed exchanged for

Russian prisoners of war, Russia had essentially treated him -- a

noncombatant and a Russian journalist -- as if he were a hostage who was

captured from enemy territory and then traded to the enemy for gain.

The practice of taking noncombatants hostage is explicitly prohibited by

common article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and article 4 of

Protocol II. Russia's treatment of Mr. Babitsky thus runs counter to the

spirit of common article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and Protocol

II.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch also questioned the voluntary nature of the agreement

to be exchanged for Russian prisoners of war which Mr. Babitsky

apparently signed, as Mr. Babitsky had no access to a lawyer during his

incommunicado detention.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch stated that video footage of the exchange, shown on

Russian television on February 4, did little to alleviate these

concerns. "The footage simply shows Babitsky being handed over to two

unidentifiable men in masks, and it is unclear when or where the footage

was shot."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch emphasized that the Russian government is responsible

both for Andrei Babitsky's treatment in Russian detention, and his fate

after the alleged handover to Chechen rebels. It urged the Russian

government to:



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*Clarify the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Babitsky's release;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">



*Provide the identity of the Russian and Chechen military units present

at the time of Mr. Babitsky's "release;"



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*Provide credible evidence that he was released in good health, and that

his treatment in Russian detention was conform international standards;



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*Take all necessary measures to locate Mr. Babitsky and insure his

safety.
