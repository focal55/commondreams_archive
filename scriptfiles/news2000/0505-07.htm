- May 5 - On May 22, The Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious 

Understanding will recognize Bishop Basilio do Nascimento, an East Timorese 

Catholic bishop, with its Peace Activist Award for his work in preserving 

peace amongst his fellow East Timorese, despite a quarter of a century of 

bloody, civil conflict between East Timor and occupying armed forces from 

neighboring Indonesia. Fellow countryman and  1996 Nobel laureate Dr. José 

Ramos-Horta will accompany Father Filomeno Jacob, a priest who led the 

resistance campaign against the Indonesian militia in East Timor, to the 

Tanenbaum Center's Sixth Annual Award Ceremony and Memorial Lecture, 6-7:30 

PM at the Park Avenue Synagogue (50 East 87th Street, NYC). The annual 

awards recognize the outstanding contributions of individuals to the cause 

of interreligious understanding around the world.



<p>The Tanenbaum Center's Peace Activist Award recognizes religious leaders 

whose lives and freedom are at risk because of their efforts to promote 

peace and reconciliation in the face of violent conflicts. Through it, the 

Tanenbaum Center works to assist religiously-motivated individuals to 

prevent, ameliorate or resolve conflicts around the world, whether they are 

in Northern Ireland, Bosnia or East Timor. In this respect the Center's 

objectives are fourfold:



<ul>

<li>To provide a degree of international recognition to individuals who are 

risking their lives and their freedom in the cause of peace;</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>To create a measurable degree of impact on the ground of the recipients' 

home countries through case studies which should help not only our 

activists but others striving for peace to better understand when and how 

to intervene to resolve conflict;</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>To inspire activists in other hotspots to follow the example of the Peace 

Activists and to assist these other peacemakers in adapting to use in their 

own countries the techniques which our Awardees have applied;</li>

</ul>

<p><ul>

<li>To provide visibility to the Tanenbaum Center which could make a future 

channel for assistance and aid from international donors and other NGOs to 

these hotspots</li>

</ul>



<p>The Tanenbaum Center plans to identify ten additional Peace Activists each 

year to help form a global network of religiously-motivated leaders who can 

consult each other in a time of crisis. A Tanenbaum Center-coordinated 

website (to be established) will also help develop, maintain and inform 

this network of activists.



  

<p>"Bishop do Nascimento, East Timorese parish priests like Father Jacob, 

and the other individuals recognized by the Tanenbaum Center at this year's 

Award Ceremony have been instrumental, via their words and their 

conscientious actions, in healing the wounds of interreligious strife in 

their communities and countries," said Dr. Georgette Bennett, President of 

the Tanenbaum Center. "The past year has witnessed religion as a decisive 

factor in a number of ongoing conflicts-from a slow rebuilding of an entire 

nation in East Timor to continuing efforts at a lasting peace in Northern 

Ireland, and as an element in the Presidential elections here in the 

U.S.  The Tanenbaum Center intends to play a vital role in organizing and 

assisting these peace activists to overcome religious differences and 

resolve the national struggles they embody."



<p>It is especially appropriate and poignant that this year-in the wake of the 

Pope's recent visit to the Holy Land and his formal apologies to Jews for 

persecution by Christians-that Dr. Eugene Fisher is recognized for his 

efforts with the Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum Award for the Advancement of 

Interreligious Understanding. His writings have helped clarify areas of 

prejudice and misunderstanding between Catholics and Jews. Dr. Fisher is 

Director for Catholic-Jewish Relations of the Commission on Ecumenical and 

Interreligious Affairs of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, and 

the only American Consultor to the Vatican Commission for Religious 

Relations with the Jews (appointed by Pope John Paul II in 1981). William 

Cardinal Keeler, Archbishop of Balitmore will be presenting Dr. Fisher's award.



<p>Among the other honored guests and award recipients attending this year's 

ceremonies will be advertising guru Jerry Della Femina, principal of the 

advertising firm Della Femina/Jeary and Partners and a respected innovator 

in creative advertising since the 1960s. Mr. Della Femina will be honored 

with the Tanenbaum Center's Media Bridge Builder Award for his 

philanthropic work in building bridges of communication between 

communities. Mr. Della Femina has long used his eminence in advertising for 

philanthropic purposes and was recently named by Advertising Age as one of 

the 100 most influential advertising people of the century.



<p>Actor James Earl Jones will take a key role in the ceremony, and Felicia 

Rashad will serve as Master of Ceremonies. Entertainment will be provided 

by the Boys Choir of Harlem.

<p>





For interested media, if you would like to speak with Father Jacob, Dr. 

Ramos-Horta, Dr. Bennett, or any of the other award recipients please 

contact John Showalter (x. 511) or Kona Luseni (x. 531), at (212) 780-1900. 

The Father's and Dr. Ramos-Horta's New York visit is extremely brief, and 

advanced, scheduled, interviews are strongly recommended.





<p>The Tanenbaum Center is a nonsectarian organization whose sole purpose is 

to apply interreligious understanding as a tool to prevent and resolve 

intergroup conflicts in the workplace, classroom, and the public arena. Our 

namesake, Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum, was a world-renowned leader in 

ecumenism, human rights, and social justice.  The Center was established 

shortly after his death in 1992 to carry on his life's work to promote 

interfaith understanding and take action against the divisive and 

destructive effects of religious and ethnic hatred.
