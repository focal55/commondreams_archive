- March 7 - Today&#146;s United States Department of Agriculture&#146;s (USDA) proposal for

national organic standards &#150; under which no irradiated food can be labeled organic

&#150; is a step in the right direction because it will help guide consumers away from irradiated foods. Americans clearly want to

know whether their food has been exposed to radiation and are concerned about the impacts

irradiated food may have on their health.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, we urge the government to do more. Every food product that is irradiated

should be labeled as such. (Irradiated food sold in restaurants and cafeterias, for

example, does not have to be labeled for customers.) Officials should not relax labeling

standards, as they are considering doing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The long-term health effects of eating irradiated food are unknown. Research shows that

irradiation reduces the vitamin content of food and creates new chemical substances called

radiolytic products. Some of these substances are known carcinogens, like benzene, while

others are completely new substances that have not been tested for toxicity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Corporate agribusiness interests have lobbied the government to approve food

irradiation because irradiation masks the unsanitary conditions under which animals are

raised, slaughtered and processed. These conditions have set the stage for infection and

disease. Irradiation therefore gives consumers a false sense of security that the problem

has been solved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 1997 poll conducted by CBS News found 77 percent of the public does not want to eat

irradiated food. And during a recent period when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

proposed eliminating the labeling of poultry, meat, vegetables and other food products

that have been irradiated, it received more than 20,000 comments from the public &#150;

the majority of them in favor of maintaining proper labeling.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is clear that USDA recognizes that irradiation changes the quality of food. Public

Citizen supports USDA&#146;s move but calls on the agency to strengthen labeling laws and

conduct long-term research on the health effects of eating irradiated food.<br>
