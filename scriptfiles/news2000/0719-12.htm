- July 19 - If nuclear waste is transported through Colorado to Nevada for permanent

storage as proposed, Denver could experience serious threats to public health, the

environment and the economy in the event of a crash or a radiation leak, public interest

groups said today.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerned citizens, elected officials and civic leaders joined Public Citizen at a

press conference held outside Muneca&#146;s Restaurant on route I-70 to call attention to

the dangers associated with transporting high-level radioactive waste through Colorado. A

public workshop on the topic of high-level waste transportation is to be held tonight at

Iliff School of Theology in Denver. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is currently preparing to recommend Yucca Mountain,

located near Las Vegas, Nev., as a &quot;permanent disposal site&quot; for high-level

radioactive waste generated by atomic weapons facilities and commercial nuclear reactors

across the country. A new analysis prepared by the Clark County Comprehensive Planning

Division in Nevada found that the waste would travel through 734 counties with a total

population of 138 million people. Because of its location, Denver would likely be a major

hub through which the waste would travel.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Members of Congress are under intense pressure from the nuclear power industry to

force a dump at Yucca Mountain,&quot; said Bob Halstead, transportation advisor to the

state of Nevada&#146;s Nuclear Waste Project Office. &quot;If the nuclear industry

prevails, Americans in 43 states will have the risks of nuclear waste transportation

imposed on them and their communities for at least 25 years while the waste is being

shipped to Yucca Mountain.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today&#146;s press conference took place against the backdrop of the Denver skyline and

in view of the I-70 and Union Pacific rail line, which would be likely nuclear waste

transportation routes. To date, DOE has refused to specify which routes would be used ship

waste; information about the potential routes evaluated in a draft environmental impact

statement has not been made public. However, experts with the state of Nevada have

analyzed likely routes and concluded that about 20,000 shipments of high-level waste could

pass through Denver, Halstead said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Press conference participants raised concerns about the transportation scheme&#146;s

safety. A 1987 study sponsored by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission used computer

modeling to predict how the casks that would be used to transport nuclear waste would

perform in the event of an accident. But the casks themselves have never been subjected to

full-scale testing. DOE risk analysis data indicate that between 70 and 310 accidents

could be expected involving waste shipments to Nevada. It&#146;s unclear whether

hospitals, police and rescue personnel in Colorado could respond effectively to a nuclear

waste emergency.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Betty Kelly, proprietor of Muneca&#146;s Restaurant, said that she is very concerned

about the impact of high-level waste transport on property values for homes and business

along I-70. Evidence suggests that even without an accident, property values are likely to

drop along nuclear waste transportation routes due to a public perception of danger.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Transportation hazards are not the only risks associated with the proposal to build a

permanent nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. Scientists in Nevada have pointed to

the danger of groundwater contamination if waste were to leak. Further, if an earthquake

were to hit, the storage canisters themselves could break open. The chance of an

earthquake occurring is far from remote; Nevada ranks third in the country for seismic

activity. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no safe way to dispose of nuclear waste,&quot; said Lisa Gue, policy

analyst for Public Citizen. &quot;A repository at Yucca Mountain would have a regulatory

period of 10,000 years, but the waste will remain dangerously radioactive for much longer.

No one can guarantee the integrity of the storage casks so far into the future.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. LeRoy Moore, of the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center agreed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The proposal to build a permanent storage facility at Yucca Mountain does not

address the nuclear waste problem. It merely transfers the risk to the state of Nevada and

to communities like Denver, which are unlucky enough to be located along transportation

routes targeted for the large-scale shipment of nuclear waste. Given the uncertainties

about Yucca Mountain and the enormous risks of transporting this material, it makes much

more sense to leave the waste at the generation plant, while developing a better

alternative.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other speakers at the press conference included Debbie Ortega, president of the Denver

City Council and Chris Arend, who spoke on behalf of Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today&#146;s events are being held as part of the Radioactive Roads and Rails Campaign,

supported nationally by Public Citizen and the <a href="http://www.nirs.org/">Nuclear

Information and Resource Service</a> (NIRS), and in Colorado by the Rocky Mountain Peace

and Justice Center, Colorado Coalition for the Prevention of Nuclear War, and the Iliff

School of Theology Peace and Justice Studies. </font>
