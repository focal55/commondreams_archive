- June 2 - Environmental Defense today 

          called on the House and Senate to strengthen pipeline safety in the 

          United States. The group made its call as the Office of Pipeline Safety 

          (OPS) announced it is seeking a $3 million fine against the Olympic 

          Pipeline Company. OPS has charged the company with numerous safety violations 

          found in the wake of an accident that killed three youths in Bellingham, 

          Washington last year.  

        </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "Today's action by the 

          Office of Pipeline Safety, while welcome, is simply not enough to prevent 

          future tragedies," said Lois Epstein, an Environmental Defense senior 

          engineer. "A complete overhaul of current pipeline law, regulatory standards, 

          and the Office of Pipeline Safety is needed to prevent serious pipeline 

          incidents." </font> 

        

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two 10-year-old boys and 

          an 18-year-old died after a pipeline operated by Olympic ruptured last 

          June, spewing out 229,000 gallons of gasoline into a creek, which then 

          ignited a fireball. "Unfortunately, this accident was not an isolated 

          incident," said Epstein. "According to the Department of Transportation's 

          Inspector General, OPS standards are inadequate and its inspectors are 

          not trained to assess the industry's inspection findings." </font> 

        

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1990s, nearly 200 

          oil pipeline accidents were reported each year, and over 6 million gallons 

          of oil were released annually, more than half the size of the Exxon 

          Valdez spill. The biggest cause of releases from oil pipelines is external 

          and internal corrosion. </font>

        

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's proposed fine compares 

          unfavorably to the $35 million fine the US Environmental Protection 

          Agency levied against Koch Industries, Inc. in January of this year 

          for multiple pipeline spills, and its February 1999 criminal penalty 

          against Colonial Pipeline Company for a major spill into South Carolina's 

          Reedy River. </font>

        

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The House and Senate need 

          to address pipeline legislation this session. Strict liability for pipeline 

          owners and operators following releases, significantly stronger state 

          and community right-to-know provisions, directives and deadlines for 

          tougher federal standards, pipeline employee whistleblower protections, 

          and legal changes allowing citizen lawsuits against pipeline companies 

          are all desperately needed. Strong protections are needed now to prevent 

          more fatal accidents," said Epstein. </font>
