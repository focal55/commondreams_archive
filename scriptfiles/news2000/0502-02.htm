- May 2 - "We are watching you," warns National Organization for Women Executive

Vice President Kim Gandy to U.S. senators

and powerful credit card companies that are pursuing the so-called Bankruptcy

Reform Act.&nbsp; "If you enrich financial bigwigs, at the expense of pensioners

and single mothers trying to collect child support, you will answer to

the voters in November."&nbsp;&nbsp; The changes would further empower

wealthy creditors and limit consumer rights under federal bankruptcy law.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One particularly onerous section of the bill would allow lenders to

require, as a condition of receiving a loan or obtaining credit, that a

borrower give up the traditional protection of her pension benefits in

the event of a future bankruptcy.&nbsp; "These institutions are just out

of control.&nbsp; They've gotten so greedy that they're ready to steal

from our grandmothers," said Gandy.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"For many women, child support payments are the only thing keeping their

families out of poverty – and this bill will make it even more difficult

to collect.&nbsp; Women and children will suffer," Gandy said.&nbsp; Statistics

show that women are the fastest growing segment of the public declaring

bankruptcy -- often in the wake of divorce or financial reversals such

as job loss or serious illness.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even though some Members – on both sides of the issue – say that new

language in the bankruptcy bill protects payment of child support obligations,

it does not.&nbsp; In reality, other types of debts are given priority

in S. 625/H.R. 833 -- and provisions which make fewer debts dischargeable

mean that payment of child support obligations is going to be much more

difficult.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, NOW is particularly concerned that some senators are attempting

to water down the impact of the Clinic Violence Amendment.&nbsp; That amendment

is targeted at violent abortion rights activists who would use a&nbsp;

loophole in current law to hide assets and use bankruptcy in order to avoid

paying legal fines, damages and related court fees.&nbsp; The Senate

passed the amendment by 80 - 17; but, anti-abortion senators have let it

be known that they would like to eliminate the amendment.</font>
