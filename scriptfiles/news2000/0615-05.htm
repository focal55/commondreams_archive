- June 15 - The following was



released today by the National Association of Community Action



Agencies:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Why, in this booming economy, do so many politicians, both



Republicans and Democrats, not see that we must help those who need



help -- the more than 14 million children who do not get enough to



eat, who live in substandard housing and don't receive adequate



education and health care?" asked Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-MN) at



today's National Town Hall Meeting on Poverty. "And what about the



millions of adults who work, but do not make enough to support



themselves and their families?" he added.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 150 people from across the country gathered in Washington



today to look at the who and why of poverty. These people have



taken part in over 500 dialogues on poverty in their local



communities and states to explore the public policy actions that



need to be taken by state and federal political leaders to solve



poverty-related problems.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There is a disconnect between what the public and the



politicians think about poverty and what it really is," according



to Deepak Bhargava, Center for Community Change. "The voices



missing from the national debate are those who have experienced



poverty first-hand. Those are the people that national policymakers



don't see," he added.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wellstone and other meeting participants called for legislation



that guarantees a living wage and provides health care and adequate



housing to those who can't afford them.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 34 million people live below the official federal



poverty level. And millions more are among the working poor who



are employed in jobs that pay the minimum wage ($5.15 an hour) and



offer few, if any, benefits such as health insurance or pensions.



A full-time, year round worker making the minimum wage earns about



$10,700 per year -- hardly enough to support an individual or a



family.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Town Hall Meeting is being sponsored by the National



Association of Community Action Agencies (NACAA) as part of the



Dialogue on Poverty 2000: Leading America to Community Action.

</font>
