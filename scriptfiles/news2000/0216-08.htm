          - February 16 - Germany’s minister for health announced today the suspension 

          of approval for Novartis’ Bt 176 corn on the grounds that the action 

          was necessary to protect consumers and defend precautionary health protection. 

          According to Minister Andrea Fischer, who holds full responsibility 

          for approving genetically modified organisms (GMO), the key factor in 

          the decision is that Novartis’ insect-killing Bt corn contains an antibiotic 

          resistance gene. She also hinted at unresolved questions about detrimental 

          effects on non-target species and dispersal of the Bt toxin in soil. 

          </font> 

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We had 

            to act now,&quot; explained Fischer, &quot;as we learned that Novartis 

            has applied for unrestricted approval of the seeds of these (corn) 

            varieties. With the suspension of the approval for the release [of 

            Bt] as GMO, such seed approvals are automatically stalled as well.&quot; 

            Fischer confirmed that any planting of Novartis Bt corn is banned 

            in Germany immediately. Fischer also said that she intended to open 

            a new round of risk assessments of GMOs and invited all stakeholders 

            to participate in this discussion. </font>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The German 

            Minister’s decision is a step in the right direction and is an important 

            signal to industry, the public and the European Commission,&quot; 

            said Benedikt Haerlin of Greenpeace. &quot;We are confident that we 

            will be able to prevent the planting of GE corn in the rest of the 

            European Union. Nobody wants this GE corn in the fields, except Novartis. 

            We appreciate that now another important member state of the EU has 

            recognized that this corn is a threat to human health and the environment.&quot; 

            </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Fischer confirmed 

            that the German government was applying Art.16 of EU Directive 90/220, 

            which allows any member state to withdraw a GMO approval if it has 

            concerns about possible health or environmental impacts of the GMOs. 

            The suspension would last at least until there was a decision of the 

            European Commission on Germany’s objections. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Germany joins 

            France, Luxemburg, Portugal and Austria in formally banning the planting 

            of Novartis Bt corn. The corn was approved by the EU Commission in 

            1997 against massive protests held before the EU moratorium on GMO 

            approvals came into effect in 1999. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In the U.S., 

            the Environmental Protection Agency has been challenged in court for 

            its pesticide registration of Bt corn. Greenpeace and a coalition 

            of over 70 plaintiffs sued the EPA, charging the agency with the wanton 

            destruction of the world's most important biological pesticide—Bt. 

            Scientists warn that corn genetically engineered with the Bt pesticide 

            in each of its cells could lead to insect resistance within 3 to 4 

            years. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Market rejection 

            of Bt corn cost U.S. farmers more than $200 million in export revenue 

            last year. A recent Reuters poll of 400 farmers predicted a 24 percent 

            decline in the planting of Bt corn and a 26 percent decline in the 

            planting of Bt cotton this year. Currently, Bt corn is grown on approximately 

            20 million acres in the U.S., and Bt cotton on about 7 million acres.</font>
