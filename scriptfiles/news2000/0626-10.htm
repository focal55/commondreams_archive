- June 26 - Today a Florida appellate

        court affirmed its decision that Coastal Petroleum Company cannot drill for oil off the

        coast of St. George Island, Florida, and clarified an earlier statement that the company

        was entitled to compensation because its permit had been denied. The court held that the

        question of whether the company should or should not be compensated as a result of the

        permit denial would have to be determined in a separate proceeding by a separate court.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>In the June 26 order, the First District Court of Appeal ruled on a motion filed

        by several parties in a four-year courtroom battle begun when Earthjustice Legal Defense

        Fund challenged a permit request by Coastal Petroleum Company on behalf of three

        conservation groups. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the state

        Attorney General, Florida Wildlife Federation, Audubon of Florida, and the Florida Chapter

        of the Sierra Club had asked the court to reconsider its October 6, 1999, ruling that the

        company should be compensated for the permit denial. Today the court agreed with the state

        agencies and conservation groups.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>&quot;We argued that the denial of a single permit to protect Florida&#146;s

        coastal waters and wildlife couldn&#146;t be considered a &#145;take&#146; of property in

        this court, and we won,&quot; said David Guest, managing attorney of the Tallahassee

        office of Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund. &quot;This is a crucial milestone in the

        protection of Florida&#146;s pristine coastal waters.&quot;</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>&quot;It&#146;s been a long, bitter fight but justice has finally

        prevailed,&quot; said Manley Fuller, President of the Florida Wildlife Federation.

        &quot;Offshore oil drilling is bad news for Florida.&quot;</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>&quot;We now know the permit is dead and the court has put off any decision on

        property rights to a completely separate proceeding, said Charles Lee, Senior Vice

        President of Audubon Society of Florida. &quot;This is great news for all of

        Florida&#146;s coastal waters.&quot;</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>The Tallahassee office of Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund--the nation&#146;s

        largest public interest environmental law firm--filed a lawsuit opposing the permit almost

        four years ago on behalf of the Florida Wildlife Federation, the Sierra Club and Audubon

        of Florida. The lawsuit, joined immediately by Attorney General Bob Butterworth, argued

        that the environmental consequences of such drilling were far too great to allow a permit.

        The First District Court of Appeal affirmed the Department of Environmental

        Protection&#146;s denial of the permit in its October 6 order.</small></font>
