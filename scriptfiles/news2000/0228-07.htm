- February 28 - In response to Senator John McCain’s statements criticizing Governor George W. Bush for &quot;pandering to the outer reaches of American politics,&quot; including Pat Robertson, People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas issued the following statement:</font>

<p></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;John McCain is right to criticize Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and George W. Bush today, but it is hypocritical for him to do so without getting his own house in order. Over the past month, John McCain has also pandered to the Radical Right time and again.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In South Carolina he refused, like George W. Bush, to take a position on the flying of the Confederate battle flag over the state capitol.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;McCain has failed to fire or repudiate the views of Richard Quinn, a $20,000-a-month campaign adviser who has held a top editorial position for two decades with the neo-confederate publication <u>Southern Partisan</u>. Quinn has written columns attacking Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela, discounting the evils of slavery, and commending those who voted for former KKK leader David Duke when he ran for public office.  The magazine, where Quinn is Editor-in-Chief, has been – at best – racially insensitive and its merchandising arm even promotes materials celebrating the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.  Ironically, Quinn’s list of previous clients even includes Pat Robertson’s 1988 presidential campaign.    </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;McCain has embraced the endorsement of Gary Bauer, who agrees with Robertson, Falwell, and Bush adviser Ralph Reed on virtually every substantive issue. Bauer even joined with these and others from the Radical Right in mounting a harsh public attack against Colin Powell for his moderate Republican views in late 1995, when Powell was considering a run for the Presidency.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Based on some of his advisers and his eighteen-year voting record in Congress, there’s more evidence that McCain has rejected, not embraced, the party of Abraham Lincoln.&quot;</font></p>
