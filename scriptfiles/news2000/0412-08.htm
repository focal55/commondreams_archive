- April 12 - Critics of the IMF and World Bank include Jeffrey Sachs, director of the

Harvard Institute for International Development and an advisor to countries

around the world. Today he told "Inside Capital" -- 

<a href="http://www.radioproject.org">http://www.radioproject.org</a>

-- that the IMF, "with the very heavy backing of the U.S. government, really

tries to run countries all over the world, and they don't do a very good job

of it." Also, the former World Bank chief economist Joseph Stiglitz, now at

the Brookings Institution, has written a New Republic piece quite critical of

the IMF (available at <a href="http://thenewrepublic.com/041700/stiglitz041700.html">http://thenewrepublic.com/041700/stiglitz041700.html</a>).



Here are other critics of the IMF and World Bank, available for interviews:

</a>Chair of the Religious Working Group on the World Bank & IMF, a coalition

of 45 organizations, Dennis said today: "This is a Jubilee year. It's a

Biblical concept, explicitly referred to in Leviticus and Isaiah but

underpinning much of Scripture. It's a call for a Sabbath, when business as

usual stops, when people are allowed back to their land, when those

imprisoned by debt or in prison are set free, when the earth is allowed to

rest and things are set straight again. Following this tradition, we are

calling for a cancellation of the burden on heavily indebted countries."

Representative of Soweto in the Town Council of Johannesburg, Ngwane said

today: "The ordinary American citizen is not aware that the policies of the

World Bank and IMF are anti-poor and anti-working class. Their structural

adjustment policies discourage government spending on social welfare and

demand the commodification of essential services like water, electricity and

education. When the ANC government took over, we had a policy that every

citizen was entitled to 50 liters of water per day since during apartheid

many people did not have the water they needed. The World Bank said no, they

said there should be user fees for water and advocated outhouses instead,

but the water table is high and the soil is porous -- the World Bank plan

would have had disastrous health effects. Only through protests were we able

to stop it. In South Africa, our vision was to make education free, but the

World Bank came with this idea that the user must pay, so schools are being

forced to charge. This year, due to budget constraints, the government

stopped funding kindergarten."

Co-author of the forthcoming "Where Vultures Feast: Forty Years of Shell in

the Niger Delta," Douglas was one of the Nigerian lawyers for Ken Saro Wiwa,

an activist who was executed in 1995 by Nigeria's military dictatorship

because of his opposition to Shell's drilling. Douglas, who is deputy

director of Environmental Rights Action, said today: "In Nigeria, through

structural adjustment policies, the IMF and World Bank have wiped out the

middle class, destroyed our educational system, impoverished the people and

been a source of pain in our country. What we have right now is a tiny cabal

of extremely rich people and millions of people who are extremely poor. This

was not the case before the IMF and World Bank started tinkering with our

economy."
