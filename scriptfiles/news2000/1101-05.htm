- November 1 - Farm policies during the Clinton-Gore

Administration have been a bi-partisan disaster for farmers, Ralph Nader

said today.



<p>“Many hoped the Clinton Administration would be more farmer-friendly

than the Reagan and Bush Administrations, but instead its policies have

moved in the direction of replacing family farms as the main food

production unit,” Nader said.



<p>Nader said the results of the Freedom to Farm Act—pushed by a Republican

Congress and signed by a Democratic President—has been historically low

commodity prices, severe decline in farmers and farm income.  “It has

meant grand profits for grain merchandisers who make money on low priced

purchases from farmers,” Nader said.



<p>Nader said the Clinton-Gore Administration has “presided over a record

number of mergers and acquisitions throughout the economy, much of it in

the agricultural sector.”



<p>“Sectors such as poultry, livestock, grain, flour milling and related

areas have seen growing concentration of control exercised by a handful

of firms like Cargill, ConAgra and Dupont/Pioneer, among others,” Nader

said.



<p>Nader said the “Freedom to Farm Act” was drafted by agribusiness

interests and peddled on the false premise that only increased

international trade was the only thing that was needed to make the

agricultural sector prosper.



<p>Nader said government policies have shown “little or no regard for

farmers net profit, ecological consequences or rural community

viability.”



<p>“Big Agri-corporations tend to incorporate savings from low farm prices

into profits rather than transferring the savings to consumers in the

form of lower prices,” Nader said.



<p>“If we want good resource managers, if we want food produced in an

environmentally responsible way, if we want the land held in a diverse

manner that provides the maximum amount of social, political and

economic benefit, then we have to start pursuing public policy that puts

the economic interests of family farmers ahead of the economic interests

of the corporate giants that control so much of agriculture today,”

Nader said.
