-  

June 30 - Eyewitnesses have brought evidence to the environmental group Bluewater Network that yet another cruise ship has been caught in the act of polluting the seas, this time right here in the Port of San Francisco. Bluewater Network and the EarthJustice Legal Defense Fund sent a letter of notice of intent to sue to Celebrity Cruises today, citing violations of the Clean Water Act for illegal dumping of oil and pollutants by its cruise ship MV Mercury. It also sent a letter to the Port of San Francisco, notifying them of the incident and reminding them of their responsibility to protect the port from ship pollution. 



<p>“It’s outrageous that a company with so many felony convictions for illegal dumping thinks it can continue this activity in the San Francisco Bay. They’re digging their own grave,” said Russell Long, Executive Director of Bluewater Network. The dumping was witnessed on the morning of September 21, 1999 when the Mercury was disembarking its passengers after an 11-day Alaska voyage. The ship was docked at San Francisco’s Pier 35. The witnesses were on their verandah watching a family of sea lions playing nearby when they smelled a very strong, noxious chemical odor emanating from below. They looked down at the water and saw the source of the odor -- a white, frothy liquid being discharged from the ship, accompanied by the unmistakable rainbow sheen of an oil slick. The discharge continued for some 30 minutes or more, and was so caustic that the sea lions left the area at once as it spread out. The couple said they believed they recognized the chemical odor as that of perchloroethylene, or “PERC,” the acutely hazardous chemical used by the ship’s onboard dry cleaning facility. The eyewitnesses, a couple from Las Vegas, brought their account to Bluewater Network’s attention after being given the run-around by EPA in their repeated attempts to report the incident. 



<p>Celebrity Cruises is owned by Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. Last July, in a criminal case brought by the US Department of Justice, Royal Caribbean pled guilty to 21 felonies, six of which were for illegal discharge of PERC into several US ports. The other felonies concerned routine illegal dumping of oil and the falsification of documents to cover it up. 



<p>This incident proves that the crimes committed by Royal Caribbean were not an isolated incident. The cruise industry has a long history of illegal dumping cases. Bluewater Network has been targeting the cruise industry in an effort to improve monitoring and regulation of its waste management activities. 



<p>The exposure of this incident comes at a particularly inopportune time for the cruise industry, which in recent weeks has been making the repeated assertion that it no longer dumps any waste in California waters and hasn’t for more than a year. This claim is the cornerstone of the cruise industry’s frenetic lobbying efforts to defeat a California bill which would enable greater oversight of the massive amounts of waste cruise ships generate. The bill, AB 2746 (Nakano), was sponsored by Bluewater Network in an effort to make the cruise industry more accountable for its wastes. 



<p>“It’s unconscionable, and frankly unbelievable, given Royal Caribbean’s rap sheet,” said Kira Schmidt, Director of Bluewater Network’s Cruise Ship Campaign. “We hope this will serve as a wake up call to legislators of the need to tighten the reins on cruise ship pollution, and to the cruise industry that they cannot continue to unabashedly pollute the seas.”
