- March 9 - An Inspector General report finding that the

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) invited a nuclear industry group to help shape

policy and later misled a congressman about the matter reinforces the widespread

contention that the agency does the bidding of the industry at the expense of the public,

Public Citizen said today.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report, released today, found that the NRC misled Rep. Edward J.

Markey (D-Mass) regarding the release of an internal commission policy paper to the

Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI). The NRC shared the paper, which addressed the NRC&#146;s

policy governing generic communications, with the NEI and provided the institute with an

exclusive opportunity to review and comment on it. The NRC told Markey&#146;s office that

the draft was simultaneously made available to the public when in fact it wasn&#146;t, the

report said. In fact, the NRC never solicited public comment on the document.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has abdicated its regulatory

responsibility to the nuclear industry and excluded the public from the process,&quot;

said Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass

Energy Project. &quot;The NRC is supposed to be regulating the nuclear industry, not

the other way around.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because these policy papers are the primary decision-making tool of

the commission, Public Citizen believes that it is improper for the nuclear industry to

have an exclusive opportunity to review and alter their contents. Allowing NEI to review

and alter NRC&#146;s policy papers is in direct conflict with at least two of the

NRC&#146;s &quot;principles of good regulation,&quot; which include independence and

openness, Hauter said. At the very least, the NRC should withdraw the document unless and

until all interested parties have an opportunity to review it and provide comment, she

said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The NRC gives little more than lip service to the notion of

public participation while simultaneously leaking internal commission documents to the

nuclear industry and then proceeds to lie about it to Congress,&quot; said James Riccio,

senior analyst with Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project. &quot;It is no wonder

that the NRC has garnered the disdain and mistrust of the public it is supposed to

represent and protect.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IG report, entitled &quot;Misleading NRC Response to a

Congressional Request for Information Concerning Circumstances Surrounding the Release of

Draft SECY - 99-143,&quot; states that &quot;information contained in a July 19, 1999,

letter signed by Chairman Dicus to Congressman Markey was inaccurate and misleading.&quot;

The letter from interim NRC Chairman Greta Dicus &quot;inaccurately depicts that between

April 7 and 22, 1999, the NRC staff simultaneously provided the draft SECY to NEI and the

public.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report determined that the inaccurate information given

Markey&#146;s office was &quot;built on erroneous information&quot; supplied by someone

involved in the development of the draft document. The information was not verified before

being sent to Markey&#146;s office. Further, more accurate information was available but

was not given to Markey. The report determined that NRC staff &quot;did not exercise due

care&quot; in ensuring the accuracy of the information. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Unfortunately, the NRC is neither independent nor open, and

neither objective nor unbiased,&quot; Riccio said. &quot;This investigation reinforces the

public's perception that the NRC has been thoroughly corrupted and captured by the

industry it is supposed to regulate.&quot;</font>
