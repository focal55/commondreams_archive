<br>

New satellite images of Pakistan's nuclear and missile

<br>

facilities provide fresh insight into the nuclear dangers on the



subcontinent. The high resolution images, acquired by the



Federation of American Scientists from the Space Imaging IKONOS



satellite, show details of Pakistan's weapons facilities previously



known only to the secret intelligence world. The public release of



these images on the eve of President Clinton's trip to India and



Pakistan highlights the urgency of new initiatives to address the



risk of nuclear escalation between these countries.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Federation's Public Eye project is acquiring imagery of



nuclear and missile facilities around the world. In February it



released imagery of the North Korean missile test facility, and



imagery of additional facilities will be released in coming weeks.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The imagery covers two of Pakistan's most important special



weapons facilities, the plutonium production reactor at Khushab,



and the nearby medium range missile base at Sargodha. Plutonium



from the Khushab reactor would probably be used in light-weight



nuclear warheads for the M-11 missiles at Sargodha, which Pakistan



acquired from China in the early 1990s. The new satellite imagery



indicates that construction of the Khushab reactor is essentially



complete, and that Pakistan has built a dozen garages for mobile



missile launchers and associated vehicles at Sargodha.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Pakistan has laid the groundwork for a force of dozens of



nuclear tipped missiles capable of striking Indian cities and



military bases. But Pakistan is in danger of having most of its



nuclear eggs in one basket, which would be a tempting target for a



pre-emptive Indian attack in a time of crisis," according to John



Pike, who directs the Federation's Public Eye project. "The United



States needs to work with India and Pakistan to reduce this



temptation for launching disarming attacks. With Pakistan and India



apparently moving ahead with deploying nuclear forces, the danger



of such attacks will grow. In the past, American policy focused on



preventing these countries from acquiring nuclear weapons. In the



future, American policy need a new focus on initiatives to reduce



the risk that these weapons will be used."

</font>

highlights of the satellite imagery, is available on the Web site
