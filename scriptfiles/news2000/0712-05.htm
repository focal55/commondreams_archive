- July 12 - Responding to reports that Northwest Airlines is

intensifying  negotiations on a merger deal  with American Airlines, Senator

Paul Wellstone today issued a sharp rebuke to the company, saying Northwest has

failed to communicate its plans to Minnesota.   Wellstone predicted that the

contemplated merger would have negative consequences for the state's economy,

hurting workers as well as air travelers to Minnesota.  He said he would oppose

the merger vigorously. 



<p>Last month Wellstone, an outspoken advocate for tough anti-trust action in many

sectors of the economy,  called on Northwest Airlines CEO John H. Dasburg to

inform Minnesotans about the impact of the company's rumored merger plans with

American.  Northwest never responded.  



<p>"We ought to be alarmed to hear that negotiations which had merely been rumored

now appear be a fact, and are intensifying.   Should these negotiations lead to

a merger between the two airlines, I will actively oppose it.  A few short years

ago, the State of Minnesota helped save Northwest Airlines financially when

there were serious concerns about the economic future of the company. 

Minnesotans are stakeholders in Northwest Airlines, and they deserve a careful

explanation of both why a merger may take place and what the impact of this

merger would be to our state.   Minnesotans, business travelers and vacation

travelers, travel agents and teachers, Northwest employees and Minnesota

taxpayers have a right  to know what Northwest's  intentions are.  All of

Minnesota's elected officials should hold Northwest accountable, and demand that

the company make clear its future intentions in Minnesota," Wellstone wrote.



<p>In June, Wellstone pressed the U.S. Department of Justice to block a proposed

merger of United Airlines and US Airways.  In a letter to Joel Klein, Assistant

Attorney General of the Antitrust Division, Wellstone said that a merger by the

two airlines would  reduce airline competition nationally, resulting in higher

prices for air travelers, and  would lead to yet another round of industry

mergers and consolidation, specifically a possible one between Minnesota-based

Northwest Airlines and American. 



<p>"I believe Northwest Airlines has an obligation to  Minnesotans to explain why

the airline feels that it might need to merge with American Airlines.  Does

Northwest believe a merger with another airline is inevitable if the United

Airlines - US Airways merger is approved?   If a merger were to take place, what

would the new airline look like?  Would Minnesota lose its hub airport?  Would

it lose Northwest's headquarters? Would we lose jobs?" asked Wellstone.   



<p>In the early 1990s when Northwest was facing financial difficulties,  the State

of Minnesota extended a financial aid package worth more than $300 million. 

Based upon Northwest keeping its operations hub in Minneapolis, the airport

currently is in the midst of undertaking tax-payer supported improvements worth

more than $2 billion.
