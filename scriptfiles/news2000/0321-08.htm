- March 21  - A group of African scholars and activists will

visit college campuses across the southeastern region of the U.S.

to promote better understanding of issues facing African nations.

Topics range from the floods in Mozambique to slavery in Mauritania

and Sudan to economic development throughout the continent. The

annual Africa Peace Tour, sponsored by the American Friends Service

Committee, will be launched from Atlanta, GA on April 9<sup>th</sup>

and conclude on April 15<sup>th</sup> in New Orleans, LA. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Tour organizers believe that in order to improve U.S. geopolitical

and economic policies toward Africa, citizens of this country

must be informed about current African issues. The tour takes

African activists to various communities to increase U.S. citizens'

understanding of the diverse cultures, languages, religions, economic

and social structures on the African continent. 

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While the pictures of the recent floods in Mozambique have

captured the attention of U.S. citizens, the issues underlying

Africa's problems with poverty, warfare, and economic debt are

rarely discussed in the U.S. media,&quot; said Jerry Herman, coordinator

of the Africa Program in AFSC's Peace Building Unit and the Africa

Peace Tour. &quot;During the Mozambican disaster, for instance,

the question of why Mozambique lacked the capacity to even minimally

cope with the floods, was never asked,&quot; Herman said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The Africa Peace Tour brings Africans directly to U.S. audiences

promoting personal contact, which gives local citizens access

to the continent on an understandable, compelling, and deeply

personal level. Ultimately, the Africa Peace Tour seeks to promote

organized U.S. citizen action that will influence U.S. policies

toward Africa.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Herman said that many concerns of Africans stopping the flow of

arms in their communities, stemming the outflow of natural and

human resources, preventing violence, and seeking an economic

livelihood for all people are similar to concerns of U.S. citizens.

&quot;We must support African peoples' right to select their own

governments, to demand responsible governance and to build societies

free from outside economic and military pressures,&quot; Herman

said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The speakers, from varied political, academic and activist backgrounds,

are from Southern Sudan, Mozambique, Liberia, Mauritania, Rwanda

and Western Sahara.
