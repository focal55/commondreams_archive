- June 21 - U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone today blasted the Clinton Administration's "Push

into Southern Colombia" military plan, and offered an amendment to the Foreign

Operations Appropriations Bill that would transfer $225 million from aid

earmarked for the Colombian military into U.S. domestic drug treatment programs.

<p>The Wellstone amendment, which failed by a vote of 89-11,  would have

transferred  funds to the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block

Grant, to provide desperately needed funds for state and local community-based

programs and for drug treatment programs within correctional facilities.  The

amendment would have left intact assistance for the Colombian government and

civil society, alternative development programs, judicial reform and human

rights, but sought to remove, and transfer to more effective domestic use, the

resources in the bill destined for the Colombian army's "Push into Southern

Colombia." 



<p>"The decision to fund the Colombian army's push into Southern Colombia  is an

enormous policy shift, and a profound mistake.   It represents a 7 to 1 shift in

funding from the Colombian Police to the Army. General McCaffrey says the

purpose of Plan Colombia is to help the Colombian army recover the southern part

of the country, currently under guerilla control. But, honestly, if the purpose

of this military aid is to stop drug-trafficking, shouldn't some of that aid

target the North as well?  Something strange is going on here," said Wellstone.



<p>The bulk of funding for the Administration's Colombia Plan focuses on the supply

side of the drug problem, without focusing on the severe emergency going on in

our own country --  the emergency of drug addiction and the lack of treatment

for those with this disease.  Wellstone insists that any effort to fight the

drug problem in our country also include treatment. 



<p>"Continuing to pursue our current Colombia counterinsurgency policy, cloaked

under the veil of anti-narcotics efforts, risks drawing us into a terrible

quagmire. History has repeatedly shown, especially in Latin America -- just

think of Nicaragua, or El-Salvador –  that the practical effect of the strategy

now under consideration, is to militarize–to escalate--the conflict, not end

it," Wellstone said. 



<p>The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy acknowledges that more

than half the adults in immediate need of treatment cannot receive treatment;

this means more than 2 million adults who need treatment right now are not

getting it. Wellstone's amendment would have resulted in an increase in the

state block grant that would enable state and local communities to immediately

address these unmet needs, reduce the waiting lists, and enable people with

addictions get the medical treatment they need.



<p>In Minnesota, there are presently 21,277 people who requested treatment and were

not able to receive it.  Most cited the lack of funds to pay for treatment, or

were put on waiting lists when they most needed treatment. 



<p>Funding for addiction treatment is cost-effective.  A landmark Rand study of

cocaine markets showed that, dollar for dollar, providing treatment to cocaine

users is 10 times more effective than drug interdiction schemes, and 23 times

more cost effective than eradicating coca at its source.



<p>"Human rights organizations have detailed, abundant, and compelling evidence of

continuing ties between the Colombian Army and paramilitary groups responsible

for gross human rights violations. Human Rights Watch has collected evidence

linking half of Colombia's eighteen brigade-level army units to paramilitary

activity. In other words, military support for paramilitaries remains national

in scope and includes areas where units receiving or scheduled to receive U.S.

military aid operate," Wellstone said.
