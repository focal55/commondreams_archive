- May 18 - In a move aimed at



protecting the public from the potential health and environmental



effects of genetically engineered (GE) foods, Friends of the Earth (FoE) attended the annual shareholder meeting of McDonalds



(NYSE: MCD) today.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A representative from the group spoke in favor of a shareholder



resolution that calls on the company to eliminate genetically



engineered ingredients from its products until long-term safety



testing proves they are safe. The resolution, filed by FoE in



partnership with other shareholder groups including the Adrian



Dominican Sisters, also calls for an interim step of labeling



products that contain GE ingredients.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"No one can say with certainty that genetically engineered food



is safe to eat over the long-term, said Sarah Newport, coordinator



of FoE's Safer Food, Safer Farms Campaign. "McDonalds has a



responsibility to its shareholders. The company's reputation is at



stake if it doesn't respond to American consumers who are



increasingly concerned about the risks posed by GE food."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The issue of genetically engineered food is not new to



McDonalds. A Consumer Reports magazine article last September found



that McDonalds' veggie burgers tested positive for genetically



engineered soy content. Recent newspaper articles have confirmed



that McDonalds has asked its major potato supplier in the U.S. to



grow non-genetically engineered potatoes for its famous French



fries, and McDonalds Europe has pledged to actively work with its



suppliers to find non-GE sources of ingredients.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While we applaud McDonalds' efforts to keep their fries



GE-free, there is still concern. They have not committed to keep



genetically engineered milk out of milkshakes, soy out of burgers,



or corn sweetener out of soft drinks." said Newport. "If McDonalds



can steer clear of GE foods in Europe, they can do it here at home.



American customers aren't getting the same treatment as European



customers when it comes to food safety."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Genetic engineering has received more shareholder attention



faster than any other topic in the history of corporate social



responsibility. This year 24 food and life sciences companies



received shareholder resolutions on the issue of genetically



engineered food. Other food companies and supermarkets including



Whole Foods, Gerber, Heinz, Seagram's and Frito-Lay have all taken



steps to remove GE ingredients from their product lines.</font>
