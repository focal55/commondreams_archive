- March 6 - More than 500 Alaska fishermen have endorsed removing four dams on the

          Knowles has called a “killing field” for endangered salmon.<span style="mso-spacerun:

          mortality, for declining runs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Proposals

          calling for retirement of the dams—removal of the dirt portion,
