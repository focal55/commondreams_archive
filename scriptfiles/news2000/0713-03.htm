- July 13 - A television ad paid for by the Conservative Party of New York, 

featuring Senate candidate Rick Lazio, has been targeted in a complaint 

filed today by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.  The 

Brennan Center, on behalf of New York's Green Party, has asked the Federal 

Election Commission to find that the Conservative Party violated federal 

election laws by spending "soft money" on an electioneering  advertisement 

in support of Congressman Rick Lazio's Senate bid.



<p>The Conservative Party claims that spending soft money on the 

Lazio advertisement is appropriate because it is an "issue ad," not an 

electioneering ad.  But it is impossible to find the issue advocated in the 

ad, other than Congressman Lazio's fondness for Long Island's beaches and 

his status as a lifetime New Yorker.  The Conservative Party Chairman 

defends the use of soft money by claiming that the ad is about "party 

building," and that the Party "could have used any New Yorker; we used Rick 

Lazio."



<p>"I doubt the Conservative Party will be spending $60,000 to 

broadcast that you or I love New York's beaches," says Brennan Center 

President E. Joshua Rosenkranz. "Other parties have crossed the line on the 

legal definition of 'issue advocacy' by featuring candidates in ads that 

sprinkle in a couple of issues.  But this is the first time we've ever seen 

a party ignore the line entirely by running a candidate-centered ad under 

the guise of issue advocacy without even the pretense of mentioning an issue."



<p>The ad, titled "Snapshots," opens and closes with pictures of 

Congressman Lazio and his family.  The accompanying text says:

         "They could be snapshots from any New Yorker's life.  Or they 

could be from Rick        Lazio's         own photo album.  Summers 

clamming in the tides of Long Island.  Growing up helping in his      dad's 

auto-parts store.  He and his wife sending their daughters to local public 

schools.       Now working for the values he's lived by: Protecting the 

environment, helping small business,   improving education.  Rick 

Lazio.  Made in New York.  A message from the Conservative   Party, 

fighting for New York's values."



<p>According to The New York Times, the ad was paid for by the 

Conservative Party with "soft money" (see "The Ad Campaign," New York 

Times, June 6, 2000).  Through a brazen misinterpretation of "issue 

advocacy," the Conservative Party claims a license to use "soft 

money--money collected in unlimited amounts from corporations, unions, and 

wealthy individuals--to influence the outcome of New York's Senate 

race.  By law, soft money is not to be used to support particular candidates.



<p>The Conservative Party claims the expenditure is issue advertising 

because it contains no "express advocacy" (i.e. a direct appeal to "vote 

for" or "elect" candidate Lazio).



<p>"It is time for the FEC to put an end to this kind of legal 

maneuvering and loophole exploitation.  The FEC needs to tell political 

parties that if they want to support a candidacy they have to follow the 

same rules that apply to the candidates: no corporate or union donations, 

limits on what rich individuals can contribute, and full disclosure," says 

Statewide Media Coordinator for the Green Party, Mark Dunlea.  "The Green 

Party follows the law because the American people deserve an open and fair 

electoral process, and we call upon other parties to do the same."



<p>The Center's recently published study, Buying Time: Television 

Advertising in the 1998 Congressional Elections, demonstrates that in 1998 

it was political parties rather than advocacy groups who were the main 

purveyors of sham "issue ads."
