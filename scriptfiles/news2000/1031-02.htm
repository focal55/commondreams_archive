- October 31 - Genetic engineering makes it possible for scientists to 

        cross apples with chickens, tomatoes with fish, and even humans with corn, 

        manipulating nature in ways previously inconceivable, according to a new 

        report released today by the Genetically Engineered Food Alert coalition. 

      </font>

<p></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Weird Science: The Brave New World of Genetic Engineering</i>, 

        a report by U.S. PIRG and the Pesticide Action Network, presents examples 

        of combinations that highlight the differences between genetic engineering 

        and traditional plant breeding. It also examines the unpredictability 

        of genetic engineering, and details examples of some unexpected results 

        that have already occurred in field tests. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Because of their built-in uncertainties, gene transfers 

        between unrelated species are inherently unpredictable and potentially 

        dangerous," said Dr. Barry Commoner, noted author and Director of the 

        Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College. "The biotechnology 

        industry is flying blind."</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Field tests have already occurred that include gene combinations 

        such as the following: </font></p>

<blockquote> 

        

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Apples and chickens To make apples resistant to fire blight, Cornell 

          University has developed a type of genetically engineered apple that 

          contains a gene from a chicken. They tested the crop in both 1994 and 

          1991 in the state of New York. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Tomato and flounder In perhaps one of the most famous cases of unusual 

          genetic combinations, DNA Plant Technology field tested a tomato with 

          a gene from the flounder in an attempt to develop a tomato that was 

          tolerant to cold temperatures. The field test took place in California 

          in 1991. </font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another combination worth noting is Bt corn, which makes up nearly one-third 

        of corn grown in the U.S. Bt corn is corn engineered to contain its own 

        bacterial pesticide. Bt corn has received much attention in recent months, 

        when a variety of the engineered corn, StarLink, was found in numerous 

        brands of taco shells. StarLink has not been approved for human consumption 

        because of concerns that the Cry9C protein produced by the corn might 

        be a human allergen. When testing commissioned by Genetically Engineered 

        Food Alert found the illegal corn in foods on supermarket shelves, Kraft 

        Foods, Mission Foods, Safeway, Shaw's, Food Lion, and Kash 'n Karry recalled 

        their taco shells and Aventis, the biotechnology company that engineered 

        the seed, withdrew registration for the seed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While proponents of genetic engineering claim that they can insert foreign 

        DNA into new species with great accuracy, and claim that the technology 

        is merely an extension of traditional plant breeding, the report details 

        several examples of why these claims are false. In May 2000, for example, 

        Monsanto disclosed for the first time that its genetically engineered 

        soybeans - their most widely used product which has been on the market 

        for four years- contained additional and unexpected gene fragments. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Dr. Frankenstein comes to mind this Halloween with experiments that 

        put mice genes in potatoes and cow genes in soybeans, and when corn genetically 

        engineered for animal feed is found in taco shells," said Richard Caplan, 

        Environmental Advocate with the U.S. Public Interest Research Group and 

        co-author of the report. "Unless the FDA adopts mandatory testing and 

        labeling of genetically engineered food, we are test subjects in a vast 

        food experiment."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite many instances of unexpected results of genetically engineered 

        crops, the Food and Drug Administration does not require testing or labeling 

        for genetically engineered foods. Consistently 80-90% of the public indicates 

        a desire for mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods. In March, 

        more than 50 consumer, food safety, and environmental groups filed a petition 

        with FDA for mandatory labeling, safety testing, and full environmental 

        review. The docket that FDA opened with that petition has received tens 

        of thousands of public comments in support of mandatory testing and labeling.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Concerned consumers should visit <a href="http://www.stopfrankenfood.org">www.StopFrankenfood.org</a> 

        to send a message to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to let them 

        know that we don't want to be guinea pigs," said Ellen Hickey, Research 

        Director with the Pesticide Action Network and co-author of the report. 

        "These products are being forced on us with inadequate testing and since 

        there's no labeling, we're given no choice."</font></p>
