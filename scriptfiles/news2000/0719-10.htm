Boyle, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law in

Champaign, served as legal advisor to the Palestinian delegation to the

Middle East peace negotiations from 1991 to 1993. He said today: "The

Palestinians have a very strong case they should take to the UN and the

World Court. Everything that they are asking for -- and then some -- is

contained in UN Resolution 181 and Resolution 194, both of which Israel

accepted as a condition for its joining the UN. If Israel continues to

refuse to let the refugees go home, or to share Jerusalem, Israel

jeopardizes its position in the international community and its UN

membership."

Director of the Middle East Children's Alliance, Lubin (who has just

returned from the Mideast) said today: "If over 100,000 people from Russia

could immigrate to Israel last year, then the time has come for the

Palestinian children from the refugee camps to be allowed back to their

rightful homes. Even if the Palestinians get 90 percent of the West Bank, we

should bear in mind that that's just 22 percent of historic Palestine."

</a>Vice president of the Arab American Action Network, Abunimah just returned

from the Mideast. He said today: "Prime Minister Ehud Barak's definition of

a 'successful' summit appears to be one where the Palestinian side gives up

on all the fundamental issues -- ending the illegal Israeli occupation of

east Jerusalem, allowing refugees to return to their homes and recover their

property, removing the Israeli settlements from the occupied territories,

and real political independence and freedom for the Palestinian people....

Palestinians living in the occupied territories have seen increased poverty

and joblessness, widespread abuses of human rights, and ever more Israeli

confiscation of Palestinian land for the exclusive use of Jewish settlers.

Palestinian refugees, especially those in Lebanon, are increasingly fearful

that the United States and Israel will try to impose a solution which

ignores the refugees' fundamental right to return to the homes and lands

from which they were expelled, or creates a 'state' over which Israel

retains control and authority."

</a>Policy director with the Center for Economic and Social Rights, Normand said

today: "Arafat clearly cannot go back to his own people without Palestinian

sovereignty in Jerusalem. Arafat is reluctant to go down in history as the

first Arab leader to legitimize Israeli occupation...especially so soon

after Hezbollah's victory in south Lebanon.... The United States is

brokering a deal to abandon the rights of Palestinian refugees soon after

going to war supposedly to protect the rights of Kosovo's refugees. The

right of over 4 million Palestinian refugees to return to their homes is

affirmed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet their inalienable

rights are on sale at Camp David, for a bribe of $20 billion."
