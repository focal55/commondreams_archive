          - February 16 - President Clinton yesterday earned the gratitude of 

          every American with his decision to protect California's giant sequoia 

          forests, a move that fulfills the goals of our nation's first conservationists, 

          including Sierra Club founder John Muir. Protecting the giant sequoia 

          forest habitats would realize a century-old dream to protect the trees 

          Muir called "nature's masterpiece." </font> 

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A hundred years 

            ago, John Muir walked these woods, marveled at these ancient wonders, 

            and dreamed of protecting all of them forever. We are thrilled to 

            see President Clinton fulfill the dream of saving America's majestic 

            sequoias," said Dr. Edgar Wayburn, Sierra Club's Honorary President. 

            "Sequoia trees are incredibly vulnerable to disruption, so protecting 

            the forest around the sequoias will ensure these towering trees can 

            survive in their healthy, natural habitat." </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Current U.S. 

            Forest Service policy protects the sequoia trees themselves, but permits 

            other tree species surrounding the giant sequoia to be logged. And 

            contrary to what most people believe, over half the remaining giant 

            sequoias have no permanent protection. There is no guarantee that 

            future administrations would not return to past policies of cutting 

            right in the giant sequoia groves. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> According to 

            Dr. Wayburn, "Logging around the sequoia groves has the potential 

            to kill the sequoia just as an ax or a chainsaw does. As John Muir 

            said, `When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched 

            to everything else in the universe.' By conserving the entire 400,000 

            acres of sequoia habitat as a National Monument, President Clinton 

            could finally and truly protect the sequoia." </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Protecting the 

            sequoia forest ecosystem has been one of the Sierra Club's top goals 

            for a century. As Muir wrote in My First Summer in the Sierra in 1911, 

            "Walk the Sequoia woods at any time of the year and you will say they 

            are the most beautiful and majestic on earth. Beautiful and impressive 

            contrasts meet you everywhere -- the colors of tree and flower, rock 

            and sky, light and shade, strength and frailty, endurance and evanescence." 

            </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Notes from a 

            1923 Sierra Club board of directors meeting echo the President's initiative. 

            At that time, the Sierra Club was urging the U.S. Forest Service and 

            U.S. Park Service to enlarge Sequoia National Park to protect the 

            habitat surrounding the groves of sequoia trees. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In his letter 

            yesterday to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman beginning the process 

            to create a Sequoia National Monument, President Clinton wrote that 

            he did so at Dr. Wayburn's urging. Clinton wrote: "I want to ensure 

            that these majestic cathedral groves, which John Muir called `nature's 

            masterpiece,' are protected for future generations to study and enjoy. 

            ... Dr. Edgar Wayburn, Honorary President of the Sierra Club, mentioned 

            this to me when I awarded him a Presidential Medal of Freedom last 

            summer, and he also has written me about the subject." </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At the Presidential 

            Medal of Freedom ceremony, Dr. Wayburn urged Clinton to use his presidential 

            authority to create National Monuments to protect some of America's 

            most threatened treasures. Dr. Wayburn has urged the President to 

            protect the Sequoia National Forest, Steens Mountain in Oregon and 

            the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.</font>
