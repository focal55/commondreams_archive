- July 6 - The prescription drug industry, using its

connections and campaign cash, is well on its way toward blocking comprehensive Medicare

drug coverage for America&#146;s seniors and people with disabilities, Public Citizen shows in an in-depth <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/reform/addicting2.htm">investigative report</a> released today. </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report is being released in more than 50 cities in 25 states today as seniors,

health, labor and consumer groups conduct a national day of action to &quot;Fight for

Independence from Drug Industry Price Gouging&quot; and protest U.S. House passage of the

Republican drug bill. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By deploying an army of lobbyists and making huge campaign contributions,

the drug industry has succeeded in blocking a comprehensive Medicare drug benefit that

reins in sky-high drug costs,&quot; said Frank Clemente, director of Public Citizen&#146;s

Congress Watch. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, <i><b>Addicting Congress: Drug Companies&#146; Campaign Cash &amp; Lobbying

Expenses,</b></i> is especially timely as the U.S. House of Representatives last week

approved a pro-drug industry bill (H.R. 4680, the Medicare Rx 2000 Act) by the narrowest

of margins -- 217 to 214, largely along party lines. Crafted by House Republican leaders

in a matter of weeks, this proposed expansion of Medicare benefits has serious

shortcomings: It depends on the private insurance industry and HMOs, rather than the

Medicare program, to provide coverage, and it will do little to contain escalating costs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the report&#146;s chief findings are the following:</font></p>

<blockquote>

  

<blockquote>

    

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The drug industry is spending vast sums on lobbying to hire well-connected former

    members of Congress and key staff to promote its financial interests before Congress.

    Overall, <u>the drug industry spent $235.7 million from 1997 to 1999 to lobby officials in

    Congress and the executive branch</u>. This amount does not include tens of millions more

    spent on television, radio and newspaper ads, direct mailings and telemarketing efforts.</font></p>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  

<blockquote>

    

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1999 drug company spending on lobbying put the industry at the top of the Washington

    heap: Spending rose from $77.8 million in 1998 to $83.6 million in 1999 as public pressure

    to pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit mounted. On the Medicare drug benefit and

    pricing issue alone, companies have hired 297 lobbyists -- the equivalent of <i>one

    lobbyist for every two members of Congress</i>, an astonishing rate of coverage.</font></p>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  

<blockquote>

    

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Since 1993, the drug industry has given $33.4 million in campaign contributions</u>

    to candidates and parties. Moreover, its giving has grown exponentially. Contributions are

    projected to reach $13.8 million for the 2000 cycle -- a 43 percent increase over 1998 and

    a whopping 147 percent increase over 1994.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The industry&#146;s campaign spending has become more and more partisan in favor of

    Republicans. Overall, 69 percent of the contributions ($23 million) have gone to

    Republicans and 31 percent to Democrats ($10.4 million). The Republican share has risen

    from 60 percent in the 1994 cycle to 73 percent thus far in the 2000 cycle. </font></p>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  

<blockquote>

    

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Soft money&quot; -- unlimited contributions from the companies and their

    executives to the political parties -- has become the favorite form of campaign

    contribution for the drug industry. It accounts for 55 percent of all donations thus far

    in the 2000 cycle. Soft money enables industry honchos to maximize their influence over

    congressional leaders who help raise party money and determine the legislative agenda. <u>Eighty

    percent of all drug industry soft money is now being directed to Republican Party

    committees</u>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>The drug industry&#146;s soft money contributions nearly tripled from the 1994 cycle

    ($1.7 million) to the 1998 one ($4.6 million).</u> If drug industry soft money spending

    for the 2000 elections continues to rise at the rate it did in the last election, the

    final 2000 figure is projected at $7.5 million -- a 344 percent jump from 1994 and a 65

    percent jump from 1998!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To work its will in Congress where Medicare prescription drug legislation is written,

    the drug industry has redirected the bulk of its soft money away from the two national

    party committees to the congressional campaign committees. Republican <i>congressional</i>

    committee collections rose from 39 percent of the total given to all Republican Party

    committees in the 1994 cycle to 61 percent in this cycle. Soft money to Democratic <i>congressional</i>

    committees went from 13 percent of the total given to all Democratic Party committees in

    1994 to 85 percent in 2000. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drug industry &quot;hard money&quot; contributions to candidates from company employees

    and political action committees help explain the recent House vote. The average drug

    industry contribution to proponents of the pro-industry House Republican bill was $18,984,

    which is 78 percent more than the $10,667 average contribution to opponents. </font></p>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, the report reveals the cozy working relationship between Republican leaders

and the drug industry and between the drug industry and &quot;renegade&quot; Democrats,

including strategy sessions, close collaboration to craft legislation favorable to the

industry and attack consumer-oriented bills, and a revolving door between Congress and the

industry that will make your head spin.</font>
