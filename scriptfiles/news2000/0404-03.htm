<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- April 4 - Common Cause and Democracy 21 today filed a complaint with the Federal 

        Election Commission (FEC) alleging that the U.S. Senate campaigns of Hillary 

        Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani are engaged in ongoing illegal schemes to 

        raise federally illegal soft money and inject it through their political 

        parties into their Senate races.&nbsp;</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Clinton and Giuliani campaigns have set up so-called "Victory Committees," 

        which are "joint fundraising" committees sponsored by their Senate campaign 

        committees and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) and 

        the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) respectively.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The complaint points out that the names of the joint fundraising committees, 

        the New York Senate 2000 Committee and the Giuliani Victory Fund, make 

        clear to donors that their contributions will aid specific Senate candidates, 

        namely Clinton and Giuliani.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The complaint charges that through these "joint committees" Clinton 

        and Giuliani are directly raising contributions to be spent to support 

        their Senate races in amounts far in excess of the federal legal limits 

        and from sources, such as corporations, that are prohibited by law from 

        giving in connection with federal campaigns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The funds will then be channeled to state parties to be spent on TV 

        ads and other communications promoting the Clinton and Giuliani candidacies 

        and/or attacking their opponents, according to the complaint. Such expenditures 

        have already occurred in the Clinton campaign.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Unless these illegal schemes are stopped, the complaint states, they 

        threaten to inject millions of dollars of federally illegal campaign contributions 

        into the New York Senate race.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The problem, furthermore, is not just limited to the New York Senate 

        race and will be widespread in Senate races in 2000 unless action is taken 

        to prevent the practice, according to the complaint.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Under this 'joint fundraising' scheme, according to the complaint, 

        "federal candidates are and will be systematically raising soft money 

        directly for their own campaigns, and using their national and state party 

        committees as pass-through conduits to launder the money into their federal 

        campaigns.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This scheme institutionalizes the practice of federal candidates making 

        direct solicitations for soft money to be used in their campaigns, and 

        systematizes a direct giving relationship between soft money donors and 

        federal candidates, in a manner that plainly violates the spirit and letter 

        of the federal election laws," the complaint states.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"What we're doing today has nothing to do with reforming campaign finance 

        laws," Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger said. "What we're doing 

        is calling on the Federal Election Commission to enforce what is already 

        the longstanding law of the land by keeping illegal money from federal 

        elections."&nbsp;</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In fact," Harshbarger said, "one would have to be completely devoid 

        of common sense to look at the Clinton and Giuliani campaigns and not 

        realize that these laws are being violated."</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Everyone knows precisely what is going on here," Democracy 21 President 

        Fred Wertheimer stated. "The Clinton and Giuliani campaigns are thumbing 

        their noses at the federal campaign finance laws and are treating the 

        voters of New York as if they were fools."</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With these 'joint fundraising' committees and this concerted scheme, 

        the old fig leaf that soft money is being raised and spent by political 

        parties for 'party building' purposes and issue discussion' has been dropped, 

        even as a pretense," according to Wertheimer.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The complaint asks the FEC to investigate the allegations, declare that 

        the parties named in the complaint have violated federal campaign finance 

        laws, enjoin them from further violating the laws, and impose appropriate 

        sanctions.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The full text of the complaint is enclosed, as are statements from Wertheimer 

        and Harshbarger, and a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno asking for 

        a Justice department inquiry into the matter.</font>
