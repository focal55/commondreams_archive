- May 9 - Social Security privatization



recently joined "rebuilding America's defense" on presidential



candidate George W. Bush's campaign plate. However, a close



examination shows that Bush's plan will likely create a "death



spiral" for Social Security and national defense that would harm



seniors and soldiers alike.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While Wall Street brokers have done wonders for the private



economy, their track record is quite different when it comes to comes



to government security programs," says Scott Nathanson, Executive



Director of Citizens for a Responsible Budget (CRB), a D.C.-based



budget watchdog group. "Bush's plan is to take an idea that failed



our national security and foist it on Social Security."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRB's first issue of its New View briefing paper series, entitled



'Wall Street, Weapons Contractors, &amp; Privatization' shows how



investment brokers' involvement with defense policy was supposed to



benefit soldiers and taxpayers alike, but failed miserably. "Defense



contractors and Clinton administration officials were pushed by



investment brokers to consider massive mergers," the paper says.



"Defense specialists promised that these mega-mergers would produce



streamlined production and research facilities that could produce



next-generation weapons at a far lower cost to the taxpayer."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once the mergers cleared anti-trust hurdles, "Wall Street bought



every kind of defense stock..." But while Wall Street rode the tide



of swelling defense stocks, the General Accounting Office concluded



last year that these mergers created no cost savings for the American



taxpayer. Further, Pentagon officials complained that the lack of



competition caused by these mergers actually harms weapons



development. As one retired official said, "I always got more new



ideas when I have several companies trying to think up products to



win a contract."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Nathanson, "Gov. Bush is singing that same siren song



to the taxpayer all over again. Brokers are once more in position to



make a killing off of the taxpayer, this time by making commissions



on privatized Social Security accounts irregardless of market



fluctuations. Meanwhile, those who need the "security" of Social



Security the most will get a cut in base benefits, and an increase

in



retirement age. It seems like quite a risk given what happened last



time around."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nathanson concluded that Bush's privatization efforts plus his



plans to dramatically boost weapons spending creates a two-headed



monster that would eat at both sides of Social Security. "A massive



increase in new weapons procurement will without doubt leach from the



budget surplus that should provide for the solvency of Social



Security. We will have more national and social security for less



money if we provide for the readiness of our soldiers rather than the



desires of defense contractors, and keep Wall Street from meddling

in



yet another of our nation's most important programs."
