- November 1 - The Association of Community Organizations for 

      Reform Now (ACORN) released a study analyzing 1999 home mortgage lending 

      data which found that minority and lower income borrowers are much more 

      likely to receive a higher-cost subprime mortgage when refinancing or buying 

      a house. Subprime borrowers pay higher rates and fees, and they are much 

      more likely to be the victims of predatory lending practices which strip 

      them of the equity in their homes and can even lead to foreclosure.<o:p></o:p></font>

      in America,” found that nationally in 1999, 45.1% of all conventional refinance 

      loans, excluding loans for manufactured housing, received by African-Americans 

      were from subprime lenders, as were 19.5% of the refinance loans received 

      by Latinos, compared to just 12.1% of the refinance loans received by whites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
