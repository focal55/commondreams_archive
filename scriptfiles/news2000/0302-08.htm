- March 2 - The Sierra Club is looking for answers to a question that is

     confusing people from coast to coast: "Who are `Republicans for Clean

     Air' and why are they running ads that contradict George W. Bush's

     poor environmental record?"  Republicans for Clean Air are

     broadcasting ads that attack Senator John McCain's environmental

     record, and make misleading claims about Bush's environmental record.

     A LEXIS-NEXIS search on "Republicans for Clean Air" revealed that they

     have never appeared in an article.  In addition, the group has no

     website, did not include any documentation with the ads.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's time for the Oz behind these ads to step out from behind the

     curtains and reveal himself," said Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive

     Director.  "Environmental issues should be openly debated and not

     subjected to misleading ads from phantom groups lurking in the

     shadows."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The ad praises Governor George W. Bush's record on clean air, despite

     the fact that Texas has the worst air quality in the nation, and that

     Houston became the nation's Smog Capital in 1999.  The ad also makes

     assertions about Texas air pollution that are not supported by the

     facts.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The ad claims that "Bush clean air laws will reduce air pollution more

     than a quarter million tons a year."  This claim is misleading because

     Texas law only requires 117,000 tons of pollution reductions per year.

     The rest of the 250,000 tons of reductions are purely voluntary, and

     therefore it is unclear whether they will actually occur.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This ad takes very optimistic speculation and makes it sound like

     facts," said Ken Kramer, director of the Sierra Club Lone Star (Texas)

     Chapter.  "As someone who breathes the air in Texas every day, I would

     be interested in learning how Republicans for Clean Air came to their

     conclusions."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The ad also implies that Governor Bush supports efforts to clean up

     New York's air.  One of New York's biggest environmental efforts was

     the state's recent lawsuit against Midwestern coal-burning plants,

     which was eventually joined by the EPA.  However, lawsuits which

     protect New Yorkers from pollution are likely to be opposed by Gov.

     Bush.  He told the New York Times, "the best way to achieve clean air

     and water was `to not try to sue our way or regulate our way to clean

     air and clean water'" (11-9-99).</font>
