- September 28 - Dads and Daughters,



the national nonprofit membership organization of fathers with



daughters, today called on Congress to reauthorize the Violence



Against Women Act (VAWA) H.R. 1248.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A letter from Joe Kelly, executive director of Dads and



Daughters, was delivered today to all 535 representatives and



senators, along with a compelling brochure on ways men can



combat violence against women. Dads and Daughters' member Hank



Shaw of Rochester, N.Y., along with graphic designer Daniel Hon



created the brochure.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his letter to Congress Joe Kelly wrote:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As the fathers of daughters, we care passionately about



ending violence against females. We want to do everything we can



to protect our daughters from violence.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We also support VAWA because of its importance to our sons.



If violence against women continues to be acceptable, then our



sons will continue to be prejudged as a threat to women, no



matter what our individual histories, just because they are



male. We have a stake in ending violence for many reasons."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enacted in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act provides



federal funding for state and local programs to combat violence



against women, including special police units focused on sex



crimes. The reauthorization bill would continue these efforts



and expand the law to include funding for transitional housing



for women and children who are victims of violence, as well as



resources for specific populations, such as the elderly and



Native Americans.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dads and Daughters provides tools to strengthen relationships



between fathers and daughters and to transform the pervasive



messages that value girls and young women more for how they look



than who they are. DADs acts against marketers who undermine



girls to sell their products, and applauds those who don't.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent weeks, DADs made national news when it successfully



pressured Campbell's Soup to drop a commercial telling young



girls they should be worrying about their weight and dieting.



DADs convinced Chattem, Inc. to cease a girl-hating Sun-In print



ad, praised Chevy Truck's positive portrayal of a



father-daughter relationship in a TV spot, and sparked a



national protest of the Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive CD-ROM game



Panty Raider.
