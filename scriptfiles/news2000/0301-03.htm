- March 1 - The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC)

is accepting financial contributions to assist in recovery efforts

in Mozambique after a tropical cyclone and two weeks of torrential

rains have left much of the country under water. Thousands of

people are homeless and endangered in Mozambique's worst flooding

in 50 years.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The Mozambican Government estimates over one million people have

now been affected by the floods and are in urgent need of food,

aid and shelter. The World Health Organization warned that hundreds

of thousands of people are now at risk from epidemics-particularly

cholera and malaria.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The devastation from the severe flooding in Mozambique,

one of the poorest nations in the world, will be felt for years

to come,&quot; said Mary Massaro, director of AFSC's Africa Region.

&quot;Mozambique's crushing international debt payments -- more

than $1.4 million per week -- will undermine recovery efforts

unless there is a coordinated international effort to provide

emergency assistance coupled with meaningful debt relief.&quot;



</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Contributions marked &quot;Mozambique Cyclone Assistance&quot;

can be sent to AFSC, 1501 Cherry Street, Philadelphia, PA 19102</b>

or by calling 1-888-588-2372 ext. #1. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

AFSC will be working in partnership with local non-governmental

organizations and with AFSC staff based in Mozambique to direct

assistance where it is most needed.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The AFSC has been active in Mozambique since its independence

from Portugal in 1975. During the ensuing sixteen years of war,

AFSC assistance included distributions of clothing, seeds, hand

tools and medical supplies; construction of health and child care

centers and support for a mobile clinic for mothers and children

at high risk. With the advent of peace in 1992, AFSC began full-scale

development activities in partnership with the Organization of

Mozambican Women (OMM). Today, AFSC staff of twelve Mozambicans

work with rural women's groups in Manica Province. More information

on AFSC's work in Mozambique is available the AFSC website at
