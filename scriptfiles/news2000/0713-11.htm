- July 13 - On behalf of seven environmental organizations including 

the Sierra Club, Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund filed suit in Federal 

Court today to stop logging in National Forests from wiping out rare birds 

and fish in the Southern U.S. Despite a previous court ruling that the U.S. 

Forest Service must examine the ways logging will harm endangered species, 

the Forest Service has continued to allow logging that destroys sensitive 

animal habitat. This suit aims to halt that destruction.



<p>"We again have to seek relief from a federal court to halt destructive 

logging because the US Forest Service refuses to comply with their duty to 

protect rare and sensitive species in our southern National Forests," said 

René Voss of the Sierra Club Board of Directors. "Many declining bird 

species such as wood warblers and various darters and other fish species 

continue to decline from the logging of our national forests in the South."



<p>In February of 1999, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta agreed 

with Sierra Club that the law requires the US Forest Service to survey and 

monitor rare wildlife species in order to gauge whether they remain viable 

or can persist and not become endangered. The court concluded that the US 

Forest Service did not maintain adequate data to make these scientific 

judgments and ordered the Forest Service to stop logging in Georgia's 

Chattahoochee and Oconee National Forests. That ruling also affected 

logging activities in Alabama and Florida.



<p>"Many of our rare species are in decline from clearcutting on our National 

Forests," said attorney Eric Huber with Earthjustice Legal Defense 

Fund.  "Logging and associated road-building destroys nesting birds, 

wildlife habitat, causes severe soil erosion which in turn destroys fish 

habitat. Despite the clear mandate of the Court, the Forest Service 

continues to approve destructive logging and road-building in the national 

forests without first obtaining the scientific information necessary to 

protect the wildlife in these areas. To make matters worse, instead of 

complying with the Court ruling, the Forest Service is attempting to 

rewrite their plans and rules to get out from under the requirements to do 

these surveys," said Huber. "This suit will enforce the court of appeals 

decision and apply it throughout the Southern Region."



<p>The suit seeks to suspend logging where the Forest Service does not have 

the required data until it complies with the National Forest Management 

Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Administrative 

Procedures Act.



<p>The Southern Region of the US Forest Service includes 31 National Forests 

in Georgia (Chattahoochee and Oconee), Alabama (Talladega, Bankhead, and 

Conecuh), Louisiana (Kisatchie), Tennessee (Cherokee), Arkansas (Ouachita, 

Ozark, and St. Francis), Mississippi (DeSoto, Homochitto, Bienville, 

Tombigbee, and Holly Springs), Texas (Sam Houston, Davy Crockett, Sabine, 

and Angelina), Florida (Ocala, Osceola, and Apalachicola), North Carolina 

(Nantahala, Pisgah, Uwharrie, and Croatan), South Carolina (Sumter and 

Francis Marion), Virginia (Jefferson and George Washington), and Kentucky 

(Daniel Boone).



<p>Joining Sierra Club as plaintiffs are the John Muir Project of Earth Island 

Institute, Wild South, Wild Alabama, Southern Appalachian Biodiversity 

Project, Friends of Georgia, Rabun County Coalition to Save the Forests, 

and Cherokee Forest Voices.



<p>Joining Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, representing these Clients are 

WildLaw (for Wild South and Wild Alabama), Stack and Associates and 

Southern Environmental Law Center (for Cherokee Forest Voices).
