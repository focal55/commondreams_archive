- October 17 - Today, Peace Action, the



nation's largest peace organization, issued a statement calling for



an immediate ceasefire in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict under



United Nations meditation. The statement noted the Israeli



government's disproportionate use of force against Palestinian



civilians, and called for an end to the massive U.S. arms sales



to Israel and other Middle Eastern countries. The statement



follows:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Peace Action deplores the breakdown of the peace process due to



current provocations and the use of violence and urges the



government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to take all



peaceful steps to end the escalating violence. Ultimatums and



threats of even greater violence are not solutions to this



crisis and should be ended.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We note that the vast majority of victims of this violence are



Palestinians and that the Israeli Defense Forces and police are



clearly using disproportionate force, including heavy weapons and



helicopter gunships against civilians.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We ask Prime Minister Barak to pull back all armed forces and



police and for Chairman Arafat to make every effort to restrain



armed civilians. We call for and support U.N. and multilateral



efforts to broker peace rather than unilateral actions by the



U.S. Further, we call for the U.N. to establish an international



commission to investigate the causes for violence.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We call upon the U.S. government to halt the sale and delivery of



weapons to Israel and other countries in the Middle East, including



Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as the weapons are contributing to the



violence and abuse of human rights. With sadness we note that the



U.S. is the major arms merchant to Israel and other countries in the



Middle East.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We extend our heartfelt sympathy to all those families,



Palestinian and Israeli alike, who are mourning personal losses. We



call upon the members of Peace Action to:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1.) Support humanitarian relief efforts.

<br>

2.) Stand alert to oppose further escalations of violence,



especially in light of the death of U.S. sailors of the coast off



Yemen.

<br>

3.) Seek common ground in our work as peace activists and oppose



stereotyping of Arabs and Jews.

<br>

4.) Use the press, public vigils, and other public activities



and forums to call for peacemaking rather than violence.

<br>

5.) Urge the implementation of all United Nations Security



Council Resolutions regarding Israel and Palestine.

<br>

6.) Express our solidarity with the strong efforts of the



peacemakers in both Israel and Palestine and honor their courage in



demonstrating against the violence.

<br>

7.) Redouble our efforts to have Congress pass a comprehensive



Arms Transfer Code of Conduct legislation."</font>
