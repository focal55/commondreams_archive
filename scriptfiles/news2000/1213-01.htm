- December 13 - Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. today said, &quot;As a U.S. congressman

I swore to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the United

States.  Today I reaffirm that oath.  I also reaffirm that we are

a nation of laws and not of men, thus, I accept and will abide by

the ruling of the Supreme Court.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;However, even as I accept and will abide by the decision, I also 

-- with every bone in my body and every ounce of moral strength in 

my soul -- strongly and vigorously disagree with it.  In third 

world countries when democratically cast votes are not counted, or

the person who most likely lost wins in a highly questionable

manner, we usually refer to that as a coup d'etat -- the overthrow

of a government, usually by a small group of persons.  All legal

votes in Florida were not counted.  If they had been counted, there

is at least a strong possibility that Vice President Gore would have

received the most votes in Florida as he did in the country -- which

is why the Bush people did not want the votes counted.  Even more

important than partisan politics, the votes should have been counted

in the name of democracy in order to give the maximum amount of

credibility and legitimacy to the eventual winner.  What we have

just witnessed is a Supreme Court that was used as a willing tool

of the Bush campaign.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;After the Soviet Union collapsed, many of its satellites fell.  

In the case of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel became the new 

President on the basis of a legitimate people uprising and a 

democratic &quot;Velvet Revolution.&quot;  In 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court 

orchestrated a questionable 'velvet legal coup.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The basis of politics and legal authority in the United States is

the Constitution.  The first words in the Preamble are 'We the

people.'  We the PEOPLE are the ultimate source of power and legal

authority for our government.  The people express their will

through the vote.  And the will and intention of the voter, as best

it can be discerned by machines, bipartisan hand counters and

accompanying public witnesses must be the legal standard.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While I urge calm and a political response in 2002 and 2004, I 

see this decision as a potential threat to our democracy and 

potentially de-stabilizing to our democratic institutions.  I see

it as undermining the legitimacy of a President Bush should he be

elected without all of the votes being counted.  All Americans can

live with votes counted for Gov. George W. Bush.  But democracy 

cannot live if the votes of the American people are not counted.  

An uncounted vote says to the American people that THEY don't count.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I do not believe that over 100 million Americans went to the polls

and cast their ballots with the expectation that they would not be

counted.  I also do not believe they voted with the expectation that

their next president would be selected by five conservative, strict

constructionist, narrowly ideological, Republican-appointed justices

who used the means of legal nitpicking and highly questionable legal

technicalities as a substitute for the peoples' democratic will as

expressed through their vote.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Justice Scalia, in the previous decision, went so far as to say

that there is no legal right of suffrage in the Constitution.  Thus,

the American people, through their federal and state elected

officials, may need to amend the constitution making the right to

vote -- which all Americans thought was implicit in our Constitution

and laws -- explicit in the Constitution.  This decision, with the

kind of thinking reflected by Justice Scalia, is a threat to our

democracy.  It is hard to imagine that Bush v. Gore will be viewed

as a high water mark in the history of the Supreme Court when viewed

through the eyes of history.  It will more likely be compared to

other infamous decisions such as Dred Scott and Plessy v. Ferguson.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The road is now even tougher for Vice President Gore, but it is

still up to him as to whether he pursues any further legal or

political remedies.  I still strongly support all legal and

political efforts to make sure that all voters who cast votes on

November 7 have their votes counted.  Legal options seem to have

exhausted any hope of getting all the votes counted.  However,

there may be political means in Congress still open to the Vice

President that he may wish to pursue.  I will respect whatever

course he chooses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Vice President won the most national votes.  And I believe that

if all votes cast in Florida had been counted he would have won the

most votes there as well -- and, thus, the 25 electoral votes and

the presidency.  Legal matters have been pursued through the courts,

ultimately with no relief.  If everything remains the same, it

appears that the Electoral College vote will go to Governor Bush.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;However, beyond and even more important than Bush or Gore, is the

issue of the integrity of the voting system itself.  There appears

to be 'voting rights' violations that should be pursued regardless

of who wins the election.  Congress needs to pass legislation to

federalize and nationalize future elections to the extent that

there is one, fair, inclusive national standard and mechanism for

conducting our federal elections.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It appears, through a combination of inferior voting machines,

police roadblocks, questionable voting procedures, roll purges and

other such mechanisms, that a significant number of African

Americans were denied either their right to vote or to have their

vote count.  These matters should be fully investigated beyond the

election results and corrective procedures should be put in place

for the future.  African Americans should remain more determined

than ever to vote and to have their vote count.  If there is a fire

and water is poured on it, but it doesn't put out the fire, don't

conclude that water doesn't put out fires.  Conclude that it will

take more water.  By the same token African Americans should NOT

conclude that voting doesn't count, but that we need even more

votes to achieve the desired effect.  We must spend the time

between now and 2002 registering and politically educating the

nearly 8 million yet unregistered black voters.  In fact, we must

register all Americans to vote regardless of race, creed or color,&quot;

Jackson concluded.</font></p>
