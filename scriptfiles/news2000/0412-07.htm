<font size="4">Campaign Finance Reform Foes Use Union Dues 

as Red Herring</font><br>

Soft Money Ban Would Not Empower Unions and Democrats, or Weaken Business and Republicans, Public Citizen President Says

- April 12 - A popular notion advanced by foes of campaign finance reform -- that a soft money

ban would elevate the power of unions and weaken pro-business forces -- is baseless,

Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook tells lawmakers in testimony to be delivered Wednesday.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In her testimony to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, Claybrook lays

out four key arguments in response to opponents of the kind of campaign finance reforms

contained in the McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan legislation. Those opponents have said

that soft money -- unlimited contributions from corporations, unions, special interest

groups and individuals -- should not be banned without curbing the use of union dues for

partisan union political campaigns. Otherwise, these opponents say, pro-business forces

will be weakened, and union-supported Democratic candidates will swamp Republicans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The argument is a complete fallacy that simply doesn&#146;t stand up to the

facts,&quot; Claybrook said. &quot;Hyping the power of the political opposition may be a

good fund-raising tactic. But it doesn&#146;t make for good public policy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Claybrook is testifying in response to various so-called &quot;paycheck

protection&quot; proposals from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and Sen. Mitch

McConnell (R-Ky.) that aim to stop unions from spending any of their members&#146; dues on

political campaigns and activities without individual authorization. Opponents of most

major campaign finance reform measures insist on attaching such &quot;paycheck

protection&quot; proposals to campaign finance bills as a poison pill to kill the

legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen is in a unique position to critique these proposals because for 25 years

its Litigation Group has represented dissidents in labor unions to protect internal

democracy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In her testimony, Claybrook notes that:</font></p>

<blockquote>

  

<blockquote>

    

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Even without soft money, pro-business forces maintain an overwhelming advantage over

    pro-union ones in contributions to candidates and parties and in lobbying expenditures.

    Contributions data back this up: During the 1998 election cycle, individuals and PACs

    associated with business outspent those affiliated with labor unions by 10 to 1. This

    figure does not include soft money.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Even without soft money, Republicans have a large advantage over Democrats when it

    comes to campaign contributions. Again, data show that not including soft money,

    Republicans in 1998 outraised Democrats by $734 million to $533 million during the 1998

    election cycle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Pro-business and pro-Republican groups, as well as labor unions, under the law can

    use their treasuries only in limited ways to ask their members to support partisan

    organizational campaigns. In fact, overwhelmingly pro-Republican groups such as the

    National Rifle Association and National Federation of Independent Businesses are

    increasingly conducting substantial member political mobilization activities. Other

    groups, from all sides of the political spectrum, are using Section 527 organizations to

    appeal to the general public in elections.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* It is misleading to brand labor unions&#146; use of member dues for political

    purposes as &quot;compelled speech.&quot; The law is clear that no worker in the U.S. can

    be required to pay for any union expenses other than those associated with collective

    bargaining, grievance adjustment and contract administration. Workers are free to join or

    not join unions. Those who chose to become union members are in the exact same position as

    members of the NRA or U.S. Chamber of Commerce who may disagree with their

    organization&#146;s political choices. But no one has called for legislation to protect

    members of these groups from &quot;compelled speech.&quot;</font></p>
