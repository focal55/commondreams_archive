-  February 21 - Texas angling organizations and environmental groups

     joined forces today to announce their strong opposition to a proposed

     weakening of water quality protections for Lake Sam Rayburn.  The

     downgrade would allow a polluting paper will to increase toxic dumping

     into the world-class bass fishing lake in East Texas.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     At a press conference at the State Capitol, the groups urged the three

     members of the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC)

     to reject their staff's proposal to downgrade water quality standards

     for a portion of the lake. The representatives of fishing and

     conservation groups also called upon Governor George W. Bush, an avid

     angler himself, to exert leadership and ask the three TNRCC

     commissioners to maintain strong water quality protections for the

     lake.  The current commissioners are all appointees of the Governor.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are opposed to lowering water quality standards to allow a

     polluting industry to renew a wastewater discharge permit," said

     Dwayne "Sparky" Anderson of Texas Clean Water Action, "especially when

     the proposed downgrade is based on studies done by the polluter."

     Anderson was referring to a proposal by TNRCC staff to divide Sam

     Rayburn reservoir into two segments and establish a lower water

     quality standard for the upper segment of the lake.  Water quality in

     the upper reaches of the lake is dramatically affected by massive

     pollution discharges by the Donohue Industries Paper Mill into a

     tributary of the Angelina River, the stream impounded to form the

     lake.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The paper mill has been operating under a permit that allows

     "variances" from having to meet strict water quality standards.  As a

     result, Donohue Paper Mill has been discharging almost five times the

     amount of oxygen-depleting pollutants and over three times the volume

     of aluminum that would be allowed under high water quality standards

     currently applicable to Lake Sam Rayburn--pollution levels that would

     likely have to be reduced when the mill's permit comes up for renewal.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     By dividing Sam Rayburn into two stream segments and lowering water

     quality standards in the new segment, the mill can avoid reducing its

     pollution when its variances end.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Walt West, a resident of the Sam Rayburn area and a retired engineer

     who fishes on the lake, fears that continued heavy pollution from the

     mill would increase the likelihood of fish kills in the lake.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Pollution, heat, and stress lowers the immune system of fish, making

     them more susceptible to the type of viruses we have seen in the area

     in recent years in large mouth black bass," said West.  "TNRCC needs

     to clamp down on pollution from the paper mill, not extend the mill's

     license to pollute."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     David Stewart with the angling organization S.M.A.R.T (Sensible

     Management of Aquatic Resources Team), urged Texas Parks and Wildlife

     Department to intervene with TNRCC in opposition to the downgrade.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Parks and Wildlife is responsible for protecting fish and wildlife

     resources, and those resources could be damaged seriously by the

     proposed downgrade of Sam Rayburn," said Stewart. "We need Parks and

     Wildlife to take a strong public stand against this downgrade.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Lake Sam Rayburn, however, is just one of the many water bodies in

     Texas that is threatened by minimized protection.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The proposed downgrade of water quality protections for Lake Sam

     Rayburn is only one of over fifty downgrades proposed by TNRCC for

     Texas water bodies as part of a triennial review and revision of the

     state's water quality standards," said Ken Kramer of the Lone Star

     Chapter of the Sierra Club. "We will release information about other

     downgrades prior to the TNRCC's March 21 public hearing on their

     proposals."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Joining in the call for rejection of the water quality downgrade for a

     portion of Lake Sam Rayburn were Ed Parten of Texas Black Bass

     Unlimited, Randi Myers Wayland of Texas Association of Bass Clubs, and

     other anglers and representatives of the angling industry.  They

     stressed the economic importance of the bass fishing industry to East

     Texas.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Representatives of several other groups joined the anglers and Clean

     Water Action in denouncing the proposed downgrade

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"TNRCC made a serious error in giving the paper mill a permit with

     such ludicrous variances," said Myron Hess of the National Wildlife

     Federation.  "The mill has been discharging over 1 million pounds per

     year of oxygen-depleting pollution, severely limiting the oxygen that

     fish and other aquatic life need to live.  If the mill had been

     required to meet appropriate water quality standards, that pollution

     would have been cut in half.  TNRCC knows that it cannot allow such

     variances indefinitely, but TNRCC's answer is to downgrade standards,

     not upgrade discharges."

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"TNRCC knows that Sam Rayburn Reservoir and the Angelina River are

     polluted," said Mary Ruth Holder of the Texas Committee on Natural

     Resources. "The lake is already listed by the agency as `impaired'

     because of pollution.  It makes no sense for TNRCC to downgrade the

     upper reaches of the lake, allowing even more pollution to be

     discharged.  Instead TNRCC should be focusing on cleaning up the

     pollution already there, in order to protect fishing and other uses of

     the lake."

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We urge TNRCC commissioners to reject the downgrade for Lake Sam

     Rayburn," concluded Anderson of Clean Water Action.  "We also ask

     Governor Bush to persuade his appointees to maintain high water

     quality standards for the lake and to require cleanup of the pollution

     discharges from the mill."</font>
