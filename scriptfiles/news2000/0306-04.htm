- March 6 - A coalition of environmental and taxpayer groups today

     called upon the Clinton Administration and Congress to halt a

     scandal-ridden study being drafted by the Army Corps of Engineers; and

     to cut all funding for the project.  The coalition is made of: Sierra

     Club, National Audubon Society, Taxpayers for Common Sense, Izaak

     Walton League of America, National Wildlife Federation, Environmental

     Defense, Mississippi River Basin Alliance and Mississippi River

     Revival.

     The groups said that until a full and independent investigation is

     conducted, allowing the Corps to continue the ongoing planning to

     expand the upper Mississippi River locks and dams would be a huge

     waste of tax dollars.

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Corps has lost all credibility in its efforts on the navigation

     study. Allowing them to continue to work on it is simply pouring good

     money after bad," said Carl Zichella, Sierra Club, Midwest regional

     staff director.  "They treat tax dollars like monopoly money to grow

     their bureaucracy with."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     On February 1, a long-term Corps employee, Don Sweeney, formally

     alleged that senior Corps officials deliberately distorted a

     feasibility study on extending seven locks on the Mississippi and

     Illinois Rivers to assure the Congress would appropriate up to $2

     billion to build the project.  The federal Office of Special Counsel

     referred Sweeney's complaint to Secretary of Defense William Cohen on

     February 28, saying, "there is a substantial likelihood that officials

     in the Corps have engaged in violations of law, rule or regulation and

     a gross waste of funds."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Both Tim Searchinger, staff counsel for Environmental Defense, and

     Steve Ellis, director of water resources for Taxpayers for Common

     Sense, argued that the $7 million Congress appropriated to the Corps

     for pre- engineering work on the proposed locks, on the condition that

     the project would be found "justified," should be returned to the

     federal treasury.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Congress only authorized the Army Corps to spend millions on

     engineering plans for bigger locks if they were economically

     justified. Because the Corps in fact concluded that they were not

     justified, spending millions for engineering plans is a gross waste of

     taxpayer funds,"  Searchinger said.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Not a penny of this money should have been spent by the Corps under

     the terms Congress required.  This project is not justified in any

     sense, and it will be a long time before any decision can be made on

     it. Congress should rescind this funding immediately, before it is

     wasted on work that will never be needed," Ellis said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Tom Adams a senior policy advisor with the National Audubon Society

     said the Corps was hurting itself by not addressing the scandal

     head-on.

</font>

<p>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The senior officials at the Corps of Engineers need to realize that

     denial ain't just a river in Egypt.  The allegations made in Dr.

     Sweeney's affidavit, and confirmed last week by Special Counsel

     Kaplan, makes it clear that the credibility and integrity of this

     study is damaged beyond repair.  It is time for the flawed Corps' plan

     to meet a paper shredder. Congress must order the Corps to go back to

     the drawing board and deliver a plan that makes the Upper Mississippi

     a river that works and a working river," Adams said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     David Conrad, water resources specialist for the National Wildlife

     Federation reiterated the groups urging to Defense Secretary Cohen to

     meet with conservation and taxpayer organizations to discuss the

     institutional problems of the Corps and to help act to restore public

     confidence in the agency by halting the ongoing planning to expand the

     upper Mississippi River locks and dams.  "While senior Corps leaders

     call for a full investigation, the Rock Island District staff has

     acted as if nothing is wrong," Conrad said. "This leaves all of us to

     wonder where the control lies in the Corps of Engineers."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Richard Moore, Midwest representative for the Izaak Walton League of

     America called on Cohen and the administration to protect the

     whistle-blower, Dr. Don Sweeney, whose testimony revealed the Corps'

     manipulation of the navigation study.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Don Sweeney deserves our gratitude for potentially saving this

     country more than $1 billion.  He played by the rules and did

     everything right. We have asked the Secretary of the Army to protect

     him from retribution and we have heard nothing in response.  In fact,

     the only response we've heard has been the repeated denials of

     wrong-doing from the Rock Island District of the Corps," Moore said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Jim Falvey, policy director for the Mississippi River Basin Alliance

     said that other Corps projects could also be affected by the scandal.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Who's to say that the economic analysis for other projects, such as

     the destructive Yazoo Pump in Mississippi wasn't rigged too," Falvey

     asked. "Investigators of the Corps should consider this possibility.

     The same Mississippi Valley Division officials that demanded their

     economists `never take no for an answer' on the navigation study

     presided over other controversial projects.  What else have they

     deliberately distorted."</font>
