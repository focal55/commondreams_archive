- March 3 - The following was



released today by Handgun Control Inc.:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recent shootings in Michigan and Pennsylvania have again



thrust the issue of gun safety into the national spotlight --



much to the dismay of the National Rifle Association and the



pro-gun presidential candidates, who are now being forced to



deal with a problem which they don't want to talk about.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a result, the NRA, Gov. George Bush and Sen. John McCain



are in full "spin cycle," using smoke-and-mirrors public relations

to



claim to be championing gun safety legislation to deflect their poor



records on the issue of gun safety. At the same time, what the NRA



and these pro-gun candidates say and do on the issue of gun control



are two completely different things entirely.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to the heavy media coverage of the shootings in



Michigan and Pennsylvania, the NRA has toned down its typical



anti-gun control rhetoric and has now expressed its alleged support



for reasonable gun control laws designed to keep firearms out of the



hands of children. Ironically, the NRA's new public relations



campaign follows eight months of aggressive lobbying Congress to



defeat the package of common-sense gun control amendments to the



juvenile justice bill, including proposals closing the gun show



loophole, requiring mandatory safety locks for all new guns sold, and



banning the possession of semi-automatic assault weapons for



juveniles under age 18.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the "new" NRA and recent gun control converts George W.



Bush and John McCain have belatedly come out in support of stronger



gun control laws to help protect children, they've got a short memory



about their long-standing positions on the proposals they are now



claiming to support.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The same NRA that now proclaims that they "support and encourage



the distribution of safety locks," last year opposed a Senate floor



amendment that simply would have required the sale of a safety lock



with every handgun sold by a licensed dealer. Believe it, or not,



only a few months ago NRA top lobbyist James J. Baker called the



defeat of the safety lock amendment, "a great victory for public



safety." In arguing against this common-sense proposal, the NRA uses



its familiar scare tactics to convince gun owners that these laws



will lead to house-by-house inspections.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This irresponsible and dishonest talk mirrors the misinformed talk



of the "trigger lock police" from Governor George W. Bush in last



night's Republican presidential debate. While our children continue



to be killed by guns that are improperly stored, both the Texas



Governor and the NRA continue to use a message of fear to scare the



public into believing that these laws are enforced on the gun owner



rather than on the gun manufacturer, which is the intent of the



proposal.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And, while it now claims to want to do more to protect children



from firearms, the NRA has consistently dismissed, and even actively



lobbied against, efforts to make guns "childproof," or "smart guns"



that cannot be fired by unauthorized users. To underscore its



opposition to this innovative safety proposal, it recently launched

a



radio ad campaign in Washington, D.C. and several other media markets



mocking President Clinton's call to provide funding to expand



research and development efforts for "smart gun" technologies. The



ad, which features a President Clinton impersonator, parodies the



television show "Get Smart," with a fake agent saying the "smart gun"



proposal "doesn't sound very smart to me."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just this morning on the Today Show, NRA Executive Vice President



Wayne LaPierre said that, "if you have young children in the house,



you better lock up your guns and you better make them inaccessible.



And if you're criminally negligent, you should be charged and we



support that."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maybe Wayne ought to inform his lobbyists in Washington about



the NRA's "new" position. For many years, the NRA has fought



laws to hold adults criminally responsible for improperly storing



of firearms so that they are not accessible to children, called



Child Access Prevention (CAP) laws. Right now in Ohio, in fact,



the NRA is fighting a CAP bill that would make it a crime for



an adult to leave a loaded firearm where it is accessible by



children, even going as far as calling the legislation the



"(Governor) Taft Burglar Protection Act."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Their efforts haven't been limited to Ohio. The NRA has



lobbied against CAP legislation across the country. Just this



year, they have fought it in New Hampshire. They have fought



CAP in Rhode Island, Washington and Indiana too. Here again,



the powerful gun lobby uses dishonest rhetoric to imply that



these laws would require people to lock up their guns all of



time, even if there were no children in the house, and would also



make families vulnerable to crime. A 1997 study published in the



Journal of American Medical Association found that state safe storage



laws are particularly effective at reducing gun injuries and deaths



among children.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NRA came to the Today Show to promote its message of



enforcement over stronger laws and express its newfound interest in



the safety of our children, but it failed to mention that, in its



zeal to defeat all new gun control laws, no matter how reasonable,



they have helped to make it easier for children and criminals to get



guns. In December, the NRA led the fight in Illinois to reduce the



penalty for illegally carrying a gun from a felony to a misdemeanor,



and recently defeated a proposal in Utah that would have strengthened



penalties for violent gun misdemeanants. Last April in Missouri, the



NRA spent more than $4 million in an unsuccessful attempt to pass a



referendum that would have allowed people convicted of violent



misdemeanors, including stalking and child molestation, to carry a



hidden handgun almost anywhere in the state.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Talk is cheap. After each horrible shooting in America, the NRA



talks about its support for laws making it more difficult for



children and criminals to get guns. Then they fight them when



lawmakers try to pass these laws.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When John McCain talks about his support for new gun safety laws,



he doesn't mention that he voted against the Brady bill, the assault



weapons ban, mandatory background checks for all sales at gun shows,



even legislation banning the manufacture, sale and importation of



undetectable plastic guns. When George W. Bush talks about



protecting children from guns, he doesn't want to tell people that

he



opposed closing the gun show loophole in his state that still allow



children and criminals to easily access guns, and signed into law one



of the nation's most lax concealed-carry laws that allow permit



holders to carry hidden handguns into most public places, even



churches and amusement parks in Texas. Governor Bush also won't tell



you how, in June 1999, he signed into law a bill that preempts Texas



cities and counties from suing the gun industry to recover damages.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until the "Johnny-come-lately's" on gun control -- NRA, Governor



Bush and Senator McCain -- put their money where their mouths are,



the American people can expect nothing less than business-as-usual



from our pro-gun "friends."

Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, is the nation's largest



citizens' gun control lobbying organization. Based in Washington,



D.C., HCI works to enact stronger federal, state and local gun



control laws, but does not seek to ban handguns. Founded in



1974, HCI has more than 400,000 members nationwide and works



with local groups around the country to enact and protect reasonable



gun control laws. More information about HCI and its affiliated



organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, can be
