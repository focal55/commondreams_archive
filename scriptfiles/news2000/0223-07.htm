- February 23 - Join Doris "Granny D" Haddock on Tuesday, February 29th in her final walk into Washington D.C.  Granny D will be walking the remaining miles from Arlington National Cemetery to Capitol Hill where she will make remarks and address supporters. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Over the past 13 months, Granny D has walked more than 3,000 miles in an effort to show that Americans care deeply about the need to reclaim their elections and

our democracy from the special interests.  Haddock has relied on the kindness and generosity of supporters and strangers alike to sustain her.  Hundreds have opened their homes, restaurants, classrooms and town meetings to her, providing her with food, shelter, and even medical attention when necessary.  Thousands have come to walk with her and show their collective outrage with the corruption

that is so commonplace in today's system.  Millions more have seen her inspiring

story through national and international news media.  <br>

<br>

complete schedule for February 29th, log onto <a href="http://www.grannyd.com">www.grannyd.com</a>, or call John Anthony at 202-422-3439.

DEMOCRACY SPEAK-OUT<br>

</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citizens Will Risk Arrest in Capitol Rotunda to Denounce Legalized Bribery and Demand Full Public Financing of Public Elections

</font>



<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHEN:<br>

</b>Tuesday, February 29th, at 2:30 p.m. (or immediately following the 1:30 p.m. welcome ceremony for Granny D)

<br>

<br>

<b>WHERE:<br>

</b>Capitol Rotunda, Washington, D.C.

<br>

<br>

<b>WHAT: DEMOCRACY SPEAK-OUT<br>

</b>Addressed to Members of Congress, concerning campaign

finance corruption and Congress' betrayal of democracy.<br>

<br>

A "Democracy Brigade" composed of a dozen or more angry -- yet peaceful -- citizens will enter the Rotunda and risk arrest by unfurling one or more large banners and speaking aloud to the assembled tourists and onlookers. <br>

<br>

Members of the Brigade will denounce the on-going "crimes against democracy" committed every time members of

Congress take money from the very same corporate and other big-money interests they're supposed to regulating on the public's behalf, and they will demand full

public financing for public elections.  This dignified, nonviolent exercise of free speech, the third in a continuing series of such actions that began last fall, is being sponsored by the <a href="http://afd-online.org/">Alliance for Democracy</a>.  <br>

<br>
