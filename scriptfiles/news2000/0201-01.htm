<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK  

- February 1 - Human Rights Watch today called for

stepped-up efforts to bring to justice those responsible for the

killing, mass destruction, and forced expulsions that wracked East Timor

last September.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a report issued yesterday, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry

on East Timor concluded that ultimate responsibility for the terror

rests with the Indonesian army, which facilitated and in certain cases

directly participated in the abuses.  The report also urged the creation

of an international investigatory body and for steps to be put in motion

for establishment of an international tribunal to bring those

responsible to justice.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Justice for East Timor is at a crossroads," said Joe Saunders, deputy

Asia director at Human Rights Watch. "The U.N. commission's findings

should put to rest the Indonesian army's self-serving claims that the

systematic destruction of East Timor was the work of crazed militias and

a handful of disobedient soldiers.  The Commission's findings make it

imperative that investigations continue until all those responsible can

be brought to justice."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Indonesia's own national commission of inquiry on East Timor also issued

its report yesterday.  It called for establishment of a special "human

rights court" in Indonesia and named more than thirty Indonesian

officers believed responsible for the terror in East Timor, including

General Wiranto and five other Indonesian generals.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Saunders noted that the Indonesian investigators, working under

tremendous pressure and at considerable personal risk, did a remarkable

job.  He emphasized, however, that it is too early to say whether any

Indonesian tribunal will have sufficient resources or authority to

conduct what will undoubtedly be expensive, drawn-out trials of military

leaders.  It will be difficult to ensure that such prosecutions stay

free of pressures from the military, currently engaged in a struggle

with the new civilian government of Abdurrahman Wahid to retain its old

political power.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"International investigations must continue if there is to be any hope

of serious pursuit of justice on the Indonesian side," Saunders said.

"And if for any reason Indonesia proves unable or unwilling to pursue

justice, the international community must step in."  He noted that it

takes time, resources, and skilled investigators to build the kind of

cases necessary to win convictions and urged that the U.N. Security

Council ensure that additional resources are pledged to support a

vigorous international investigation.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch also welcomed President Wahid's call for prosecutions

of army leaders.  President Wahid, speaking on Monday at the World

Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, reportedly said that he will soon

ask Wiranto, Indonesian military chief at the time of the East Timor

carnage, to resign his current post as Coordinating Minister for

Politics and Security Affairs.  The president reportedly also said that

he would pardon Wiranto, but only after a trial, and that no other

military officers would be pardoned.  The president has publicly

rejected an international tribunal, preferring trials of military

officials before a special Indonesian court.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We welcome President Wahid's call for accountability and trials of army

leaders," said Saunders. "The principle of accountability must be

upheld, whether it is an Indonesian court or an international tribunal

that ultimately hears the cases."  He emphasized, however, that any

decision to pardon Wiranto would be premature and must under no

circumstances serve as an opening to broader impunity for the armed

forces.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How the trials of the generals are handled will have important

implications not only for justice in East Timor but also for the process

of reform in Indonesia.  Much of the regional and sectarian conflict in

Indonesia today has been fueled by public frustration with lack of

accountability for past injustices and a resultant loss of faith in the

ability of government institutions to broker fair resolutions of

disputes.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hard-line military officers disgruntled with the new civilian

leadership are also rumored to be directly behind some of the violence.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Impunity for the armed forces must end," said Saunders. "Establishing

accountability for the abuses in East Timor is a necessary beginning."

He noted that with international tribunals underway for Rwanda and the

former Yugoslavia, and another tribunal under discussion for the Khmer

Rouge in Cambodia, the progress of justice in the case of East Timor

would have broad repercussions internationally.
