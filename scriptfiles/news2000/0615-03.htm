Glennon is author of "Fathering: Strengthening Connection with Your 

Children No Matter Where They Are," for which he interviewed 180 fathers, 

aged 15 to 87, almost all of whom cried during their interviews. He said 

today: "Fathers need to get deeply engaged in the upbringing of their 

children. Fathers don't want to be isolated, children don't want them to be 

disconnected and mothers don't want them to be absent -- physically or 

emotionally. But we have patterns of how we raise our children which keep 

fathers distant, cost them emotionally, cause pain in their relationships, 

making boys more violent and girls accepting of misogyny."

Executive director of Dads and Daughters, Kelly said today: "Fathers are 

key in their children's lives -- we know this already. But fathers have a 

unique influence (for the bad or the good) in a girl's life. A dad is in a 

powerful position to help his daughter resist the media and cultural 

pressure to worry exclusively about appearance and sex. Plus, dads are in 

powerful positions to make our communities and world better for girls, 

working for greater opportunities for girls which helps to also bring about 

greater opportunities for sons. This Father's Day, we should give our kids 

the gift of talking with them about media messages for girls and boys. Kids 

are bombarded with ads and shows and products and attitudes that tell them 

things like: 'How a girl looks is more important than who she is. Inner 

beauty only goes so far.' And, 'Boys are tough and show no feelings. They 

are only interested in titillation and violence.' These messages are 

manipulative, corrosive -- and blatantly false. We need to help our kids 

understand this -- and, as responsible fathers, we need to stand up and 

protest these messages, too."

Professor of education at American University and author of "Failing at 

Fairness," which documents gender bias in schools, Sadker said today: 

"Father's Day should be an important marker, reminding fathers that they 

are educational advocates for their children. Fathers should work with 

schools to make sure that their children are not shortchanged by gender 

bias. Their daughters are likely to be given less attention in the 

classroom, ask fewer questions and be praised less; girls quickly learn 

that being silent and conforming results in higher report card grades, but 

results in a loss of initiative. Their sons in school too often get 

disciplined out of proportion to their behavior and too often learn to 

demean girls. Fathers should provide a caring bridge to their sons, 

teaching them to respect girls and women. Fathers should help their 

daughters to develop a public voice and their sons to develop a public ear."	</font>
