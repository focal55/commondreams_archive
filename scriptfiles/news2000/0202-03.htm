- February 2 - Public school football games are no place for school-sponsored prayer,

          Americans United for Separation of Church and State said in a brief

          filed today with the United States Supreme Court.

          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

bold">Americans United and allied groups filed a &quot;friend of the court&quot;

          brief in Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, a Texas case

          dealing with school-sanctioned, student-led pre-game prayers broadcast

          over a high school's public address system.</span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

bold">&quot;Students should be able to attend all public school events without

          being pressured to participate in religious worship,&quot; said the

          Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United.

          &quot;Public school officials should be teaching our children to

          respect religious differences, not to bully their classmates to pray

          their way.&quot;</span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

bold">The Santa Fe controversy began four years ago when two anonymous families,

          one Catholic and one Mormon, filed a suit in federal court arguing

          that prayers before football games violate the First Amendment's

          separation of church and state. On Feb. 26, 1999, the U.S. 5th Circuit

          Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the families. The school district

          appealed, and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on Nov. 15.

          Oral argument is scheduled for March 29 and a decision is expected by

          June or July.</span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

bold">AU's brief tells the justices that there is an important constitutional

          difference between private religious expression and prayers sponsored

          by the government. When public school officials turn over the school's

          microphone to broadcast a prayer to those in attendance for an

          official school event, the brief argues, the line is crossed from

          private expression to state sponsorship.</span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

bold">Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in

          Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization represents 60,000

          members and allied houses of worship in all 50 states.</span></p>
