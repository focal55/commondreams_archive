- May 31 - WASHINGTON-- U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt

     today recommended that President Clinton protect four majestic

     landscapes as National Monuments, earning ringing applause from the

     Sierra Club.  Babbitt urged that the President safeguard Hanford Reach

     in Washington, Canyons on the Ancients in southwest Colorado, Ironwood

     National Monument in Arizona, and Soda Mountain in southwest Oregon.

     Treasured for their historic, wildlife and recreational values, these

     areas could be lost unless the President uses the power of his office

     to safeguard these examples of our nation's vanishing natural

     heritage.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By designating these four monuments, President Clinton can protect

     areas throughout the spectacular American West from destruction," said

     Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director.  "Each of these areas is

     threatened by oil and gas drilling, development, grazing, or off-road

     vehicle use, but with the President's action, they will be protected

     for our families and our future. Because Americans see our wildlands

     so rapidly dwindling, people want action now to save what's left for

     future generations to explore and enjoy."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Washington's Hanford Reach is one of the nation's natural wonders,

     because this 51-mile stretch of the Columbia River is the only

     free-flowing stretch of the Columbia left in the U.S.  A run of wild

     fall chinook salmon is abundant enough to support a commercial and

     tribal fishery and attract hundreds of recreational anglers to the

     region.  Irrigation projects and polluted run-off threaten to load up

     the river and choke the salmon, unless the President ensures the

     future of this treasure.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There are areas of the Columbia River at the Hanford Reach that

     remain as wild as it did two hundred years ago when Lewis and Clark

     explored the breath-taking American West," Pope said.  "With a

     National Monument designation, President Clinton can ensure the

     Hanford Reach continues to amaze Americans and nurture salmon for

     generations to come.  The time has come to protect our salmon by

     protecting the Hanford reach."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Babbitt's proposal will also grant protection for Canyons on the

     Ancients, the rich cultural and archeological resources of remote

     Anasazi sites in southwest Colorado.  National Monument designation

     will maintain the pristine character of these undisturbed canyon areas

     and the integrity of the irreplaceable archeological sites that

     include cliff dwellings, towers, petroglyphs, and other evidence of

     1,000-year-old communities.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Canyons on the Ancients National Monument would encompass a

     one-of-a-kind, world class archeological resource," said Mark Pearson,

     Chair of the Sierra Club Wildlands Committee. "National monument

     designation would bring long-needed management attention to the

     problems of vandalism, resource impacts, and rapidly expanding

     recreation that threaten the longevity of these cultural resources."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     This announcement comes at a time when the Canyons on the Ancients are

     under extreme ecological destruction from oil and gas leasing,

     off-road vehicle use, mining and grazing.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Soda Mountain represents a breathtaking landscape of high ridges and

     steep canyons that harbors a biological treasure house of plants and

     wildlife.  Rich with trout streams, ancient stands of pine and fir,

     towering cliffs, and rich grasslands dotted with majestic oaks,

     scientists have long recognized this area for its amazing array of

     plant and wildlife diversity.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Soda Mountain's majesty is in danger.  Abuse by off-road vehicles,

     over-grazing, and logging, could push Soda Mountain's trout streams

     and ancient pine forests to the brink." said Anne Mitchell, chair or

     Sierra Club's High Desert Committee.  "We welcome today's action which

     gives us hope that it's not too late to protect the values of this

     unique landscape."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The proposed Ironwood National Monument is located in the Silver Bell

     Mountains, currently home to ASARCO's Silver Bell copper mine. The

     strip mine uses 2 million gallons of limited desert water a day and is

     endangering plant and animal life in the process.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The desert big horn sheep and Saguaro cactus are both in danger of

     extinction without national monument protection," said Rob Kulakofsky

     from the Sierra Club's Rincon Group. "Ironwood trees provide shade for

     new growths of trees and habitat for species which is important in a

     desert climate."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The land is also sacred to native tribes and has territorial and

     Spanish-colonial historical significance.
