- July 13 - The following is a



statement by Tom Z. Collina, Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS)



Arms Control Program Director:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By a party-line vote of 52-48, all but three GOP Senators



rejected an amendment to the Senate Defense Authorization Bill



that would have required realistic testing of the National Missile



Defense (NMD) system. This amendment called for testing the



NMD system against the types of threats the US Intelligence



Community tells us may soon arise -- missiles armed not just



with warheads, but with decoys and countermeasures designed



to foil our defense. If we do not test the system against such



threats, we will never have confidence that this system would



work in a real attack.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The amendment, sponsored by Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL), was



supported by the Pentagon's chief weapons tester, Dr. Phillip Coyle,



Director of Operational Testing and Evaluation. In a letter to



Senator Durbin, Coyle stated: "As we move forward, test realism will



need to grow with system capability, and it will become more and more



important to achieve realistic operational conditions in NMD system



tests. This will include realistic countermeasures and engagement



conditions."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization did



not oppose the amendment, and in fact had already called on



the Welch Panel of missile experts to review plans for NMD testing



against countermeasures, also called for by the Durbin amendment.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How can the Republican Party claim to support NMD if they



do not want to conduct the tests that are necessary to show



that it will work? What are they afraid of? That tests against



realistic targets may show that NMD can not do the job?

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Republican Senators who voted against the Durbin amendment are



saying "build it and it will work." By supporting a $60 billion



system without adequate testing they appear to be more interested in



fleecing Americans than in defending them.
