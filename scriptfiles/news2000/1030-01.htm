- October 30 - Ralph Nader, Green Party Presidential candidate, will hold

the campaign's final super rally at the MCI Center on November 5, 1:00 PM to

5:30 PM.  The event will be broadcast via satellite to simultaneous rallies

on college campuses across the country.



<p>Over the past two months, the Nader campaign Super Rallies have drawn huge

crowds (as large as 16,000 at Madison Square Garden in New York) of

supporters eager to hear the "politics of joy and justice."



<p>Super Rally organizers expect people from the District, Maryland, Virginia,

Pennsylvania, West Virginia, North Carolina, and other states to pack the

arena.



<p><b>WHO:</b> Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader; featured guests: Danny

Glover, Randall Robinson, Michael Moore, Patti Smith, Barbara Ehrenreich,

Phil Donahue, Cornell West, Pie Tasters, local candidates of the D.C.

Statehood Green Party, and locals bands.  Others to be announced later this

week.



<p><b>WHAT:</b> Super Rally to "Get Out the Vote" for Nader/LaDuke and DC Statehood



<p><b>WHEN:</b> Sunday, November 5, 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM

              Doors open, and local performances begin, at 11:30 AM



<p><b>WHERE:</b> MCI Center, Washington, DC



<p>The Nader campaign has raised more than $6 million with an average donation

of under $100, and is not accepting PAC money or raising soft money. The

Nader/LaDuke ticket is on the ballot in 44 states and sees November 7th as

the launching point of a major third-party reform movement.



<p>Nader campaign manager Theresa Amato said the campaign looks forward to the

MCI Center event. "We're thrilled to highlight the momentum and energy of

this campaign right here in DC and to point out the lack of democracy in our

nation's capitol."



<p>The themes of the Super Rally are Get Out The Vote! and Support D.C.

Statehood!  Mr. Nader has promoted statehood and democracy for the people of

the District of Columbia throughout his campaign, discussing it in speeches

across the U.S.



<p>Tickets to the Nader rally are available for a suggested donation of $10 at

the MCI Center box office, through Nader's website at www.votenader.com or

www.votenader.org, (click on "Super Rally") or by calling the Nader 2000

Washington office at 202-265-1160.
