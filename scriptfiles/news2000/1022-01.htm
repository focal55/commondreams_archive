- October 22 - On Tuesday, October 24 at 2 PM, representatives from local

and national organizations will join clergy, labor, and legislators in

delivering a clear message to Philadelphia’s District Attorney, Lynne Abraham

-- Stop wasting time and money on senseless prosecutions: Drop all charges

against the Republican Convention protestors!



<p>After a 2 PM press conference outside the D.A.’s office (1421 Arch Street in

downtown Philadelphia), a delegation will personally deliver to D.A. Abraham

over 100 letters supporting the protesters and condemning the city for its

assault on free speech. Trials for hundreds of RNC protesters will begin the

following day, Oct. 25.



<p>In one of the letters addressed to Mayor Street and D.A. Abraham, members of

U.S. Congress, concerned that the city’s actions may chill political dissent,

call for the immediate dropping of all charges.



<p>U.S. Congressman John Conyers (D-MI), ranking member of the House Judiciary

Committee, joins other Congressional co-signers in this letter addressed to

Philadelphia Mayor John Street and D.A. Abraham.  Their letter urges the city

to end its campaign to punish non-violent, peaceful protest.

 

<p>Local labor leaders, clergy, and over 80 local and national organizations will

deliver the D.A. letters of their own, calling upon the city to drop all

charges.



<p>Art Dougherty, President of the PA local of the American Postal Workers Union,

says, “The police response to [Convention] protests was disproportionately

harsh, and apparently aimed at preventing free expression.”



<p>“The city already went way over-budget on the convention, and these ridiculous

trials will add thousands if not millions of dollars to the cost of turning our

city over to the Republicans,” says Mark Rifkin, a graduate student at the

University of Pennsylvania who was arrested on August 1st and was in jail

for 10

days. “The city needs to spend its money on real issues  affordable housing,

health care, and education  not persecuting activists.”



<p>During the Republic National Convention on August 1st of this year, several

hundred activists were arrested for protesting, among other issues, the

criminal justice system and the lack of public discussion of human rights

abuses by the police and in U.S. prisons. Over 400 people, including

bystanders, legal observers, and medics, were rounded up by the police and held

for days on end, many waiting over 100 hours before being arraigned. All faced

enormous bails, ranging from $10,000 to $1 million, and were jailed for up to 2

weeks. They will be brought to trial over the next few months. Many of those

arrested are charged with multiple felonies, facing the possibility of decades

in prison. The arrests were for acts of civil disobedience, which typically

bring only summary charges.



<p>“This situation is unprecedented in this country’s history,” says Marina Sitrin

of the R2K Legal Collective.  “Never before has there been a concerted effort

to convict hundreds of protestors on such numerous, severe, and trumped-up

charges  all for using time-honored tactics of civil disobedience to try to

challenge and change the racism and classism of the criminal justice system.”



<p>Prior to, during, and after the week of the Republican Convention, police used

surveillance and infiltration, as well as targeting specific activists, in

order preemptively to disrupt political organizing and to silence political

dissent.  On multiple occasions, the Philadelphia police claimed not to be

involved in such covert activity, but investigative work by the Philadelphia

Inquirer later showed that the police had indeed relied heavily on information

gathered in this way.

<p>BACKGROUNDER



<p>TRIALS BEGIN WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 25TH



<p>The first day of trials for hundreds of arrested activists is Wednesday,

October 25th, 2000 at noon.  Margaret Burns will be tried in Room 806 of the

Criminal Justice Center (13th & Filbert Streets) as the first defendant to face

multiple misdemeanor charges.  She will be followed by a handful of other

defendants scheduled for Thursday and Friday.  The bulk of the group or

consolidated trials will begin later in October and early November.



<p>Some of the scheduling depends on the conclusion of a series of motions being

introduced by R2K lawyers this week.  A motion for discovery, introduced last

week by the R2K legal team forced the continuance of many trials due to the

lack of preparedness on the part of the prosecution and the DA.  This week

arguments will be made on motions to suppress, selective prosecution, and

destruction of exculpatory evidence.



<p>CLAIMS OF MULTIPLE CIVIL LIBERTY VIOLATIONS AGAINST ACTIVISTS:

POLICE STAKED OUT, INFILTRATED ACTIVIST HOMES AND MEETINGS;



<p>There is comprehensive proof that, prior to the actions, police surveilled

activists’ houses and meetings, infiltrated activist groups, and interrogated

people about their plans for the Convention.  However, because criminal cases

are pending, much of this information cannot be discussed publicly.



<p>Acting on information obtained through illegal infiltration, police targeted

specific activists for pre-emptive arrests.  On August 1st, police surrounded a

puppet-making warehouse and arrested everyone inside, altogether over 70

activists who had been making signs and puppets for the demonstrations.  The

message that would have been communicated, a First Amendment right, was

confiscated and later destroyed by law enforcement.



<p>Protestors faced what may be the highest bails in history for misdemeanor

charges.  While a handful of people had bails as high as $500,000 and

$1,000,000, the majority of bails ranged from $10,000 to $50,000  still

outstandingly high for misdemeanor charges.  Protestors also face multiple

charges.  Instead of the customary citation for blocking a highway, protestors

are facing as many as twelve charges apiece, including conspiracy.  Many

charges are obviously false; for example, people arrested in the puppet

warehouse are charged with obstructing a highway.



<p>Several dozen protestors, as well as bystanders, were singled out for felony

charges, many for felony assault on police.  Such charges can bring

decades-long jail sentences.  The vast majority of these charges, if not all of

them, are trumped up efforts by police to cover up their own violent acts

toward protestors.



<p>Activists who set out to protest the criminal justice system experienced

first-hand some of the routine cruelty perpetrated by that system.  Arrested

protestors were denied food, water, and urgent medical needs.  They were

dragged, kicked, punched, and handcuffed so tightly as to cut off circulation. 

Some people were held for over 100 hours without being arraigned.



<p>WHY WERE ACTIVISTS ON THE STREETS AUGUST 1ST?



<p>The atrocities of the criminal justice system are numerous.  People were on the

streets August 1st in Philadelphia to call attention not only to the track

record of Candidate Bush on issues like state sanctioned executions, but on a

wide variety of dysfunction within a system that has not fared any better under

Democrat or Republican leadership.



<p>The August 1st Coalition, a group of activists engaging in non-violent direct

action, called for the following systemic changes: Freedom for Mumia Abu Jamal

and all political prisoners; abolishment of the Prison Industrial Complex;

abolishment of the death penalty; an end to police violence; and an end to the

corporate war on the poor.



<p>Nearly two million people are incarcerated in the US.  That’s more than any

other industrialized nation, and one quarter of the entire planet’s prison

population.  In 1995, black men were seven times more likely than white men to

be imprisoned, and still make up 47% of state and federal inmates.
