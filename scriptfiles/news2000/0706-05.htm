<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- July 6 - The following is the body of a letter sent yesterday from

Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger to the heads of the

"host committees" of the Republican and Democratic National

Conventions.  The letter calls on Noelia Rodriguez, President

of LA Convention 2000, and Karen Dougherty Buchholz, President

of Philadelphia 2000, to take the steps necessary to ensure

prompt and full disclosure of the reported $70 million raised

by the committees.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">July 5, 2000</font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to recent reports, almost $70 million has been raised by the host 

committees of the Republican and Democratic National Conventions.  The 

level of convention fundraising is on pace to shatter all previous records. 

The large majority of this money is being contributed by special interests, 

many of which have pressing issues before Congress or the Clinton 

administration.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the unprecedented amount that these interests are contributing, 

Common Cause calls on the host committees which are receiving the money to 

take the necessary steps to ensure full and prompt disclosure of the 

money.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the recently enacted legislation addressing the funding of Section 527 

entities makes plain, there is overwhelming bipartisan support for maximum 

disclosure of money in the political process.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We recognize that convention host committees are required to disclose 

contributions 60 days after the convention.  This is inadequate to serve 

the public interest.  We ask that the host committee respect not just the 

letter of this regulation, but the spirit of full and immediate disclosure, 

and publicly commit to disclose the name of any contributor and amount of 

the contribution within 24 hours of receipt by the committee.  Further, 

this information should be made available to the public by posting on the 

Internet.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We recognize that many of the donors who have already contributed have 

allowed their names and contributions to be disclosed. However, we urge you 

to fully embrace the values of openness and accountability, by publicly 

committing to full and immediate disclosure of all contributions - both 

monetary and in-kind - as soon as they are received.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,

					

</font>
