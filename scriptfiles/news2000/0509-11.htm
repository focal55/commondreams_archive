- May 9 - Bay Area human rights and peace activists will join UC

Berkeley students Wednesday, May 10 to protest Secretary of State

Madeleine Albright's graduation speech at the university's

commencement ceremony. The protests will target the Clinton

Administration's plan for a huge military aid bill to Colombia that

activists say will increase human rights abuses in the

conflict-troubled country.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The commencement ceremony begins at 4:00 p.m. at the Greek Theater on

the UC Berkeley campus. At 4:30 p.m. a plane will start flying over

the graduation trailing a banner with the message "Stop US Military

Aid to Colombia." Other signs of protest will appear inside the

ceremony. Earlier in the day, a teach-in is planned for noon at Sproul

Plaza. Students will begin demonstrating outside the Greek Theater at

2:00 p.m.

In March, the House of Representatives approved a $1.6 billion aid

package for Colombia, already the third largest recipient of US

foreign aid. The bill is supposed to go to the Senate floor later this

month.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Eighty five percent of the planned aid--or $1.3 billion--will go to pay

for military hardware and training to halt drug production in the

Andean country. But drug policy experts say that further

militarization will not decrease drug production and that even if it

did succeed in suppressing production, it would not affect the US drug

market.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Human rights groups charge that the Colombian military's record of

human rights abuses, and its connection with right-wing paramilitaries

who are responsible for 75 percent of abuses in the country, should be

reason enough to deny an increase in military funding. Rights

activists say the aid will only aggravate Colombia's humanitarian

crisis. More than 30,000 people have lost their lives during the last

10 years of the country's 40-year civil war. Another 1.5 million

people have been displaced, more than 500,000 of those in just the

last two years. And up to 1,000 people are fleeing the country every

week. Human rights groups fear that the aid package may scuttle the

country's struggling peace process.



</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This military aid package will not stop the flow of drugs to the

US--that's a fact," says Sandra Alvarez, coordinator of the Colombia

program at Global Exchange, a San Francisco-based human rights

organization. "What this military aid will do is worsen the terrible

suffering already occurring in Colombia. US citizens must demand that

we don't deepen the conflict in Colombia and call their Senators to

tell them to vote against this gross proposal. We must support the

peace process in Colombia. Any aid sent to the country should be

directed entirely to social investment such as education programs,

alternative development programs, crop substitution, aid to the

displaced, and strengthening of the judicial system."</font>
