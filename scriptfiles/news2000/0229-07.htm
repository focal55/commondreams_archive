<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">News Advisory:

</font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO:

<br>

- WWII Veteran John Wack, a de-miner in the 39th Combat



Engineering Unit, lost his leg in Italy in 1943.

<br>

- WWII Vet Duane Robey, 415th Infantry Regiment 104th "Timberwolf"



Division, lost foot in Germany on Dec. 31, 1944.

<br>

- Jerry White lost right leg below the knee during his junior year



abroad in Israel on April 12, 1984 and serves as newly elected chair



of the U.S. Campaign to Ban Landmines.

<br>

- Ken Rutherford lost both legs on a humanitarian mission in



Somalia on Dec. 16, 1993.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">White and Rutherford co-founded the Landmine Survivors Network,



co-recipient of the 1997 Nobel Prize for Peace awarded to the



International Campaign to Ban Landmines.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT:

<br>

Appeals signed by 1,000 landmine survivors from 12 heavily



mine-affected countries ask President Clinton to actualize his vision



for a time when families and neighbors can "Walk the Earth in Safety.



" Survivors urge President Clinton to take one last courageous step



in his Presidency and ban anti-personnel mines in 2000. "As landmine survivors ourselves we cannot feel healed and we cannot feel secure



until the scourge of landmines is eliminated."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN:

<br>

10:30 a.m., Wednesday, March 1. The Mine Ban Treaty came into



force as international law on March 1, 1999. 137 countries have



joined.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE:

<br>

Press Briefing Room No. 226, United Nations, New York City

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DETAILS:

<br>

"Today we speak on behalf of hundreds of thousands of brother and



sister landmine survivors. We call on all nations to eradicate



anti-personnel mines so that everyone in the world can walk without



fear. Someone steps on a mine every twenty-two minutes. Between today



and President Clinton's last day in the White House, over 21,000



individuals will be murdered or maimed by a mine," said White.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Landmines are equal opportunity weapons-they do not discriminate



or know who is friend or foe. Landmines do not recognize armistices



or peace treaties. Secreted deep in the earth, they continue to kill



and maim for years after wars have been forgotten and battles won or



lost," noted Rutherford.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"After the war, I went to Harvard University and enjoyed



challenging and fulfilling work until I retired in 1992. I have a



wonderful wife, eight children, and eleven grandchildren. Sometimes



I recall the field just North of Florence where I lost my leg and I



think I have had a fulfilling life, but how much easier it might have



been with my leg," commented Wack, who had been a de-miner in Italy



in 1943.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Duane Robey recalls New Year's Eve, 1944. A big 21-year-old guy,



6 feet, 200 pounds, from Minnesota, Robey was on patrol waiting to



rush across the road and leap into the German position on the Roer



River front. "I moved into position to wait for the signal. I saw a



slight rise in the snow. The other six in my unit had stepped over



this spot; my subconscious screamed DON'T STEP THERE! Too late!



WHOOMP! I was thrown forward and my face plowed into the snow-covered



ground. Dazed, I rolled over on my back...I sat up and saw my mangled



foot against my shin...The boot was gone and my lower leg felt sticky



and wet. I saw my foot was gone. I could hear nothing but the falling



snow. I did not make a sound...The Lieutenant called the mission



'aborted. Pick Robey up and head for our lines.' Four guys carried



me. Quietly I said, 'For God's sake, don't anyone step on a mine.'



WHOOMP! I was thrown upwards. I recall sharp pain in my back, then



there was blackness," recalled Robey.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"U.S. silence in the Landmine Ban reminds me of the quiet,



listening to the falling snow in 1944. Danger covered us like a



blanket. It was so unreal and eerie," said Robey. He hopes Clinton



will "stand tall and stop the use of anti-personnel mines. Make the



promise of the landmine ban real. My foot has been gone for



fifty-five years, a lifetime, Mr. President. Your mission as



Commander-in-Chief is drawing to a close. One act of courage that



will be your legacy is to ban mines forever. You will honor hundreds



of thousands who have met their mine and offer a lifeline to future



generations who will 'walk the earth in safety' as you yourself have



said."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Survivor Action Appeal is only one of many survivor



initiatives to ban landmines and provide peer support and assistance



to others. Other initiatives include:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- "Surviving Limb Loss" - Just published: 10 fact-based Peer



Support Pamphlets designed to educate amputees and families on what



to expect, what to do, and how to resume active, productive lives.



The series is being translated into several languages for use by



survivors around the world.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- "Survivors Rehabilitation Database" (<a href="http://www.lsndatabase.org">www.lsndatabase.org</a>) -



Developed in partnership with UN Mine Action Service and the UN



Office for Project Services, the database profiles rehabilitation



services available to mine victims worldwide.
