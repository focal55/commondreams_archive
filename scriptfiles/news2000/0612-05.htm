- June 12 - On the eve of the U.S.



EPA's release of a reassessment of dioxin, more than 100 prominent



physicians, public health professional and scientists have

appealed to President Clinton and Vice President Gore "to develop a



Plan of Action, which should include national and international



commitments to the long-term goal of the virtual elimination" of the



dangerous chemical.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The text of the letter is available at the Physicians for Social



Responsibility website, <a href="http://www.psr.org">www.psr.org</a>.)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The appeal from the health professionals, released today by



Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), commended the agencys



efforts to gather a comprehensive scientific review of the dangers

of



dioxin. The reassessment has been in the works for nearly a decade



and has been the target of much industry pressure.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The industries flooding our environment with dioxin have denied



its dangers while this report has been held up for nine years," said



Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., CEO and executive director of PSR. "This



reassessment tells the truth they don't want you to hear: dioxin is

a



dangerous cancer-causing chemical that must be phased out."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Industry will undoubtedly try to undermine this news as they have



in the past, but this report and its endorsement by leading public



health professionals should allow us to put to rest the debate," said



Musil.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dioxin is especially dangerous to children. As the physician



letter to the administration explains, "developing fetuses, nursing



infants, and young children are at greatest risk from current levels



of dioxin exposure. EPA's draft risk characterization warns that



young children consume more than three times -- and nursing infants



100 times -- the amount of dioxins as adults, on a body weight



basis."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Animal and human data shows that current exposures to dioxin are



enough to contribute substantially to cancer risks in the general



population," said Ted Schettler, MD, MPH, a signer of the letter and



a member of PSR's Environment Committee. "The administration has an



opportunity to use this reassessment to move the U.S. closer to a



meaningful policy of virtual dioxin elimination."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dioxin is produced by waste incineration and other industrial



processes. It is one of 12 persistent organic pollutants (POPs)



which are the subject of a international treaty negotiation. These



pollutants build up in the human and animal tissue, accumulating as



it ascends up the food chain. The physicians' letter to the



administration also recommends that the State Department pursue



virtual elimination of dioxin through that treaty.</font>
