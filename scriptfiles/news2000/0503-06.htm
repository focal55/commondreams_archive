- May 3 - Consumers Union (CU), the nonprofit publisher

of <i>Consumer Reports</i> magazine, today expressed disappointment

that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has no plans to require

labeling of foods derived through the use of biotechnology.

</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The FDA's new policy falls short of what consumers need," said

Mark Silbergeld, co-director of CU's Washington, DC office.  "FDA's

proposal to develop guidelines for voluntary labeling will not help

most consumers who want to know if their food is genetically

engineered.  FDA's proposals on safety could be an improvement, but

the devil will be in the details.  We will be monitoring it closely

to see how effective it is in helping consumers."

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FDA issued a press release today announcing the direction it plans

to take in refining its regulatory approach to genetically engineered

foods, or GE foods (the release is located online at www.fda.gov). 

The initiative comes in the wake of meetings held by FDA last year to

gather opinions from the food industry and the general public. 

Hundreds testified, and some 30,000 people sent written comments to

the agency.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The FDA fails to require mandatory labeling for all genetically

engineered food products even though polls show that 70-90 percent of

Americans want it," said Silbergeld. "Therefore, most foods on the

supermarket shelf are unlikely to contain label information about GE

content, whether they are GE or GE free.  Consumers will be given

little of the information they say they want when they do the family

food shopping."  He explained that because the law is unclear as to

who will be liable if a food is mislabeled "GE Free" if accidentally

contaminated with GE product, the industry will be very reluctant to

make that label claim.  Furthermore, GE foods are not likely to be

voluntarily labeled, because companies believe such labels will drive

consumers away. 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FDA would also require biotech companies to notify the FDA

four months in advance of releasing new genetically engineered crops

and provide the agency with "specific information" on safety.  This

requirement would apply to imported foods as well as foods grown

domestically.  Company data on a product will be made available to

the public on the FDA web site after FDA completes its review.

 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The proposed mandatory safety consultation is potentially a step

forward," said Jean Halloran, director of CU's Consumer Policy

Institute. "However," she warned, "the consumer will only benefit if

the FDA implements this effectively.  What tests must be done, how

FDA reviews the data and how the government assures that imported

foods meet the new requirements, all remain to be determined."  

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Halloran added that CU applauds the agency's decision to make

company data available to the public.  However she criticized the FDA

for being secretive about how it is handling genetically modified

animal foods, such as salmon modified to enhance growth hormone

production.  "FDA should conduct a full and thorough public review of

its policies on engineered animals, similar to the one it completed

on engineered plants," Halloran states.
