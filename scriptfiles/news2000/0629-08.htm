- June 29 - The House of Representatives

          is scheduled to vote on an appropriations bill today that is riddled

          with unnecessary provisions. In some cases, Congress has asked for

          millions of dollars above what the President has requested for the

          coming fiscal year.</font>



<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House Committee on Appropriations has

          already passed the bill. Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent

          watchdog against government waste, is calling for a reduction in

          spending, and in some cases, the termination of projects in this bill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here are

          some of the amendments to the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and

          Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, for

          FY2000 Taxpayers for Common Sense supports:

          </font></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>DeFazio (D-OR) –Bass (R-NH) -Morella (R-MD) Amendment:</u> This amendment seeks to reduce funding for Wildlife

          Services lethal predator control program by about $7 million, taking

          the appropriation back down to the Administration request of $28.7

          million. About half of

          the funding for USDA’s Wildlife Services predator control program is

          little more than a taxpayer handout to the Western livestock industry.&nbsp;

          Instead of improving their own techniques, ranchers rely on a

          taxpayer-funded program to protect their livestock from predators.&nbsp;

          This expensive subsidy to the western livestock industry

          continues despite the fact that is has been proven ineffective.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Chabot

          (R-OH) Amendments on the Market Access Program</u>:&nbsp; Two

          separate amendments on the Market Access Program (MAP) will be offered

          by Rep. Chabot (R-OH), seeking to scale back and eliminate the

          program.&nbsp; A perennial

          target of fiscal conservatives, this program is too often simply

          corporate welfare for big agribusinesses that do not need taxpayer

          handouts.<&nbsp; MAP is designed

          to encourage the export of different agricultural products by funding

          consumer related activities that promote these products, such as trade

          shows, advertising campaigns, and other marketing tactics.&nbsp; In theory, MAP has been reformed to benefit only small

          businesses, farmer cooperatives and trade associations.&nbsp;

          But corporate agribusiness often ends up receiving benefits at

          taxpayer expense.Moreover,

          many beneficiaries can afford their own advertising and promotion

          without digging into taxpayer pockets. 

          </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

          second amendment would strike a provision from the bill that would

          again allow the mink industry to receive benefits through MAP.&nbsp; The FY99 Omnibus Appropriations bill effectively eliminated

          the subsidy to the United States Mink Export Development Council or

          any mink industry trade association.&nbsp;

          However, this year’s Agriculture Appropriations bill would

          allow this subsidy to return, wasting millions in taxpayer dollars. 

          </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Miller

          (R-FL) Amendment</u>:&nbsp; The

          USDA’s sugar program subsidizes sugar producers and processors

          through price supports, non-recourse loans, and severe restrictions on

          imports.&nbsp; The 1996 Farm

          Bill also guarantees sugar prices at 18 cents a pound, regardless of

          the world market price.&nbsp; As

          a result, the program has helped generate a huge surplus and can no

          longer guarantee these unrealistically high prices.&nbsp;

          The solution the USDA has proposed is to buyback hundreds of

          thousands of tons of sugar in an effort to stabilize prices – all at

          taxpayer expense.&nbsp; Recently,

          the USDA purchased 132,000 tons of sugar at a cost to taxpayers of

          more than $54 million, and more buybacks could cost taxpayers upwards

          of $100 million.&nbsp; Representative

          Miller’s (R-FL) amendment would limit the amount of money

          used to purchase excess sugar cane and sugar beets to the $54 million

          that the USDA has already spent.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Sanford

          (R-SC) Amendment</u>:&nbsp; This

          amendment would eliminate $10 million in payments to wool and mohair

          farmers authorized in the recently passed crop insurance bill.&nbsp;

          The entire wool and mohair program was originally phased out by

          Congress and the Administration beginning in 1994, but was revived in

          the FY99 Omnibus Appropriations bill. The payments proposed in the crop insurance bill would simply

          make up for low market prices, and would not be for natural disaster
