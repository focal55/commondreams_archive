- May 9 - As Congress considers key legislation about trade relations with Africa and

China, the following policy analysts are available for interviews:

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EZEKIEL PAJIBO, <a href="mailto:pajibo@afjn.org">pajibo@afjn.org</a>, <a href="http://afjn.cua.edu">http://afjn.cua.edu</a><br>

Senior policy analyst with the Africa Faith and Justice Network, Pajibo

said today: "This Africa trade bill will not improve the conditions for most

people in Africa. It fails to provide for desperately needed debt

cancellation, poverty reduction or an end to structural adjustment policies

of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It will, however,

help major multinational corporations. It doesn't lay the basis for Africa

to have a manufacturing capability. Instead, it continues with what has been

happening: Africa being a source of raw materials." Pajibo added: "Unjust

economic policies lead to war in Africa. Poor economies lead to unstable

political conditions. The conflicts in Sierra Leone and in Angola and the

Democratic Republic of the Congo are largely funded by diamond sales, which

are controlled by criminally minded individuals. What the U.S. can do is

constrain those sales."

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LORI WALLACH, <a href="mailto:lwallach@citizen.org">lwallach@citizen.org</a>, <a href="http://www.tradewatch.org">http://www.tradewatch.org</a><br>

Director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch and co-author of "Whose

Trade Organization? Corporate Globalization and the Erosion of Democracy,"

Wallach said today: "The Clinton administration's China trade bill asks

Congress to abdicate its annual oversight of China's aberrant record on

human rights and religious freedom. The Clinton administration is trying to

sugar-coat its PNTR [permanent normal trade relations] for China proposal

with side agreements which do nothing to cover the flaws of PNTR. The

unenforceable Levin provisions would provide no incentive for Beijing to

change its behavior. Given that the administration and GOP leaders oppose

any parallel measure with real teeth, the very fact that Levin's proposal

might be acceptable demonstrates how meaningless it really is. It duplicates

measures that currently fail to improve conditions in China on human rights

and on trade. The Levin proposal would rely on United Nations sanction for

enforcement, yet U.S. attempts to censure China at the UN High Commission on

Human Rights have failed every year for the past decade."

</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Co-director of Food First and co-editor of "America Needs Human Rights,"

Mittal said today: "China entering the World Trade Organization will hurt

U.S. workers and devastate Chinese workers. NAFTA has eliminated more than

400,000 U.S. jobs. It is these trade agreements and not China which pose a

threat to the U.S. worker. China has provided a lot of economic human rights

for its people, but in the WTO they will be left at the mercy of the market,

which is what devastated Russia. We should not be xenophobic against the

Chinese, but we should recall that the U.S. has, in many instances, acted

like the rogue nations it criticizes."
