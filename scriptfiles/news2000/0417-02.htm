- April 17 - Despite escalating police violence in downtown Washington 

DC, at least three thousand nonviolent protestors have left the Ellipse 

and are headed for The World Bank.  On this second day of nonviolent direct 

action against the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, protestors 

remain determined to highlight the central role of these institutions in 

increased poverty, human and labor rights violations and environmental 

devastation worldwide.



<p>Field reports indicate that close to a hundred protestors have been arrested 

already this morning – in some cases the arrests have appeared arbitrary 

and without cause.  At 7AM, a crowd of several hundred protestors was pepper 

sprayed by DC police, in what observers described as "an unnecessary use 

of force."  Throughout the morning, observers report that DC police have 

taken a markedly more aggressive stance than yesterday.



<p>"The DC police have gone too far this morning," said Beka Economopoulos 

of the Mobilization for Global Justice  "They have militarized the nation's 

capitol in defense of the economic interests of the World Bank and IMF. 

 Its clear that overwhelming force is the only thing enabling these meetings 

to go forward, and these institutions to survive, around the world today. 

 Like our brothers and sisters engaged in global struggles against the 

World Bank and IMF, this kind of force only strengthens our resolve.  We 

will not back down until sunshine floods every dark corner of the global 

financial system, and power is restored to all the people."



<p>Today's actions are the culmination of a week of protests against the World 

Bank and IMF.  Tens of thousands of protesters traveled to Washington DC 

from across the U.S. and around the world to draw attention the misguided 

policies of these institutions.  From the proposed Chad-Cameroon Pipeline 

where the World Bank will be partnering with repressive military regimes 

to open ancient rainforests to development, to the IMF structural adjustment 

policies in Brazil, which have resulted in the slashing of health, educational 

and other social programs, these policies have run in direct opposition 

to the mission statement claims of these financial institutions.



<p>The organizations of the Mobilization for Global Justice, and the hundreds 

of other environmental, labor and human rights organizations that have 

participated in these massive organizing efforts have vowed to continue 

in solidarity.



<p>"All around the world, whenever these global institutions gather, global 

citizens will come together to protest their destructive polices," said 

Steve Kretzmann of the Mobilization for Global Justice. "The globalization 

we look forward to is one that is democratic, serves and benefits all peoples, 

and protects the environment, not one that serves only trans-national corporations."
