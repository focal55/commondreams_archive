- June 26 - It's the dispute with more passion than the Democrats vs. the Republicans, more staying power than the Hatfields vs. the McCoys, and even more zealous partisans than many ancient, longstanding battles over land and family honor. It's the age-old drama that pits Biblical literalism against evolution – and it will be center stage next month in Lawrence, Kansas, where the dispute is not just history but current events, as well.

      On July 12, 75 years almost to the day since teacher John Scopes went on trial in Dayton Tennessee, the two combatants in the 1925 "Monkey Trial" – prosecuting attorney William Jennings Bryan and counsel for the defense Clarence Darrow – will once again square off. This time their audience will be not a jury of 12 Tennesseeans but 2000 Kansans at the Lied Center on the campus of the University of Kansas in Lawrence.

<p>

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>At an 11:30 news conference in Lawrence on June 27, People For the American Way Foundation, will unveil details of the special event, titled "ORIGINS: Exploring the Evolution-Creationism Dispute through Drama and Debate." The news conference will be held in the Lied Center's Seymour Gallery, upper lobby.</b>

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"ORIGINS" consists, as the title suggests, of two parts. The first is a historically accurate recreation of scenes from the Scopes trial in a new theatrical production based on the original trial transcript and eyewitness news accounts of the proceedings. The part of Bryan will be played by <b>Ed Asner</b>, a Kansan by birth who is perhaps best known to audiences across the nation as the tough-talking, big-hearted newsman "Lou Grant." Darrow will be played by <b>James Cromwell</b>, whose many film credits include such recent titles as "L.A. Confidential" (Chief of Detectives, Dudley Smith) and "Babe" (Farmer Hoggett). Other participants include <b>Susan Lowenberg</b> of LA Theatre Works, <b>Richard Masur</b> (One Day at a Time), <b>Shirley Knight</b> (As Good As It Gets), <b>Harold Gould</b> (Patch Adams), and <b>Frederic Forrest</b> (Apocalypse Now).

    </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

      The second part of the "ORIGINS" presentation will be a discussion and debate on today's dispute over evolution and creationism, a hot topic in Kansas as well as many other states and communities around the nation. The panelists, who will include national and Kansas experts, will represent all sides of the issue.
