- April 20 - The Environmental Protection Agency today responded to a Greenpeace lawsuit by hiding behind bad science produced by the industries the agency is supposed to regulate. The Greenpeace lawsuit, filed by attorneys from the Center for Food Safety in February 1999, challenged EPA's decision to allow the release of genetically modified insect resistant "Bt" (Bacillus thuringiensis) crops.

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The EPA should stop polluters before the environment is threatened," said Greenpeace

Genetic Engineering Specialist Charles Margulis. "But the agency's response today shows that they will risk ecological havoc for the benefit of biotech companies. We will continue to fight EPA's willingness to fiddle with unsound corporate science while monarch butterflies die.' 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

On Tuesday, a team of Swiss scientists from EcoStrat released a report showing that EPA used inappropriate and scientifically questionable studies in approving the first GMO insect-resistant corn for U.S. growers. The report showed that EPA accepted industry studies despite design that was so questionable that there was virtually no chance that adverse effects would be observed. In today's response, EPA cites other studies found by EcoStrat to be highly questionable scientifically.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

In EPA's response to Greenpeace today, the agency reasserts that "EPA is not aware of any data or information indicating that any unreasonable adverse effects [on non-target insects] have occurred." Yet the agency's response acknowledges that Bt crops could pose risks to monarch butterflies. EPA also admits that when it allowed Bt corn on the market, the agency had concluded that threatened butterflies would not be at risk.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

In January, Federal District Court Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer in Washington, D.C., ruled that he would "hold [EPA's] feet to the fire" over the GMO issue and ordered the agency to respond to Greenpeace's charges within 60 days. EPA sent its response to Greenpeace just this afternoon, as the agency failed to make the original deadline. 

</font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We consider EPA's response today to be non-responsive," said Joseph Mendelson, lead attorney from the Center for Food Safety. "As long as the agency continues to put the environment at risk, we will continue to fight."

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Last February, Greenpeace and a coalition of over 70 plaintiffs sued the EPA, charging it with the wanton destruction of the world's most important biological pesticide-Bt. The effectiveness of that pesticide is threatened by splicing the bacteria into GMO crops.

The extensively peer-reviewed EcoStrat report, "Review on Non-Target Organisms and Transgenic Bt Plants," was commissioned by Greenpeace and reviews tests submitted by the biotech companies Novartis and Mycogen to determine whether their GMO corn could harm non-target insects.
