- February 18 - When Hans von Sponeck, the United Nations Humanitarian

Coordinator in Iraq resigned on 13 February, he sounded a wake-up

call to the world that a humanitarian disaster is unfolding in

Iraq. But he is not alone. He is the second Baghdad-based Assistant

Secretary General to resign: a powerful repudiation of the UN's

sanctions policy and the oil-for-food program. His predecessor

Denis Halliday resigned in 1998. 

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

On the day following von Sponeck's resignation, Jutta Burghardt,

head of the World Food Program (WFP) in Iraq also resigned her

post. Her resignation further highlights the frustration of the

humanitarian community. 

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The World Food Program is the United Nations agency that directly

distributes food to the 3 million Iraqis living in the north.

The project in Iraq represent the largest WFP program in the world.

It operates within the oil-for-food program that allows Iraq to

sell oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies

for the Iraqi people. The program is governed by tough U.N. sanctions

imposed on the country since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The principled position taken by these career United Nations civil

servants illustrates the failure of the Security Council to address

the humanitarian disaster in Iraq. The oil-for-food program has

been a failure. 

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Instead of lifting the sanctions, the new resolution passed by

the Security Council in December may ease the sanctions only after

new weapons inspectors are satisfied with their visits to the

country. In the views of these two officials the new resolution

is hopelessly inadequate, and will do little to reverse the deprivations

caused by the sanctions.

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

According to Kathy Bergen, Coordinator of the Middle East Peace

Building Unit at AFSC, &quot;the US gains nothing by standing

by a failed policy. It should now move toward the rapid lifting

of the economic sanctions while working for a zone free of weapons

of mass destruction in the Middle East. As the principal supplier

of arms to the Middle East, the US must end its policy of transferring

arms to the Middle East and elsewhere.&quot;

</font>

     <p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The loss of life inflicted on ordinary Iraqis by the sanctions

is incompatible with the United Nations Charter,&quot; says Denis

Halliday former Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq who resigned

in October 1998 to protest the continued use of sanctions. &quot;The

continuation of these sanctions in full knowledge of their deadly

consequences constitutes genocide.&quot;

</font>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

AFSC applauds Hans von Sponeck's statement upon his resignation:

&quot;I'm not at all alone in my view that we have reached a point

where it is no longer acceptable that we are keeping our mouths

shut.&quot; We respect those willing to take a principled position

on the calamitous misuse of sanctions in Iraq.
