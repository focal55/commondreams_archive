- June 9 -  The following was



released today by Environmental Defense, National Environmental



Trust, Natural Resources Defense Council, Union of Concerned



Scientists and World Wildlife Fund:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leading science and environmental groups today lauded the



draft of Climate Change and Our Nation, which will be



released for public review on Monday, June 12, as a balanced



assessment of the potential impacts of climate variability and change



on the United States. At the same time, the groups warned that the



country should view the report as a wake-up call for Americans to



take climate change seriously, and to launch significant efforts to



reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to hedge against possible



negative impacts and surprises.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Places that Americans love like Florida's coral reefs and the



alpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains could suffer greatly from



global warming, according to the report. America's alarm bells



should go off today," said Jennifer Morgan, director of the



World Wildlife Fund's Climate Change Campaign. "The National



Assessment shows that now more than ever the U.S. must act to



protect its national treasures."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The draft report, which should be released on June 12 for public



comment, reveals that natural ecosystems are the most vulnerable to



the harmful effects of climate change because they have very limited



options to adapt to these changes and because they are already



stressed through air and water pollution, habitat fragmentation, and



overuse.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Major alteration of natural ecosystems due to a changing climate



is particularly significant because our lives and our economy depend



on the sustained bounty of our Nation's lands, waters, and native



plant and animal communities," the report stated.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the key findings of the report are:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- According to the climate models used in the assessments,



temperatures will rise 5-10 degrees F on average in the next



100 years if trends in greenhouse gas emissions continue, but



increases will vary somewhat from one U.S. region to the next.



It is also very likely that more rain will come in heavy downpours,



increasing the risk of floods.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Ecosystems are highly vulnerable to the projected rate and



magnitude of climate change. The goods and services lost through the



disappearance or fragmentation of certain ecosystems are likely to

be



costly or impossible to replace.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Throughout the U.S., water is likely to become one of the key



concerns in coming decades: droughts, floods, declining snow packs



and water quality, and possibly greater water use conflicts could



become even more common problems than they are today.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Climate change and the resulting rise in sea level are likely



to worsen threats to buildings, roads, powerlines and other



infrastructure along the coast. Sea-level rise is very likely to



cause the loss of some barrier beaches, islands, and wetlands, and



worsen storm surges and flooding during storms.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Overall, U.S. crop productivity is likely to increase over the



next few decades, but the gains will not be uniform across the



nation. Falling prices and competition are likely to stress some



farmers. And pests, droughts and floods could reduce some of the



benefits from higher temperatures, precipitation and carbon dioxide.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Similarly, forest productivity is likely to increase in some



areas over the next few decades, but fires, insects, droughts and



diseases will possibly decrease productivity. Climate change will



cause long-term shifts in forest species, such as sugar maples moving



north out of the Northeast or economically important soft wood



species moving from the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report covers all regions of the country, and assesses the



potential impacts of climate variability and change on water,



agriculture, human health, forests, coastal areas, and marine



resources.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This report brings the meaning of global climate change home to



every American," said Dr. Susanne Moser of the Union of Concerned



Scientists. "Even if the impacts ultimately manifest differently from



what the report projects, everyone will experience some changes, and



everyone should know that climate change is not science fiction. In



some regions, like Alaska, the impacts of warming are here, now."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report consists of an overview and a much longer foundation



document, and is a snapshot of the current state of knowledge



produced through a series of regional and sectoral assessments,



supplemented through the peer-reviewed literature. The report release



was preceded by an extensive, multistage peer-review process



involving more than 300 scientific and technical experts throughout



the country, and overseen by a Blue Ribbon Panel of renowned



scientists.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The so-called National Assessment Synthesis Team, a group of



14 climate change impacts experts, who authored the report,



was convened by the President's Council of Advisors on Science



and Technology. Federal agencies, under the guidance of the



Office of Science and Technology Policy, also reviewed the report.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Climate change is already happening," said Dr. Janine Bloomfield,



senior scientist at Environmental Defense, "Because greenhouse gasses



stay in the earth's atmosphere for decades, the time for action is



now. Reducing emissions is the most important action we can take now



to minimize damage to people, ecosystems, and economies."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report does not cover the current state of climate science,



the question of human causation, or how heat-trapping gases can be



reduced but instead focuses exclusively on the potential impacts of



global warming, given selected climate change scenarios. It



identifies regions and sectors most vulnerable to climate change,



opportunities to adapt to likely changes, and the most critical



information needs for the U.S. to be better positioned to predict



climate change impacts. "No matter how aggressively emissions are



reduced, the world will still experience some climate change," the



report stated. This is because elevated concentrations of greenhouse



gases will remain in the atmosphere for decades as the climate system



responds only slowly to changes in human inputs.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The assessment shows that many of the country's distinct natural



features could deteriorate as a result of changing climate," said Dr.



Susan Subak, a senior research associate at the Natural Resources



Defense Council. "Whether we're talking about fisheries and



recreational areas on the coasts, or the habitats of America's



mountains and deserts, rising temperatures will put further stress

on



our natural areas."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This report is yet another blow to the global warming naysayers.



It confirms the validity of the science and the seriousness of the



impacts on human health, our economy and our environment," said



Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust. "And



it demonstrates that the current international negotiations in Bonn



and the November negotiations in The Hague are critical."
