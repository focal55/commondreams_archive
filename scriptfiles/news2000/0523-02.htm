- May 23 - President Clinton and Vice President Gore hail the U.S.-China agreement 

          on WTO accession "a hundred percent win" for America that will increase 

          U.S. exports to China and create jobs for American workers. Nice words, 

          but they made the very same claims for NAFTA. They were wrong then, 

          and they are wrong now. </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On this issue of critical importance to working people - one that could 

          cost hundreds of thousands of American workers their jobs - President 

          Clinton and Vice President Gore once again have sided with multinational 

          corporations against workers here and abroad. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the past weeks, proponents of giving China PNTR have portrayed 

          the same multinational corporations who today are exploiting the Chinese 

          government's well-documented brutal repression of basic human and workers' 

          rights to fatten profits as the champions for a more free and open Chinese 

          society. Meanwhile, the labor movement's insistence that the Chinese 

          government demonstrate progress on human and workers' rights before 

          the U.S. Congress permanently gives up its power of annual review is 

          dismissed as selfish, myopic, and worse. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are deeply disappointed that Vice President Gore has failed to speak 

          out against these cynical attacks on the labor movement and our partners 

          in this fight. Instead, he has tried to have it both ways on China PNTR. 

          One moment, presidential candidate Gore is telling the labor movement 

          that he believes human rights, workers' rights, and environmental protections 

          should be included in core trade agreements; the next, Vice President 

          Gore is holding hands with the profiteers of the world and singing the 

          praises of the U.S.-China WTO accession agreement while lobbying for 

          PNTR for China. And, obviously, we cannot turn to Republican candidate 

          George W. Bush; his positions on issues of concern to working families 

          are far worse. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America's working families need and deserve a president they can count 

          on to stand with them on their tough issues, not just the easy ones. 

          That's why we have no choice but to actively explore alternatives to 

          the two major political parties. It's time to forget about party labels 

          and instead focus on supporting candidates, such as Ralph Nader, who 

          will take a stand based on what is right, not what big money dictates. 

          Supporting those who support us is our political agenda, not just a 

          slogan.</font>
