- January 26 - Four weeks ago, Internet toy giant eToys announced to the press that it 

was "moving away" from its lawsuit against European art group etoy in 

response to the torrent of public outrage. As the weeks went by without 

further action, however, many activists decided that eToys' words had 

represented a typical corporate ploy to derail opposition, and that the 

company had no intention of actually dropping the suit.

<p>

Activists quickly renewed their campaigns against eToys. RTMark 

initiated two new campaigns to drive eToys' stock price yet further 

down (it has now sunk well below its opening value of $20 per share, 

after a high of $67 reached the day the protests began), and a new 

community platform, <a href="http://www.toywar.com" target="_blank" style="color: #000000">http://www.toywar.com</a>, gathered a "toy army" of 

1400 activists poised to perform "operations" on command.

<p>

The strongest attack to date was scheduled to coincide with eToys' 

earnings announcement on Thursday. Today, just in time, eToys 

formally dropped its case against etoy "without prejudice"--a phrase 

that means either party is still free to attack the other. eToys has 

also formally agreed to pay etoy's court costs and other expenses 

incurred as a result of the lawsuit.

<p>

"A precedent has now finally been set in stone," said RTMark 

spokesperson Ray Thomas. "eToys thought it could act like corporations 

typically do, but it had no idea how the Internet works. Now e-commerce 

corporations have a choice: either obtain a legal stranglehold on the 

Internet, so that this kind of defensive reaction is no longer possible, 

or behave decently towards the humans who use this medium for purposes 

other than profit."

<p>

"This is the Brent Spar of e-commerce," said Reinhold Grether, an 

Internet researcher and a mastermind of the anti-eToys campaigns. "Just 

as the petroleum industry learned it had to listen to environmentalists, 

so e-commerce companies have now learned that the Internet doesn't 

belong to them, and they can't do whatever they want with it." (See 

<a href="http://rtmark.com/shell" target="_blank" style="color: #000000">http://rtmark.com/shell</a> for more about the Brent Spar, and 

<a href="http://www.hygrid.de/etoyrhiz.html" target="_blank" style="color: #000000">http://www.hygrid.de/etoyrhiz.html</a> for more comments by Grether.)

<p>

"eToys will try to paint this as a misunderstanding, as just a simple 

error that has now been corrected," wrote etoy in a prepared statement. 

"But this is not what happened. They tried to destroy us, and that got 

them into very big trouble. They wanted to drop their case 'with 

prejudice,' because they fear further attacks and trademark battles, 

but now they see they have no choice at all in the matter. It is a 

total victory."

<p>

WHAT NOW?

<p>

Even though etoy has recovered its domain, the etoy Fund will not be 

retired, said RTMark spokesperson Thomas. Each project's discussion 

board will continue to function, and the resources of the etoy Fund 

pages will continue to be accessible for use and research.

<p>

"We hope that this campaign continues to serve as a reminder to people 

of what corporations do when left to their own devices, and as a 

reminder to corporations of what they cannot do, at least on the 

Internet," said Thomas. "We also hope people continue expressing their 

anger at eToys, if they so choose. There are many ways to embarrass and 

further damage this company--the Nazi figurine eToys advertises could lead 

to a boycott by Jewish groups, for example."

<p>

Another immediate option would be a class-action lawsuit by eToys 

investors, said lawyer and RTMark member Rita Mae Rakoczi. "It could 

convincingly be argued that eToys, being an Internet company, should 

have known what it was getting into, and has seriously mismanaged its 

stockholders' money. If etoy's possession of etoy.com is so dangerous--

as perhaps it really is--why didn't eToys choose a different name for 

the company when they had the chance? And why did they choose to pursue 

in an openly hostile manner an art group best known for a piece called 

the 'Digital Hijack,' which made sophisticated use of technology to 

playfully attack users' browsers? It wouldn't take an Einstein to 

predict trouble."

<p>

"If eToys stumbled into this through sheer stupidity and negligence," 

Rakoczi continued, "it could be liable to investors for part of the $4 

billion in value that's been lost as a consequence. A successful 

lawsuit could even entail eToys losing its own trademark, which would 

likely mean the end of the company." RTMark has set up a page 

containing links to resources on class action lawsuits against 

corporate managements (http://rtmark.com/etoysclassaction.html).

<p>

"Things on the Internet don't go away," said etoy in its statement. 

"'Brick and mortar' corporations do this sort of thing and then bury 

it--but this will always be there when you search for information on 

eToys. It will always be very visible what bastards they were. They can 

never recover from this." The 1400 "Toywar soldiers" mustered by 

<a href="http://www.toywar.com" target="_blank" style="color: #000000">http://www.toywar.com</a> will remain on high alert, according to the 

platform's operators, and are prepared to spring into action at the 

slightest indication of further aggression by eToys.

<p>

"And Network Solutions had better be careful, too," etoy said. "We will 

not tolerate any delay in the reinstallation of the etoy.com DNS 

entries." Network Solutions, the company in charge of Internet domains, 

illegally terminated etoy's e-mail shortly after the November 29 

injunction, although no such move was required by the order. (See 

http://rtmark.com/etoyvaticano.html for another example of illegal 

behavior by Network Solutions.)

<p>

BACKGROUND AND TIMELINE (see also http://rtmark.com/etoyline.html)

<p>

Late last year, eToys attempted to buy etoy.com from European art group 

etoy, and offered upwards of $500,000 in cash and stock options for 

the domain. etoy turned down the offer, so on November 29, 1999, eToys 

obtained a court injunction preventing etoy from operating a website at

www.etoy.com, which had been registered before eToys even existed. To 

obtain the injunction eToys told the judge that etoy.com was confusing 

customers, and furthermore that it contained pornography and calls to 

violence. etoy.com had never made any reference to eToys or toys, nor 

featured anything resembling pornography or calls to violence.

<p>

During the subsequent weeks, activists attacked eToys by a variety of 

means that have been widely credited with contributing to the 70% 

decline in the value of eToys stock--a decline that began the same day 

as the protests.

<p>

The Dec. 15-25 Virtual Sit-in crippled the eToys servers, as <a href="http://cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/9912/17/mlld.00.html" target="_blank" style="color: #000000">CNN 

reported</a>, and 

prompted eToys to file a restraining order against one of the 

organizations responsible for it, and to threaten another activist 

anonymously.

<p>

Simultaneously, the Disinvest! campaign filled eToys investment boards 

and other outlets with messages about the situation. Many investors 

responded by dumping their eToys stock. Even those who refused to see 

a link between activist attacks and the eToys stock fall were at a loss 

to explain how it could lose so much money, so consistently, on 

consistently good financial news. Some suspected foul play by eToys 

management, and the possibility of a class-action lawsuit was raised.

<p>

Finally, on December 29, eToys announced it was "moving away" from its 

lawsuit in response to public outrage. At first, etoy and the activists 

were delighted, and a formal counterpart to the statement was expected 

from hour to hour. Then, when nothing happened for days and then weeks, 

it became clear that eToys' announcement had been an empty verbal 

concession it had no intention of making concrete--a typical corporate 

ploy to derail activist momentum.

<p>

Activists quickly renewed their campaign to damage eToys. Perhaps 

startled by the endurance of its opponents, and nervous about further 

attacks and proof of instability during the week it is to announce its 

quarterly earnings, eToys today--at 15:20 Pacific Standard Time, to be

exact--finally backed down on paper, ceding full rights to etoy.com on

etoy's terms, without precondition and with payment of court costs and 

other expenses.

<br>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;

<br>

RTMark, which is in no way associated with etoy, aims to publicize the 

widespread corporate abuse of democratic institutions like courts and 

elections. To this end it solicits and distributes funding for 

"sabotage projects." Groups of such projects are called "mutual funds" 

in order to call attention to one way in which large numbers of people 

come to identify corporate needs as their own. RTMark projects do not 

normally target specific companies; the etoy Fund projects are an 

exception.
