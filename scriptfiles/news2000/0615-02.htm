- June 15 - The following was released



today by Clean Air Trust:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How much money does the chairman of Exxon-Mobil make? Are oil



companies crying wolf when it comes to cleaning up dirty diesel



fuel? What can average citizens do to clean up big, smelly trucks?

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These questions and others will be answered by a new web site,



<a href="http://www.cleanupdiesel.org">http://www.cleanupdiesel.org</a>,

unveiled today by the Clean Air Trust



Education Fund in conjunction with the American Lung Association.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This site is designed to educate the public about the major



health threat posed by diesel trucks and buses and diesel fuel,"



said Paul G. Billings, the Lung Association's assistant vice



president for government relations. "It is also set up to allow the



public to communicate directly with the U.S. Environmental



Protection Agency -- and to tell EPA to clean up dirty diesel trucks



and diesel fuel now."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EPA recently proposed the most sweeping diesel cleanup in



history, calling on new trucks and buses to be up to 95 percent



cleaner than today's new diesel vehicles. To enable advanced



emission controls to work, the EPA also proposed eliminating 97



percent of the sulfur from diesel fuel. (Sulfur is a poison, much



as lead was a poison to catalytic converters in the 1970s.)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Billings noted that the oil industry is vehemently opposed to



the cleanup plan. "Armed with the facts, however, citizens can use



www.cleanupdiesel.org to counter the oil companies' scare tactics,"



Billings noted.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next week the EPA begins hearings on the plan, which it hopes to



make final by the end of this year. The agency is also accepting



public comments until mid-August.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This web site, <a href="http://www.cleanupdiesel.org">www.cleanupdiesel.org</a>,

will allow the public to



send comments to EPA with a simple click of the mouse," said Frank



O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust Education



Fund. He noted www.cleanupdiesel.org also contains: fact sheets



about diesel pollution; links to details of the EPA proposal as



well as comments from President Clinton and EPA Administrator Carol



Browner; the latest on oil industry profits; an analysis by state



and local air pollution regulators of diesel-related cancer; and



links to allied organizations including the Lung Association, the



Natural Resources Defense Council, Clean Air Network, U.S. PIRG,



Union of Concerned Scientists, and state agencies. The site will



be continually updated with new information.
