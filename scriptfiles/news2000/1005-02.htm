- October 5 - The nonprofit Clean Air



Trust today awarded its clean air "Villain of the Month" award



to a "phantom" member of Congress who is trying behind closed



doors to block the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's effort



to clean up dirty diesel trucks and diesel fuel.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Congress completes action on the EPA's budget bill, a



member of the Senate or House secretly advanced an amendment --



clearly written by big polluters -- that would block the EPA



cleanup plan until the National Academy of Sciences completed a



new study of the issue. The amendment was crafted following a



classic special-interest lobbying blitz by the American



Petroleum Institute, the Cummins Engine Company and related



interests.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This amendment has one purpose -- to delay and kill the EPA



cleanup plan," noted Frank O'Donnell, the Clean Air Trust's



executive director. "This dirty-air diversion is being done



entirely in secret. It is time for the phantom author of this



amendment to come clean and debate the issue publicly."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'Donnell noted that most observers have fingered the staff



of Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), who declared at a hearing last



month that he wants Congress to overturn the EPA plan. Inhofe's



staff has denied his involvement in this stealth maneuver.



Another likely collaborator is Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas), House



Majority Whip and a supporter of both the oil industry and Texas



Governor George W. Bush.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are at least two people who could identify the



phantom -- Sen. Kit Bond (R-Mo.) and Rep. James Walsh (R-N.Y.)



and their respective staffs. They chair the Senate and House



subcommittees that write EPA's budget.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The real questions are why is this attack on a major



clean-air proposal being done in secret -- and why are Senator



Bond and Rep. Walsh allowing the miscreant to remain a



dirty-diesel phantom?" O'Donnell added.</font>
