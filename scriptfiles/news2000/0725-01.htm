- July 25 - A doctors' organization



will file a petition tomorrow with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)



requesting an immediate investigation into health claims in "milk



mustache" ads featuring Marc Anthony, Britney Spears, and other



celebrities. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM)



will ask the FTC to investigate whether the National Fluid Milk



Processor Promotion Board, the Milk Industry Foundation, the



International Dairy Foods Association, and Bozell Worldwide, Inc.,

an



advertising agency, have disseminated scientifically unsubstantiated,



purposefully deceptive, and harmful advertising.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new Marc Anthony ad implies that milk can help prevent



osteoporosis in Hispanic Americans. What fans "need to know," the



doctors group says, is that there is little or no evidence that



Hispanic Americans benefit from milk-drinking. To add insult to



injury, the majority of Hispanic Americans-like Asian-, African-, and



Native Americans-are lactose intolerant and experience



gastrointestinal problems from milk.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Latin heartthrob is one of dozens of celebrities whose images



have been exploited to sell milk. A Britney Spears ad advises girls



to get four glasses a day, which add up to 33 grams of fat, including



20 grams of heart-clogging saturated fat. "Britney's ad might as well



be captioned, 'Oops, I did it again-sold out for an unhealthy



product,'" says PCRM president Neal D. Barnard, M.D. Other



celebrities unknowingly contributing to the milk-is-good-for-you myth



include the Dixie Chicks, Larry King, Tyra Banks, and even the



cartoon Simpsons.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The dairy industry continues to whitewash the dangers of cow's



milk," says Dr. Barnard. "The ubiquitous "milk mustache" campaign



makes misleading claims about milk preventing osteoporosis, lowering



blood pressure, and enhancing sports performance. Recent studies,



including the Harvard Nurses' Health Study, have shown that milk



offers no protection against broken bones. And, unlike prescription



drug ads, the "mustache" ads don't reveal the many unwanted



'side-effects' of milk, among them increased risk of prostate and



ovarian cancer, diabetes, obesity, and heart disease.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PCRM's petition is available by contacting Ms. Simon Chaitowitz at



202-686-2210, ext. 309, or via email at simonc@pcrm.org. PCRM doctors



and dietitians are also available for interviews.

Founded in 1985 and based in Washington, D.C., the Physicians



Committee for Responsible Medicine is a nonprofit organization



dedicated to promoting preventive medicine, especially good



nutrition, and higher standards in research. PCRM's membership



includes 5,000 physicians, one of whom was Dr. Benjamin Spock whose



posthumously published "Baby and Child Care" bestseller recommends



against dairy consumption.</font>
