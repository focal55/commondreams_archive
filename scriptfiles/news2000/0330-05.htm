- March 30 - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is playing an early

April Fools&#146; Day joke on American consumers by once again promoting the agency&#146;s

experimental inspection program as a preventive food safety system, Public Citizen and the

<a href="http://www.whistleblower.org/">Government Accountability Project</a> said today. </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pilot project shifts responsibility for ensuring that animals and carcasses

destined for dinner tables are healthy from the USDA&#146;s meat inspectors to the meat

industry. This shift is done by allowing meat processing plants that volunteer to

participate in the program to determine which animals and carcasses are diseased and

should not be used for food. This means that USDA inspectors will closely examine only a

small sample of carcasses instead of examining each carcass, as in the past. Approximately

two dozen plants have volunteered to participate in the program, which began on Oct. 4,

1999.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The USDA today held another in a series of public meetings on the pilot project, called

the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP)-Based Inspection Models Project. At the

meeting, officials promoted the project as a redeployment of resources to better address

health problems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Once again, the USDA is pandering to the meat industry instead of protecting

Americans,&quot; said Wenonah Hauter, director of <a href="http://www.citizen.org/CMEP/">Public Citizen&#146;s

Critical Mass Energy Project</a>. &quot;They call it science-based and give it a long,

complex title. But that won&#146;t fool consumers, who don&#146;t want to eat meat

contaminated with fecal matter, even if it is <a href="http://www.citizen.org/CMEP/rad-food/radfoodindex.htm">irradiated</a>

in an attempt to kill food-borne disease. This tomfoolery is typical of the USDA&#146;s

changes in inspecting meat, and the public won&#146;t buy it. The agency claims it is

doing it to improve safety, but this is all about maximizing profit for the meat

industry.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Added Felicia Nestor, director of the Government Accountability Project&#146;s food

safety program, &quot;The results of the pilot project speak for themselves. Since the

program&#146;s implementation, government sampling is finding more chickens with visible

fecal matter than in the past. April Fools&#146; Day calls for rubber chicken pranks, not

dirty chickens for the public&#146;s consumption.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A recent incident at a Gold Kist, Inc. poultry plant in Alabama confirmed that the

pilot program is problematic. Two Gold Kist plants are closely situated. One uses the old

inspection system, the other the new pilot program. When meat inspectors prevented

diseased chickens from being processed at the plant that has USDA meat inspectors, the

slaughter plant operators sent the diseased chickens to the plant operating under the

pilot project, where they were slaughtered, whistleblower inspectors have told the

Government Accountability Project. The inspectors knew about this but had no authority to

stop it. Some of the meat was destined for school lunches, the inspectors said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the second plant, the chickens were killed at the extraordinary pace of 140 birds

per minute, compared to 91 birds per minute at the plant with traditional inspections.

When animals are killed at that high a rate, it is hard to inspect the birds for disease

and filth.</font>
