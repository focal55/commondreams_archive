- April 10 - To protect the Arctic from climate change and oil spills, four Greenpeace activists attempted to stop the controversial pipelaying operation at BP's Northstar offshore oil project this morning. One activist climbed onto the backhoe laying the pipe and displayed a banner reading "Stop BP's Northstar." The pipelaying operation is currently stopped. Police have now arrested all four Greenpeace activists. 



<p>If completed, the Northstar pipeline will run six miles offshore and will be buried in potentially unstable permafrost soil under an ocean that is frozen solid or in broken ice conditions for ten months of the year. This project represents the first use of this dangerous unproven technology in the Arctic environment, where severe storms are common and huge blocks of ice regularly gouge through the area in which the pipeline is being built. Government estimates have predicted up to a 24 percent chance of a major oil spill (1000 barrels or more) over the 15-year lifetime of the project and acknowledge that oil spills can only be cleaned up 50 percent of the time, due to darkness, severe storms and broken ice conditions. 



<p>"BP Amoco knows that the Northstar project will fuel global warming. It also claims to be concerned about the environment, but the facts tell a different story," said Melanie Duchin Climate Campaigner on the ice at the Greenpeace Camp Sirius, on the Arctic Ocean. "BP Amoco insists on pushing ahead with this project that has a 24 percent chance of despoiling the Arctic and a 100 percent chance of increasing global warming." 



<p>Recent studies by NASA have confirmed that in Polar Regions, global warming has already taken a significant toll as the ice pack melts and marine mammals such as polar bears and walrus lose their habitat and hunting grounds. In the last 40 years the average thickness of the polar pack ice has decreased by 40 percent, and in the last three decades an area the size of the state of Texas has melted away. 



<p>"We are simply asking BP Amoco to live up to its words," said Duchin. "They talk about being a green oil company, but if you just scratch the surface of the thin green veneer there is a lot of very dirty, climate-destroying oil below. If BP Amoco was truly concerned with either the local Arctic environment or the larger global climate they would cancel the Northstar project and shift the resources they plan to spend on Arctic destruction to their solar company to power the renewable energy revolution." 



<p>On Thursday April 13, BP Amoco will hold their Annual General Meeting for their shareholders in London. At this meeting the shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on a resolution which calls on the company to switch away from high-risk, environmentally harmful ventures like Northstar, towards solar and other clean renewable sources of energy. Although BP Amoco has aggressively promoted its solar division as proof it is concerned about global warming, the company actually spends over 100 times more on oil exploration and production. 



<p>If Northstar is allowed to begin oil production, it will open the door for several other offshore drilling projects in the Beaufort Sea, off the Alaskan coast. Greenpeace opposes opening up new oil frontiers because climate scientists warn that the world cannot burn even one-quarter of all known fossil fuels without risking dangerous levels of global warming. The international organization has maintained a protest camp near the Northstar site for the past six weeks.
