- May 25 - We have been waiting for 15 long years for the National Highway Traffic Safety

Administration (NHTSA) to propose a stability standard for vehicles, particularly sports

utility vehicles (SUVs). While we are pleased that the agency has finally acted,

they&#146;ve only done half the job. Rather than issue a minimum safety standard that all

vehicles must meet, NHTSA has chosen to issue only a consumer information rating system,

which will not require safer vehicles. </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today&#146;s action on rollovers is long overdue. In 1986, Rep. Tim Wirth petitioned

the agency to issue a safety standard to limit rollover potential for all vehicles. The

agency refused. In 1991, Congress required NHTSA to conduct rulemaking on rollover

protection. NHTSA started, issuing an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking for rollover

prevention and rollover protection in addition to consumer information. The result? In

1994, NHTSA proposed merely a notice of consumer information -- a weak response from an

agency that had acknowledged the increasing danger of rollovers. Still, nothing became

even of this. The consumer information proposal withered.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, we are facing yet another consumer information proposal that, remarkably,

resembles what Wirth proposed in 1986. It calls for a &quot;static&quot; stability test

that would rate vehicle stability on mathematical measurements of tire-track width and

vehicle height. The test results are to be purely informational. But unfortunately,

consumers won&#146;t have access to this vital information at the point of sale. And

manufacturers won&#146;t be required to do a thing to make their vehicles less prone to

rolling over. Only public embarrassment might cause vehicle redesign.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fifteen years ago, a static test might have made sense as a first step. Today it simply

doesn&#146;t. We need a dynamic test, that is, a real-world test in which a vehicle is

driven on the road. NHTSA could do this quite cheaply by test-driving vehicles destined to

be crashed in the New Car Assessment Program tests.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The need for a strong standard is pressing. Each year, 9,700 people die in rollovers.

Many of these fatal crashes involve sports utility vehicles, which are more prone than

cars to rolling over. In addition, we need rollover crash protection achieved by a strong

roof crush standard, improved door latches and hinges to prevent people being ejected and

a side impact air bag standard.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It&#146;s taken 15 years to get us back here, to square one. At a minimum, this rule

should be issued immediately to be followed by a minimum safety standard to prevent any

more tragic, unnecessary deaths.</font>
