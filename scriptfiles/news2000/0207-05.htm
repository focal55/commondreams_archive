- February 7 - Georgia's death rate

for heat-related illness is one of the 10 highest in the nation. As



greenhouse gases warm the earth, residents of Georgia can expect



even more extremely hot days with a corresponding increase in



heatstroke, heart attack and stroke. Asthma and other respiratory



diseases will dramatically increase. Extreme weather events such as



hurricanes and tornadoes will become more frequent and more



intense.

<p>With more frequent storms and floods, Georgians can expect to

see more drownings, electrocutions and other accidential deaths, as



well as diarrhea from contaminated drinking water. Insects and



rodents will multiply, increasing the incidence of diseases such as



encephalitis and malaria. Sea level rise will impact Georgia's



coastal communities. Higher surface temperatures may stimulate the



growth of poisonous "red tides" algae which is eaten by fish and



shellfish and transmitted to humans. Health costs will also rise as



climate change takes its toll on Georgia's large uninsured



population and elderly residents on Medicare.

<p>These and other consequences of global warming are described in

"Death by Degrees: The Emerging Health Crisis of Climate Change in



Georgia," a 30-page report released today by Physicians for Social



Responsibility (PSR), a nonprofit organization representing 16,000



health professionals nationwide.

<p>"We have just ended the hottest decade on record," said Dr.

Robert K. Musil, executive director of PSR, who released the Death



by Degrees report today at a press conference at the Capitol



Building in Atlanta. "The death rate for asthma has tripled over



the past 20 years. Decisive action is needed now to protect human



health. The number one priority is to reduce the burning of fossil



fuels, especially by coal-burning power plants and automobiles."

<p>The report lays out specific opportunities for personal and

political actions needed to achieve this goal. The report on



Georgia is the second report in a planned series of 18



state-specific reports in which PSR describes the effects that



rising world temperatures will have on local communities. Free



copies of the report are available to the public through the PSR



national office.
