- March 23 - Top

          leaders of Congress are cosponsoring a birthday celebration for TV

          preacher Pat Robertson despite the religious broadcaster's record of

          religious and political extremism.</font>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">House

          Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), House Majority Leader Dick Armey

          (R-Texas) and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) are among

          the &quot;Inner Circle Sponsors&quot; of the Pat Robertson 70th

          Birthday Celebration, scheduled for March 24 at the Washington Hilton

          in Washington, D.C.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other

          &quot;Inner Circle Sponsors&quot; include U.S. Sen. John Ashcroft

          (R-Mo.), House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas), U.S. Sen. Jesse

          Helms (R-N.C.) and U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.). Top officials

          from Robertson's home state also are well represented, including Gov.

          Jim Gilmore, Lieutenant Gov. John Hager and Attorney General Mark

          Earley.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans

          United for Separation of Church and State condemned the congressional

          endorsement of the TV preacher. Said AU's Executive Director Barry W.

          Lynn, &quot;Pat Robertson makes Bob Jones III look tolerant, yet major

          leaders of Congress still line up to kiss his ring and toss him

          flowers. What a disgrace!&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn

          charged that Robertson's power in Congress and Republican political

          circles has reached new heights even though his Christian Coalition

          has waned in influence and his rhetoric has remained extreme.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Examples

          of Robertson's record include:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*

          According to Robertson, a centuries-old Satanic conspiracy controls

          world events. In his book, <i>The New World Order</i>, he claimed

          Presidents George Bush and Jimmy Carter are agents of a &quot;tightly

          knit cabal whose goal is nothing less than a new order for the human

          race under the domination of Lucifer and his followers.&quot; He

          claims Jews were admitted to the conspiracy through the Masonic lodge

          in France in 1782.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*

          Robertson has expressed open contempt for groups he dislikes. He once

          said on his television program, &quot;You say you're supposed to be

          nice to the Episcopalians and the Presbyterians and the Methodists and

          this, that and the other thing. Nonsense. I don't have to be nice to

          the spirit of the Antichrist.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*

          On another occasion, Robertson said, &quot;Many of those people

          involved with Adolf Hitler were Satanists, many of them were

          homosexuals. The two things seem to go together.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*

          In a fund-raising letter issued during a campaign to defeat an equal

          rights amendment in Iowa, Robertson wrote, &quot;The feminist agenda

          is not about equal rights for women. It is about a socialist,

          anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their

          husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism

          and become lesbians.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*

          Last year, Robertson advocated changing U.S. foreign policy to allow

          for assassination of foreign leaders. Admitting that the change

          &quot;sounds somewhat Machiavellian and evil,&quot; he nonetheless

          said, &quot;[I]t's the intelligent thing to do and I don't see

          anything un-Christian about it.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*

          In 1998 Robertson warned that the city of Orlando, Fla., might face

          divine wrath for allowing a gay group to display rainbow flags from

          city light poles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He said

          it might bring about terrorist bombs, earthquakes, tornadoes and

          &quot;possibly a meteor.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Observed

          AU's Lynn, &quot;Robertson's extremist track record is clear.

          Top-ranking members of Congress involved with this event ought to

          cancel their dinner plans.&quot;</font></p>
