<p>DETAILS:

<br>

As the national elections season begins, the Green Party gears

up for action.

<p>On Thursday, Feb. 3, the Electoral Action Working Group of the

Greens/Green Party, USA and the Chicago Green Party will open for



the Greens Electoral Action Resource Service (GEARS) Center.

<p>Located in the Chicago Loop at 202 S. State St., the GEARS

Center will be the touchstone of independent and coordinated



campaigns of Green Party through the United States. The GEARS



Center 15th floor office is staffed to further the work of the



Electoral Action Committees objectives of networking the more than



70 current Green Party Officeholders through GONet Green



Officeholders Network as well as provide support for the Green



Party candidates. GONet is a program of GEARS. The GEARS Center



will be the legislative research bureau for Green-elected officials



and candidates.

<p>In addition, the GEARS Center will be a resource for achieved

Green public policy accomplishments and plans. "In the coming



election cycle, GEARS will be vital to spreading the Green Party



message of social justice and environmental concerns," said Karen



Harris, the GEARS Center office manager. While the main office of



Greens/Green Party, USA are located in Lawrence, Mass., the GEARS



Center expands the organization capacity and focuses our work,"



said Harris.

<p>"There are many people that support the ideals of the Greens but

have not known how to reach us, or where to sign up. GEARS will be

a



place that volunteers interested in election work can contact GEARS



and get connected with local campaigns in their area or national



efforts," said Marc Loveless, chairperson, Greens/Green Party, USA

Electoral Action Working Group. "We don't have the problems of the



major parties or current media darlings. Our objectives are clear



from the grassroots up. From sea to sea and providences beyond we



will change American public policy," said Loveless. "We will be an



incubator for Green campaigns and programs and then take those



programs right where they matter: to the people," said Loveless.

<p>The Green Party has been organized in the United States since

the 1980s. The Greens/Green Party, USA is active with International



Green Party associations and dialogues throughout the world. Since



then, more than 100 people have been elected to public office as



Greens. Most serve on local townships, cities, county boards and



governing bodies of school educational boards and councils. In



1996, the Green Party candidate for president was consumer activist



Ralph Nader.

<p>This year, the Greens will choose from a field of four candidates

for the Green Party presidential nomination, including: Jello



Biafra (Eric Boucher), lead singer of the rock group Dead Kennedys;



Stephen Gasken, activist and author of such publications as



"Cannabis Spirituality"; Dr. Joel Koval, college professor and



former Green Party New York U.S. Senate candidate; and Ralph



Nader, national consumer activist and attorney. In addition,



the Greens and the GEARS Center will be encouraging Congressional



candidates through the country. Districts and contact information



for all national candidates will be available through the GEARS



Center, as well as information on other national Green activities.

<p>The GEARS Center is the Greens nationally getting our collective

act together.
