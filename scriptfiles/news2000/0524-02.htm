-  May 24 - Bluewater Network and the National Parks and Conservation Association (NPCA), in conjunction with several other environmental groups, released today the results of a national poll showing that 59 percent of Americans support the National Park Service's (NPS) recent decision to phase out recreational snowmobile use from the entire National Park System. "The poll confirms that the public wants the Park Service to follow its legal obligation to protect National Park resources. Congress should join the overwhelming majority of Americans and support the NPS decision to adhere to the law," said Sean Smith, Public Lands Director for Bluewater Network and a former Yellowstone Ranger. The decision is slated for review by both the House and Senate in committee hearings on Thursday, May 25, 2000.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since NPS's announcement of the decision in late April, the White House has received over 20,000 comments supporting the system-wide phase-out and continues to receive at least 1,000 favorable comments per day. Snowmobiles' severe adverse effects on park resources such as air quality, water and soil quality, wildlife, natural quiet, and visitor health, safety and experience left NPS in violation of both its legal mandate under the Organic Act to "leave [park resources] unimpaired for future generations," and Executive Order 11644. Only 29 percent of those polled opposed the phase-out.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The NPS decision to phase out snowmobiles came in response to a petition filed by Bluewater Network and a coalition of 67 environmental organizations, and was supported by extensive study of the effects of recreational snowmobile use on park resources and visitor experience. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), upon review of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks' Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS), found that replacing snowmobile use with a mass-transit snowcoach system was the only legal alternative to the pollution, health and safety problems wrought by snowmobiles. EPA remarked, "We would like to point out that this DEIS includes among the most thorough and substantial science base that we have seen…[it] includes extensive analysis of the effects from current winter use and that analysis demonstrates significant environmental and human health impacts. We encourage NPS to take the steps necessary to protect human health and the environment immediately...."
