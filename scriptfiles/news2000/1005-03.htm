- October 5 - Buyers of 

              new automobiles will pay more than 30% more than the sticker price 

              at the gas pump as a direct result of outdated miles-per-gallon 

              standards, according to a new study released today by U.S. PIRG.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "Pumping Up 

              the Price" documents how outdated Corporate Average Fuel Economy 

              (CAFE) standards add up to 100,000 pounds in extra global warming 

              pollution and an average of $5,700 in extra fuel costs to the cost 

              of each new vehicle. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies have 

              shown that auto manufacturers could build vehicles that average 

              45 miles per gallon. However, for the past six years, Congress has 

              put a rider on the Department of Transportation's budget that prevents 

              the agency from updating the standards that mandate average fuel 

              efficiency. As a result, the average mileage of new passenger vehicles 

              is at its lowest point since 1980, and falling. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These costs 

              won't be found listed at the car lot," said U.S. PIRG Global Warming 

              Associate Katherine Abend. "Consumers shopping at dealerships rarely 

              realize how much they are being shortchanged by outdated miles per 

              gallon standards, but they're paying through the nose," she continued. 

              </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. PIRG 

              report analyzes the additional monetary and environmental costs 

              that low fuel efficiency standards add to each model year 2000 car 

              and truck. According to the report, those buying the best-selling 

              car, the Honda Accord, will pay more than $5,000 in additional fuel 

              costs, and emit an extra 96,000 pounds of global warming pollution, 

              over the lifetime of their vehicle. Those buying the best-selling 

              SUV, the Ford Explorer, will pay an extra $7,100 and emit an extra 

              136,000 pounds of global warming pollution. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By freezing 

              miles-per gallon standards, Congress has in effect imposed a heavy 

              tax on all new car buyers at the pump," said Abend. "We might as 

              well just throw cash down the gas tank." </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report 

              maintains that, by nearly doubling oil use for passenger vehicles, 

              outdated standards increase air pollution and emissions of greenhouse 

              gasses that cause global warming. Transportation accounts for a 

              third of U.S. global warming pollution. Moreover, higher demand 

              for oil leads to higher gas prices, which topped $2 per gallon in 

              parts of the country this summer. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The ten hottest 

              years ever recorded have all occurred since 1980, and scientists 

              have reached a virtual consensus that global warming is already 

              happening. Upgrading fuel efficiency standards would cut global 

              warming emissions that threaten catastrophic climate change, while 

              reducing our dependence on foreign oil and saving drivers money," 

              said Abend. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the findings 

              of the report: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· Outdated 

              fuel efficiency standards add more than 30% to the price of a model 

              year 2000 automobile. For the average passenger vehicle, this means 

              an increased cost of $5,700 in fuel expenses. This amounts to an 

              average of more than $4,800 for cars and more than $6,600 for SUVs, 

              minivans, and pickups. Overall, updating mileage standards would 

              save drivers $80 billion a year at the gas pump. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· Updating 

              fuel efficiency standards would annually save the country 1.3 billion 

              barrels of oil, or 40% of U.S. imports of crude oil. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· Outdated 

              fuel efficiency standards increase the average passenger vehicle's 

              global warming emissions by more than 100,000 pounds of CO2 equivalent. 

              The average car will emit more than 90,000 extra pounds, while the 

              average SUV, minivan, or pickup will emit more than 125,000 extra 

              pounds. Updating the standards would reduce total U.S. greenhouse 

              gas emissions by more than 1.5 trillion pounds a year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "Upgrading 

              fuel efficiency standards would cut global warming emissions that 

              threaten catastrophic climate change, reduce air pollution from 

              refineries, prevent oil spills, reduce our dependence on foreign 

              oil, and save drivers money," said Abend. "Congress should allow 

              the Department of Transportation to set one standard of 45 miles 

              per gallon for cars and light trucks. With gas prices on the rise, 

              it is unacceptable that Congress keeps our cars inefficient," she 

              concluded.</font>
