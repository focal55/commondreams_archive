- April 26 - America's senior citizens are falling farther and

      farther behind in their struggles to pay for the prescription drugs they

      need as prices for those drugs increase faster than inflation, according

      to a new report released today by Families USA, a consumer health care

      organization.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report, <a href="http://www.familiesusa.org/pubs/pdrug.htm">Still Rising: Drug Price Increases for Seniors,

      1999-2000,</a> examines the increasing costs of the 50 drugs that are

      most commonly prescribed for senior citizens. The report was highlighted

      by President Bill Clinton at a White House press briefing today. Joining

      the President were Families USA executive director Ron Pollack, Sen. Tom

      Daschle (D-SD), and Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-MO).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;This report underscores the importance of protecting seniors from

      the growing burden of prescription drug prices,&quot; Pollack said.

      &quot;Each year, it becomes increasingly difficult for millions of senior

      citizens to pay for the drugs they need. Their incomes remain fixed as

      they watch drug prices soar out of sight, taking the promise of effective

      treatment with them.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Still Rising&quot; examines the increasing costs of the 50 drugs

      most commonly prescribed for senior citizens from January 1999 to January

      2000 and from January 1994 to January 2000. The report found, for example,

      in the 1999-2000 period:</font></p>

<ul>

        

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Prices for the 50 drugs most frequently used by seniors rose, on

          average, nearly double the rate of inflation</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Of the 50 drugs, only 12 rose slower than inflation; nine had no

          price increase.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Prices for 33 of those drugs rose by at least 1.5 times the rate of

          inflation.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Prices for 25 of those drugs rose at least twice the rate of

          inflation.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Prices for 15 of those drugs rose at least three times the rate of

          inflation.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Prices for 11 of those drugs rose at least four times the rate of

          inflation.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The prices for some drugs soared even higher over that one-year span.

      The cost of one, furosemide (a diuretic manufactured by Watson and used to

      treat conditions such as hypertension and congestive heart failure), rose

      by 50 percent, about 23 times the rate of inflation. Another drug, Klor-Con

      10 (manufactured by Upsher-Smith and used as a potassium replacement),

      rose 43.8 percent, or about 20 times the inflation rate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Families USA report found similar price hikes over the six-year

      period from January 1994 to January 2000. Thirty-nine (39) of the 50

      most-commonly-prescribed drugs were on the market during that entire

      six-year period. Of those:</font></p>

<ul>

        

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Prices for 37 of 39 rose faster than inflation.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Prices for three-quarters of those drugs - 30 out of 39 - rose at

          least 1.5 times the rate of inflation.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Prices for more than half of those drugs - 22 out of 39 - rose at

          least twice the rate of inflation.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Prices for 11 out of the 39 rose at least three times the rate of

          inflation.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Prices for 6 out of 39 rose at least five times the rate of

          inflation.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report's findings may have a major impact on the debate regarding

      prescription drug coverage for senior citizens. The Clinton Administration

      has proposed a benefit that would cover all seniors, while the House

      Republican leadership has proposed a plan that would only subsidize

      seniors with incomes up to 150 percent of poverty, or $12,525 a year for a

      widow or widower. Pollack called that woefully inadequate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;A widow living on $1,000 a month and trying to pay for housing,

      food, and utilities will find the fast-growing costs of prescription drugs

      unaffordable,&quot; he said. &quot;Seniors living at 150 percent of

      poverty cannot afford drugs that consume one-sixth of their modest

      incomes.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As an example, Pollack described the situation of a widow living on

      $12,525 a year who must take Glucophage, Procardia XL and Lipitor, three

      commonly-prescribed medications for diabetes, hypertension and high

      cholesterol, three relatively common conditions. She faces an annual bill

      of up to $2,295 for those medicines alone -- more than 18.3 percent of her

      total income.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report's price increase data are based on price increases in

      average wholesale prices. Data for the report were prepared for Families

      USA by the PRIME Institute of the University of Minnesota.</font>
