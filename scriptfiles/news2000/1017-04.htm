- October 17 - The Human Rights Campaign today admonished Texas Gov. 

  George W. Bush for continuing to refuse to answer directly whether current federal 

  hate crimes law should cover sexual orientation. Judy Shepard, mother of slain 

  Wyoming college student Matthew Shepard, asked the question again in a new HRC 

  radio advertisement, and officials for the GOP presidential candidate have yet 

  to give a straightforward answer, according to HRC.<br>

  <br>

  &#147;The Bush campaign&#146;s response to Shepard&#146;s question is the greatest 

  Texas dance since the two-step, and shows a wanton display of political maneuvering,&#148; 

  said HRC Political Director Winnie Stachelberg. &#147;It is amazing that the 

  Bush campaign can&#146;t answer the simple question of whether they support 

  sexual orientation being added to current federal hate crimes law. Hate crime 

  victims and their families deserve a simple, honest answer. Unfortunately, the 

  Bush campaign has not been forthcoming.&#148; <br>

  <br>

  &quot;Texas has a hate crimes law on the books&#133;The individuals who murdered 

  James Byrd Jr. received some of the toughest penalties available, including 

  the death penalty for two and life in prison for the other,&#148; Bush campaign 

  officials today told the Washington Post in response to the HRC ad. The governor 

  supports the bill put forth by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, &#147;because it helps 

  states prosecute hate crimes without dramatically expanding the role and the 

  reach of the federal government,&#148; the officials said. <br>

  <br>

  &#147;What the Bush campaign failed to mention is that the Hatch bill does not 

  include sexual orientation which leads us to wonder if he does not believe gay 

  and lesbian Americans should receive the same protection as other people from 

  hate crimes,&#148; said Stachelberg. &#147;Furthermore, although Texas has had 

  a weak penalty enhancement statute since 1993, it also does not include sexual 

  orientation. Legislation was introduced in 1998 that would have strengthened 

  the existing state law, while also adding sexual orientation, but Bush opposed 

  it.&#148; <br>

  <br>

  Bush&#146;s apparent opposition to adding sexual orientation is even more striking 

  in light of the Oct. 15 release of the FBI&#146;s Uniform Crime Reports for 

  1999, the latest year for which statistics are available. As overall serious 

  crime continued to decrease for the eighth consecutive year, hate crimes based 

  on sexual orientation have continued to rise, and increased 4.5 percent from 

  1998 to 1999. <br>

  <br>

  Further, reported hate crime incidents based on sexual orientation have more 

  than tripled since the FBI began collecting statistics in 1991- comprising 16.7 

  percent of all hate crimes for 1999 at 1,317, according to the FBI data. Hate 

  crimes based on sexual orientation continue to make up the third highest category 

  after race and religion, which make up 54.5 and 17.9 percent, respectively of 

  the total, 7,876.<br>

  <br>

  The new <a href="http://www.hrcusa.org/hrc/hrcnews/2000/001016judy_HC.asp">HRC radio campaign</a> 

  is currently playing in media markets where Bush is traveling, beginning today 

  in St. Louis, Mo. The ad will also run in other cities he visits on the campaign 

  trail until he answers the question posed by Shepard, HRC said. A spending figure 

  for the campaign is not available due to the open-ended nature of the run. <br>

  <br>

  The radio ad features Shepard speaking by telephone and is directed at Bush. 

  The text of the ad follows:<br>

  <br>

</font>

<ul>

  <i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Governor Bush, my name is Judy Shepard. Two years ago my son Matthew was 

  murdered because he was gay. Last week you said in the debate that you opposed 

  the Kennedy hate crimes bill. I want to know why? It has nothing to do with 

  punishment. It has everything to do with giving law enforcement new tools in 

  combating hate violence. Your own state received federal help in convicting 

  the murderers of James Byrd Jr. Law enforcement in Jasper, Texas, received $284,000 

  to help them with the crime.<br>

  <br>

  &#147;In Laramie, Wyoming, the sheriff&#146;s department had to layoff four 

  deputies because of the cost of investigating and prosecuting my son&#146;s 

  murderers. The detectives got the job done, but they support the Kennedy hate 

  crimes bill because they did not get the same federal assistance. Why? Because 

  sexual orientation is not covered in current hate crimes law.<br>

  <br>

  &#147;I am asking American families to call you, Governor, at (512) 463-2000 

  and ask why you said you support Senator Hatch&#146;s bill which is much weaker 

  and excludes sexual orientation. Do you support including sexual orientation 

  in federal hate crimes law? Governor Bush, we deserve an answer. <br>

  <br>
