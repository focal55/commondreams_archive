- July 25 - ExxonMobil's latest profit



announcement "clearly demonstrates" that the oil industry can afford



to clean up diesel fuel, the nonprofit Clean Air Trust noted today.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Clean Air Trust also noted that its analysis suggests that



major oil companies are on track to report more than $13 billion in



collective profits for the second quarter of 2000.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The world's largest publicly traded oil company reported this



morning that its second quarter earnings more than doubled as profits



surged to $4.15 billion for the three-month period.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, noted



that ExxonMobil made more in profits in this quarter alone than the



diesel fuel cleanup is expected to cost over the next six years. (The



U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed requiring oil



companies to remove most of the sulfur from diesel fuel by mid-2006



to enable use of advanced pollution control devices on big diesel



trucks and buses.)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is time for the oil industry to stop crying poor -- and to



stop its opposition to the diesel cleanup," O'Donnell said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'Donnell said the new profit figures for ExxonMobil and other



major oil companies also raise questions about the industry's



contentions that cleaner-burning gasoline standards drove gasoline



prices sky-high this year.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Prices at the pump have plummeted recently even though the



cleaner-burning gasoline standards remain in effect," O'Donnell



noted. "It does raise anew the question -- was the industry price



gouging?"</font>
