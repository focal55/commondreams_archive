- February 7 - Increased spending



on the environment proposed by President Clinton today will



not happen without a stronger commitment from the president



and Congress, according to Friends of the Earth.

<p>Today, President Clinton released the fiscal year 2001 budget

request and proposed an overall increase of more than 11 percent



-- or $4 billion -- for environmental and conservation purposes



in fiscal year 2001.

<p>Despite increases proposed by President Clinton in past years,

federal spending on environmental and conservation programs has not



kept pace with other budget priorities. While overall federal



spending has grown 22 percent since 1993, environmental programs have



only grown 14 percent. In 1993, environmental spending was



1.81 percent of the overall federal budget at $26.7 billion;



in 2000, environmental spending will shrink to 1.69 percent



at $30.4 billion.

<p>"New initiatives and proposals are good, but history shows that

Congress and the president are not serious about beefing up



conservation and environmental protection," said Gawain Kripke,



director of economics campaigns for Friends of the Earth.

<p>The president's fiscal year 2001 budget request seeks major new

funding for land acquisition, farm conservation, and a variety of new



climate and water-related initiatives. However, Congress has quickly



rejected similar proposals in recent years.

<p>"Since 1993, the U.S. economy has grown more than 40 percent the

federal government has budget surpluses as far as the eye can see.



At the same time, drinking water systems serving more than 50 million



Americans violate health standards, and air pollution is so bad in



several metropolitan areas, it's causing respiratory diseases and



increasing asthma in children," said Kripke. "This country should be



investing more in public health and the environment; we can afford

it



and we owe it to our children and future generations."

<p>A fact sheet on the federal budget can be viewed at Friends of the

Earth's website at <a href="http://www.foe.org">www.foe.org.</a>

<p>Founded in 1969, Friends of the Earth is a national environmental

advocacy organization dedicated to protecting the planet from



environmental degradation; preserving biological, cultural and ethnic



diversity; and empowering citizens to affect the quality of their



environment -- and their lives.
