- October 23 - Ralph Nader charged today that the Clinton-Gore

Administration has presided over the deterioration of the Food and Drug

Administration, once considered the world's premiere drug-safety agency.



<p>Today, FDA approves drugs that would have been rejected in the past

because of doubts about their safety or effectiveness,'' Nader said.  ''As a

result American lives are at risk.''



<p>Nader cited the drug Rezulin as a prime example of problems at FDA. This

spring, Rezulin was taken off the market after causing hundreds of cases of

severe liver toxicity and at least 63 deaths. Rezulin was the fourth drug

pulled off the market from among those approved in 1977.  Only one other

time since 1970 were as many as two FDA-approved drugs were taken off the

market.



<p>Nader said a confidential survey conducted in 1998, FDA medical

officers-the physicians responsible for primary reviews of new drug

applications-identified more than two dozen drugs they believed were

mistakenly approved. The physicians reported stepped up pressure from

superiors, Congress and the drug industry to approve a high proportion of

new drugs.



<p>''Not surprisingly, the drug industry is celebrating the lax approach at

the Clinton-Gore FDA,'' Nader said. ''In surveys, drug and medical device

industry executives say they have a more positive attitude about FDA than at

any previous time.''



<p>Nader said the so-called FDA Modernization Act of 1997 and other

legislative acts have seriously weakened the FDA's regulatory capacity,

permitting the manufacturers of many medical devices to rely on private,

for-profit companies instead of FDA to review their application. This

process, he said, has reduced the evidence required to prove safety and has

allowed drug companies to promote drugs for purposes for which they were not

approved.



<p>Nader said FDA needs new leadership that will refuse to compromise public

safety to accommodate industry demands. He also urged repeal of the FDA

Modernization Act and other deregulatory measures that have weakened the

agency.
