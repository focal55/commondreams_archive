- March 23 - A disgruntled customer who co-created a Web site

devoted to airing complaints about Circuit City Stores should not be ordered to dismantle

the site, Public Citizen argued in a brief

filed today in federal court in Ohio.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circuit City has sued Steven Shane, a Kentucky lawyer representing

unhappy Circuit City customer Maury Tepper. Tepper, who lives near Cincinnati, Ohio, has

sued Circuit City alleging that the company engaged in false advertising and sales

practices. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After filing the suit, Tepper and Shane created <a href="http://www.circuitcitylawsuit.com">the Web site</a>, outlining Tepper&#146;s

experiences, his reason for suing and a copy of his complaint. The Web site also provided

a link to the Federal Trade Commission&#146;s complaints page and featured a

&quot;guestbook&quot; where site visitors could post their own experiences with Circuit

City.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the Web site was legally filed in Shane&#146;s name, Circuit

City sued Shane in February 2000, alleging that Shane violated trademark law and

professional conduct codes. The suit also alleged that Shane used the company&#146;s name

and distinctive colors to divert customers from Circuit City&#146;s Web site to his own

and to solicit clients to expand the lawsuit. Along with its complaint, the company asked

the court to issue an injunction that would forbid the use of Circuit City&#146;s name

anywhere on the Web site, which would effectively shut it down.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the brief, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Ohio, Public Citizen Litigation Group attorney Paul

Alan Levy argued that granting such an injunction would violate the First Amendment and

that trademark law does not forbid the use of a company&#146;s name to inform the public

about alleged corporate wrongdoing. He also noted that the Web site did not solicit people

to join the lawsuit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It&#146;s ridiculous and outrageous that a company,

particularly a company the size of Circuit City, is attempting to silence a customer

simply because he had a bad experience,&quot; Levy said. &quot;It is a blatant attempt to

rob him of his First Amendment rights.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several other dissatisfied customers have created protest sites

directed at Circuit City. If Circuit City can force a lawyer such as Shane to close his

site, it is likely that lay persons will be even more intimidated and would have to close

their sites as well, Levy said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circuit City&#146;s lawsuit mirrors one filed last year by Terminix,

the well-known pest control company, its parent corporation, ServiceMaster, and several

ServiceMaster subsidiaries against an unhappy customer who created a Web site in which

other unhappy Terminix customers posted their gripes. After extensive adverse publicity

and a vigorous legal defense by Public Citizen, Terminix dropped its lawsuit earlier this

month. </font>
