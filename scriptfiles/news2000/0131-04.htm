<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- January 31 - The Sierra Club today held a toxic fish buffet to

     urge for effective clean-up plans for the Great Lakes.  Ten years

     after the Sierra Club's last toxic buffet, little has changed. Toxic

     hot spots around the Great Lakes still contain enough pollution to

     render most local fish too dangerous to eat.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It is a tragedy that the Great Lakes are still toxic after all these

     years," said Emily Green, Director of the Sierra Club's Great Lakes

     Program, while standing behind appetizing yet toxic plates of poached,

     smoked, and fillets of yellow perch, walleye, and rock bass. "But even

     worse is the fact that our children's health is at risk simply from

     eating these dishes for dinner."



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beside each of the five plates of fish - one fish from each of the

     Great Lakes - was a list of toxic chemicals that are commonly found in

     fish caught in the Lakes. Dangerous amounts of mercury, PCB's and

     other toxic contaminants still pour silently into the lakes from

     nearby industries and abandoned dumping spots. Fish that swim in this

     toxic soup are now contaminated, and pose a particularly insidious

     threat to the health of pregnant women, children and subsistence

     fishermen.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cancer risks from these contaminants are 4,500 times above EPA's

     minimum "acceptable" level for some populations. Fish consumption

     advisories have been posted around all of the lakes, and the toxins

     are causing developmental problems and learning disabilities in

     children.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We are pleased to see the Clinton Administration addressing this

     problem, but we still have a long way to go to protect our children's

     health," Green stated, referring to a multi-million dollar plan that

     the Environmental Protection Agency is negotiating. She then proceeded

     to lay out a plan put together by a coalition of groups including the

     Sierra Club and Great Lakes United that would focus on a complete

     clean-up of one or two key sites first.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This plan will allow us to develop the expertise to clean up these

     toxic hot spots completely. A model can then be made for other Great

     Lakes communities to follow so that their children can safely swim in

     the lakes, drink the water, and eat their favorite fish dinner," said

     Green.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also speaking at the event were Dr. Theo Colburn, author of Our Stolen

     Future, Margaret Wooster of Great Lakes United, and Charlotte Caldwell

     of the Great Lakes Indigenous Environmental Network who related how

     her community was forced to change its way of life due to the

     pollution. Dr. Colburn described a few key scientific studies that

     show the harmful effects this pollution has to the Great Lakes

     population, including one that showed how children born to mothers who

     eat Great Lakes fish are as much as two years behind in reading and

     math.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's time to end the delay, and clean up the Great Lakes today,"

     concluded Green.
