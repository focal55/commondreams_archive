- March 29 - The Wilderness Society



(TWS) today condemned as "ludicrous" action by the Senate Budget



Committee endorsing oil drilling in the pristine wilderness of the



Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Alaska.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, the Senate Budget Committee included revenues from



assumed drilling in its annual Budget Resolution -- suggesting that



the additional oil revenues are necessary to balance the federal



budget.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An amendment by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) to eliminate the



drilling provision was blocked on a tie vote. The Budget Resolution



now moves to the full Senate where another amendment to delete the



drilling provision is expected.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In an era of trillion dollar surpluses, it is ludicrous for the



Senate Budget Committee to suggest through this resolution that we



need to plunder the natural treasure of the Arctic Refuge to balance



the federal budget," said Rindy O'Brien, TWS vice president of public



policy. "Three weeks ago, with oil prices above $34 per barrel, the



Alaska Congressional delegation argued that we need to drill in the



refuge to reduce oil prices. Now that oil prices have dropped below



$27 a barrel, this week their argument has conveniently 'morphed'



into budget balancing."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this month, Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska) introduced



legislation that would allow oil development in the Arctic Refuge.



Ninety-five percent of the North Slope is already available to oil



and gas exploration and development.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"You don't pawn family heirlooms for extra cash when you have more



than enough money to pay all your bills," said Jim Waltman, TWS



director of refuges and wildlife. "Clearly, this resolution is



nothing more than a scam -- an outrageous justification for



destroying our nation's greatest northern wilderness. This dog won't



hunt!"
