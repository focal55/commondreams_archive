- February 29 - In support of Senator Robert Torricelli's (D-NJ) Senate Resolution condemning the discriminatory practices prevalent at Bob Jones University and challenging Congress to stand against its divisive practices, Sister Mary Carol Bennett, President of the Board of Directors of The Interfaith Alliance of Southwestern Pennsylvania and member of the Pittsburgh Regional Community of the Institute of the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas, issued the following statement at a press conference sponsored by the office of Robert Torricelli at the House Triangle this afternoon:</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As a person of faith and on behalf of concerned people of faith, I urge members of the United States Senate to denounce any association of bigotry, discrimination, and intolerance with religious faith.  I am deeply troubled by the embrace of Bob Jones University by several presidential candidates.  While Catholics do not represent a monolithic group theologically or politically, we should take careful note of those who spread a blanket condemnation on the 62 million of us.  In addition, in a country whose population includes nearly fifty percent racial minorities, a call for racial purity in relationships ought to be seen as waving a red flag.  It recalls a lesson we ought to have learned in the painful struggles of the last century.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As a national clergy-led grassroots organization dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in the life of the nation, and one that challenges any individual or organization that would manipulate religion to promote social intolerance, we have serious concerns about the religious and social views being expressed and promoted by Bob Jones University. Furthermore, we have serious reservations about candidates for public office giving the appearance of an endorsement of Bob Jones University's philosophy by using the University as a backdrop for certain political purposes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As a faith-based organization comprised of over 50 different faith traditions dedicated to promoting civility, mutual respect and cooperation in our increasingly diverse society, we believe that Bob Jones University works against these goals and needs to greatly reassess the values that it is embracing as an educational institution. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Over the last ten years, officials at Bob Jones University have made statements regarding Catholicism and organized religion in general that we not only find to be destructive but factually flawed.  In addition to directly attacking people of organized religions who differ from its own views, Bob Jones University's segregationist policies are reminiscent of arguably the saddest days of our nation's struggle for equality for all Americans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Therefore, we at The Interfaith Alliance call on public officials and all candidates for public office to carefully consider what their relationship with Bob Jones University is now, and what it shall be in the future. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We ask public officials and candidates for public office to carefully consider the message they are sending to the general public by using Bob Jones University campus as a forum to discuss any topic besides the continued need for civil rights education for all people in this nation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We call on public officials who do speak to the university audience to implore them as a university community to consider the implications of their policies and their views and to re-evaluate them because our society recognizes the equality of all peoples regardless of their religion, sexual orientation, race or gender. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"People of faith challenge Congress to stand against the divisive practices of Bob Jones University, and to offer support for this resolution." </font></p>
