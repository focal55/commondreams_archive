              coalition of environmental, human rights, religious, and social

              justice organizations have locked themselves to the undercarriage

              of a 17-foot panel truck, emblazoned with the words, &quot;WORLD

              Bank phase out its financing of destructive oil, gas, and mining

              projects. The platform details the ten most harmful impacts of

              Bank likes to talk about its new concern for stopping catastrophic

              global climate change. Yet it is still spending 25 times more

              on the very fossil fuel projects that cause global warming, than

              on clean, renewable energy projects.  Is this what the Bank calls
