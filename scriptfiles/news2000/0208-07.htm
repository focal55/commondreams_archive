- February 8 - </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statement by Judith L. Lichtman, President<br>

National Partnership for Women &amp; Families

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Today marks an important milestone on the road to better health and a fairer workplace for women and families.  The President’s executive order on genetic discrimination prohibits the federal government from discriminating in hiring or

promotions against employees with a genetic predisposition to a disease.  The National Partnership applauds this historic step and urges Congress to extend these protections to all Americans.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Medical advances are unraveling the complex structure that determines the very fiber of our being, and our laws must keep pace with these rapid changes in science.  From early pre-natal tests to discoveries of genes relating to breast and ovarian cancer, women have been at the forefront of the genetics revolution.  But fears about misuse of this sensitive medical information have frightened many women into avoiding genetic testing.  This means far too many women may lose out on the benefits of prevention or early detection and treatment of diseases.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The President has taken an enormous step forward by ensuring that the federal government does not discriminate in employment on the basis of genetic information.  Now it is time for Congress to act.  We call on the House and Senate to pass legislation that will protect all Americans from discrimination in employment and prevent discrimination by health insurers.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The National Partnership for Women & Families (formerly the Women’s Legal Defense Fund) successfully advocated for inclusion of the first federal protections against genetic discrimination in the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which prohibits group health plans from denying insurance on the basis of genetic information. Recently, the National Partnership founded the Coalition for Genetic Fairness, a coalition of patients, civil rights organizations, and other advocates dedicated to achieving protections from genetic discrimination in insurance and employment. </i>
