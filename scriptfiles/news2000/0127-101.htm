<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ATLANTA 

- January 27 - Standing beside a 

20 foot high inflated replica of a plastic 

contoured Coke bottle, environmental and 

recycling groups today announced plans for a 

Super Bowl demonstration and nationwide tour 

targeting The Coca-Cola Company's plastic soda 

bottle waste.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The GrassRoots Recycling Network, Earth Day 

2000, and Waste Not Georgia held an 11:00 a.m. 

news conference today at Woodruff Park in 

downtown Atlanta to announce the kickoff 

demonstration and nationwide tour.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We are targeting Coke because it is 

'greenwashing', trying to create a positive 

environmental image while it is breaking with 

a decades-long practice of using recycled 

materials in packaging," said Sheehan.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Coca-Cola is the champion beverage industry 

waste-maker, responsible for plummeting 

plastic bottle recycling rates and a rising 

flood of soda bottle waste.  Coke is leading 

the beverage industry in the wrong direction, 

away from aluminum cans and glass bottles made 

with recycled materials to plastic bottles 

made with little or no recycled plastic," Dr. 

Bill Sheehan, network coordinator for the 

GrassRoots Recycling Network, said in an 

Atlanta news conference today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Coke's virgin plastic soda bottle waste in 

the last five years would fill 15 Georgia 

Domes," Sheehan said.  "Put another way, if 

you laid all the littered, landfilled and 

incinerated Coke bottles end to end, they 

would stretch from Atlanta to Los Angeles and 

back 868 times," said Sheehan.</font></p>

WHEN<br>

Saturday, January 29, 2000, at 1:00 p.m.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

WHERE	Centennial Park across from the Coke-   

      sponsored 'NFL Experience' at the Georgia    

      World Congress Center</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The GrassRoots Recycling Network launched its 

Coke Campaign in April 1997, calling on Coke 

to take voluntary steps to reduce plastic 

bottle waste.  More than 100 recycling, 

environmental, business, consumer and student 

organizations and leaders from across the 

country have endorsed the campaign.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Local government officials from Florida to 

Minnesota and California have passed 

resolutions calling on Coke to make new 

plastic soda bottles with recycled plastic.



"Coke produced more than 21 billion plastic 

bottles in the last 5 years that have been 

wasted, as litter on streets, in parks and on 

beaches, or sent to landfills and 

incinerators," Dr. Sheehan said.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"These bottles could be used again to make new 

bottles, if Coke would take responsibility for 

its waste.  Coke makes bottles with 25 percent 

recycled plastic in other countries," Sheehan 

stated.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The GrassRoots Recycling Network is seeking a 

'public commitment' from the chairman of Coca-

Cola to begin using 25 percent recycled 

plastic on a specific timetable.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We started direct discussions with Coca-Cola 

in October 1999, nearly two years after our 

campaign was launched.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Coke ignored our 

protests until last summer when we ran 

advertisements in the New York Times and Wall 

Street Journal about the waste problem," said 

Sheehan.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Coca-Cola used recycled plastic in bottles in 

the United States from 1991 to 1994, then 

abandoned the initial technology.  According 

to public statements by Coke officials, the 

company used virgin plastic in its soda 

bottles for the next 4 years.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Newer plastic recycling techniques approved by 

the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are 

commercially available.  Coke could produce a 

bottle made with 25 percent recycled plastic 

for only about 1/10 of a cent more than virgin 

plastic for a 20-ounce bottle.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bob Woodall, speaking on behalf of Waste Not 

Georgia, said: "Another part of the solution 

is creating financial incentives to increase 

recycling collection.  We support a system of 

deposits on beverage containers to boost 

recycling, but Coke opposes deposits."</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Coke is misleading the public, trying to 

claim credit for plastic bottle recycling.  

But the facts tell a different story.  Bottle 

bill states recycle the vast majority of 

plastic bottles, because deposits provide a 

financial incentive.  Coke opposes deposits 

and spends millions of dollars annually to 

defeat new legislation and seek repeal of 

existing deposit laws," Woodall said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Container Recycling Institute, based in 

Arlington, Virginia, reports that the 10 

states with so-called 'bottle bill' laws 

report recycling rates for all beverage 

containers (plastic, aluminum and glass) of 75 

to 95 percent, which is two to three times 

higher than non-deposit states.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A bottle bill in Georgia would produce a 

steady stream of recycled bottles which could 

be used by both Coke and the carpet industry.  

The carpet industry is one of Georgia's 

largest employers and the largest end-user of 

recycled plastic soda bottles in the nation," 

said Woodall.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The GrassRoots Recycling Network favors 

voluntary or mandatory measures that hold 

product manufacturers accountable for product 

and packaging waste, as policies and laws in 

many other countries already do.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recent trade press reports indicate that Coca-

Cola is beginning to use a small amount of 

recycled plastic to make their soda bottles.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"From the summer of 1998 to the summer of 

1999, Coke used only a token amount of 

recycled plastic," Sheehan said.  "Our 

information indicates that it was no more than 

one tenth of one percent of the more than one 

billion pounds of virgin plastic that Coke 

used to make bottles that year."</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Coca-Cola so far refuses to confirm the 

amount of material used or a timetable for 

widespread use of recycled plastic," Sheehan 

said.  "It's time for Coke to make a clear 

public commitment to use recycled plastic in 

their bottles and support a system of 

financial incentives to make plastic soda 

bottle recycling work."</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The sign on our 20 foot bottle communicates 

an essential first step to solve the plastic 

bottle waste problem - 'Demand Coke Use 

Recycled Plastic Always' - and now is the time 

to start," Sheehan said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The GrassRoots Recycling Network (GRRN) is a 

North American network of recycling and 

community-based activists dedicated to 

achieving a sustainable economy based on the 

principle of zero waste.  GRRN advocates 

policies and practices to promote producer 

responsibility for product and packaging 

waste, to end corporate welfare for waste, and 

to create sustainable jobs from discards.  

GRRN was founded in 1995 by members of the 

Sierra Club Solid Waste Committee, the 

Institute for Local Self-Reliance, and the 

California Resource Recovery Association.</font></p>
