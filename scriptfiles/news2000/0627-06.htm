- June 27 -  The following was



released today by Jubilee 2000/USA:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's 32-21 defeat of the Pelosi amendment in the House



Appropriations Committee condemns the world's children to poor



health and a future without hope. The amendment would have



restored funding for poor country debt relief instead of the $69



million that was in the foreign operations bill, an amount far



short of the $435 million request to fund the United States share



of the Cologne Debt Initiative through 2001.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our legislators have once again turned their backs on the



19,000 children that die every day as a result of debt. Where is



the compassion in this conservatism? Now, when the United States



is expecting an enormous surplus, is the time to take action and



let the people in these heavily indebted countries get on with the



business of caring for their own people," said Dan Driscoll-Shaw,



National Coordinator for Jubilee 2000/USA. "It is appalling that



the committee could earmark $1.3 billion for military aid to



Colombia and leave the poor behind. The faith community supports



debt relief and will remember this vote on election day,"



Driscoll-Shaw added.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Debt cancellation has the potential to:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Save 21 million children from disease and hunger in Africa

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Preserve the environment. Debt induced poverty leads to



greater exploitation of natural resources, contributing to global



warming and general environmental degradation

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Promote growth in the US and abroad by lifting the burden of



debt from the economies of impoverished countries

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Increase global security. Debt creates social unrest and



war.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Debt cancellation can make an immediate difference in the lives



of those living in the world's poorest countries. In Uganda,



resources freed from debt relief combined with other sources have



led primary school enrollment to double in just three years.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The campaign is inspired by the scriptural idea of the Jubilee



Year: periodically, every 7 x 7 years or 50 years, debts are



forgiven and slaves set free, and "liberty is proclaimed throughout



the land". Jubilee is a time to apply self-righting mechanisms for



restoring balance to society.
