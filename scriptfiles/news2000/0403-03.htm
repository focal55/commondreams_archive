- April 3 - Crown Central Petroleum (CCP) shareholders complained today to the

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the company, in its just

released 10K report and in prior SEC reports, failed to detail the material

effects of its labor dispute and other mismanagement.  The complaint asserts

that the company's reporting on its operations may have depressed currently

pending buy-out offers. According to the complaint, recent data showed a

consistent decline in retail gasoline sales volumes at Crown Central

Petroleum stores during a  labor-led  boycott from 1997-1999. 



<p>According to Attorney Sanford Lewis, who filed the complaint with the SEC,

"The stock prices offered by proposed purchasers might be substantially

higher if Crown management had better disclosed how severely the boycott and

management induced problems have hurt returns. Under new, better management,

the company could be worth almost twice the value of current cash bids."



<p>Current cash offers to purchase Crown shares, proferred by Rosemore Inc.( a

closely held company affiliated with Crown's management)  and Apex Oil Inc.

range from $92 to $93.5 million.  A stock exchange offer from Apex Oil could

be worth $120 million. But one Wall Street analyst has put the actual value

of company assets at $170 million. According to the shareholders who

complained to the SEC, one source of this underpricing may be the failure to

report on, and allow the market to reflect, the boycott's actual impacts. 



<p>The complaint asks the SEC to order Crown to undertake more detailed

disclosures prior  to the consummation of current proposed stock sales,

including:



	<p>1) Stating whether the labor dispute has had or may in the future pose a

material impact on the corporation.



	<p>2) Estimating any impacts on retail gasoline sales volumes, pricing

strategies and income caused by the boycott, and to identifying all

assumptions and investigative techniques used in developing such estimates.



	<p>3) Reporting on the specific costs of litigation which the company

attributes to responding to the labor dispute and the union's corporate

campaign.



	<p>4) Quantifying the number of hours Crown management has expended in

response to the labor dispute and activities that the company believes are

related to that dispute, and whether such activities have posed an impact on

their other managerial obligations.



	<p>5) Requiring additional disclosures regarding the company's misadventures

in the oil futures market as the SEC deems appropriate. 



<p>The complaint filed April 3 followed prior complaints by the same

shareholders on August 25 and Dec. 16, 1999 alleging among other things that

the company had failed to disclose: 



<p>•	The existence and effects of the boycott resulting from the lockout.  (The

company reported to shareholders the existence of the boycott only after

shareholders complained to the SEC about nonreporting of its existence.) 



<p>•	Certain environmental proceedings and penalties, including a $1.1 million

air pollution fine reported in its quarterly report but not its annual report.



<p>Sanford Lewis, the attorney who filed the complaint with the SEC, is a

lawyer specializing in corporate accountability to shareholders and other

corporate stakeholders.

 

<p>Copies of the complaints and graphic charts showing gasoline sales volumes

before and after the boycott are available online at
