- June 16 - Nearly nine out of



10 people believe that big diesel trucks and buses should be



required to use the best available pollution control technology,



according to a new national public opinion survey.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The survey, conducted for the American Lung Association,



Environmental Defense and the Clean Air Trust, also found that more



than more than eight of 10 people believe up to four cents a gallon



is a reasonable price to pay for cleaner diesel fuel that would



significantly reduce pollution.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the survey found that nearly seven of 10 believe that



cleaner diesel fuel and stricter diesel vehicle standards should be



required within less than five years.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's clear from these results that the public overwhelmingly



wants dirty diesel trucks and diesel fuel to be cleaned up," said



Paul G. Billings, the American Lung Association's assistant vice



president for government relations.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The public health and environmental groups released the survey



results as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency begins a series



of hearings on a plan to require a sweeping cleanup of big diesel



trucks and buses. Last month EPA proposed requiring that new trucks



and buses be up to 95 percent cleaner than today's models.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To enable use of advanced technology pollution controls, the EPA



also proposed requiring that oil companies slash 97 percent of the



sulfur from diesel fuel. (Sulfur is a poison, much as lead was a



poison to catalytic converters in the 1970s.)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The survey found that 87 percent of respondents believe that



18-wheeler trucks, buses and other big diesel vehicles should be



required to use the best available pollution control technology even



though it will cost the owners of these vehicles more money. Only 10



percent disagree.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Most Americans can't attend these public hearings," said Vicki



Patton, a senior attorney with Environmental Defense. "But these



results clearly show they don't want diesel trucks and buses to get

a



free ride when it comes to public health. They want these vehicles



cleaned up."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the critical question of diesel fuel, 85 percent of survey



respondents believe up to 4 cents a gallon is a reasonable price to



pay for cleaner diesel fuel that would significantly reduce



pollution. (The U.S. EPA estimates the cost of cleaner diesel fuel

at



3-4 cents extra per gallon.) Fifty percent of respondents would find



an increased price of up to 7 cents a gallon reasonable.(a)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA would phase in the stricter truck standards over the next



seven to 10 years, but the public wants a quicker cleanup.



Sixty-nine percent want cleaner diesel fuel and tighter truck



pollution standards to be phased in within the next five years. Only



six percent favor a stretchout of more than a decade.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA has estimated the new standards would cost the oil industry



about $3.5 billion over the next six years. Over three-quarters of



survey respondents agree the amount is just right (60 percent) or too



little (18 percent). Only 13 percent believe EPA is asking the oil



industry to spend too much.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"People know the oil companies are raking in huge profits, and



they want a small portion of these profits spent to protect our



health rather than simply going to stockholders or highly-paid



corporate executives," said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of



the Clean Air Trust. "ExxonMobil made enough in profits in the first



three months of this year alone to virtually pay for the entire



cleanup, while its chairman and CEO is making more than $25 million

a



year."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The nationwide survey of 1,000 adults was conducted June 1-4 by



Lake Snell Perry &amp; Associates. The margin of error is plus/minus



3 percent.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">------



Note a: Thirty-five percent responded that cleaner diesel fuel



that produces significantly less air pollution should cost only up

to



four cents a gallon. Another 15 percent believe cleaner fuel should



cost only up to 7 cents more per gallon and 22 percent say only up

to



10 cents more per gallon. Seven percent say up to 20 cents more per



gallon, and six percent say more than 20 cents per gallon.
