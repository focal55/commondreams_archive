- July 13 - The House of the Representatives today took a giant step

towards relieving the debt burden on the developing world by passing an

amendment offered by U.S. Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA-35) to provide

a total of $225 million for debt cancellation in FY2001.



<p>"This is a real shot in the arm for the debt relief campaign," said Dan

Driscoll-Shaw, National Coordinator for Jubilee 2000 USA. "It shows that

lawmakers in the House are truly hearing the call of the poor and are ready

to lead efforts to help.  It also shows members of Congress are feeling the

pressure of Jubilee 2000 supporters, many of them members of religious

groups from across the US, who have called and written over the past year.

These supporters will keep up the pressure."  Earlier this week Jubilee 2000

USA delivered to Congress 500,000 signatures on a petition for definitive

debt cancellation.



<p>Earlier this year the Senate vote to appropriate only $75 million for debt

cancellation.  The two chambers now conference on the final figure.



<p>"It is our great hope that the Senate will follow the House's lead and

elevate the final figure.  We are losing 19,000 children a day in the

poorest indebted countries, that is not only inexcusable, but more

importantly, preventable," added Driscoll-Shaw.



<p><i>Jubilee 2000/USA is part of the international coalition of religious,

environmental, human rights and labor organizations, working for the

cancellation of the debt of the world's most impoverished countries in this

Jubilee Year of 2000.</i>
