- July 19 - U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN) was harshly critical of

the Clinton Administration’s proposal to extend Permanent Normal Trade Relations

(PNTR) to China at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held on

the subject today.  Wellstone called for a thorough national debate on the

issues raised by proposed PNTR for China, and promised to bring forward a number

of amendments to the bill centering on human rights, labor rights and the

environment when it is taken up by the full Senate.  



<p>“I strongly believe that these issues must be fully and thoroughly discussed and

debated -- not only in the Foreign Relations Committee and on the floor of the

United States Senate, but in the kitchens and living rooms of every American

family.  The issues we are examining today affect all Americans in many

important ways.  People engaged in human rights issues have long understood this

basic truth: that Americans can never be indifferent to the desperate

circumstances of exploited and abused people in the far reaches of the globe. 

When the most basic human rights and freedoms of others are infringed or

endangered, we are diminished by our own failure to act. But when we embrace the

cause of human rights, we reaffirm one of the greatest traditions of American

democracy,” Wellstone said.



<p>Wellstone pointed out the issue before Congress is not whether the U.S. will

trade with China: we will continue to expand our trade relations regardless of

whether Congress passes PNTR.  The issue before Congress is not whether we talk

to the Chinese or engage the Chinese government; we will continue to do so

regardless of PNTR.  There has been no suggestion of boycotting China, or

isolating China, or walling them off from their economic partners.



<p>“The question is not whether we integrate China into the world economy.  The

question is on what terms do we integrate them.  What will the rules be?  Who

will decide those rules?  Who will benefit from those decisions?  And who will

be harmed by them?” Wellstone asked.  “Our bilateral agreement contains page

after page of protections for U.S. investors.  It is a virtual wish list for

multinational corporations operating in China, and for those who wish to move

there.  But it contains not a word concerning human rights, nothing on religious

freedom, nothing on labor rights, and nothing on the environment.  Annual review

of China’s trading privileges remains our best leverage over China’s behavior on

human rights, and on labor rights.  And it remains the only remaining leverage

in our trading relationship to promote important non-commercial values.”



<p>“Absent any minimum standards for human rights, labor, or the environment, the

most likely scenario is for China to become an export platform attracting

foreign manufacturers with wages as low as 3 cents an hour.  Even in

U.S.-controlled factories, a recent report by the National Labor Committee

documented payment of below-subsistence wages and violations of fundamental

worker rights by U.S. companies and their contractors in China, often in open

collaboration with repressive government authorities.  And the tens of millions

of Chinese expected to lose their jobs as a result of this deal would join a

‘floating population,’ already numbering in the tens of millions, exerting

downward pressure on wages and working conditions,” said Wellstone,  



<p>Wellstone said many of the concessions the U.S. chose to demand from China will

make it easier for U.S. corporations to relocate there, taking advantage of weak

Chinese labor and environmental standards, and export back to the United States

in competition with American workers.
