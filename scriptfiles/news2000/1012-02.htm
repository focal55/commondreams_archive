WASHINGTON 

- October 12 - 



 The code phrase for the second Presidential

debate was “I agree.”



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Twelve times during the debate George W. Bush and Albert Gore used a

variant of the phrase “I agree with you”, and 28 more times they used

other words to let the national television audience know they were in

agreement on everything from foreign policy to trigger locks to the need

for gas drilling in pristine areas of Alaska.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With that many “agreements,” was it a debate?  Bush obviously worried

about that, mentioning during their agreement on a hands-off approach to

the genocide in Rwanda that “it seems like we’re having a great love

fest right now.”



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Do we need three national debates to learn the obvious –that there are

few differences and numerous areas of agreement between Gore and Bush?



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To save valuable air-time in the third debate in St. Louis, Gore and

Bush could simply stipulate their agreements in advance and use ten

minutes to outline the minutia on which they actually disagree.  Then

they could let the other candidates have their say.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of tonight’s debate, Green party candidate Ralph Nader opined, “This

misnamed debate was an interminable tedium of platitudinous dittos,

garnished by relentless evasions and marinated in cowardly escapes from

challenging the entrenched corporate interests.”</font></p>
