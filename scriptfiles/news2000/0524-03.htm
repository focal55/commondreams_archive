- May 24 - A physicians group dedicated to the abolition of nuclear weapons had cause

for alarm today after Governor George W. Bush delivered dangerous and

contradictory language on missile defense and other  key national security

issues.  While on one hand he denounced the Clinton Administration’s

multi-billion dollar national missile defense program as ‘flawed,’ Governor

Bush on the other then proposed a much larger system, which would cover in

its shadow all of our allies, presumably Europe and parts of Asia.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Bush’s larger national missile defense is just a bigger, more expensive

umbrella full of holes," said PSR Associate Director for Nuclear/Security

Programs Anne Gallivan. "And without any hard data or real numbers to back

it up, Governor Bush’s talk about deep cuts in our nuclear arsenal is just

that: talk."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) viewed Bush’s speech, in which he

delivered a vaguely-worded pledge to cut US nuclear arsenals in addition to

the pledge to increase the size of a National Missile Defense, as an attempt

to reach out to disarmament proponents while still trying to keep his favor

with his more hawkish supporters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The one positive thing that candidate Bush proposed -- which has not yet

been proposed by Vice President Gore -- is to take our nuclear weapons off

hair-trigger alert and challenge the Russians to follow," Gallivan

continued. "His father’s unilateral disarmament was an important move in

1991, and led the Russians to further disarmament."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although Bush referred to our nuclear weapons as ‘expensive relics of dead

conflicts,’ he still proposed a national missile defense which is much

larger than the one the Clinton Administration is currently weighing. The

smaller plan is opposed by Russia and would require a revision in the

Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty signed by Russia and the US in 1972.

Bush’s larger plan would also require abrogation or serious revision of the

ABM.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Bush’s language shows how naïve our country’s leaders remain on issues of

national security," explained PSR Nuclear/Security Program Associate

Kimberly Roberts. "Building a national missile defense would not ‘reduce

nuclear tensions,’ as Governor Bush said, but would trigger a new arms race

involving Russia and potentially other nuclear powers like China."</font>
