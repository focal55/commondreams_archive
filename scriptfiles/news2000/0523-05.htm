asked Mayor Susan Golding to explain why San Diego was ranked fourth in

the nation in fatal police shootings in a recent study of FBI statistics

released by the Detroit Free Press on May 15.  In a letter sent to Mayor

Golding today, the heads of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU),

National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Earl

B. Gilliam Bar Association, and La Raza Lawyers urge the Mayor to direct

the City Manager to explain the apparent contradiction between this

recent report and the San Diego Police Department's own statements that

San Diego has relatively few shootings as compared to other cities.

However, according to the FBI statistics, San Diego's rate of fatal

police shootings over the past decade exceeds that of both Los Angeles

and New York, cities whose police practices have been severely

criticized.



<p>"This is a distinction none of us in San Diego welcome," said ACLU

Executive Director Linda Hills. "The community is entitled to an honest

assessment of how San Diego compares to other cities when it comes to

police use of deadly force."



 

<p>In February, 2000, the San Diego City Council held a special workshop

following the fatal shooting of William Miller, a homeless man who

brandished a stick at officers.  At that workshop, police officials

touted San Diego's ranking as second lowest in the nation for police

shootings in the 1997-99 period.



<p>The letter to Mayor Golding follows.  The Detroit Free Press article is

available at <a href="http://www.freep.com/news/statewire/sw12416_20000515.htm">freep.com/news/statewire/sw12416_20000515.htm</a>.  A chart of

the FBI statistics prepared by the Detroit Free Press is available on

request via fax.

<p>Mayor Susan Golding<br>

City of San Diego<br>

202 C St.<br>

San Diego, CA 92101



<p>Dear Mayor Golding:



<p>We are writing to express concern about the fact that San Diego is

ranked fourth in the nation in fatal police shootings. This fact

recently came to light in a study of FBI statistics conducted by the

Detroit Free Press, which is enclosed. According to this report, San

Diego's rate of fatal police shootings exceeds that of both Los Angeles

and New York,  whose police practices have been severely criticized in

recent months.  This is a distinction that none of us in San Diego

welcome.



<p>On February 22, 2000, following the controversial police shooting of

William Miller, the City Council held a special workshop to discuss the

use of force by our police department.  At that workshop, and in related

media reports about our deadly force policy, the Police Department

asserted that San Diego's record in this area was laudable.  For

example, an Assistant Chief stated at the workshop that we were second

lowest in the nation for police shootings in 1997-99.  These statements

seem to be at odds with the information reported by the Detroit Free

Press.



<p>We urge you to direct the City Manager to explain this discrepancy

immediately.  While we are aware that a special task force is studying

the police use of force issue generally, without an accurate starting

point with respect to how San Diego compares to other cities, this

discussion will be pointless.



<p>As you may know, our organizations and the San Diego Police Department

have worked together constructively as partners on a number of issues.

For example, at our urging, former Chief Jerry Sanders directed SDPD to

become the first law enforcement agency in the nation to collect racial

data on traffic stops, in order to enable us to address the phenomenon

of "Driving While Black or Brown."  Chief Bejarano has continued that

commitment to ensuring that SDPD does not engage in racial profiling in

traffic stops.  Earlier, the ACLU worked closely with then Captain

Bejarano to ensure that events during the Republican National Convention

were orderly, while also respecting the constitutional rights of

demonstrators.



<p>We are confident that we can look forward to a similar commitment to

honesty and responsiveness by the City in the matter of police use of

deadly force.  We no doubt share the goal of being last in the nation in

police shootings and first in the nation in public safety.  If we can be

of assistance as the City sorts out the discrepancy between the Chief's

statistics and those reported by the Detroit Free Press, please do not

hesitate to call on us.





<p>Sincerely,



<p>Linda Hills, ACLU<br>

H. J. Sims, Earl B. Gilliam Bar Association<br>

Alvin Gomez, La Raza Lawyers Association<br>

Randa Trapp, NAACP
