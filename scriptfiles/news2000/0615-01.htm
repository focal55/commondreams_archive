- June 15 - Clinton Administration lawyers who are proposing to

reinterpret the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in order to permit a

deployment decision of national missile defenses should be marched to the

banks of the Potomac and dumped in the river, said Council for a Livable

World in a statement released today.

<p>According to the June 15 New York Times ("Clinton Lawyers Give a Go-Ahead

to Missile Shield"), Administration lawyers are suggesting that the

President can authorize construction at an initial anti-missile site in

Alaska without violating the ABM Treaty.

<p>If the President chooses this option, he can move forward toward missile

defense deployment -- in theory protecting the political interests of Vice

President Gore -- while avoiding announcing a withdrawal from the ABM

Treaty and crushing arms control.

<p>These legal tricks are reminiscent of the questionable interpretations of

Reagan Administration lawyer Abraham Sofaer who claimed that the ABM Treaty

permitted Star Wars in the 1980's.

<p>It is also reminiscent of the legal maneuvers that the Russians tried to

use to justify building the Krasnoyarsk radar in the 1980's.

<p>John Isaacs, Council for a Livable World's president, condemned the

Clinton lawyers for their ignominious behavior:  "These lawyers believe

that because the President triangulated the Democratic and Republican

parties, he can now triangulate Russia and arms control."

<p>"Rather than trying to twist the treaty's meaning," added Isaacs, "the

President should defer a decision on national missile defense deployment

until the next Administration."

<p>"National missile defense is not ready for prime time, technologically,

politically or legally," concluded Isaacs.

<p>The Council is one of the nation's oldest and largest arms control

organizations.
