-  March 21 - Calling the situation of  East Timorese refugees in Indonesia "a criminal 

matter," East Timorese Nobel Laureate Jose Ramos-Horta urged their speedy 

return. He said that all but the commanders responsible for ongoing 

military and militia terror are welcome to return. These leaders must be 

called to account, and the international community "must take strong 

measures at all levels to put the Indonesian military in check."



<p>In a statement issued today, Ramos-Horta also praised Indonesian President 

Abdurrahman Wahid's efforts at reconciliation with East Timor and urged the 

international community to support democracy in Indonesia. "By suspending 

all military ties with that brutal military, the ... world will not only 

help stop the terror in West Timor, they will also strengthen the civilian 

government... [and] bring closer the day when the people of Indonesia can 

finally live in peace, free from military repression."



<p>Ramos-Horta called on the international community to push forward with its 

own tribunal, while supporting Indonesia's efforts to investigate and 

prosecute some of those responsible "for the nightmare of destruction East 

Timor has witnessed since 1975." He said, "such a tribunal would guarantee 

justice is served against the masterminds of genocide in the Indonesian 

military high command if Indonesia cannot meet standard international norms 

of due process." He urged the international community to clarify the 

standards that Indonesia must satisfy for credible prosecutions.



<p>Ramos-Horta, vice president of the National Council of Timorese Resistance 

(CNRT), said East Timorese are welcome to return "including those who 

collaborated with Indonesia... The CNRT will accept no reprisals against 

any of them. This is their country."



<p>He urged an intensive short-term increase in personnel in West Timor "to 

help with accompaniment of civilians. International aid workers must be 

sent in to the camps, to shine the light of international attention on what 

our people are

facing on a daily basis."

Statement by<br>

1996 Nobel Peace Prize Co-Laureate<br>

José Ramos-Horta<br><br>



The National Council of Timorese Resistance (CNRT) is deeply concerned 

about the dire situation still facing those East Timorese in militia and 

military-controlled camps in West Timor.<br><br>



More than a month ago, West Timor officials stated that nearly 500 East 

Timorese, including 310 children, have died due to inadequate sanitation 

and medical care in the camps. Sanitation and access to medical treatment 

in the camps is practically nonexistent. Attacks and intimidation by 

militia and military are an ongoing reality. Access by international aid 

groups to the refugees is extremely limited, and there have been many 

militia attacks on aid workers. That this situation continues six months 

after these East Timorese were driven into forced exile is a criminal 

matter that must be remedied immediately.<br><br>



The propaganda being spread through the camps by hard liners in the 

Indonesian military and their militia lackeys about violence in East Timor 

is making repatriation efforts much more difficult. We are committed to 

working together with the Indonesian government to explain to our East 

Timorese brothers and sisters that they can return safely, including those 

who collaborated with Indonesia.<br><br>



Those thousands who voted for autonomy with Indonesia and those militia 

members who collaborated with the Indonesian Army can feel safe returning 

to their homeland. The CNRT will accept no reprisals against any of them. 

This is their country, they belong here and all of us -- the resistance, 

the pro-autonomy groups -- must meet halfway, bury the past, consolidate 

peace and rebuild this country.<br><br>



However, there can be no tolerance for militia leadership that continues to 

oversee terror campaigns in West Timor, or cross-border and against Oecussi 

in East Timor. Those responsible for such premeditated savagery must be 

arrested immediately. Very recently, international peacekeepers near the 

border between East and West Timor came under fire from Indonesian 

military-backed militias four times in 24 hours. More recently, a 

cross-border raid into East Timor by either militias or military (in too 

many cases they are one and the same) killed one East Timorese civilian; a 

UN military spokesman said, "further harassment and killing of innocent 

locals could very well take place."<br><br>



We are relieved that at long last a militia boss in West Timor, Moko 

Soares, was arrested, but we are concerned over the nature of and authority 

over his pending trial in West Timor. More of those in the militia 

leadership that are still ordering attacks must be brought to trial, and 

their bosses in the Indonesian military should be called to account as 

well. If the Indonesian authorities in West Timor can, in the arrogant 

double speak of the Suharto era, say our people in the camps need to decide 

whether or not they will come home by the end of March, certainly the rest 

of the world can tell those authorities that the military thugs calling the 

shots need to decide to cut loose the militias this week.<br><br>



In East Timor we are beginning, with UNTAET, to establish our own judicial 

system, which will soon be ready to try those in East Timor arrested for 

militia or criminal violence.  But, our brothers and sisters will have a 

harder time practicing forgiveness here in East Timor if they know justice 

is not being served at the highest levels of power, through trials of those 

in the Indonesian military who are responsible for the nightmare of 

destruction East Timor has witnessed since 1975. This is also the only way 

to send a signal once and for all that the international community will not 

tolerate ongoing military aggression against innocent East Timorese 

civilians. For this reason, while we support the process of investigation 

and trials underway in Indonesia we also encourage the international 

community to push forward with support for a tribunal. Such a tribunal 

would guarantee justice served against the masterminds of genocide in the 

Indonesian military high command if Indonesia cannot meet standard 

international norms of due process.  The international community should 

clarify these standards now, and focus particular attention on the 

credibility of judicial personnel, witness protection, and military 

cooperation, and it should not allow selective immunity from prosecution.<br><br>



We were extremely grateful that President Wahid took the bold step of 

coming to East Timor and reaching out his hand in reconciliation. This 

gesture of goodwill, in which he acknowledged with regret the destruction 

of our country by the Indonesian military, was not taken lightly by the



East Timorese people. Nor will we forget that President Wahid supported our 

right to self-determination in the Suharto years. We are also grateful for 

his promise that Indonesian military support for the militia in West Timor 

will end, and look forward to seeing it fulfilled.<br><br>



The international community must support the pro-democracy movement and the 

civilian government in Indonesia by taking strong measures at all levels to 

put the Indonesian military in check. By suspending all military ties with 

that brutal military, the great countries of the world not only help stop 

the terror in West Timor, they also strengthen the civilian government of 

our friend Abdurrahman Wahid, and bring closer the day when the people of 

Indonesia can finally live in peace, free from military repression and the 

draconian "dual-function" that maintains it.  We are grateful for current 

restrictions and call for their continuation, until Indonesia is truly 

under civilian control, as well as fulfilling its commitments to legal 

accountability and the return of our people.<br><br>



To help speed the return home of our fellow East Timorese still in West 

Timor, we ask for an intensive short-term increase in personnel to help 

with accompaniment of civilians. International aid workers must be sent 

into the camps, to shine the light of international attention once more on 

what our people are facing on a daily basis.<br><br>



I thank you for your urgent attention to these vital matters.<br><br>
