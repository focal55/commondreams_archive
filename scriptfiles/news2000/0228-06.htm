- February 28 - “Press reports about BP divesting all of ARCO’s Alaska assets sound

encouraging but we really don’t know exactly what is on the table,” said

AKPIRG Executive Director Jim Sykes.  Sykes cautioned, “The deal could

still be bad for Alaska if assets are sold to multiple parties, an inactive

silent partner or a company that colludes with BP rather than competing.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are still many scenarios where BP could eliminate effective

competition, and recent history points in that direction.  Sykes said, “On

the other hand if all ARCO Alaska assets go to one single active

competitor, substantial competition could be restored and Alaska might not

be hurt by a BP-ARCO merger.”



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AKPIRG has fought to preserve meaningful competition in Alaska since BP’s

takeover of ARCO was announced.  “This development adds credibility to our

fight for a fair deal,” said Sykes.  “From the beginning it’s been clear

that the state failed to negotiate a good deal for Alaska in the ‘compact

agreement’ and news of BP’s significant offer is proof of that failure.”



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Sykes, it is essential that the new buyer be known and

approved before a merger takes place.  A determination needs to be made on

the realistic level of significant competition to which the new owner will

commit prior to approval.  Severe enforceable penalties for noncompliance

by BP and the new owner must also be part of any merger package.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even if Alaska monopoly issues are resolved, there may be other antitrust

problems regarding the West Coast and Cushing, Oklahoma interests.  AKPIRG

will monitor the situation closely and keep open the option of filing an

amicus brief in the pending legal case of FTC v. BP and ARCO.
