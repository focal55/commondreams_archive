- October 24 - A coalition of the nation's leading environmental, consumer and family farm organizations, including Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists, National Family Farm Coalition, Consumers Union, Environmental Defense, Friends of the Earth National Environmental Trust and others sent a joint letter to President Clinton today expressing concerns about the widespread contamination of the food supply by an unapproved variety of genetically engineered corn. StarLink, a gene altered corn approved only for animal feed, has been found to have widely contaminated the human food supply. The letter urges the President to intercede to insure that federal regulators do not bow to industry pressure by now approving the product retroactively.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The biotech industry promised keep this corn out of our food, and yet it's now been found in supermarkets across the country," said Charles Margulis, Greenpeace Genetic Engineering Specialist. "We call on President Clinton to insure that biotech companies are held responsible for failing to protect consumers from a potentially dangerous food."

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

StarLink, which produces an insecticidal protein called Cry9C, is not approved for human consumption over concerns that it could cause dangerous allergic responses in some people. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA's) review of StarLink found that many of the allergenicity data submitted on StarLink were "either inconclusive or indicate that Cry9C exhibits some characteristics of known allergens." On Friday, an EPA advisory panel heard from scientists who warned that there is no known safe level of allergens in food.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

But on Saturday, the Washington Post reported that government officials had suggested that a "solution" to the widespread StarLink contamination of the food supply is to approve some level of StarLink in food. Yesterday Reuters quoted anonymous government officials who denied that a "temporary" exemption for StarLink was in the works. But Legal Times reported yesterday that food and biotech industry lobbyists are pushing federal officials to declare StarLink to be safe for people, a ruling that could save companies hundreds of millions of dollars in potential recalls, lost sales and legal liability.

The industry must not now be rewarded for violating the law by an after-the-fact approval of a potentially dangerous product."

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Dear President Clinton,

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

We appreciate your involvement in the growing concerns about an unapproved variety of genetically engineered corn that has contaminated the human food supply. A number of food companies have recently withdrawn several products over concerns that StarLink, a genetically engineered crop approved only for animal feed, has contaminated their corn supply. Some of the nation's largest food makers are facing production problems due to their inability to find uncontaminated corn. 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

When a Kraft Foods product was found contaminated with StarLink corn, the company took responsible action by voluntarily recalling the product. Later, when the Food and Drug Administration confirmed the positive test result, the agency ordered a Class II recall. FDA defines a class II recall as "a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote." 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

We are very concerned about recent reports suggesting that foods now found to be contaminated with StarLink may be treated differently than the Kraft product. According to press reports, a "solution" to the problem of StarLink contamination now being considered by government officials is to exempt StarLink from the requirement for a tolerance, for food as well as feed uses. This would allow an unlimited amount of StarLink corn in the food supply. It would be unacceptable to approve this genetically engineered product in the human food supply simply for the convenience of industry. Any such action would show a troubling disregard for consumer protection that could only further erode consumers' confidence in our regulatory system for biotechnology products.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The biotechnology industry was permitted to sell StarLink to farmers on the condition that systems were in place to insure that the corn was used only for animal feed or industrial use. Mounting evidence shows that many farmers were unaware of the restrictions when sold StarLink seed. StarLink seed bags and seed contracts apparently confirm that many farmers were not informed of the restrictions agreed to by industry.  As a result, StarLink corn has pervasively contaminated the food supply.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The industry must not now be rewarded for violating the law by an after-the-fact approval of a potentially dangerous product. 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Scientists have concerns that StarLink corn could trigger potentially dangerous allergic responses in people. There is no known history of human dietary exposure to the Cry9C protein produced in StarLink corn. Moreover, the concentration of this protein in StarLink seeds is up to 100 times that of the Cry proteins found in other engineered corn varieties. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) review of StarLink found that many of the allergenicity data submitted on StarLink were "either inconclusive or indicate that Cry9C exhibits some characteristics of known allergens." There is no known safe level of allergens in food, as some scientists warned EPA just last Friday.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

We urgently request your swift and decisive action to insure that EPA does not retroactively approve StarLink corn for human consumption, and to see that FDA takes no action to set tolerance or action levels for Starlink corn. We also ask that you use your influence to insure that biotechnology companies that violate the law are held accountable for losses suffered by farmers and food producers. 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Science, not political expedience, should be the basis for regulatory action. We look forward to your leadership in this urgent matter.

</font></p>
