- May 16 - The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) today praised Procter & Gamble's decision to drop its advertising buy on Laura Schlessinger's upcoming syndicated television program.  In addition, a P&G spokesperson told GLAAD today that the company plans to stop advertising on Schlessinger's radio program. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In a statement released today, P&G said: "We have decided not to sponsor the Dr. Laura show. There has been controversy surrounding Dr. Laura on a number of topics. We've chosen not to be involved with a show that will require time and resources to deal with this kind of controversy. We were offered this opportunity as part of an on-going programming partnership. The focus of the show is intended to be responsible parenting. As we've studied it more closely, we've decided it isn't possible to separate the broad range of Dr. Laura's opinions from the specific focus of this program.  Stepping back, today there are lots of programming options and we've decided there are better ones for us." </font>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"GLAAD salutes Procter & Gamble's corporate responsibility and good conscience in its decision to discontinue advertising on Laura Schlessinger's programming," said GLAAD Executive Director Joan M. Garry.  "By doing so, the company has demonstrated the kind of respect for fair-minded people everywhere that we would like to see from Paramount, which plans to produce and distribute Schlessinger's TV program this fall." </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> P&G also has backed away from its advertising on Schlessinger's radio program.  According to P&G spokesperson Gretchen Briscoe:  "We currently do have ads on Dr. Laura's radio program, although for the reasons enumerated in today's statement, we do not anticipate any future advertising purchases." </font>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We certainly are encouraged and heartened that Procter & Gamble made this decision," said Gary Wright, a member of the GABLE/P&G Leadership Team (Procter & Gamble's gay, bisexual and lesbian employee group). </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Criticism of Schlessinger's anti-gay commentaries has intensified in the last year, with the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council ruling last week that her broadcasts were "abusively discriminatory" toward lesbians and gay men. Also, GLAAD and local lesbian and gay community members have been meeting with local television station management in the nation's top media markets about Schlessinger's program.  Affiliates in Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco have announced that they will be screening each show for offensive or defamatory content. </font>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) is dedicated to promoting and ensuring fair, accurate, and inclusive representation of individuals and events in all media as a means of eliminating homophobia and discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.</i> </font>
