- March 1 - The Sierra Club today blasted ads that are being run in New York by

     "Republicans for Clean Air," which praise Governor George W. Bush's

     clean air record in Texas.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Praising George Bush on clean air is like thanking John Rocker for

     his contribution to civil rights," said Susan Holmes, Sierra Club New

     York Regional Representative.  "This ad is an insult to New York

     Republicans who are smart enough to see past Bush's smoke and

     mirrors."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The ad is littered with half-truths:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     HALF-TRUTH: "[Bush] led one of the first states to clamp down on old

     coal-burning electric plants."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     TRUTH: That half-truth is referring to "grandfathered" plants built

     before 1972, which are not subject to the Texas' clean air laws.  Bush

     "clamped down" on those grandfathered plants with a voluntary plan

     that was written by industry. According to Time, the result of Bush's

     voluntary policy is "only 33 of the 160 biggest industrial plants have

     volunteered.  Of those 33, only three have taken steps to cut their

     emissions.  Questioned about this during his interview with Time, Bush

     became irritated." (2-21-00)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The Dallas Morning News concluded that "[Bush's] voluntary

     anti-pollution initiatives have produced only marginal improvements."

     (11-14-99) Furthermore, the bill that deals with these plants, Senate

     Bill 7, only affects 2 of Texas' 18 grandfathered plants.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     HALF-TRUTH: "New York Republicans care about clear air.  So does

     Governor Bush."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     TRUTH: One of New York's biggest environmental victories this year has

     been the state's lawsuit against Midwestern coal-burning plants, which

     was eventually joined by the EPA.  However, lawsuits which protect New

     Yorkers are likely to be opposed by a Bush Administration.  In a

     November interview, he told The New York Times, "the best way to

     achieve clean air and water was `to not try to sue our way or regulate

     our way to clean air and clean water.'" (11-9-99)

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The truth is that there is no way to spin the Bush record on air

     pollution in Texas," said Holmes. "Texas is No 1 in toxic releases,

     No. 1 in total toxic air emissions from industrial facilities, No. 1

     in toxic chemical accidents, No. 1 in cancer-causing pollution.  And

     in 1999, Houston became the Smog Capital of the United States,

     grabbing the No. 1 spot from Los Angeles."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The ad is sponsored by an unknown organization "Republicans for Clean

     Air," which does not have a website.  A LEXIS-NEXIS search found that

     the organization has not appeared in any news stories.</font>
