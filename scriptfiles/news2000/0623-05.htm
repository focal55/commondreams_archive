- June 23 - Soaring gas prices have



unleashed a wave of dubious remedies, from eliminating clean air laws



to increasing U.S. oil drilling.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But a better solution lies in reducing oil consumption by making



Detroit's hottest product, the Sport Utility Vehicle, more



fuel-efficient. If SUVs were as clean as the average car, oil



consumption in the United States would be down 5 percent from a



decade ago; instead it is up over 10 percent. And fuel use will



continue to grow if the SUV craze continues.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Repealing air quality laws or drilling in pristine wilderness to



ease gas prices is like shooting yourself in the foot to cure a



headache," said Jason Mark, transportation program co-director at the



Union of Concerned Scientists. "Since SUVs are the leading cause of



increased gasoline consumption, making these vehicles more efficient



provides better long-term protection."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current loopholes in federal fuel efficiency standards allow SUVs



and other light trucks to burn more gasoline than cars. The loopholes



leave consumers and the environment to bear the burden of



gas-guzzling SUVs. On average, light trucks use 42 percent more fuel



than cars to travel each mile, costing their drivers an extra $27



billion this year at the pump. Less efficient light trucks have meant



an additional 240 million tons per year of global warming pollution



entering our atmosphere.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the technology exists to remedy these problems. A UCS report



released last year, Greener SUVs, laid out the technological pathways



to protect the planet and save drivers money. Stronger fuel economy



standards would give automakers the incentive to use these



technologies.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If new trucks were as efficient as today's cars, consumers would



save more than $3,500 over the life of the vehicle at today's



prices," said Mark. "Automakers have the technologies to bridge the



gas guzzling gap, but government and consumers need to pressure



Detroit to install them."
