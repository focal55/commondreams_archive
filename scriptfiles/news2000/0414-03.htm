- April 14 - Greenpeace today called on the EU to take a firm position on the trade in ivory, White Sharks and tortoiseshells from the endangered Hawksbill Sea Turtle at the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) that is taking place this week in Nairobi, Kenya.

<p>"Greenpeace applauds the EU for its stand against Japan and Norway's

proposals to trade in whale meat and blubber and for its urgently needed support for two shark species. However, indecision over the fate of elephants and the endangered Hawksbill Turtle and its failure to support a total ban on trade in the Great White Shark is of serious concern.  It's imperative that these species are also protected from trade," said Peter Pueschel of Greenpeace International.

<p>EU delegates have not reached a majority vote amongst community members to support an Appendix 1 CITES listing for the African Elephant. Both Kenya and India are calling for a re-establishment of a trade ban on ivory as poaching has increased dramatically in both countries since the ban was eased in South African countries by CITES in 1997. Not only the African but the Asian elephant is suffering from increased poaching as a result of this move. Other countries have also reported illegal kills of elephants and exports in ivory, including Zimbabwe, which is one of the strongest advocates for opening the ivory trade.

<p>The EU's position is still unclear despite revelations by the delegationof India that poaching has increased and up to 50 park wardens and senior officials have been killed each year since CITES allowed the ivory trade to resume.

<p>'It's not just the elephants that are killed for ivory', added Pueschel. "It's clear that it's impossible to control poaching and illegal trade in high value commodities such as ivory, turtle shell or whale products. Only an international trade ban gives these species the protection they need," added Pueschel.
