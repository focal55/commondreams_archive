- March 1 - </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">REV. JIM WALLIS, (202) 328-8842 ext. 225, <a href="mailto:jimwallis@sojourners.com">jimwallis@sojourners.com</a>,

<a href="http://www.sojourners.com">http://www.sojourners.com</a><br>

Editor-in-chief of Sojourners magazine, Rev. Wallis said: "Al Gore and

George W. Bush have talked about how much Jesus influenced them. The

question has been whether that's an appropriate thing for a candidate to

talk about. It is very appropriate for a candidate to speak of their

personal faith -- if they say what it means in relation to public policy

issues. So what would Jesus say about poverty in the midst of prosperity?

What would Jesus say about 44 million Americans without health

insurance?.... Talking about whether Bush's speech at Bob Jones University

will affect how Catholics vote is a way of pretending to talk about religion

while actually just horseracing the field. The real question is how the

candidates will relate to the growing importance of faith-based

organizations."

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">REV. LUCIUS WALKER, (212) 926-5757, <a href="mailto:ifco@igc.org">ifco@igc.org</a>, <a href="http://www.ifconews.org">http://www.ifconews.org</a><br>

Executive director of the Interreligious Foundation for Community

Organization, Rev. Walker said: "The presidential election is largely about

the buying and selling of public office and that's morally reprehensible.

The method of the election of the highest office is morally bankrupt because

it's dependent on the god of green rather than the God of the scriptures. We

need to drive the money changers from the temple of our democracy.... The

margin of difference between the major candidates is fairly narrow -- they're

two sides of the same coin."

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">REV. </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MEL WHITE, (949) 455-0999, <a href="mailto:revmel@aol.com">revmel@aol.com</a>, <a href="http://www.soulforce.com">http://www.soulforce.com</a><br>

Rev. White is co-chair of Soulforce, a network of people of faith committed

to applying Gandhi's principles of nonviolence to the liberation of sexual

minorities. Before coming out as a gay man, White was a ghost writer for

leaders of the "religious right" including Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell.

"The fundamentalist right frequently condemns people who disagree with

them," Dr. White said. "Now Mr. McCain has condemned the fundamentalist

right with equal fury. What have we gained? Nothing. We need political

leaders who understand that ends do not justify the means. Right, left, or

center, we are fellow Americans, sisters and brothers, children of the same

Creator. If a person wants to bring us together as our President, he or she

must bring us together as a candidate as well. These political campaigns

stir up divisiveness. They leave us worse off than when we started.

Demeaning and caricaturing our enemies only leads to anger and violence. I

agree with Mr. McCain that the rhetoric of Robertson and Falwell is

dangerous and untrustworthy. But when I stoop to that same kind of rhetoric

in condemning them, I become dangerous and untrustworthy myself."
