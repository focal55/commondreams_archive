<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- March 10 - In what amounts to a major victory for free

speech rights of consumers on the Internet, Terminix Corporation and its corporate

affiliates have abandoned a lawsuit they filed last year aiming to shut down a Web site

featuring comments from disgruntled Terminix customers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The voluntary dismissal of the case is a triumph for the

consumer&#146;s right to criticize corporations on the World Wide Web, said Paul Alan

Levy, a Public Citizen attorney who defended the Californian who launched the Web site.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Had this case succeeded, it would have encouraged other

corporations to sue citizens who create Web sites to publicize their complaints about the

way they have been treated,&quot; Levy said. &quot;The dismissal of this case without the

expense of discovery or trial, on the other hand, sends a message to other companies that

the way to respond to criticism is by answering it, not by suing to stop it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In October, Terminix, the well-known pest control company, along

with its parent corporation, ServiceMaster, and several ServiceMaster subsidiaries, sued

Carla Virga, a secretary from Yuba City, Calif. Terminix filed the suit in federal court

in Memphis, Terminix&#146;s hometown, seeking damages and a preliminary injunction against

Virga. Virga had created a Web site that criticized Terminix because its inspectors had

failed to find problems with a house that she had purchased. The Web site grew into a

general forum for consumer criticism of Terminix.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Terminix earlier had sued Virga for defamation in California court,

but the lawsuit was thrown out as meritless. After that, Virga expanded the site further,

adding a page devoted to criticism of ServiceMaster and its subsidiaries. The corporations

responded with the current lawsuit, which alleged that by using their names on her Web

page, Virga was violating their trademarks. They alleged that Virga was not entitled

either to display their names on the Web site or to list their names among her &quot;meta

tags,&quot; a form of Internet code that is widely used to describe Web sites in a way

that helps people using search engines locate Web pages in which they may be interested.

Although Virga&#146;s site is non-commercial and thus not covered by the trademark laws,

the corporations demanded that the district court enter a preliminary injunction barring

any use of their names on her site.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Virga contacted Public Citizen, which in turn contacted lawyers at

two prominent Tennessee law firms. In early December, Virga moved to dismiss the lawsuit

because it violated her free speech rights and asked that the preliminary injunction be

denied. In addition, she asked for an injunction labeling Terminix a &quot;nuisance

litigant&quot; and requiring it to provide special justifications before suing her again

in the future. She argued that the trademark claim was meritless, that it violated her

free speech rights, and that it should have been included in the first suit Terminix

brought against her. She also objected to the fact that she had been sued in Tennessee

instead of her home state of California.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More recently, Virga asked the district court to stay any discovery

against her while the court decided whether the lawsuit should be dismissed. The court

granted that motion at the end of February. This week, Terminix withdrew the case.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Although Carla Virga is pleased that the lawsuit has been

withdrawn, Terminix&#146;s legal harassment has caused her considerable anguish, not to

speak of costing a substantial amount of time and expenses,&quot; Levy said. &quot;She

will be reviewing her options about how to obtain redress for those wrongs, not to speak

of teaching Terminix, and companies like it, the lesson that such lawsuits are not an

acceptable way to respond to criticism.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These options include seeking attorneys fees and filing suit for

malicious prosecution and abuse of process in California, Levy said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Levy credited the victory in part to the substantial media attention

that Terminix&#146;s lawsuit attracted, which in turn led to a number of complaints on

investor bulletin boards about the lawsuit. A recent court filing from Terminix complained

bitterly about the adverse publicity that the lawsuit had received and about the

unexpectedly strong legal defense that Virga had been able to mount.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Tennessee lawyers who volunteered their services to help Virga

were Lucian Pera and Brian Faughnan of Armstrong Allen in Memphis, and Thor Urness, a

trademark specialist from Boult, Cummings, Conners and Berry in Nashville. The First

Amendment Project in Oakland, Calif., also played a key role in locating counsel in

Tennessee. Virga received substantial pro bono assistance from her Internet experts,

Charlene Cunniffe, an Internet specialist at Boult Cummings, and Danny Sullivan, a leading

international authority on search engines.</font></p>
