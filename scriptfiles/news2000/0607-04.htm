- June 7 - Greenpeace today called upon the French 

Government to reject an application by the operators of the giant La Hague 

reprocessing plant, COGEMA, to increase its production capacity which 

would lead to significant increases in radioactive discharges.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such increases in radioactive discharges,  which pollute the coastline from 

France to the Arctic,  would be contrary to Franceís international obligation 

under the OSPAR Convention on Marine Pollution. The OSPAR member 

states meet annually to adopt measures necessary to comply with the 

Convention. They include: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, 

Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, 

Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The European Union is also 

a member.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace has released three new reports(1) which show that by ending 

reprocessing and instead adopting a policy of above ground dry storage for 

spent nuclear fuel France could meet its obligation under OSPAR to bring 

about ìsubstantial reductionsî of radioactive discharges to the sea. In 

addition, spent fuel storage would reduce the risk of accidental releases from 

the site and be significantly cheaper.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reports have been submitted to the French Government and the OSPAR 

Convention. In particular they demonstrate how France could support a 

resolution that has been tabled by the Danish Government, with the support 

of Ireland, Iceland and Norway, which calls for an immediate suspension of 

nuclear reprocessing. The Danish proposal will be considered at the annual 

meeting of OSPAR which will take place in Copenhagen between June 26 

and 30.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace nuclear campaigner, Jean-Luc Thiery said: "Reprocessing 

makes no economic, environmental or safety sense. The government should 

now honour its promise from 1997 to produce a zero discharge option for 

the La Hague site. Such an option would inevitably involve a rejection of 

continued reprocessing in favour of on-site above ground dry storage."

Among the conclusions of the reports are:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Operations at La Hague create large inventories of long-lived 

radioactive 

material, especially in spent fuel pools and high-level radioactive waste 

(HLW) facilities.  For example, the stock of cesium-137 in the fuel pools and 

vitrified HLW stores at La Hague is hundreds of times larger than the amount 

of cesium-137 that was released in the 1986 Chernobyl reactor accident.  

About 27 kg of cesium-137 was released into the atmosphere at Chernobyl, and accounted for most of the 

offsite radiation exposure from this accident.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aloss of water from a spent fuel pool at La Hague could potentially 

cause a

 radioactive release whose offsite consequences would be hundreds of times 

greater than the consequences of the Chernobyl accident. Spent fuel storage 

would reduce the hazard potential at La Hague.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

*	Discharges of several radio-nuclides have steadily increased in recent 

years. If granted the new authorisation would see the discharges of some 

important radionuclides, notably tritium, carbon-14, krypton-85 and iodine-

129 increase significantly.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

*	Collective doses are very large for La Hague discharges, comparable 

with some major nuclear accidents in the past and could be reduced by three 

or four orders of magnitude if spent fuel was stored and not reprocessed.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	Around three quarters of the spent nuclear fuel from the world's 

nuclear power stations is not reprocessed, but stored. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	Storage is between 2 and 3 times cheaper than reprocessing.</font>
