- April 26 - Some of the nation's leading consumer and public

interest groups are petitioning the federal government to block the

merger of America Online (AOL), Inc. and Time Warner, Inc., unless

the transaction is significantly restructured.<br>

</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumers Union (CU), Consumer Federation of America (CFA), Media

Access Project (MAP), and the Center for Media Education (CME) filed

a <a href="http://www.consumersunion.org/telecom/aol2_info_page.htm">formal petition</a> with

the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) today in opposition to

the deal, which would fuse the country's largest online company with

the world's biggest media and entertainment conglomerate.<br>

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups contend that the merger would reduce the diversity and

program choices in video and Internet content. They also believe that

it would impede innovation and economic growth in the Internet

sector.<br>

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "petition to deny" seeks to block FCC approval of the merger.

It is accompanied by a report that details a wide array of harms and

legal violations that the groups believe would result from the

merger. Among the findings:<br>

</font></p>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#183; The merger would allow two enormous firms to

   dominate the markets for broadband and narrowband Internet

   services, cable television, and other entertainment services,

   which could leave consumers with higher prices, fewer choices, and

   the stifling of free expression on the Internet.<br>

   

   

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#183; The business links between AOL Time Warner and

   telecommunications giant AT&amp;T would create cross ownership

   problems that violate antitrust merger guidelines and the FCC's

   public interest principles.<br>

   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#183; AOL was once a vigorous advocate for rules to require

   that cable wires be left open to competitors to provide Internet

   services. Now that AOL stands to become the owner of cable

   properties, it has changed its view, arguing that open access

   should be more limited and merely voluntary.<br>

   </font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"AOL Time Warner involves a complex web of cable and Internet

properties that would be in a position to thwart competition in many

markets across the country," said Gene Kimmelman, Co-Director of CU's

Washington DC office. "This merger links AOL with AT&amp;T, making

them the two largest cable companies in the United States controlling

over half of America's cable lines and nearly half of the

most-watched channels on cable TV. They would also control access to

more than half of the narrowband Internet subscribers and

three-quarters of the broadband Internet customers," Kimmelman

said.<br>

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Before AOL purchased a cable company, it claimed that the cable

industry had such a stranglehold on the emerging Internet that

regulators need to impose nondiscriminatory open access rules for

broadband transmission," said Dr. Mark Cooper, Research Director for

CFA and lead author of the report. "The voluntary open access it has

offered in its Memorandum of Understanding with Time Warner does not

even come close. That is why we are asking the FCC to impose AOL's

own nondiscrimination rules on AOL's cable affiliates."<br>

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Emerging technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for a

wide range of civic discourse and innovative forms of program

content," said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, MAP President and CEO.

"However, the sheer size of these two companies' assets and their

inadequate commitment to open access fall short of what the public

interest requires and the law permits," Schwartzman stated.<br>

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Companies such as AOL-Time Warner and AT&amp;T, which control

both conduit and content, need to be held to a high public standard,"

observed Jeffrey Chester, Executive Director of CME. "They will wield

tremendous power in the marketplace of ideas, with the ability to

shape the future of the Internet and other digital media. The FCC can

no longer afford to sit back and watch this parade of media giants

march by without enacting the necessary safeguards to ensure open,

fair, and competitive access."<br>
