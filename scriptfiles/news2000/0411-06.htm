Greenpeace activists attempted to stop  BP Amoco’s controversial Northstar offshore oil project. 

Braving wind chills of minus 50 degrees F (-46C), activists towed a fiberglass dome with two others 

inside into the construction area. Meanwhile two activists made for Seal Island displaying banners 

reading "Stop BP’s Northstar, Save the Climate." As police and security guards attempted to 

remove the protestors from inside the hut, Alaska State Police, North Slope Borough Police and BP 

security personnel tried to block all video documentation of the event. Five Greenpeace activists are 

now in police custody.

Today’s events follow the arrest yesterday of four other activists who tried to stop the laying of 

a dangerous and untested subsea  pipeline that will carry oil from the site six miles offshore.   

Greenpeace has maintained a protest camp near the Northstar site for the past six weeks. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

BP Amoco’s Northstar project is the spearhead for oil development in the Beaufort Sea, which will 

lead to a sprawl of oilrigs across the Arctic Ocean. Greenpeace and other groups including Alaska  

Natives and responsible investment organizations are opposed to new oil development in the Arctic 

because of the dual threats of oil spills and global warming. Recent studies by NASA have confirmed  

that in the polar regions, global warming has already taken a significant toll as the ice pack melts 

eliminating habitat and hunting grounds for marine mammals such as polar bears and walrus. In  

the past two decades Arctic sea ice equivalent to an area the size of the state of Texas has melted away. 

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"BP and the State of Alaska can trample on free speech and  freedom of the press in their own backyard, 

but Greenpeace will continue to oppose Northstar until BP Amoco shifts its resources to sustainable 

renewable energy" said Melanie Duchin climate campaigner at Greenpeace Ice Camp Sirius, on the Arctic 

Ocean. "It is irresponsible to continue to develop the Northstar project when we know that we can not 

afford to use even a quarter of known fossil fuel reserves if we are to avoid dangerous climate change." 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

On Thursday April 13th, BP Amoco will hold its Annual General Meeting for shareholders in London.  At 

this meeting, shareholders will vote on a resolution which calls on the company to switch away from 

high-risk, environmentally harmful ventures like Northstar, and reinvest resources in solar and clean, 

renewable sources of energy. Although BP Amoco has aggressively promoted its solar division as proof 

it is concerned about global warming, the company actually spends over 100 times more on oil exploration 

and production. 

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"BP Amoco knows that oil fuels climate change and that clean, renewable energy is technologically 

available, but it is stalling  widespread commercialization to the detriment of the climate and  

the Arctic environment," said Duchin.</font>
