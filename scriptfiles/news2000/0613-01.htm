- June 13 - U.S. government policies planned for Colombia might push more people off their land in a country that already ranks as the second largest producer of internally displaced people in the world, the U.S. Committee for Refugees (USCR) said today.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

	A U.S. aid plan that will fumigate Colombia's coca fields as part of anti-drug efforts will destroy tens of thousands of small farms growing banana, yucca, corn, and other crops, rural citizens in Colombia's Putumayo Department told USCR in recent days.  USCR Senior Policy Analyst Hiram Ruiz has just completed a three-week site visit to Colombia, including to Putumayo in the country's southern Amazon region.

</font>

<p>

	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Farmers in Putumayo whose lands have already been fumigated have compiled convincing evidence of the serious effects on the land and the people," Ruiz says.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

	Some 1.8 million Colombians are already uprooted from their homes after years of conflict and human rights abuse.  About 280,000 Colombians fled their homes last year; an additional 50,000 or more have fled their homes in the first five months of this year.

Information about Colombia's widespread population displacement is contained in the <a href="http://www.refugeesusa.org/store/individual1.cfm?item_id=2032"><i>World Refugee Survey 2000</i></a>, a report released today by USCR.  The <i>World Refugee Survey </i>annually assesses conditions affecting refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons worldwide.  This year's 328-page study contains reports on Colombia and 125 other countries.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

	Colombian farmers interviewed by USCR in recent days assert that the U.S.-sponsored fumigation will affect many areas that do not contain large coca plantations.  In every region of Putumayo visited by USCR, peasant associations stressed that they want to stop cultivating coca and are willing to pull up the coca plants by hand.  But they need financial help to begin new crops and transport those products to market.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Throughout Colombia, displaced people are increasingly frustrated and angry about their government's failure to help them stabilize their lives, Ruiz reports.  Many people displaced several years live in misery, their children often not in school, with little hope for any improvement in their situation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

	The Colombian government has improved its response to newly displaced families and others needing emergency assistance, according to Ruiz.  Colombian officials say they plan to improve conditions for those who have been displaced longer.  But officials say they lack the resources to implement these plans.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

That is little consolation to desperate displaced people, groups of whom have begun to take aggressive action to assert their demands for help.  In the past year, several groups have taken over and occupied the offices of the government and international agencies.

At least 350 displaced people have occupied the offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for more than six months.  They told Ruiz last week that they want to negotiate an end to the situation and are afraid that local police will try to force them out, which could endanger the more than 90 children in the group.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

But negotiations have broken down.  Officials told Ruiz that the government cannot meet the protesters' demands for income-generating projects because it cannot do the same for other displaced people.  The protesters say they are only asking for what the government itself has said it should be providing.
