- June 27 - The Sierra Club today applauded Vice President Al Gore's

     call to clean up power plants to protect our families from global

     warming and air pollution.  By instituting tough, comprehensive

     standards to cut emissions from outdated power plants, the United

     States could reduce greenhouse gas pollution, cut soot and smog,

     reduce excessive energy consumption, and help all Americans breathe

     easier.

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Vice President Gore's plan to clean up America's aging power plants

     could stop their smokestacks from belching so much global warming

     pollution and lung-burning soot and smog," said Carl Pope, Sierra

     Club's executive director.  "On summer days, our children should be

     playing outside, not locked indoors because air pollution has worsened

     their asthma.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Tough, comprehensive standards like those outlined by Vice President

     Gore will help Americans breathe healthier air and protect our

     climate," Pope added.  "By committing $180 billion over 10 years to

     this effort, the Vice President has signaled that tackling the

     nation's global warming pollution and cutting air pollution are among

     his top priorities.  In contrast, Texas Gov. George W. Bush's energy

     policy is to drill the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which is as

     foolhardy as damming the Grand Canyon for hydroelectric power."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Pope welcomed today's power-plant announcement, and said he looks

     forward to the Vice President outlining his plan for improving the

     fuel economy of the nation's cars, sport-utility vehicles and other

     light trucks.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We applaud the Vice President's opening salvo in the fight to reduce

     America's excessive energy consumption.   We look forward to working

     with the Vice President to cut our gas guzzling with new modern

     technologies.  Starting with raising Corporate Average Fuel Economy

     (CAFE) standards, our nation can end its dependence on foreign oil and

     save consumers millions at the gas pump while slashing pollution,"

     Pope said.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As we make the transition to cleaner power plants and to cars and

     light trucks that go farther on a gallon of gas, we must consider the

     people employed in those industries," Pope said.  "We believe any

     solution can both clean up our environment and protect coal miners and

     autoworkers."</font>
