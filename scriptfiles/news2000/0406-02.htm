- April 6 - The United States suffered nearly $200 billion in economic losses due to extreme weather in the 1990s&#150;the hottest decade on record&#150;including $14 billion in damage in 1999, according to <i><b>Storm Warning: Global Warming and the Rising Costs of Extreme Weather</b></i>, a new report released by U.S. PIRG.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, which assesses the insured losses and disaster relief funds connected to extreme weather events<i><b>, </b></i>demonstrates that recent weather-related disasters are part of a global trend of rising frequencies and costs of extreme weather, consistent with scientists&#146; projections of the impacts of global warming. Global warming is caused primarily by power plant, industry and automobile pollution. Scientists predict extreme weather events like heat waves, droughts, fires, downpours, and floods, to occur more often and more intensely as global temperatures rise.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Polluting industries say that it will cost too much to tackle the problem of global warming. This report shows that we can&#146;t afford not to,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Legislative Director Anna Aurilio. &quot;If we fail to curb global warming pollution, we are flirting with disaster. The costs will only continue to increase.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1999, the U.S. experienced one of its worst droughts ever recorded. Nearly two-thirds of the country suffered severe and persistent heat waves, killing 257 Americans and thousands of cattle in July alone. Hurricane Floyd killed 78 people and about three million farm animals, causing an estimated $6 billion in damages in North Carolina alone, the worst disaster ever for that state.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;People around the country are suffering&#150;losing their homes, their businesses, and even loved ones,&quot; said Aurilio. &quot;By failing to take action, Congress and the President are turning their back on the families, farms, and businesses across the country that increasingly find themselves in harm&#146;s way.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the report&#146;s findings:</font></p>

<ul>

							

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the United States, weather-related natural disasters in the 1990s took nearly 4,000 lives and caused nearly $200 billion in economic loss, including 450 lives and $14 billion in economic loss for 1999. Worldwide, the weather disaster toll was more than 330,000 lives and more than $625 billion in economic loss, including 52,000 lives and $68 billion in economic loss for 1999.

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Worldwide, the number of great weather disasters in the 1990s is more than five times the number for the 1950s, and damages are more than ten times as high (adjusted for inflation).

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The average number of weather-related disaster declarations has more than doubled in recent years, with the 47 declarations in 1999 far exceeding the average 21.7 disaster declarations per year during the 1980s.

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Farm states were particularly hard hit by extreme weather, comprising seven of the top ten states in per capita damages in the 1990s, and nine of the top ten in 1999.

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The five states with the highest amount of weather damage (insured loss and government assistance) in 1999 were, in descending order: North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and Virginia.

							</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The five states with the highest amount of weather damage (insured loss and government assistance) in the 1990s were, in descending order: Florida, Texas, California, North Carolina, and Minnesota.

						</font>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is impossible to link definitively any single weather event with global warming. However, the enormous economic and human costs of extreme weather damage today and scientists&#146; warnings of even more destruction to come, make it imperative that Congress invests in pollution reduction policies against such risk.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Noting that curbing global warming will require major reductions in emissions of global warming pollution, the report recommends adoption of the Earth Day Clean Energy Agenda. This agenda is supported by the nation&#146;s leading environmental groups and is the theme of this year&#146;s 30th anniversary of Earth Day. The Agenda&#146;s four platforms&#150;Clean Power, Clean Air, Clean Cars, and Clean Investments&#150;provide simple, effective ways to reduce global warming pollution, including raising miles-per-gallon standards for automobiles and cleaning up old, dirty coal-fired power plants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We simply cannot afford to ignore this storm warning,&quot; said Aurilio. &quot;The Earth Day Clean Energy Agenda lays out an effective, achievable blueprint for reducing global warming pollution in the U.S. Members of Congress should represent the interests of the American people, not the polluters emitting global warming pollution, and should commit to endorsing the Earth Day Clean Energy Agenda.&quot;</font></p>
