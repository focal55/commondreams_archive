- July 17 - The U.S. Forest Service asked the public for opinions on

     their proposal to protect the last wild areas of our National Forests,

     and American's weren't shy.  With the comment period closing today, an

     estimated one million letters, emails and postcards are flooding the

     Forest Service offices.  An unprecedented number of Americans have

     stood up to support remaining wild forests by urging a halt to logging

     and roadbuilding in roadless areas and calling for immediate

     protection for the Tongass National Forest in Alaska.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In meetings across the nation, in letters and postcards and in

     newspaper editorials, Americans have sent President Clinton a very

     clear message-- fully protect our remaining wild forests from roads,

     logging and other destruction, and don't delay," said Debbie Sease,

     Sierra Club Legislative Director.  "Americans want to save these

     treasured places where they love to hunt, hike, fish and camp.  These

     unspoiled forests provide some of our nation's best wildlife habitat,

     and provide millions of Americans with clean drinking water."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Support for wild National Forests was abundant at hearings in places

     such as Atlanta, GA where 48 spoke in favor of greater protection, 18

     spoke against; and Seattle, WA where 217 spoke in favor of greater

     protection, and only 2 spoke against.  However, this support extended

     to smaller, rural communities as well, such as:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Hood River, OR:    45 spoke in favor of protecting roadless areas,

                        only 3 spoke against the proposal.

     Lufkin, TX:        24 spoke for greater protection, 5 against in the

                        home of the Texas Forestry Museum.

     Sitka, AK:         63 spoke for greater protection, 3 against.

     Seneca, WV:        33 spoke for greater protection, 6 against.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     In addition to the outpouring at hearings, conservationists estimate

     that Americans have sent over one million letters, emails and

     postcards to the Forest Service.  This unprecedented outpouring is

     nearly four times the previous record of 275,000, notched as part of

     the 1998 debate over organic food standards.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Editorial boards have joined the chorus:

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"What little `roadless' area left - only about 12% of the state, a

     much smaller slice than most people think - must carry a huge

     responsibility for unspoiled hunting, clean water, wildlife and fish

     habitat, camping, hiking, spiritual renewal and other activities that

     require and demand distance from cars and snowmobiles and

     development."<i><br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Should the nation's roadless forests remain open to future road

     construction to promote logging?  The short-answer: No._The ban

     excludes the Tongass National Forest in Alaska-- a better solution

     would be to ban road building and to ban logging there as well."<i><br>
