- June 2 - Governor George W Bush's unprecedented reprieve granted to a Texas death row inmate

     minutes before his execution yesterday represents a small pause in the Texas machinery of

     death, Amnesty International said today.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 30-day reprieve granted to Ricky McGinn shows that even a state that has executed

     men and women at a rate of one every two weeks for the past five and a half years can be

     susceptible to increased scrutiny," the organization added. 

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The pressure on Texas and US authorities against judicial killing must be maintained and

     increased."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Ricky McGinn's execution was blocked 20 minutes before it was due, to allow for new

     DNA tests to be carried out to examine his claim that he did not rape and murder his

     12-year-old stepdaughter in 1993. It was the first time that Governor Bush has used his

     power to authorize such a reprieve since taking office in January 1995, a period which has

     seen some 131 executions. 

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While we support DNA testing for death row inmates, the death penalty can never be free

     from the risk of fatal error. Only abolition can guarantee that," Amnesty International said,

     noting that Troy Farris, James Beathard, and Odell Barnes all went to their deaths in Texas

     in the past 18 months despite serious doubts over their guilt. Odell Barnes's execution

     caused international outrage.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Gary Graham, also known as Shaka Sankofa, is one of 14 men scheduled for execution in

     Texas in the next 12 weeks. He was convicted on the basis of a single, disputed,

     eyewitness testimony. No physical evidence links him to the crime. No DNA testing could

     help exonerate him if indeed he was wrongfully convicted and condemned, as he has

     claimed for the past 19 years. He is scheduled for lethal injection on 22 June.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We do not know whether Gary Graham is guilty or innocent of the murder of which he

     was sentenced to die more than half his lifetime ago," Amnesty International said. 

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"But neither will Governor Bush or his appointees on the state's clemency board when the

     case comes before them. It remains to be seen if they will let Gary Graham go to his death

     with serious questions about his conviction remaining." 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Guilt or innocence aside, Gary Graham's death sentence violates international law

     forbidding the use of the death penalty against those who were under 18 at the time of the

     crime.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Whilst Ricky McGinn's reprieve is a victory for him and his appeal lawyers, it must not be

     forgotten that the risk to the wrongfully convicted is not the only injustice being perpetrated

     against capital defendants in Texas," Amnesty International said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Texas frequently violates international standards in its relentless pursuit of judicial killing,

     including in its use of the death penalty against the mentally impaired, children, foreign

     nationals deprived of the rights to consular access, and the routine denial of indigent

     defendants to adequate legal representation. 

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"All those concerned for human rights should draw strength from Ricky McGinn's reprieve,"

     Amnesty International said. "It shows that even the leading US death penalty state, one that

     executes more than most countries, can be made to hesitate."

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The leadership in Texas, and across the USA as a whole, must now focus on the bigger

     picture. The death penalty is a cruel, outdated, ineffective, and fallible punishment which

     must be abolished," Amnesty International concluded.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Background</b><br>

     Texas accounts for 218 of the 639 US executions carried out since 1977, and has executed

     more inmates in the past three years than any other US state in over two decades. This year

     alone, 19 prisoners have been put to death in the state.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Texas' record on the death penalty has come under increased scrutiny because of Governor

     Bush's presidential bid, his repeated assertions that all those executed under his watch have

     been guilty as charged, and since his counterpart, Governor Ryan, suspended executions in

     Illinois because of repeated wrongful convictions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     In March 1998 Governor Bush refused a DNA-based reprieve request in to Jerry Lee

     Hogue, who went to his death maintaining his innocence.</font>
