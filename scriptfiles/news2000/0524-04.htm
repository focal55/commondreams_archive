<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- May 24 - </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">United Airlines said today it intends to buy U.S. Airways. The following

analysts are available for interviews:



</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PAUL HUDSON, <a href="mailto:acap71@erols.com">acap71@erols.com</a>, <a href="http://www.acap1971.org">http://www.acap1971.org</a><br>

Executive director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, Hudson said

today: "If this merger is approved without major divesting of routes and

other restrictions, the 'Big Six' will quickly become the 'Big Three' and

U.S. airline passengers will be the major losers. No airline should control

more than 25 percent to 30 percent of the nation's airline seats or over 40

percent of seats in a particular region. This merger would give United

dominant control of most routes in the Northeast and Midwest."



</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALBERT FOER, <a href="mailto:BFoer@aol.com">BFoer@aol.com</a>, <a href="http://www.antitrustinstitute.org">http://www.antitrustinstitute.org</a><br>

President of the American Antitrust Institute, Foer said today: "The

proposed swallowing up of one of its few competitors by United Airlines

comes in a context that makes it unlikely to be in the public's interest....

To allow this merger to occur, with the likelihood that it will not only

raise concentration but induce further consolidations in reaction, would be

inconsistent with the Justice Department's efforts and contrary to the

anti-merger provisions of the Clayton Act."



</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CURTIS GRIMM, <a href="mailto:cgrimm@rhsmith.umd.edu">cgrimm@rhsmith.umd.edu</a><br>

Chair of Logistics and Transportation Department at the Robert H. Smith

School of Business at the University of Maryland, Grimm said today: "This

merger raises real questions that need to be examined. It could lead to

dominance in some markets, and there will have to be divestitures on a

market-by-market basis. In addition, an airline so large creates general

competitive problems and will likely prompt rivals to spawn their own

mergers. We've seen mergers come in waves in different industries."



</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ED FABERMAN, <a href="mailto:epfaberman@uhlaw.com">epfaberman@uhlaw.com</a><br>

Executive director of the Air Carriers Association, which represents new

entrants in the airline industry, Faberman said today: "This is another step

in the consolidation of this industry into a few carriers. If this merger 

takes

place and the Northwest-Continental merger is allowed to proceed, two

companies will control about 50 percent of the market. The government has

allowed almost every merger to take place. Steps have to be taken to ensure

that competition will survive."</font></p>
