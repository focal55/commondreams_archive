- July 11 - As the Republican National



Convention approaches, the Legal Action Project of the Center to



Prevent Handgun Violence has served notice to the gun industry that



the industry's high hopes of a George W. Bush presidency are in



vain. The Legal Action Project is stepping up its efforts to



represent gun violence victims in lawsuits against the industry.



Since 1989, the Legal Action Project has pioneered innovative



theories of gun industry liability against gun manufacturers and



sellers in an attempt to hold the gun industry accountable for



dangerous and irresponsible practices. The Legal Action Project's



legal theories have been used in the past to bring claims on behalf



of individual victims of gun violence and are now being used by the



cities and counties suing the gun industry. The Center represents



over two dozen of the cities and counties that have filed suits



against the industry.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By intensifying its pro bono work for victims, the Center is



sending a message to gun manufacturers and dealers that relying on



the possibility that Governor George W. Bush will be elected



President of the United States will not insulate the industry from



legal accountability for its misconduct. The gun industry recently



broke off settlement talks with the Department of Housing and Urban



Development over threatened public housing authority lawsuits in



the hopes that a George W. Bush presidency will result in federal



legislation to prohibit municipal lawsuits. As Governor, Bush



signed legislation banning local government lawsuits against the



gun industry in Texas last year.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The gun industry seems to be forgetting that even if Bush is



elected President and even if he manages to push legislation



shielding the gun industry from municipal lawsuits through the new



Congress, victims of gun violence still can and will file private



lawsuits against the gun industry," said Dennis Henigan, Director



of the Legal Action Project. "Innocent victims of gun industry



misconduct will continue to assert their legal rights and we are



ready to help them."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On June 29, the Center announced a significant new lawsuit



brought on behalf of victims of a series of racially-motivated



shootings on July 4 weekend of last year. African-American, Asian



American and Jewish victims of violent white supremacist Benjamin



Nathaniel Smith brought suit in Chicago against the gun trafficker,



gun dealer and gun manufacturers whose conduct allowed Smith easy



access to handguns in the illegal market. The defendant dealer,



Old Prairie Trading Post, sold over sixty handguns over a two-year



period to trafficker Donald Feissinger, who then sold two handguns



-- one a Bryco Arms .380, the other a .22 caliber Ruger, to Smith.



Smith had tried to buy a gun from a legitimate dealer, but was



turned away because a background check revealed he was under a



domestic restraining order. The suit charges that Old Prairie



knew, or should have known, that it was dealing with a gun



trafficker who was buying such a large volume of handguns to sell



them into the illegal market. The suit also names Bryco Arms and



Sturm, Ruger, charging that the gun makers failed to set standards



for the retail sale of their firearms that would prevent such



large-volume sales.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In May, the Center also brought suit in Michigan for shooting



victim Ronald Rissman, who was shot by a mentally disturbed



individual in June of last year. The suit was brought against gun



dealer Target Sports, Inc., which sold a handgun to the shooter



even thought the store had been warned of his mental instability.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, the California Court of Appeals recently opened the



door to a possible new trial in Dix v. Beretta, the first case ever



brought against a gun maker for failure to "personalize" guns to



prevent their use by children and other unauthorized users. Center



lawyers had filed this case against gun manufacturer Beretta for



the parents of a teenage boy who was accidentally killed by his



friend with a gun the friend thought was unloaded. A jury had



ruled 9-3 against the parents, but the appeals court found there



was reason to believe that at least one of the jurors was biased in



favor of Beretta. A new trial may be ordered in the case.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These cases demonstrate our determination to hold the gun



industry accountable to innocent victims for its choices that



increase the risk of violence," said Mr. Henigan. "The gun



industry may be counting on George W. Bush and a future pro-gun



Congress to rescue it from the city cases, but the industry will



always be vulnerable to courageous victims willing to assert their



rights. Smith &amp; Wesson finally concluded that the only way to



truly protect itself from liability for irresponsible conduct is to



act responsibly. Eventually, that simple truth will dawn on the



rest of the gun industry as well."

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence was founded in 1983 to



reduce gun violence through education, legal advocacy, research,



and outreach to the entertainment community. Chaired by Sarah



Brady, the Center's national initiatives include violence



prevention programs for youth, education programs on the risks



associated with guns, legal representation for gun violence



victims, reform of the gun industry, and research on the risks



associated with guns and on the efficacy of gun control laws. More

Control, can be found on our website at <a href="http://www.cphv.org">www.cphv.org</a>.</i></font>
