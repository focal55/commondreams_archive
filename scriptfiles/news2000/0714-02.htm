- July 14 - Police officers need special training

and better supervision to ensure they do not beat or abuse suspects

after chases, Human Rights Watch said today.



<p>In the latest such incident, police officers in Philadelphia are being

accused of beating a suspect, Thomas Jones, after a high-speed car

chase. A videotape of the beating suggests that the police used

excessive force in subduing Jones.



<p>"When police officers are chasing after suspects at high speeds, it can

get their adrenaline running," said Allyson Collins, an expert on U.S.

police abuse at Human Rights Watch. "But that doesn't excuse abusive

behavior. The police need special training to know how to check

themselves after a chase."



<p>Collins said that post-chase incidents of brutality are too common. The

1991 beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles occurred after a car chase.

In 1995, a police officer in Boston who was mistaken for a suspect was

chased, and then beaten and abandoned at the scene. In 1996, police

pursued undocumented Mexican migrants riding in a truck in Riverside

County, California, and then beat some of the truck's occupants -- an

incident that was also captured on videotape.



<p>Other post-chase cases in Atlanta, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and

Washington, D.C., are documented in the July 1998 Human Rights Watch

report on police abuse, Shielded from Justice [see

http://www.hrw.org/reports98/police/index.htm].



<p>Several officers in the Philadelphia videotape were clearly attempting

to stop other officers from hitting and kicking Jones.  Those officers

deserve recognition for behaving in a professional manner, Human Rights

Watch said.



<p>Human Rights Watch expressed concern that police used a chokehold to

take Jones to a transport vehicle after he was apprehended, although

chokeholds are not permitted under Philadelphia police department rules.



<p>Human Rights Watch said that any officers found responsible for using

excessive force should be disciplined appropriately, or prosecuted

criminally if their conduct violated the law. It also urged the U.S.

Justice Department, which has launched its own investigation into the

incident, to step in and prosecute any officers who may have violated

federal civil rights statutes.
