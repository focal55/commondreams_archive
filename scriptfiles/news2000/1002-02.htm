- October 2 - With the Supreme Court opening a new session, Americans

     are focusing on the impact Justices can have on environmental

     protections.  For example, last year in the Laidlaw case, Justice

     Antonin Scalia -- named by Texas Gov. George W. Bush as his judicial

     role model -- opined that community groups do not have the right to

     sue a polluter for violating the laws that protect our families from

     poisons -- even when a Roebuck, South Carolina company had dumped

     mercury into a stream nearly 500 times.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"To the Sierra Club, the ability to force a polluting neighbor to

     clean up its act is the very essence of common sense and fair play.

     Citizen suits are a powerful weapon for protecting our families from

     toxic pollution, but that tool could vanish depending on who the next

     President appoints to the Supreme Court," Cox added.  "Our next

     President will decide whether the Court continues to protect the laws

     that keep our air breathable and our water drinkable."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Cases before the Court this year will play a vital role in setting

     future environmental precedents.  When the Supreme Court hears Browner

     v. American Trucking Associations on November 7, it has the potential

     to strike a blow against a crucial effort to reduce soot and smog.  At

     issue is a long-dead legal doctrine regarding whether federal agencies

     will be allowed to use modern solutions to address the problems

     plaguing our increasingly complicated society.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If the Supreme Court uses a long-dead legal doctrine to throw out our

     nation's health standards on soot and smog, it will doom Americans to

     dirtier air and worse lung problems," Cox said.  "Americans are

     concerned that polluters could turn back a generation of progress

     we've made in cleaning up the air we breathe.  If the Supreme Court

     overturns the standards that protect our families from soot and smog,

     then people with asthma and the more than 100 million Americans who

     breathe dirty air will suffer while the polluters profit."

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While the next President will only be in office four to eight years,

     his legacy on the Supreme Court could harm our environment and our

     communities for more than a generation," Cox concluded.  "If the next

     President packs the Court with people like Bush's role model, Justice

     Scalia, then our clean air and clean water protections will suffer

     profound damage."</font>
