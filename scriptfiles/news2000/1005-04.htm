- October 5 - Each day the Republican leadership of the U.S. Senate holds the Violence

Against Women Act (VAWA) hostage is another day that politicians are

putting women's lives on the line. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is

turning this life-saving legislation into a political bargaining chip --

trying to load it down with things his cronies want -- some of which will

actually harm women. The Senate must follow the House of Representatives'

lead and pass VAWA without further delay and without attaching harmful

amendments like the one Rep. Nancy Johnson (R-Conn.) is pushing, which

would allocate millions of dollars for men's custody groups.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just recently George W. Bush said he didn't even know what the Violence

Against Women Act was -- so it shouldn’t surprise me that the Republican

leadership doesn't think that stopping violence

against women should be a national priority. But in a few days, tens

of thousands of women and men will prove them wrong right here in Washington

at the <a href="http://www.worldmarch.org">World March of Women 2000</a>

on October 15. The World March of Women is unprecedented --&nbsp; involving

women from 157 countries calling for an end to poverty and violence against

women -- and it will have an unprecedented impact when activists carry

the enthusiasm and energy of this march back to their communities and to

the polls in November.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Women and men from across the country and around the world are marching

because violence against women and poverty are global epidemics; because

many women and their children fall into poverty because she is fleeing

an abusive relationship; because law enforcement agencies ignore cries

for help and discount charges of sexual and domestic violence; because

the U.S. Supreme Court decided that a woman does not have the right to

sue her rapist in federal court.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And we are marching because the leadership of the U.S. Senate is holding

up reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. Without funding from

VAWA, we could lose the hundreds of shelters, hotlines and anti-violence

programs.&nbsp; And without these programs, tens of thousands of women

will have nowhere to turn in the aftermath of rape, sexual assault, or

domestic violence. The Senators holding up passage of the Violence Against

Women Act would do well to heed the call for justice from feminists around

the world -- today and on October 15 at the World March of Women. If not,

they will hear the sound of angry women marching to the polls in November</font>
