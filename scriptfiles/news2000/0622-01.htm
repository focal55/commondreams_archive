- June 22 - Human Rights Watch condemned today Israel's

introduction of legislation permitting the holding of hostages, a war

crime.  The draft "Imprisonment of Combatants not Entitled to Prisoner

of War Status Law" passed its first reading in Israel's Knesset

yesterday by a vote of 22 to 6.



<p>Human Rights Watch criticized the legislation in letters on Wednesday to

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Justice Minister Yossi Beilin,

Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein, Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg, and

Knesset committee chairs Amnon Rubinstein and Dan Meridor.  While

sharing concern over the fate of Israelis missing in Lebanon, the

organization said that there is no acceptable justification for

committing war crimes.



<p>In a case in April involving Lebanese detained as hostages, Israel's

Supreme Court ruled that administrative detention cannot be used to hold

individuals as "bargaining chips."  Lower courts have since ordered the

release of all but two of the hostages, Sheikh `Abd al-Karim `Obeid and

Mustafa al-Dirani.  A ruling on their case has been postponed until July

12, apparently to allow the introduction of yesterday's legislation.



<p>"Israel's highest courts have acknowledged that the Lebanese hostages

are held illegally,"  said Hanny Megally, the executive director of

Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. "The Knesset

should not attempt to sidestep the courts."



<p>Israel kidnaped Lebanese nationals `Obeid and al-Dirani from Lebanon in

1989 and 1994, respectively.  Israeli officials admit that the two are

being held for future use in negotiations to gain the release of Israeli

nationals gone missing in Lebanon.  As such, their detention is both a

grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and a violation of Israel's

legal obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and

Political Rights.  They should be immediately released.



<p>Human Rights Watch also criticized the sweeping language of the

legislation, which provides almost unlimited powers to the military to

detain civilians arbitrarily and indefinitely.  This raises serious

concerns that the legislation could be used to detain persons based on

their political beliefs, and not for any actual acts they have

committed.





<p>A backgrounder with Human Rights Watch's analysis of the draft

legislation is attached.

<p>Human Rights Watch Backgrounder



<p>Israel's Proposed "Imprisonment of Combatants not Entitled to Prisoner

of War Status Law, 5760-2000"<br>

June 2000





<p>International humanitarian law categorically prohibits hostage-taking.

On April 12, 2000 Israel's highest court ruled that the administrative

detention of Lebanese nationals as "bargaining chips" -- hostages -- was

illegal under Israeli domestic law, making Israel's continued detention

of Lebanese nationals Sheikh `Abd al-Karim `Obeid (held since 1989)  and

Mustafa al-Dirani (held since 1994) as hostages a violation of Israeli

domestic law as well. On June 11, 2000, in a transparent attempt to

legitimize an illegal situation,  the Israeli Cabinet unanimously

approved draft legislation entitled "Imprisonment of Combatants not

Entitled to Prisoner-of-War Status Law, 5760-2000". The legislation

passed its first reading in Israel's Knesset on June 21, 2000. The draft

legislation not only fails to end `Obeid and al-Dirani's  illegal

detention, it opens the way to sweeping human rights violations against

them and others by appearing to legitimize prolonged, arbitrary

detention.



<p>Article 1 of the draft law declares the law to be consistent with the

Geneva Conventions, while Article 2 gives the Commander of the General

Staff of the Israel Defense Force powers to detain indefinitely, without

charge or trial, "a person who belongs to a force fighting against

Israel or a person taking part, directly or indirectly, in hostile

activities of the said force," but who is not a prisoner of war under

the Third Geneva Convention.



<p>However, under international humanitarian law, all detainees who are not

entitled to protection as prisoners of war are nevertheless protected

under the Fourth Geneva Convention (Relative to the Protection of

Civilian Persons in Time of War).  Those protections include the

prohibition of hostage-taking (Article 34), the prohibition against

individual or mass forcible transfer (Article 49), and the requirement

that internment (detention without charge or trial) "may be ordered only

if the security of the Detaining Power makes it absolutely necessary"

(Articles 42 and 78).



<p>Hostage-taking is unacceptable under any interpretation of international

humanitarian law, and like the prohibition of torture,  is never subject

to derogation.  Human Rights Watch views with alarm Prime Minister Barak

statements that the draft legislation is "aimed at ensuring that we can

detain people from organizations fighting us for as long as our people

are held by those groups,' and more specifically, is intended to

continue Israel's illegal detention of Lebanese nationals Sheikh `Abd

al-Karim `Obeid and Mustafa al-Dirani. This intention is borne out in

Article 13(A) of the legislation, which includes "transitional

provisions" that extend its application to "a combatant who is not a

prisoner of war who is held by state authorities on the date of its

commencement."



<p>Similarly disturbing is the sweeping language of the draft legislation,

which may permit the indefinite internment of persons who pose no threat

to state security, a violation of both international humanitarian law

and international human rights law.  For example, Articles 2 and 3(A)

allow imprisonment based on the IDF Chief of Staff's  assertion that an

individual "belongs to a force combating Israel or [is] a person taking

part, directly or indirectly, in hostile activities of the said

force."   Judicial review is limited to determining whether a detainee

"is a combatant who is not a prisoner of war." (Article 4)  The

legislation fails to provide the Minister of Defense with guidelines for

determining that a particular force is hostile, is engaged in hostile

activities, that hostile activities have not ended, or even that it is a

force.  This raises serious concerns that the legislation could be used

to detain individuals based on their political beliefs, and not for any

actual acts they have committed.  The draft law provides no mechanism

for  reviewing or challenging such decisions, as the Minister of

Defense's determination "shall serve as decisive proof in this matter."

(Article 9)



<p>Sheikh `Abd al-Karim `Obeid and Mustafa al-Dirani are protected persons

under the Fourth Geneva Convention, and subject to the protections of

the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  Their

kidnaping from Lebanon and prolonged incommunicado detention, including

periods of prolonged solitary confinement, violate both the ICCPR's

prohibition of arbitrary detention and the Fourth Geneva Convention's

prohibition of hostage-taking and forcible transfer.    Hostage-taking,

unlawful transfer, and unlawful confinement are also grave breaches of

the Fourth Geneva Convention, that is to say, war crimes.



<p>Human Rights Watch calls on the Israeli government to immediately

release Sheikh `Abd al-Karim `Obeid and Mustafa al-Dirani, and to

publicly commit not to use any other individuals as hostages.  Israel

has a legal obligation to ensure that no one in its custody is deprived

of rights guaranteed them under international humanitarian law and

international human rights law. Legislation like the "Imprisonment of

Combatants no Entitled to Prisoner of War Status Law" are concessions to

political expediency that undermine both the rule of law in Israel and

the integrity of international  law, and should not be allowed to stand.
