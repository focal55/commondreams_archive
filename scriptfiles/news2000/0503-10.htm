- May 3 - World Wildlife Fund (WWF) today called on President Clinton to condemn the Japanese government's reported plan to catch 120 additional whales over the next two years.  The proposed catch of 50 Bryde and 10 sperm whales per year in the North Pacific marks the first time these species would be harvested since an international ban on whaling was introduced in 1986.  WWF is calling upon President Clinton to urge Japanese Prime Minister Mori to order his government to desist and reconsider the plan to expand the amount of whaling done by the Japanese despite international consensus against whaling.

The Japanese move, which was reported by the Kyodo News Agency today, comes only two weeks after the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) rejected Japan's proposal to open up international trade in minke and gray whales.  At the close of that meeting on April 20, President Clinton clearly expressed his wishes that existing protections for whales remain in place.  This latest action by Japan flies in the face of the worldwide moratorium on whaling, established by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 1986.  

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Japan's unwarranted escalation of whaling threatens to turn back the clock on whale conservation," said Richard Mott, Vice-President, International Policy, World Wildlife Fund.  "The fact that this move comes on the eve of the new Japanese Prime Minister's visit to Washington shows a disregard for the wishes of the United States in this area." 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Although Japan has exploited a loophole in the IWC's rules and has conducted "scientific whaling" for minke whales in both the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary around Antarctica and the North Pacific, this it the first time that they have planned to catch other species of whale since the IWC's moratorium came into effect.  Further, unlike minke whales, Bryde and sperm whales are of a size that would require processing in large factory ships, also illegal under IWC regulations.  

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This escalation by the Japanese does not bode well for the future of whale conservation.  There is a very real possibility that this latest move by the Japanese could signal the return of big time whaling," Mott added.
