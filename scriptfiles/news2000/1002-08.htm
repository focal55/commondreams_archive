- October 2 - Privatizers are feeding



the public a lot of misinformation about Social Security. That's



why Pizza Economics, a new grassroots educational initiative, is



launching a web site <a href="http://www.pizzaeconomics.org">http://www.pizzaeconomics.org</a>,

and delivering



pizzas state-to-state and at the Presidential debates.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pizza Economics is getting out one message: "No matter how



you slice it, privatization of Social Security means cuts, cuts



and MORE cuts."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pizza Economics Team, made up of union activists, youth



and retiree groups, is serving pedagogical pizzas to



participants at the Presidential debate in Boston on Oct. 3



to educate the public about the importance of preserving Social



Security and the dangers of privatization. In Boston, Pizza



Economics is teaming up with the American Federation of Teachers



Retirees, the Gray Panthers and 2030 Action to warn people that



privatization means sliced benefits.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a recent Century Foundation study, authored by



some of the nation's foremost economists, diverting 2 percent of



payroll taxes into individual accounts will slice 40 percent of



people's Social Security benefits -- for young and old alike.



Pizza Economics cuts through the complex economics of Social



Security by delivering "privatized pizzas" that are missing four



pieces from every pie demonstrating visually and unmistakably



how the benefits of widows, children and retirees would be



slashed under privatization schemes.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We're launching a pizza education movement, " says Karen



Friedman, the founder of Pizza Economics. "While the whole



Social Security pie is filled with guaranteed,



inflation-adjusted lifetime benefits, privatized pizzas are



expensive, half-eaten, thin-crusted substitutes."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pizza Economic partners include 2030 Action, the National



Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare (NCPSSM),



AFSCME, the American Federation of Teachers Retirees, the Gray



Panthers, and the Campaign for America's Future. In coming



weeks, 2030 Action will be holding pizza parties in New Mexico,



California and Pennsylvania to help publicize their new report



about the impact of privatization on young people. NCPSSM is



holding pizza parties for their members in Michigan, Arkansas



and across the country as part of their Legacy Campaign.</font>
