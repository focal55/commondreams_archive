- February 10 - A record number of U.S. Senators earned a "zero"

environmental rating on the 1999 <i>National Environmental Scorecard</i> released

today by the League of Conservation Voters. Thirty-seven Senators, over

one-third of the chamber, failed to cast a single environmental vote-the

highest number of Senate "zeroes" since the League started keeping score in

1970.

<p>

"Last year the Senate reversed its role as the moderating voice on

environmental policy," said league president Deb Callahan. "Rather than

heading off environmental attacks, in 1999 the Senate spearheaded efforts to

benefit special interests at the expense of the environment and taxpayers.

While the House was not devoid of its share of anti-environment legislation,

Republicans and Democrats alike did make an effort to block some of the

anti-environment efforts of the Senate."

<p>

The votes included in the 1999 <i>National Environmental Scorecard</i> are based on

the consensus recommendation of experts from over 20 nonpartisan

environmental, conservation and sportsmen's groups. The votes include key

Congressional action on issues such as public lands and natural resource

protection, efforts to rollback environmental protections and funding for

conservation programs. Based on the tallies, the LCV <i>Scorecard</i> assigns a

percentage score to every Representative and Senator. A 100 percent score

indicates the strongest environmental commitment, while a zero percent shows

consistent votes against conservation and public health protections.

For the fifth consecutive year, Congressional environmental scores averaged

below 50 percent-41 percent in the Senate and 46 percent in the House. For

the third year in a row, the top members of the Senate majority leadership

team failed to cast a single vote in favor of conservation. The Senate

minority leadership dropped to a 63 percent average, from 78 percent in

1998. On balance, Democrats outscored Republicans by over 60 points in each

chamber. However, 29 Republicans outperformed the national average in the

House or Senate.

<p>

Of particular concern to the League is the zero percent score earned by

Senator Robert Smith (R-N.H.) who recently became chairman of the Senate

Environment and Public Works committee. Smith replaced the late John Chafee

(R-R.I.) who compiled a 70 percent lifetime environmental average and was

known as a leader in building bipartisan consensus for environmental

protection. Callahan stated that Smith's poor environmental showing does not

bode well for the future leadership of the committee and hopes that Smith

will work with the environmental community and members of both political

parties to forge positive environmental progress.

<p>

Callahan also stated that during the 106th Congress, groups who lobby on

behalf of the mining, timber, oil and similar industries attempted to use

their wealth to curry favor with elected officials and weaken health and

environmental protections. 

<p>

"The American public clearly believes that Congress should be working to

pass and fund the enforcement of stronger, not weaker, environmental and

public health protections," Callahan said. "However, too many members of

Congress continue to turn their eye on the largess of polluting industries

while turning their back on the public's interest." 

<p>

In 1999, special interests actively sought legislative efforts to expand the

use of public lands for the dumping of mining waste, to allow the oil

industry to avoid paying $66-100 million in oil royalties per year for

drilling on public lands, and to increase taxpayer subsidies for logging. 

"Money in politics continues to stand in the way of consistent and

meaningful environmental advances," Callahan said. "If the public's interest

in a healthy environment is to ever gain equal footing with the special

interests' desire for increased profit margin and decreased regulation, our

system of campaign finance must be reformed." The 1999 Scorecard reports how

Senators and Representatives voted on campaign finance reform legislation;

however, these votes are not factor into the members' environmental scores.

LCV's 1999 National Environmental Scorecard is available to the public over

the Internet at <a href="http://www.lcv.org">http://www.lcv.org</a>.

<p>

The nonprofit League of Conservation Voters is the bipartisan political

voice for the environment. LCV is the only organization working full-time to

inform citizens about the environmental records of Members of Congress. LCV

has published a Scorecard for each Congress since 1970.
