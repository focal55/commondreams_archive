          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1999, Houston 

            overtook Los Angeles as America's smoggiest city. Texas ranks first 

            in toxic releases to the environment, first in total toxic air emissions 

            from industrial facilities, first in toxic chemical accidents, and 

            first in cancer-causing pollution.(1) </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> GOV. BUSH IS 

            NOT FIGHTING TO CURB TEXAS'S POLLUTION </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Federal laws such 

            as the Clean Air Act are forcing industries to cut pollution, but 

            air quality in Texas continues to decline.(2) Rather than adopting 

            tough laws to reduce pollution from aging facilities, Gov. George 

            W. Bush asked industry to draft their own regulations to pre-empt 

            legislative action. After a briefing by the industry insiders who 

            wrote the plan, DuPont official Jim Kennedy noted that the voluntary 

            industry proposal, had "no `meat' with respect to actual emissions 

            reductions. One of the [business] leaders actually stated that emissions 

            reductions was not a primary driver for the program."(3) </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The result of 

            Bush's voluntary policy has been that only 15 percent of the 760 so-called 

            "grandfathered" plants have signed up for the voluntary program.(4) 

            According to the Dallas Morning News, "[Bush's] voluntary anti-pollution 

            initiatives have produced only marginal improvements."(5) </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When Time Magazine 

            issued a report card on issues, Bush's pollution record received a 

            D: "Bush let industry write an anti-pollution measure, and believes 

            voluntary plans, not regulation, can clean up the air and water. No 

            wonder Texas has a world-class pollution problem."(6) </font>

            agency, leading to restrictions on citizen participation in pollution 

            permitting and weaker enforcement. Six times, the TNRCC has been brought 

            to court for denying public hearings-- and the TNRCC has lost every

            for lung-scorching ozone or are on the verge of doing so." -- Dallas

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEXAS AIR POLLUTION: 

            </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under Gov. Bush, 

            Texas's air has gotten dirtier, not cleaner. For the majority of Texans, 

            air quality has substantially diminished under the Bush Administration. 

            Two-thirds of Texans-- 12 million people-- live in the state's top 

            eight urban areas. From 1990-94, they suffered 508 eight-hour ozone 

            violations, from 1995-99 under Bush, this jumped to 679 violations, 

            a 34% increase.(9) </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 1999 this 

            pollution led to Houston passing Los Angeles to claim the dubious 

            title as the nation's smoggiest city. And it's not just the number 

            of days -- it's also the intensity. On Houston's smoggiest day, the 

            air was nearly 50 percent dirtier than the air on Los Angeles's smoggiest 

            day.(10) In addition, a 1999 City of Houston study shows that air 

            pollution alone may have caused at least 435 premature deaths and 

            as many as 1,196 new cases of chronic bronchitis annually.(11) </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bush inherited 

            a solution, yet he exacerbated the problem. The Houston Chronicle 

            reports that from 1987 through 1994, "despite continuing population 

            and economic growth," the air in Houston became cleaner due to "the 

            introduction of new pollution controls." However, since 1994, when 

            Bush was elected governor, the number of smoggy days has increased 

            by 20 percent.(12) </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 1999, Texas 

            suffered seven of the nation's 10 highest one-hour ozone levels, and 

            15 of the top 30.(13) </font>

            </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The state ranks 

            third in the nation for surface water discharges, dumping nearly 21 

            million pounds of toxic chemicals into streams, ponds and surface 

            water. The U.S. EPA found swimming impaired in 27 percent of Texas 

            rivers; 5 percent do not support aquatic life.(15) </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Texas leads the 

            nation in injecting toxic waste into underground wells, disposing 

            60 percent more toxic waste into injection wells than any other state.(16) 

            Injecting toxic waste into the ground can potentially poison local 

            drinking water supplies. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On January 1, 

            1995, only one Texas body of water had a fish ban triggered by high 

            levels of mercury. By January 1, 1999, that number had soared to 7.(17)

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> FACT: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Texas 

            has reduced toxic chemicals emissions at about the same rate as the 

            national average due to the Federal Clean Air Act of 1990.(18) As 

            the Dallas Morning News said, "[Bush's] irrefutable claim that toxic 

            emissions are down owes to measures the federal government put in 

            place before he became governor."(19) </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Yet, despite 

            the benefits the Clean Air Act has had on Texas, Bush's appointees 

            have attempted to weaken the law. According to the Boston Globe, "[E]ven 

            as the administration of Governor George W. Bush talks about tough 

            actions, Texas lobbyists are trying to seriously weaken one of the 

            US Environmental Protection Agency's strongest tools to prod states 

            to clear the air: the power to stop highway construction in polluted 

            areas."(20) </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> FACT: Bush's 

            actions led to one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in state 

            history when he killed an auto inspection and maintenance plan for 

            Houston in 1995. His actions broke a state contract with Tejas Testing, 

            which sued Texas and won $136 million. The money came from funds intended 

            for environmental enforcement and higher education.(21) </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SPIN: "Texans 

            agree with Governor Bush's reasonable and balanced approach toward 

            protecting our environment, which has resulted in a 10 percent reduction 

            in industrial pollution, Texas leading the nation in reducing toxics, 

            and legislation that will reduce emissions by 250,000 tons per year." 

            -- Mindy Tucker, Bush Campaign Spokeswoman Houston Chronicle, October 

            20, 1999 </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> FACT: Texans 

            do not agree with the Bush approach. In an editorial, the San Antonio 

            Express-News criticized Bush's pollution scheme: "Bush refused to 

            back legislation (which failed) that would have forced Texas' oldest, 

            dirtiest power plants to clean up. Instead, the governor backed voluntary 

            measures, asking owners of the air-polluting plants to clean themselves 

            up. Few have, nor will they without a regulatory stick to make them 

            do it."(22) </font>
