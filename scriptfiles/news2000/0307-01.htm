- March 7 - Friends of the Earth



today released "IMF: Selling the Environment Short," a report that



criticizes International Monetary Fund (IMF) policies for



accelerating environmental damage in borrowing countries.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report looks at eight countries -- Brazil, Cameroon, Cote



d'Ivoire, Guyana, Indonesia, Nicaragua, Philippines, and Thailand



-- and concludes that significant negative environmental impacts



occurred in all countries.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Every case in the report shows that the IMF pushes short-term



profit at the expense of biodiversity and ecological prosperity,"



said Carol Welch, co-author of the report and International Policy



Analyst at Friends of the Earth. "Quality of life and environmental



quality go hand in hand. This report shows that the IMF is



undermining people's lives by disregarding environmental issues."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several of the countries in the study received IMF bailouts and



suffered severe reductions in government environmental spending



after the start of the bailout programs. The IMF's pressure on



countries to eliminate budget deficits is a major reason behind



these cuts. Although countries undergoing structural adjustment may



show some economic gains, these so-called achievements are based on



the unsustainable exploitation and export of natural resources.



Several of the case studies point to the short-sightedness of the



IMF's policies that encourage, and sometimes induce, countries to



exploit their natural resources at unsustainable rates.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is time for the IMF to wake up and face the long term



environmental and economic consequences of its policies. The



selection of the IMF's next leader will be key in determining if



the IMF is capable of facing this reality," said Welch.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth is calling on the IMF to institute reforms



which would make its practices less environmentally harmful, and



advocates pro-active measures which the IMF could adopt to



encourage environmental sustainability in countries. Among the



recommendations in the report is a call for the IMF to cease its



structural adjustment programs and have institutions with more



appropriate expertise, such as the World Bank, handle longer-term



issues like structural adjustment. This recommendation is expected



to be echoed in an upcoming report by a congressionally appointed



commission examining the role of the IMF and World Bank. The



Friends of the Earth report also calls for environmental impact



assessments of structural adjustment at the World Bank.
