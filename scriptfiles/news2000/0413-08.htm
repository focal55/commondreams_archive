Other Black Methodist Churches May Follow Lead of Union United Methodist,

- April 13 - Union United Methodist Church in Boston made history by voting

to become the nation's first black Methodist church to officially welcome

and include gay and lesbian worshipers.

        <p>"This is a courageous, precedent-setting decision that blazes a new

trail for other churches who want to be more inclusive and accepting of

their gay and lesbian members," said HRC Executive Director Elizabeth Birch.

"This vote - combined with the resolution by the Central Conference on

American Rabbis to allow same-sex weddings - shows that there is a growing

trend towards religious inclusion that cuts across denominational lines."

 <p>The Union United Church, a 125-member institution led by Rev. Theodore L.

Lockhart, voted to become a "reconciling and inclusive" church - a term that

essentially means a church that accepts and affirms gay and lesbian people.

Hilda Evans, a 61 year old married woman with two adult children, suggested

in 1996 that the church become "reconciling and inclusive" and led the

effort that ended in a successful vote. The church is holding a special

service on April 16 to celebrate the decision.

<p>Other black United Methodist Churches may follow their lead. According to

the Washington Blade, San Francisco's Glide United Methodist Church is

considering a vote to recognize and include gay and lesbian worshippers.

        <p>As an institution, the United Methodist Church has a long way to go

before they are accepting of gays and lesbians, according to HRC. They are

officially against same-sex marriage and a United Methodist Minister cannot

perform these unions. The denomination also does not "condone" the "practice

of homosexuality," and sexually active gay people cannot be ordained as

ministers.

        <p>"The vote by Union United Methodist Church shows that even within

the more strict religious institutions there is a diversity of opinions on

gay and lesbian issues," said Donna Payne, HRC field organizer, working with

people of color and the religious community. "Religious views on

homosexuality are not monolithic, and people of faith are increasingly

speaking out in favor of full-inclusion for gay and lesbians worshipers in

churches, synagogues and mosques throughout America."

          <p>The Human Rights Campaign is the nation's largest national lesbian

and gay political organization with members throughout the country.  HRC

effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the

public to ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and safe

at home, at work and in the community.
