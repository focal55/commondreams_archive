- November 1 - Nader campaign manager Theresa Amato

today said that Gore supporters are misusing a recent response by Ralph

Nader to a hypothetical question to scare pro-choice voters, and thereby

intentionally distort Nader’s history of opposing right-wing Supreme

Court justices.



<p>“Ralph Nader has said over and over again that for American women, the

right to a safe, affordable and legal abortion is a legal right, and

that the government has no business telling a woman to have or not to

have a child,” Amato said. “Al Gore recognized this when he changed his

position from pro-life to pro-choice. George Bush recognized this when

he told Tim Russert two weeks ago on Meet the Press that, ‘(Abortion) is

not going to be outlawed until a lot of people change their mind. And

there’s going to be abortions one way or the other.’”



<p>“The attempt by pro-choice advocates to take Ralph Nader’s statement

about a hypothetical overturning of Roe vs. Wade out of context and

paint him as unconcerned about a woman’s right to choose is both unfair

and the worst sort of dirty-trick politics,” Amato said.



<p>“In a clear act of desperation, Democratic party partisans are trying to

turn history on its head. Whereas Ralph Nader has opposed the nomination

of Haynesworth, Carswell, Bork, Scalia and Thomas, the Democrats

supported justices Scalia and Thomas and allowed them to be confirmed.

The Democrats, including Al Gore, voted 98-0 to confirm Justice Scalia

to the Supreme Court, and in a Democratic-controlled Senate, after the

Anita Hill hearings, 11 Democrats voted to confirm Justice Thomas,

thereby granting him a 52-48 confirmation victory,” Amato said.



<p>“The Democrats are responsible for putting what they term the two

biggest anti-Roe vs. Wade justices on the Supreme Court.”
