- October 20 -<i>"Now, (Al Gore is) saying 'I'm with you guys on guns.' In any



other time or place you'd be looking for a lynching mob." The crowd



responded with "let's do it" and "I've got a rope."</i>



-- The Grand Rapids Press, October 17, 2000 quoting NRA president



Charlton Heston and describing audience reaction.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Handgun Control released a new report today, "The Gun Lobby and



Race: Thinly-Veiled Bigotry," revealing the extremist message of



the gun lobby. The report shows a clear pattern of appealing to



violence, racism and bigotry through National Rifle Association



(NRA) official speeches and literature. Just this week NRA



president Charlton Heston used words tinged with racist overtones.



Despite often bragging of his presence at the 1963 March on



Washington with Martin Luther King, thinly veiled hateful and



racist arguments have been a staple of his public appearances for



several years. In a 1997 speech titled "Fighting the Culture War in



America," Heston provided some insight into the NRA's apparent



message:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Mainstream America is counting on you to draw your sword and



fight for them. These people have precious little time to and



resources to battle misguided Cinderella attitudes, the fringe



propaganda of the homosexual coalition, the feminists who preach



that it is a divine duty for woman to hate men, blacks who raise a



militant fist with one hand while they seek preference with the



other..."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Heston's words were even quoted on former Ku Klux Klan Wizard



David Duke's Web site.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to Heston's statements Sarah Brady said, "Heston's



incendiary remarks, tantamount to calling for the lynching of a



sitting Vice President of the United States, are incredibly



frightening and dangerous. Heston speaks a language of violence and



hate. Do the leaders of the NRA feel they need a message riddled



with hate to accomplish their extremist legislative agenda? When



the gun lobby ties racism and hatred to their political and



legislative agenda, America loses. My husband was seriously



wounded in an attack on President Ronald Reagan. Incendiary words



often have violent results. I call on George W. Bush to denounce



the violent and abhorrent language of his supporters directed



against the Vice President of the United States. "

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">James Jay Baker, the NRA's top lobbyist, has publicly said that



Governor George W. Bush has never denied the NRA any of its agenda.



Bush has eased restrictions on carrying handguns while presiding



over lax enforcement of gun laws and tolerating armed felons. Bush



heeded an NRA call to allow handguns inside places of worship,



hospitals and nursing homes. And Texas ranks number one in the



country for gun shows, providing criminals with easy access to



guns. In the words of Nina Butts of Texans Against Gun Violence,



"What the NRA wants, Bush gives. What the NRA doesn't want, he



defeats."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paul Blackman, NRA director of research, has written that



inner-city violence, which kills predominantly young black males,



is good for society. In his 1994 paper, "The Federal Factoid



Factory on Firearms and Violence: A Review of CDC Research and



Politics," Blackman dismisses public health researchers who have



decried the $20-billion-a-year medical costs and loss of



productivity costs of firearm violence, arguing that since young



homicide victims are "frequently criminals themselves and/or drug



addicts or users," he argues their deaths offer "net gains" to



society.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a startling statement, Jeff Cooper, NRA board member and



columnist for the NRA's flagship publication, the American



Rifleman, noted in 1991 "the consensus is that no more than five to



ten people in a hundred who die by gunfire in Los Angeles are any



loss to society. These people fight small wars amongst themselves.



It would seem a valid social service to keep them well-supplied



with ammunition."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Heston is calling his crusade "a holy war." George W. Bush,



according to the NRA's Baker, has been only too eager to answer



Heston's call. In the words of NRA vice president Kayne Robinson,



"If we win, we'll have a president where we work out of their



office."

Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974 by



Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. "Pete" Shields, two victims of gun



violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law



enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups across



the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and local gun



control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI has more than



400,000 members nationwide, making it the nation's largest



citizens' gun control lobbying organization. More information about



HCI and its sister organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun



Violence, can be found on our Web site at <a href="http://www.handguncontrol.org">http://www.handguncontrol.org</a>
