- October 12 - Gov. George W. Bush made a number of misleading and

     inaccurate statements about his environmental record and other issues

     during the debate last night in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  The

     following are some of his misleading statements from the transcript of

     the debate as printed in the New York Times (10-12-00), and the real

     facts.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * "Our water is cleaner now."

     FALSE: The discharge of industrial toxic pollution into surface waters

     in Texas increased from 23.2 million pounds in 1995 to 25.2 million

     pounds in 1998, the last year with data available.  (Toxics Release

     Inventory, Environmental Protection Agency, May 11, 2000)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * "We're [sic] reduced our industrial waste by 11 percent."

     FALSE: First, Gov. Bush is probably referring to the oft-stated

     assertion that air pollution in Texas has declined by 11 percent.  This

     assertion is incorrect.  It is based on a Texas Natural Resources

     Conservation Commission (TNRCC) calculation that emissions of six

     criteria air pollutants from industry fell by 11% during the last five

     years.  EPA statistics dispute this number, instead showing a net

     increase in emissions of these six criteria pollutants.  The TNRCC

     statistics are misleading because large amounts of the claimed

     reductions are simply a change in reporting methodology for NOx

     emissions -- giving the appearance of reductions of almost 100,000

     tons, which are reductions on paper only.  In fact, emissions of NOx,

     the key ozone smog precursor emitted by industry, has increased during

     the last five years.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * "The electric decontrol bill that I fought for and signed in Texas

     has mandatory emission standards."

     MISLEADING: In fact, Governor Bush initially opposed any mandatory

     cleanup of 68 grand fathered power plants in S.B. 7.  His position

     changed after the US EPA Region 6 letter of May 3, 1999 informing

     Texas that $1.3 billion in federal highway funds could be withheld as

     a sanction due to noncompliance with ozone health standards in the

     Dallas-Ft. Worth area.  Bush finally agreed to support these mandatory

     reductions under pressure from Dallas-Ft. Worth elected officials such

     as State Rep. Steve Wohlens, who chaired the House Committee with

     jurisdiction over electric utility deregulation under SB 7.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * Mandatory emission reductions are "what we ought to do at the

     federal level when it comes to grant [sic] for other plants, for

     utilities."

     MISLEADING: As a candidate for President, Gov. Bush has not proposed

     mandatory pollution reductions from aging power plants.  Instead, he

     has said: "I don't think you can litigate clean air and clean water. I

     don't think you can legislate clean air and clean water." (Seattle

     Post-Intelligencer, 8-12-00) This philosophy would preclude such

     mandatory emission reductions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * "They took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without

     consulting local officials... I just cited an example of the

     administration just unilaterally acting without any input."

     FALSE: Gov. Bush is referring to the Administration's pending proposal

     to protect 40 million acres of roadless areas in our national forests

     from additional road building and logging.  In fact, the Forest Service

     conducted 600 public meetings about the proposal nationwide and more

     than one million Americans urged the Administration to strengthen the

     proposal.  There was ample opportunity for local officials and others

     to comment on the proposal, which has not been issued in final form

     yet.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * "China and India were exempted from that [Kyoto] treaty."

     FALSE: China and India are not exempt from the Kyoto Treaty to reduce

     global warming pollution.  Under the agreement, both countries are

     required to report their emissions.  In fact, both nations have

     committed to reducing their global warming pollution.  China has

     erased its emissions growth and may have actually reduced its

     emissions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * "I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there's a

     national petroleum reserve right next to Prudhoe Bay that your

     administration had opened up for exploration in that pristine area."

     MISLEADING:  The National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska was set aside

     specifically for potential oil and gas production.  Last year, the

     Administration opened a portion of the NPR-A to leasing and

     development, being careful to prohibit drilling in environmentally

     sensitive areas, such as the Colville River Delta and Teshekpuk Lake.

     The NPR-A lies far to the west of the Arctic National Widllife Refuge

     and is separated from the coastal plain by the Prudhoe Bay oil fields.

      Bush would like to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil

     drilling even though it contains many sensitive areas with unmatched

     ecological diversity.  The coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge is home

     to polar bears, caribou, musk oxen and other rare species.</font>
