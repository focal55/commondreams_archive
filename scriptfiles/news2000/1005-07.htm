<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- October 5 - Ralph Nader today sent a letter to the

co-chairmen of the Commission on Presidential Debates demanding an

apology for his exclusion from a viewing room, separate from the

presidential debate auditorium, at UMass Boston Oct. 3. Nader had a

ticket to attend.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader was prevented from entering the viewing room by a security guard

and three state troopers. “One of the police officers told me that I

would face arrest if I continued to remain on the premises,” Nader wrote

in the letter. Nader was also prevented from appearing at a pre-arranged

live broadcast at the Fox News trailer, which was located at the site

with the full permission of the CPD.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The Commission’s decision to deploy public officers at a public

university to bar me from viewing the presidential debates and

participating at a subsequent onsite newscast because of my political

viewpoints and affiliation with the Green Party violates both

Massachusetts State and federal civil rights laws.”



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader called the CPD’s actions “outrageous and unlawful behavior” and,

in the spirit of a settlement, proposed that by Oct. 10 he receive a

written apology, that a contribution of $25,000 be sent to the nonprofit

Appleseed Center for Electoral Reform at Harvard Law School, and that he

receive assurance that he will not be barred from attending any other

CPD presidential debate venues for which he has an invitation from the

press or a ticket.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Should you not respond by Tuesday morning to these three requests, the

Nader 2000 Campaign will pursue its legal remedies on Tuesday, October

10th,” Nader wrote.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader had been given the transferable ticket to access the debate

viewing room by a student of Northeastern University.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also today in Boston, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals

reviewed a case brought by Nader and voters challenging the corporate

funding of the CPD. If successful, the case could have a dramatic impact

on the structure of the remaining presidential debates this month,

according to attorney John Bonifaz of the National Voting Rights

Institute.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 5, 2000



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr.<br>

Mr. Paul G. Kirk, Jr.<br>

Co-Chairmen<br>

Commission on Presidential Debates



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mssrs. Fahrenkopf and Kirk:



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Tuesday night October 3, 2000, I attempted to view the first

presidential debate hosted by the Commission on Presidential Debates

(CPD) at the University of Massachusetts.   Though I have been

excluded from participating in the debates by the arbitrary and unfair

standards set by your private, bi-partisan company, I was given a

transferable ticket by a university student to observe the debates in

a separate auditorium reserved apart from the corporate-sponsored

audience in attendance for the two-party show.  I planned to view the

debates so that I could appear as a guest to comment on the debates

later that evening on a live broadcast by Fox News Channel from a

trailer occupied by them, at the debate site, with the full permission

of the CPD.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">En route to the event, ticket in hand, and members of the press

present and recording everything at my side, I was met by a security

consultant, Mr. John Vezeris, who was flanked by three uniformed state

troopers.  The security consultant, while declining to present any

credentials, told me that he was “instructed by the Commission” to

advise me that “it’s already been decided that, whether or not you

have a ticket, you are not invited.”  One of the police officers told

me that I would face arrest if I continued to remain on the premises.

The security consultant repeatedly refused to divulge who from the CPD

ordered this action and subsequent attempts by my campaign to

establish who ordered this coercive expulsion with the aid of police

officers have not resulted in any names.  I was stopped a second time

by the same police when I attempted to visit the news trailer for a

broadcast I was formally invited to do by Fox News Chief Executive

Roger Ailes and which had been arranged from the premises.   According

to today’s media reports, Mr. Kirk claims I was excluded as a “point

man for the protests,” when I took no part in those protests and when

demonstrations by pro-Gore supporters did not result in similar

exclusionary treatment for Vice-President Gore.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the Green Party candidate for the office of President, I am not

used to being barred by police officers from attending public events

for which I hold a ticket.  Nor am I accustomed to being physically

prevented from attending approved on-site newscasts and reaching

national audiences from venues where I am invited to appear.  Indeed,

the Commission’s decision to deploy public officers at a public

university to bar me from viewing the presidential debates and

participating at a subsequent onsite newscast because of my political

viewpoints and affiliation with the Green Party violates both

Massachusetts State and federal civil rights laws.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Accordingly, in the spirit of a proposed settlement offer for this

outrageous and unlawful behavior, I am seeking the following by 10

a.m.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tuesday morning October 10th:<br>

1) An official, written apology from both of you, on behalf of

Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Albert Gore, Jr.<br>

2) A contribution of $25,000 to the nonprofit The Appleseed Center for

Electoral Reform at Harvard Law School.<br>

3) An assurance that I will not be barred from attending any other CPD

presidential debate venues for which I have an invitation from the

press or a ticket.





</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Should you not respond by Tuesday morning to these three requests, the

Nader 2000 Campaign will pursue its legal remedies on Tuesday, October

10th.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sincerely yours,



<br>

Ralph Nader

Cc: Ms. Janet H. Brown, Executive Director

 <br>

Vice-President Albert Gore, Jr.

 <br>

Governor George W. Bush
