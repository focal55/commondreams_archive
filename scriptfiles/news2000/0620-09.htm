- June 20 - The Interfaith Alliance Foundation Executive Director, the  Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, issued the following statement in response to the US Senate's passage of hate crimes legislation:</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I applaud the US Senate's leadership in taking a firm stand against hate violence.  Neither hate nor violence is a traditional American value, both are abominations to democracy and spirituality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The sacred scriptures of many different religious traditions speak with dramatic unanimity on this matter of hate. When true to the prophetic core of our various religions, we cannot condemn hate and then refuse to act to stop hate and the violence that hate foments upon us.  Religion and government can work together to create a society in which diverse people are safe as well as free.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Amid a lot of election year talk about forging partnerships between religion and government, here is the place for a true, dynamic partnership that does not involve dangerous institutional entanglements but reflects the highest integrity of both religion and government.  We in the inter-religious community will continue to promote the primal moral values that nurture respect for the dignity and worth of every person and thus expose and seek to eradicate hatred as a malignancy of the mind and spirit.  While it is true that legislation cannot remove hate from the hearts and minds of individuals, we learned a long time ago that legislation, like hate crimes legislation, can help to create a society in which people are influenced by their government's unbending intolerance of prejudice-based, hate-motivated violence.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The struggle to eradicate hate from our society is not over, but today's action in the US Senate is a significant step in the right direction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Interfaith Alliance Foundation (TIAF) is a nonpartisan, educational institution dedicated to promoting the positive role of religion as a healing and constructive force in American life.</i></font></p>
