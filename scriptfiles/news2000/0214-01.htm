- February 14 - News Advisory:

<p>WHAT:

<br>

On April 7, 1999, Judge Sam Cummings of the Northern District of

Texas became the first federal judge in more than 40 years to



overturn a gun control law on the grounds that the Second Amendment



protects the individual right to own firearms. Judge Cummings'



ruling in U.S. vs. Emerson not only violated the long-standing rule



that requires lower courts to follow the lead of appellate courts,



but also ignored strong opposing legal and historical scholarship



on the language of the Second Amendment.

<p>The Emerson decision has given new vigor to the gun lobby's

campaign of misrepresenting the Second Amendment as guaranteeing a



broad, individual right to bear arms and precluding the enactment



of reasonable gun control laws.

<p>Some of America's most acclaimed scholars will shatter the gun

lobby's myth of the Second Amendment by presenting academic



studies of the Amendment's historical context. These historians



will refute the individual rights theory promulgated by the



gun lobby, discuss the historical context in which the amendment



was crafted, including its relationship to English law, and



speak directly to the Emerson decision.

<p>This timely symposium will be invaluable to understanding the

arguments surrounding Emerson as the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals



considers the federal government's appeal of the decision.
