- March 2 - </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JOYCE HORMAN

<br>

Joyce Horman is the widow of Charles Horman. Along with another U.S.

citizen, Frank Teruggi, he was detained and murdered in September 1973 in

the days following Gen. Augusto Pinochet's bloody military coup backed by

the U.S. government. She has worked to uncover the facts about his murder

for more than 26 years. Today she said: "With this decision to allow

Pinochet to go to Chile rather than face justice in Spain, it becomes even

more important to press the U.S. intelligence agencies to release the

remaining documents they have on the cases of Charles Horman and Frank

Teruggi as well as any other documents they have on cooperation between U.S.

government agencies and the Chilean dictatorship."

Director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, Birns was serving with the

U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America in Santiago, Chile during the

period immediately leading up to the 1973 Pinochet coup. Today he said: "The

case has produced winners and losers. The winners clearly include the

Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, whose persistence in hunting down Pinochet

was of heroic proportions, as was the vindication of the U.N. Torture

Convention by British judges. The losers in the affair were [British] Home

Secretary Jack Straw for putting his country's strong economic ties with

Chile above the memory of Pinochet's victims, as well as Chile's

Christian-Democrat-led government which dishonored the memory of thousands

of Pinochet's victims by its pusillanimity and genuflecting before Pinochet's

shadow as it spared no effort in trying to get him back to Chile."

<br>

Amnesty International's advocacy director for Latin America and the

Caribbean, Salinas said: "We're clearly disappointed that Mr. Straw decided

to make a political decision rather than allow the process to continue in

the legal arena. However, despite this specific setback, the precedent

established by the case of universal jurisdiction for crimes against

humanity and gross human rights violations -- as well as the clear message

to all human rights violators of the world that their time in court may

still come -- are invaluable outcomes."

<br>

National Security Archive senior analyst Kornbluh, who has led the campaign

for the release of documents on the U.S. role in Chile, said today: "The

British have released Pinochet citing a 'memory deficit' that leaves him

unfit to stand trial. While he may not remember his crimes against humanity,

his victims and the rest of the world will never forget. This leaves

unresolved investigations into Pinochet's crimes and the crimes of his

subordinates." Human rights advocates pointed to the importance of the

U.S. Justice Department continuing its investigation of the 1976 

Letelier-Moffitt

car bomb assassination in Washington, D.C.</font></p>
