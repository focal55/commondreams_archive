<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK  

- February 1 - A statement by the East Timor Action Network/U.S.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reports issued this week by the U.N.'s International Commission of

Inquiry on East Timor and the Indonesian National Commission of Inquiry on

East Timor both confirm what has been long known Indonesian military

officials at the highest levels -- working with militia leaders and

civilian officials -- were responsible for the violence surrounding the

U.N.'s plebiscite in East Timor. Their mandates, however, limited the

investigations to events since January 1999, rather than the entire period

of Indonesia's illegal occupation since 1975. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The individuals named must be

further investigated, prosecuted and, if convicted, punished. Individuals

who suffered human rights abuses should receive reparations.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The special UN panel has recommended that an international tribunal be

established. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Indonesian government, however, insists that an

international tribunal is unnecessary and that the international community

should wait and see if Indonesia can prosecute its own.



The Indonesian government's stance is problematic. While an Indonesian

commission has investigated the most recent violence in East Timor,

Indonesia has yet to demonstrate its ability to follow through with

credible prosecutions. The commission's investigation is only the first

step of a long process, and there is no guarantee that later stages will

meet international standards. Too many uncertainties about the

independence, quality and ability of Indonesia's courts exist.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The democratic Indonesian government has yet to show that it can hold its

military to account. Despite repeated pledges by Indonesia's civilian

leadership, the Indonesian military and its militia allies continue to

block East Timorese refugees from returning home and incursions continue

into East Timor's Oecusse enclave. Indonesia's failure to remedy these

ongoing problems do not inspire confidence in pledges to hold the military

accountable for past activities in East Timor. In addition, Indonesia has a

long record of reneging on commitments to the U.N. Human Rights Commission.

Efforts by members of the military to "deny accountability" and "obstruct"

the Indonesian investigations trouble U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Richard

Holbrooke, among many others.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Indonesia has yet to adopt the necessary legislation to create a human

rights court able to try crimes against humanity. While the Indonesian

parliament is now working on setting up a human rights court, its mandate

as currently conceived will not be retroactive. It leaves past crimes to an

undefined truth and reconciliation commission. The grave human rights

violations committed against the people of East Timor could go unpunished.

While he plans to remove General Wiranto from his cabinet, Indonesian

President Abdurrahman Wahid has already said that he will pardon Wiranto,

if found guilty. Justice will have been delayed and likely denied for the

East Timorese should Indonesia fail to credibly prosecute and punish.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The atrocities committed against the people of East Timor are an

international issue, not just an Indonesian one. An international tribunal

is needed to deal with crimes committed against the international

community, as well as against East Timorese. Both must actively participate

in the prosecution and sentencing of those responsible. While most of those

accused are Indonesian, their alleged crimes were part of a systematic

attempt to undermine and then overturn a U.N.-conducted vote. The East

Timorese who participated in the plebiscite received public promises from

both the U.N. and Indonesia that their vote would be respected. They voted

in the defiance of overt and covert threats, knowing these pledges might

turn out to be hollow. Nearly all of the victims of the violence were East

Timorese, not Indonesian. In the words of the U.N. report, they must "not

be forgotten in the rush of events." East Timorese at all levels of society

have long called for an international tribunal.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">



ETAN calls on the U.S. government and the U.N. to work with the Indonesian

government to establish a joint Indonesian, East Timorese and international

tribunal as recommended by the U.N. commission's report. However, the U.N.

must move forward with an international tribunal, even if Indonesia refuses

to cooperate. The operation of the panel must be totally transparent. Any

tribunal's mandate must be expanded to include atrocities and rights

violations committed as a result of the entire period of Indonesia's

invasion and occupation of East Timor since1975. Both the U.N. and

Indonesian reports are preliminary; the U.S. government (and other U.N.

members) can support further investigations by releasing all relevant files

and intelligence information both to any tribunals and to the general

public. While Indonesia bears the greatest responsibility for events in

East Timor over the last 25 years, governments -- such as the U.S. -- which

supported Indonesia's occupation of East Timor by providing weapons,

training and other assistance, should publicly examine their own complicity.

the massacre of more than 271 peaceful demonstrators in Dili, East Timor.

ETAN/U.S. supports independence and human rights for the people of East

Timor. ETAN has 28 local chapters.
