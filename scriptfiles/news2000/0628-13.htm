- June 28 - U. S. Senator Paul Wellstone criticized Republican

proposals today to repeal the federal gas tax.  Wellstone said that cutting

gasoline taxes would do little, if anything, to reduce the price motorists pay,

and would provide a huge windfall to oil refiners, big oil companies and OPEC. 

Instead, Wellstone called for Congress and the public to hold big oil companies

accountable for possible anti-competitive practices, and expressed his concern

over the lack of competition in the energy sector.



<p>“OPEC and the oil conglomerates will love the Republican proposal, but it won’t

help consumers and motorists.  When gasoline prices are high, people use less

gasoline, cutting into the oil companies’ profits.  But if  these large

conglomerates can count on Congress to cut gasoline taxes every time the price

of crude oil rises, these companies are in a considerably better position to

increase their already skyrocketing profits,” Wellstone said. 

    

<p>Wellstone emphasized that a gas tax cut does not mean lower prices at the pump. 

There is no guarantee that prices at the pump would fall if the tax were cut -

especially in the short term.  In fact, the Federal tax is not actually imposed

at the pump; it is collected shortly after it leaves the refinery. The fuel can

pass through several middlemen before it reaches the consumer. None of these

middlemen would have to pass along the savings, and the reduced tax could simply

be kept by those supplying the fuel. 



<p>“Although the GOP scheme proposes to replace lost gas tax revenues with budget

surpluses, I am concerned that federal highway, transit and transportation

safety programs may be put at risk under such a proposal, or that important

federal programs that benefit working families and children, such as education

and health care, might be eliminated to pay for this scheme,” Wellstone said.

     

<p>Past experience has shown that as the wholesale cost of fuel goes up, prices at

the pump increase. However, decreases in the wholesale price - or in the fuel

tax -- have not been passed on to the motorists or truckers as consistently. 

Several years ago, Connecticut reduced their State fuel tax, but it did not

translate into a price cut for consumers. 

 

<p>Furthermore, some states have laws that automatically increase the state tax if

the federal tax is reduced. In such States, there would be no tax savings to

pass along. 



<p>“I recall that when the FTC announced it would investigate gasoline price

increases in Minnesota, the very next day prices at the pump fell 7-10 cents. 

It would appear that the big oil companies have the greatest control in

determining the price of gasoline.  We may be barking up the wrong tree in going

after federal gas taxes.  We need the FTC and the public to demand some

accountability on energy prices. When you have a few large conglomerates

dominating the energy market, we need to know if they are engaged in

anti-competitive practices and price-gouging of consumers,” Wellstone said.



<p>“A lot of Minnesotans are hurting from these gas price hikes.  Family farmers

are having enough trouble already without outrageous gasoline price hikes.  I

opposed the mergers of Exxon-Mobil and BP Amoco-Arco.  Look at the wave of

mergers in agriculture, the airlines, energy, banking, or telecommunications. 

It's time for Congress to put some free enterprise back in the free enterprise

system, rather than pass on ill-conceived subsidies to big oil corporations

which already are recording record profits.
