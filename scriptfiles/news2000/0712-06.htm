- July 12 - Saying last weekend’s failure of the National Missile Defense

(NMD) system perfectly illustrates the folly of the U.S. military’s current

plan, Senator Paul Wellstone today announced legislation requiring more

realistic testing.  Wellstone is co-sponsoring an amendment reconvening the

independent Welch panel to evaluate the testing program, requiring more

realistic testing, and requiring a report to Congress on the adequacy of the

program.



<p>“Today, national missile defense must be recognized for what it is, an

illusion,” said Wellstone.  “A decision to move forward with deployment of this

system at this stage isn’t responsible policy making, it’s politics.  A good

test asks tough questions.  This test doesn’t.  It’s make believe.  We need an

honest testing of this system, so American taxpayers know if their money is

being spent for a shield which will actually protect them and their families or

is just a waste of money.  A sensible national defense policy would make a more

credible assessment of the threats against our nation, determine whether or not

this system will be able to protect us from those threats, and decide what the

effect of deploying the system will be on overall U.S. security interests.”



<p>The Administration will soon decide whether to begin deploying NMD. This system

is intended to defend the U.S. from limited attacks by intercontinental-range

ballistic missiles armed with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.  To date,

the Department of Defense has conducted three tests of the NMD system, with a

test conducted last Saturday failing in every respect. One test initially

characterized as a success was actually later revealed by Pentagon officials to

have actually been a fluke.  In that test, the interceptor hit its target only

after a series of technical mistakes caused it to drift off course and initially

picked up on a decoy balloon rather than the warhead.  



<p>Previously, the Administration requested that the Pentagon provide an estimate

of whether a national missile defense system can be deployed in five years’

time. General Kadish, the head of the Pentagon’s ballistic-missile-defense

program, has described the 2005 timetable as much faster than military planners

would like. The recommendation of the Pentagon’s own Office of the Operational

and Test Evaluation Program stated clearly that the deployment readiness review

“is a strongly ‘schedule driven’ approach”, rather than one based on results. 

Just last month, the NMD independent review team headed by General Welch stated

that current testing is limited to the point that it “impacts confidence in the

validity of the system.”  This same review team noted that advanced decoys are

likely in the future and that the NMD program will need to develop a program to

combat this “threat evolution.” 



<p>Wellstone also expressed concern that proceeding with a flawed NMD system at

this time could seriously harm, rather than increase, overall U.S. national

security.  Russia has publicly stated that it would respond with “adequate

measures” if the U.S. proceeds with deployment of NMD. Additionally, China has

threatened to accelerate its own strategic arms build-up if the U.S. moves ahead

with this system and has threathened to withdraw its promises to stop exporting

dangerous defense technologies and will base its disarmament policies on the

U.S. decision on NMD.



<p>“Are we prepared to discard an arms control system that has kept the peace for

over fifty years? Are we prepared to ignore the concerns of key allies like

Germany, France and Japan? Are we prepared to undermine the deterrence capacity

of other nuclear countries, including Russia and China?  On the one hand, we

have a proven system that places the assurances of retaliatory destruction

within a framework of treaties.  On the other hand, we have an unproven system

that could provoke a new arms race. The stakes are too high for us to be

foolish.”
