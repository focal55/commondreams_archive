- February 10 - Earth Island Institute has joined Defenders of Wildlife and a

number of other environmental and animal welfare organizations and

individuals in filing a second lawsuit challenging the Clinton

Administration's efforts to weaken U.S. dolphin protection laws.<p>



        "Here they go again, selling out on one of our most

cherished environmental protection laws in order to give in to trade

bureaucrats of the World Trade Organization," stated David Phillips,

Director of Earth Island Institute's International Marine Mammal Project.

"Just a few short months after Seattle, the Clinton Administration has

continued a shameful legacy of ignoring environmental concerns when dealing with trade issues."<p>



        The new lawsuit, filed yesterday in the Court of International

Trade in New York, demonstrates that the new Dept. of Commerce federal

regulations designed to allow import of dolphin-deadly tuna into the U.S.

are seriously flawed and violate Congressional mandates.<p>



        For example, under the new regulations, contrary to law, foreign

tuna fleets can kill 5,000 dolphins annually, and even more under "special

circumstances," without ever reducing dolphin deaths to levels approaching

zero, as called for in the Marine Mammal Protection Act.<p>



        The lawsuit seeks to prevent the lifting of tuna embargoes against

countries, such as Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia, which still allow the

chasing, injuring, netting and killing of thousands of dolphins annually  in order to catch the tuna which swim beneath.<p>



        In August 1999, Earth Island Institute, Defenders of Wildlife, and

other groups filed a separate dolphin lawsuit, charging the Secretary of

Commerce was arbitrary and capricious in allowing the standards for

labeling tuna as "dolphin safe" to be seriously weakened.  That lawsuit is

well underway in U.S. District Court in San Francisco.<p>



        VIDEO AVAILABLE: Broadcast quality video footage by Samuel LaBudde

of the devastating effects of tuna nets on dolphins is available by calling Earth Island (415) 788-3666.<p>
