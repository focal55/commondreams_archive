- July 18 - The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) should

clarify that &quot;leadership PACs&quot; associated with federal candidates and officials

must fully reveal their finances, Public Citizen said today in a

letter urging IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti to issue guidance under a new law

mandating disclosure of contributions and expenditures of Section 527 political

organizations.<i><b> </b></i></font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public Citizen letter was prompted by press reports,

appearing within days of the president&#146;s signing the law July 1, suggesting that one

prominent group of Section 527 &quot;stealth PACs&quot; -- so-called state or non-federal

accounts of leadership PACs connected to federal officeholders and candidates -- would not

have to disclose their contributions and expenditures under the new law. According to

Public Citizen&#146;s inquiries, at least one lawyer associated with such PACs has

promoted this self-serving argument with the press.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, as Public Citizen&#146;s analysis of the law and relevant

Federal Election Commission regulations demonstrates, there is absolutely no legal basis

for any exemption of the state or non-federal accounts of leadership PACs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until enactment of the new law, there was no requirement for the

existence of these accounts to even be acknowledged. According to press reports, there are

at least 30 known state leadership PACs fueled by unlimited, often undisclosed

contributions. This money is being spent on ads, voter registration drives, polling and

other activities designed to influence elections.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It is time to stop this destructive process where good campaign finance reform legislation is

continually subverted by politicians trying to find loopholes,&quot; Public Citizen

President Joan Claybrook said. &quot;Congress has just overwhelmingly voted to reveal

undisclosed Section 527 political money. The IRS should make it crystal clear that

leadership PACs cannot evade this law through so-called &#145;non-federal accounts&#146;

that raise unlimited, secret funds from wealthy special interests.&quot;</font>
