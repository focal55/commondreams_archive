- July 19 - Continuing their fight to guarantee all Americans the

basic right to quality, affordable, and comprehensive health care coverage,

Senator Paul Wellstone and President Andrew Stern of the Service Employees

International Union (SEIU), the nation’s largest health care union with 1.4

million members, today announced “The Health Security for All Americans Act”(S.

2888). The bill for universal health care coverage in America was also

introduced today by Wellstone in the Senate. 



<p>"In this time of unparalleled economic prosperity, every American certainly

ought to have the right to see a doctor when they need to, a doctor of their own

choosing,” said Wellstone.   “It is high time that the right to quality,

comprehensive health care become a reality for all Americans, regardless of

their wealth or income.  And it is time that all Americans be free from the fear

of catastrophic illness wiping them out financially or of being denied the care

they need.” 



<p>Wellstone's Health Security for All Americans Act is designed to reach the goal

of universal health care coverage by allowing states to decide how to provide

quality, affordable, and comprehensive health care coverage for all Americans. 

The proposal insures the uninsured, guarantees affordable health care by

limiting out-of-pocket expenses, provides comprehensive care by guaranteeing a

minimum benefit package equal to that enjoyed by Members of Congress, and

ensures the quality of care benefits by providing strong patient protections. 



<p>“The health insurance industry, using all of its clout and its legions of

lobbyists, took universal health care off the nation’s agenda.  But with this

proposal, and with the grass-roots power of organized working men and women

throughout the country, we are going to put health care for all Americans back

on the agenda,” Wellstone said.



<p>"Our plan tells states and governors to choose their way to universal coverage,

and then backs up that promise with the federal support necessary to help get

them there.  This plan is both decentralized and comprehensive,” said Wellstone.

 “We insist on minimum standards – the same ones members of Congress enjoy.  We

set the national goal of quality, affordable, comprehensive, universal coverage,

but we invite the states to tailor it to the needs of their people. This 

approach is flexible, but we do not give up on the principle that every American

has a right to affordable, dignified health care.”
