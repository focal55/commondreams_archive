- April 6 - With protests planned in mid-April for Washington, D.C., when the World

Bank and the International Monetary Fund meet in the nation's capital, the

following analysts are now available for interviews about those

institutions:



<p>DENNIS BRUTUS, <a href="mailto:dvbmay@vms.cis.pitt.edu">dvbmay@vms.cis.pitt.edu</a>, <a href="http://www.50years.org">http://www.50years.org</a><br>

Now professor emeritus of Africana Studies at the University of Pittsburgh,

Brutus was a political prisoner with Nelson Mandela. A member of Jubilee

2000 South Africa, Brutus said today: "The record of both the World Bank and

IMF over a period of more than 50 years shows that they serve the interests

of the corporations rather than of people. Their policies have led to

increased poverty and misery in much of the developing world. It is time to

stop these policies. Seattle represented a tremendous surge for change in

the world which will be further developed in Washington. What we seek is a

new, just, equitable world in which people are more important than profits."



<p>MEREDETH TURSHEN, <a href="mailto:turshen@rci.rutgers.edu">turshen@rci.rutgers.edu</a>

Author of "Privatizing Health Services in Africa" and a professor of policy

and planning at Rutgers University, Turshen said today: "The IMF and the

World Bank have forced, as conditions of badly needed loans, many African

countries to dismantle their public health services. One consequence of this

is the increased number of reported AIDS cases in Africa. AIDS in Africa is

rarely diagnosed with an HIV test -- they can't afford it. Rather, it's

diagnosed by symptoms, so many of the 'AIDS' cases are actually TB and other

diseases that are easily preventable and treatable if they had minimal

health facilities. Attributing the deaths to 'AIDS' covers for the

culpability of the West in the deteriorating health conditions in Africa and

implies that there's little to be done except get Africans to use condoms,

which dovetails with the World Bank's obsession with population control; it

also plays to sexual stereotypes. The IMF has also ordered currency

devaluations which have severely curtailed drug imports."



<p>JEFFREY WINTERS, <a href="mailto:jaw@northwestern.edu">jaw@northwestern.edu</a><br>

Co-editor of the upcoming book "Re-inventing the World Bank" and associate

professor of political economy at Northwestern University, Winters said

today: "The World Bank's public relations budget is roughly five times its

budget for project auditing and supervision. One consequence of this is the

massive problem of Criminal Debt, that portion of a country's official

foreign debt that is stolen by government officials. For many countries in

the Third World, this is between 25 to 50 percent of the money loaned -- for

Indonesia, it's a third or $10 billion. The population has to pay back 100

percent plus interest. The World Bank's charter requires that it ensure that

the monies it lends are used for their intended purpose -- but since its

inception the Bank has failed to do this, with the losses accruing to poor

people across the developing world."
