- June 15 - Using the death penalty against children flies in the face of basic standards of

     decency and justice, Amnesty International said today as it appealed to

     President Clinton, Vice-President Gore and Governor Bush of Texas to take a

     stand against this internationally illegal punishment.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The human rights organization is asking the three leaders to condemn the recent

     execution of a 14-year-old child called Kasongo in the Democratic Republic of

     Congo and stop the same violation of international law happening in the USA

     next week.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Now, in the 21st century, most people would have no trouble condemning

     unreservedly the atrocity of such an execution, but these US leaders may not

     find it so easy," Amnesty International said.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The USA leads a handful of countries that still flout the international prohibition

     on the use of the death penalty against those convicted of crimes committed

     when they were under 18 years old."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     An African American man, Gary Graham, is scheduled for lethal injection in

     Texas on 22 June for a crime committed when he was 17. 

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The circumstances of the Kasongo and Graham cases may differ, but the

     violation relating to their age is the same," Amnesty International said.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is too late for the human rights violators in the Kasongo case to step back

     from their act, but those with power over Gary Graham's life can still change

     their course of action and the way history will judge them," the organization

     added.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The trials in both cases failed to meet international minimum standards.

     Kasongo, convicted of murder by military court, was denied the right to appeal

     to a higher jurisdiction and shot 30 minutes after his sentence was pronounced. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     In contrast, Gary Graham, also known as Shaka Sankofa, faces execution after

     a process which has lasted nearly two decades. He was denied the right to

     adequate legal representation at his trial, and was convicted on the basis of a

     sole, disputed, eyewitness account. Extensive exculpatory evidence was not

     heard in court because of his lawyers' failings. His guilt in the 1981 killing of

     Bobby Lambert remains in serious doubt.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Gary Graham's execution looms at a time when the error-prone nature of

     death sentencing in the USA has become abundantly clear," Amnesty

     International said. "His case is a textbook example of the fatal flaws that riddle

     the US capital justice system."

</font>

<p>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> Background </b><br>

     In January 2000, the Governor Ryan of Illinois imposed a moratorium on

     executions in his state because of its "shameful" record of wrongful convictions.

     In contrast, Governor George W. Bush continues to assert that the more than

     130 prisoners who have been executed in Texas during his term in office were

     guilty as charged. The Chicago Tribune, which published an exposure of the

     flawed nature of the Illinois capital justice system shortly before Governor Ryan

     suspended executions, this week revealed that it had found that "the problems

     plaguing Illinois are equally pronounced in Texas", and that "Texas has

     executed dozens of inmates whose cases were compromised by unreliable

     evidence, disbarred or suspended defense attorneys, meager defense efforts

     during sentencing and dubious psychiatric testimony."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     A new study of all US death sentences passed between 1973 and 1995 found

     that they were "persistently and systematically fraught with error". The

     Columbia Law School study, released on 12 June, concluded that courts had

     found serious errors in 68 per cent of the cases, a rate which leaves "grave

     doubt whether we catch them all." 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     On 7 June Governor Glendening of Maryland stopped the execution of Eugene

     Colvin-El because "it is not appropriate to proceed with an execution when

     there is any level of uncertainty." Uncertainty runs through the case of Gary

     Graham.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     There have been 47 executions in the USA so far this year -- a rate of two a

     week. Twenty-one of these have been carried out in Texas, which now

     accounts for 220 of the 645 prisoners put to death since the USA resumed

     judicial killing in 1977. Ninety-eight prisoners were executed in the USA in

     1999 alone, a total exceeded only by China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the

     Democratic Republic of Congo.
