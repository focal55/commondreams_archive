<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA  

- February 11 - The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest

gay and lesbian political organization, today endorsed Al Gore for president

of the United States at a West Hollywood, Calif. press conference attended

by the vice president. While his Democratic primary opponent Bill Bradley

has taken honorable stands on gay issues, Gore earned the endorsement

through his long, well-documented history of tangible actions in support of

equality, says HRC.

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Al Gore understands that words create dreams, but actions create results,"

said HRC Executive Director Elizabeth Birch at the press conference.  "He

has demonstrated a thorough understanding of our issues, not just

rhetorically but historically. He has a long, tangible record of support and

has championed our quest for freedom both in word and deed."

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gore best demonstrated his willingness to stand by his convictions in 1996

when the Employment Non Discrimination Act (ENDA) -- which would prohibit

job discrimination based on sexual orientation -- was up for a Senate vote.

Gore actively lobbied his former Senate colleagues to pass this legislation

and vowed, in the event of a tie, to return to Washington by helicopter to

cast the decisive vote.

 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It is still legal to fire people in 39 states just because they are gay,"

said Birch.  "Al Gore has proven that he will actively use the power of his

office to help end this injustice.  If Congress passes ENDA, Gore has

pledged to sign it into law when he is elected President."

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gore and his wife Tipper have been in the forefront in the fight against

AIDS and the spread of HIV at home and abroad. Both he and Tipper visited

and read names at the AIDS quilt. Tipper has served as the chair of the

Washington, DC AIDS walk. Gore has fought within the Clinton administration

to expand Medicaid coverage for people with AIDS. Gore has committed to

using our nation's resources to develop an AIDS vaccine and provide money

for better, life saving drugs.

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gore also supports the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which would help combat

the violence that killed James Byrd Jr. and Matthew Shepard. Gore has

appointed openly gay men and lesbians to high level positions in both his

vice presidential and campaign staffs. Additionally, he supports gays

serving openly in the military.

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next president will pick nominees for the Supreme Court who will make

crucial decisions that will profoundly affect our lives.  During the

Clinton/Gore administration the president signed a historic executive order

banning federal government workplace discrimination based on sexual

orientation. Comments made by both John McCain and George W. Bush suggest

that policies such as this might be in jeopardy if either one wins the oval

office.

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There is a lot at stake in the next presidential election," said Birch.

"The outcome will determine whether we take monumental strides forward or

significantly prolong our fight for fairness. If Gore is elected president,

we will have someone in the oval office who is committed to uniting our

country and ensuring equality for each and every person."

                </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian

and gay political organization with members throughout the country.  It

effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the

public to ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and safe

at home, at work and in the community.
