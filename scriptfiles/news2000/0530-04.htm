- May 30 - The Sierra Club today applauded Vice President Al Gore's

     vision of an "environmental decade" to begin the 21st century.  In his

     address on the shores of Lake Michigan, Gore supported important

     initiatives such as protecting our nation's remaining wild forests,

     encouraging smart growth and opposing efforts to weaken our clean air

     and water laws.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We strongly applaud Vice President Gore for articulating a bold

     vision for protecting the environment in the 21st century," said

     Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope.  "We're especially pleased

     with his support for protecting our wild forest roadless areas,

     including the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. The new draft Forest

     Service plan does not yet protect our wild forests from logging and

     other destructive activities. Gore's vision is the type of bold

     leadership America needs to protect its remaining wild forests for

     future generations to enjoy, explore and discover."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The Sierra Club is urging citizens to attend public hearings this

     summer to urge the U.S. Forest Service to provide full protection for

     all unspoiled roadless areas of 1,000 acres or larger from all

     destructive activities, including the Tongass.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     In addition, Gore called for proactive steps to clean up polluted

     water bodies, such as the Great Lakes and our nation's dirtiest power

     plants.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We're glad Vice President Gore is once and for all dispelling the

     myth that there is a trade-off between clean air and water and a

     world-class economy," Pope said.  "We encourage other leaders to voice

     their support for protecting our environment; for our families, for

     our future."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Gore made the comments in a speech where he received the endorsement

     of the League of Conservation Voters. The Sierra Club is currently

     undergoing its grassroots endorsement process, surveying the views of

     its 65 Chapters and its leaders and members.</font>
