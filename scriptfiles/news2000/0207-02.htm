<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CORVALLIS, OR 

- February 6 - A local group has scheduled a teach-in on the World Trade Organization and

the "Battle in Seattle" for 7 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 8 at the Majestic Theater,

115 S.W. 2nd in Corvallis. Composed primarily of local residents who were in

Seattle during the WTO Ministerial early in December, Corvallis Action on

Globalization has arranged for seven speakers to appear in an

event expected to run two and a half to three hours.



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The event will center on the issues that brought approximately 50,000

protesters to Seattle to protest the WTO's structure and operations. A broad

coalition including human rights activists, environmentalists, labor and

others converged in Seattle to participate in marches, rallies and protests

in an attempt to call public attention to the WTO.



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scheduled speakers at the teach-in include Wayne Anderson of the United

Steelworkers of America; Chuck Willer, Coast Range Association; Manuel

Pacheco, professor of philosophy at Oregon State University; journalist and

filmmaker Paul VanDevelder; Albert V. Krebs of the Corporate Agribusiness

Research Project; Alan Kapuler, research director of Seeds of Change; and

Sharon Scott, social worker and member of Benton Pacific Greens.



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The speakers will respond to questions from the audience following

individual 15-minute presentations related to such issues as labor,

agriculture, the environment, democracy, and human rights.



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Local sponsors of the event include Benton Pacific Greens, Carpenters Local

1094, the Coast Range Association, the Committees for Correspondence,

Students for World Awareness - Crescent Valley H.S., the Corvallis

Environmental Center, the Corvallis Page, First Alternative Co-op, Jobs with

Justice, the Just Peace Committee of the First Congregational Church, KBOO

Radio 100.7 FM, NW Earth Institute, OPEU - OSU Classified Employees, and the

United Steelworkers of America.



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Admission to the teach-in is $3.00, though no one will be turned away for

lack of funds.





</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">



<b>Webcast to feature Corvallis WTO teach-in</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Audio of Tuesday evening's WTO teach-in at the Majestic Theatre will be

available to anyone in the world with Web access via a "webcast", according

to Sam Ettaro of Unisun Communications, Corvallis.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ettaro said that he was attracted to the teach-in, organized by Corvallis

Action on Globalization, as a subject for a webcast by "the potential to

educate people who may not be up to speed on just what is happening with the

WTO and the general 'globalization' of the economy: what it means, where

it's taking us, and the direct impact on our everyday lives...



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Also, it's very important to keep the momentum going after the Seattle

protest.  We need to be sure that we keep this issue in the forefront of

people's minds. It's all-encompassing  and affects every single aspect of

our lives."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Information on the webcast is available on the World Wide Web at

www.unisun.org.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Potentially, the webcast can make the teach-in available to tens of

thousands of people around the world, Ettaro said. People listening to the

event on the web will be able to participate in near real-time by e-mailing

questions or comments through the Unisun website as the event is  underway.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Right now, due to monetary constraints  we're going to have a limited

number of feeds available," Ettaro said. "For now, I'm just telling people:

'The early surfer catches the feed!'



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ettaro founded Unisun three years ago with the intent of basing his company

on the internet. He began live webcasts in January when he covered a

performance of Kerosene Dream at the Fox and Firkin in Corvallis. A few days



later, he webcast a performance by Greg Brown.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"During the Greg Brown show," Ettaro said, "we received responses from

Quebec,

St. Paul, Colorado, Alaska....All over the place."



The teach-in begins at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 8.
