- July 5 - Today, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Founder and

President of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, called on people of conscience

to step forward to participate in a march against bigotry and racial disparities

in Mississippi. The two-day march will take demonstrators from the site

of Raynard Johnson’s hanging death to the courthouse in Columbia.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jackson urged elected officials, ministers, civil rights activists,

and people of conscience to step forward to help expose the many racial,

gender and economic disparities that exist in the state of Mississippi.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“This coming weekend we are convening leadership from across Mississippi

and other southern states to participate in a two-day march and a series

of community rallies in an effort to expose the racist underbelly of Mississippi,”

said Jackson. “All races need to come together to work towards a new Mississippi.

A Mississippi that practices equal protection under the law, a Mississippi

that practices due process and encourages economic and social justice.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“There appears to be a bounding fear in Kokomo, Mississippi. There was

an ugly epithet on a bridge near the Johnson’s home that stated Kill All

Niggers. That slur remained for weeks before Raynard’s death - it was just

recently removed, but its sentiment still lingers in Kokomo.”

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first portion of the march will take place on July 8, 2000 in Kokomo,

Mississippi where hundreds of supporters will meet and march to the tree

where Raynard Johnson was hanged. Then on July 9, 2000, in Columbia, Mississippi,

supporters will gather in Ducksworth Park and march to the Columbia Courthouse.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“We have talked with Mississippi’s Governor who assured us of his willingness

to look into the Johnson’s case and provide a thorough investigation,”

said Jackson. “We have talked to Attorney General Janet Reno, and Deputy

Attorney General Eric Holder, and so the Department of Justice and the

FBI are involved in this case and are pursuing leads.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“We have not stopped working to expose the dark underbelly of Marian

County since we learned of the suspicious hanging death of Raynard Johnson.

We stand firmly with the family and do not believe that this is a case

of suicide. We know that Kokomo was a very threatening environment for

the Johnson family. Raynard Johnson’s social relationships with white female

friends were the subject of bitter racial animosity from people in the

community toward him and his family. On several occasions Raynard was confronted

or threatened with violence.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Recently the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition began to investigate claims that

several other mysterious deaths of African American males within the Marian

County have occurred within the last 18-months. Now that we have begun

to examine the possibility that Raynard Johnson is one of many African

American men who may have died at the hands of local white supremacists,

we have to wonder what’s happening in the dark in Mississippi?</font>
