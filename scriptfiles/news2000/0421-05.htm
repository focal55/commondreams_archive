- April 21 - Environmental activists from Public Citizen and other groups on

Friday joined &quot;Granny D&quot; in a Capitol Hill protest to highlight the pollution

and environmental harm caused by federal policies influenced by corporate campaign

donations.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Granny D, or Doris Haddock, is the 90-year-old great-grandmother who trekked across

America recently to call attention to the need to reform the corrupt campaign finance

system. She was joined on Friday by a number of environmental and energy activists,

including Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Critical

Mass Energy Project.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The activists held a brief press conference outside the Capitol before marching to the

Capitol Rotunda to speak out for campaign

reforms, including a ban on unlimited soft money contributions by corporations,

wealthy individuals and unions. The protesters were arrested by the police.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hauter cited electric utility

deregulation, nuclear waste disposal

and radioactive recycling as

examples of issues in which industry is purchasing influence with campaign money. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Corporate interests are buying and selling public policy, and that has a

detrimental effect on our pocketbooks, our health, the environment and our

democracy,&quot; Hauter said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nearly two dozen states have passed laws forcing ratepayers to pay collectively about

$150 billion to bail out electric utilities, mostly for uneconomic and dangerous nuclear

reactors that never should have been built in the first place. Now nuclear utilities are

lobbying Congress to protect the bailout. Electric utilities gave more than $3 million to

candidates for federal elections in the current election cycle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The nuclear industry also has been doling out money to members of Congress in an effort

to persuade the government to take control of the industry&#146;s deadly nuclear waste.

From 1997 to 2000, the industry plied federal candidates with a total of about<b> </b>$16

million. The industry is pushing a scheme to move its toxic trash from nuclear power

plants to an inappropriate dump at Yucca Mountain, Nev. In the first quarter of this year,

the Senate and House both passed legislation that would lead to 100,000 shipments of

nuclear waste on the roads and rails of 43 states, exposing 50 million Americans to

radiation in the event of a crash.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The nuclear industry has used its money to develop special relationships with members

of Congress. New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, for example, raised $425,000 from energy and

defense-related companies or individuals for his most recent re-election campaign in 1996.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Domenici supports every aspect of the nuclear industry -- from food irradiation to

recycling radioactive waste into household products. He was instrumental in the

authorization of approximately $100 million over the next several years to study whether

exposure to so-called low levels of radiation is really a health risk. The study will be

used to justify the recycling of radioactive waste into household goods.</font>
