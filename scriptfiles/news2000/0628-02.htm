- June 28 - A delegation from Tucson and Douglas/Bisbee,

Arizona, sponsored by the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC)

and the Coalici&oacute;n de Derechos Humanos (Human Rights Coalition)

of Tucson, will be meeting with members of Congress and the administration

concerning escalating vigilante activity in their communities

along the U.S./Mexico border. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

A Press Briefing has been called for <b>Tuesday</b>, <b>June 27,

2000 in room SC-6 at 2:00 PM in the US Capitol Building </b>to

focus on growing violence at the Arizona border where it has been

reported at least 30 incidents of local ranchers detaining and

arresting undocumented border crossers at gunpoint. These activities

have been bolstered by the support of anti-immigrant groups nationally,

including those headed by David Duke and Patrick Buchanan. Meetings

have been scheduled with the Immigration and Naturalization Service,

the Department of Justice, the White House, the Congressional

Hispanic Caucus and delegation members' congressional representatives.

The Arizona Border Delegation for Peace and Justice is a group

of human rights activists, religious organizers, community members,

and ranchers from the Douglas/Bisbee and Tucson areas. Accompanying

the group is Maria Jimenez of the AFSC. Jimenez, director of AFSC's

Immigration Law Enforcement Monitoring Project (ILEMPS), coordinates

efforts to monitor human rights abuses along the US/Mexico border.



</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The voices of the affected communities must be heard by

policymakers,&quot; said Jimenez. &quot;The recent surge of vigilantism

by ranchers on the border stems from an 'out of sight, out of

mind' strategy pursued by the U.S. government. The Justice Department

needs to find a solution to the border problems that is acceptable

to everyone,&quot; Jimenez added. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The roots of this crisis lie in the current generation of border

control policies being pursued by the Immigration and Naturalization

Service (INS). These &quot;blockade-style&quot; enforcement strategies

claiming to stem the flow of undocumented immigrants, have actually

forced migrants to cross into ever more hostile and dangerous

desert terrain, where they risk accidents, dehydration, and death.

Meanwhile, as a direct result of the heightened presence of law

enforcement, border communities have become divided and filled

with hostility, suspicion, and violence. As Isabel Garcia, a delegation

member, human rights activist and attorney based in Tuscon, Arizona,

asks the question, &quot;How many deaths will it take before we

realize that our policy is at the root of the problem?&quot; </font>
