- October 31 - Genetic engineering has far outrun the science that must be its first

governing discipline. Many unknowns attend the insertion of genes across

species, from ecological risks to food allergies-and even more frightening

uncertainties surround the effort to clone humans or manipulate human

germlines-that is, to breed genetically modified humans. These unknowns beg

for investigation, before biotech corporations or their indentured

researchers introduce unintended hazards into the natural environment.



<p>In the industry, corporate greed has eclipsed sound science and the humility

and caution that should be manifest in contemplations of "Changing the

Nature of Nature," as Martin Teitel and Kimberly Wilson subtitled their

recent book Genetically Engineered Food, which should serve as a primer on

that issue for all citizens and government regulators. Compounding the

problem, government regulators have abandoned their duty to protect the

public, choosing instead a mission of industry boosterism.



<p>The result has been a rush to introduce genetically altered seeds into the

natural environment without adequate testing; a frenzy to patent genes,

seeds and life forms and to extend monopolistic control over the very

material of life; a transformation of university culture so that traditional

values of openness and shared information are increasingly replaced by

proprietary agreements and a focus on personal, university and corporate

bottom lines; and an effort to foist genetically altered food on an

unknowing public that would reject biotech foods if notified and given

alternatives. Even more serious perils lie in the near future, as biotech

companies increasingly focus on manipulating human germlines, the prospect

of genetic discrimination rises and researchers such as Princeton's Lee

Silver openly predict the creation of "Genrich" and "Natural" classes of

people.



<p>The Clinton-Gore Administration has been extremely cozy with the biotech

industry, until recently relying on voluntary safety assurances by industry

for biotech food. The regulatory budget for environmental and human health

safety assessment has been tiny in comparison to research and other monies

budgeted to aid industry aims. Recently, the Administration supported only

the voluntary labeling of genetically modified foods. Under the new plan,

the FDA will require companies to disclose the planned release of

genetically modified products into the food supply merely 120 days before

their introduction. No testing will be required. This decision represents

the Administration's staggering failure to recognize the precautionary

principle and protect human heath and the environment.



<p>The Taco Bell crisis and the mixing of genetically altered corn-not approved

for human consumption-into the nation's corn supply reveals how poorly

government regulators have been doing their job. Indeed, it was not the FDA,

but biotech activists, who discovered the problem.

It is time to re-establish priorities. Protection of human health and the

environment must take precedence over corporate efforts to rush the latest

product to market and please investors. The commodification of life must be

stopped. Sci-fi-like proclamations about "improving" the human species

through germline modification must not be permitted to translate into public

policy. We must:



<p> Halt the release of genetically altered plants into the environment until

comprehensive, independent studies are performed as to environmental and

food-safety risks under a regulatory framework.



<p>  Exempt life forms from the purview of patent laws in order to allow

broader research and safety testing opportunities by academia and

government.



<p> Place liability for harm on the owners or licensees of biotechnology

patent rights in the event of damages caused by environmental release.



<p> Label all food containing any genetically altered ingredients.



<p> Ban the genetic manipulation of human embryos-cloning or germline

manipulation-for reproductive purposes.



<p> Adopt much more rigorous personal and institutional conflict-of-interest

rules for recipients of federal research funding; ever-tightening

corporate-university alliances undermine the independence and critical

detachment needed from academia to monitor corporate biotech schemes.
