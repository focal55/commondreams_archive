- September 29 - Child poverty in



America dropped from 13.5 million children in 1998 to 12.1 million



in 1999, according to the U.S. Census Bureau figures released



this week. While the percentage of children living in poverty



in America is at its lowest level since 1979, the percentage



of poor children in working families continues to climb with



77 percent of poor children living in families where someone



is working. The Children's Defense Fund (CDF) hopes the downward



trend continues but believes that 12.1 million children in poverty



is still too high and that too many of America's children remain



at the bottom of the nation's agenda.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are very glad that 1.4 million children are no longer poor,



but we are very sad that 12.1 million children are still poor



and a great majority of them in working families," said Marian



Wright Edelman, founder and president of the Children's Defense



Fund. "It is shameful that more children are living in poverty



now than 20 years ago. When has there ever been a better time



for this nation to invest in its children, than when it has



huge federal and state surpluses, billions in tobacco settlements,



billions in welfare reform money, millions in unspent child



health money in the states, and 8 years of prosperity? If not



now, when?"

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Census figures show that more families are struggling to



stay afloat in the workforce, and that the percentage of poor



children living in working families continues to rise-up from



61 percent in 1993 to 77 percent in 1999.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Child poverty is America's dirty little secret," said



Edelman. "We must get it out in the open and clean it up now.



Every politician making speeches about Leaving No Child Behind



needs to be specific about how they will provide for nearly



12 million children without health insurance, for the 12.1



million still living in poverty, and for the millions still not



getting quality child care or a decent education and a fair



share of our nation's prosperity."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Census Bureau defines poverty as an income below $13,290



a year, or the equivalent of $1,108 a month for a family of



three.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mission of the Children's Defense Fund is to Leave No



Child Behind(r) and to ensure every child a Healthy Start, a



Head Start, a Fair Start, a Safe Start, and a Moral Start in



life and successful passage to adulthood with the help of caring



families and communities. CDF provides a strong, effective



voice for all the children of America who cannot vote, lobby, or



speak for themselves. We pay particular attention to the needs



of poor and minority children and those with disabilities. CDF



educates the nation about the needs of children and encourages



preventive investment before they get sick or into trouble, drop



out of school, or suffer family breakdown. CDF began in 1973



and is a private, nonprofit organization supported by foundation



and corporate grants, and individual donations. We have never



taken government funds.</font>
