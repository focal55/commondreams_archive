- June 14 - Physicians for Social



Responsibility (PSR) Tuesday condemned plans by Senate Republicans,



led by Sen. Wayne Allard (R-Colo.), to allow the Department of



Energy to develop a new line of nuclear weapons. This will permit



development of a small, bunker-busting nuclear weapon designed to



take nuclear war to the regional level.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senate supporters of the Allard Amendment see a new regional



nuclear weapon, working in tandem with the National Missile Defense



as a guarantee of nuclear weapons use with impunity.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In voting against the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty last year,



and now moving to mandate development of regional nuclear weapons,



the Senate is promoting nuclear proliferation and risking the



catastrophe of nuclear war," said Robert K. Musil, Ph.D, executive



director and CEO of Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR).



"This sends a signal to the world that the U.S. places a high value



on nuclear weapons, and are not prepared to disarm. Other countries



are bound to follow us into this new arms race."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposal for new nuclear weapons development is contained in



an amendment to the FY2001 Defense Authorization Act, currently



under debate in the Senate. The amendment requires a DOD/DOE study



of the need for a small, bunker-busting warhead and allows research



and development necessary to develop such a new weapon. The weapon



would be intended for use in conflicts such as the Gulf War to



attack national command facilities, such as Saddam Hussein's bunker



under Baghdad. This move makes clear the motivation behind the



Republican Leadership in the Senate's drive to defeat the



Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1999. That treaty would have



prevented testing of such a new warhead, a necessary step in new



weapon development.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The world is moving to prevent proliferation of nuclear



weapons, as a step in preventing the ultimate health emergency --



nuclear war. Ending testing and development of new weapons is a



necessary part of that vital task," said Kimberly Roberts, security



program associate. "Now Sen. Allard wants to move in the opposite



direction, lowering the bar for nuclear use, threatening millions



of deaths and environmental disaster in a nuclear war, by accident



or even by design."</font>
