- June 7 - Marking the second anniversary of the death of Mr. James Byrd, Jr., a disabled black American, who was assaulted and dragged to his death in Jasper, Texas, on June 7, 1998, The Interfaith Alliance is designating today National Call to Congress Day on behalf of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act (HCPA).</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Interfaith Alliance Executive Director, <b>the <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/Directors/directors.htm">Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy</a> will issue a statement today calling on elected officials to pass hate crimes legislation at a press conference sponsored by the office of Senator Chuck Robb at 1:30 at the Senate Swamp</b> (Rain location: Senate Radio/TV gallery).  Additionally, over 10,000 activists have been called upon from TIA's Interfaith Community Action Network <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/Newsroom/ican/060500ic.html">http://www.interfaithalliance.org/Newsroom/ican/060500ic.html</a> to call their member of Congress and Senator during the National Call to Congress Day and demand support for hate crime legislation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this week, Dr. Gaddy wrote a letter to both Governor Bush and Vice President Gore urging them to publicly remember Mr. Byrd on June 7th and to offer strong leadership for hate crimes legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Dear Governor Bush and Vice President Gore,</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As we approach the anniversary of one of our nation's greatest injustices - and arguably - one of our nation's saddest reminders that the great battle for civil rights for all Americans is yet to be won, I write you today with a request. As you well know, on June 7, 1998, Mr. James Byrd Jr., a disabled black American, was assaulted and dragged to his death in Jasper, Texas by three men blinded by hatred and prejudices which hailed from our country's worst days as a segregated society.  While the anniversary of this hate crime is a tragic one, it is one that we need to remember because it tells us of the work that we must do as a nation to ensure that all Americans - regardless of the color of their skin, regardless of their professed beliefs, and regardless of with whom they chose to hold hands -- are protected under the law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Governor Bush and Vice President Gore, even though the words "Equal Justice Under The Law" are emblazoned above the highest court in our land, as people of faith, you and I know, that not all Americans are protected. The time to change this is now.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As the Governor of Texas and as the Republican nominee for President of the United States and as Vice President of the United States and as the Democratic nominee for President of the United States, you articulate the vision of your party for all the country to see, to consider, and to act upon.  As the leaders of your parties, people look to you for leadership on how to address issues that are currently affecting our country. People from different religious traditions look to you for proposals of real faith based solutions that bring people together rather than create ideological rifts that tear our country's people apart.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Given our nation's need and the power of your leadership, I want to encourage you to publicly remember Mr. Byrd on Wednesday, June 7th.  The thousands of people involved in The Interfaith Alliance believe that the most effective way to address this anniversary is to urge your friends in the Congress to co-sponsor, support and enact hate crimes prevention legislation in this session of the 106th Congress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Hate Crimes Prevention Act (H.R. 1082/S.622) addresses specific obstacles that prosecutors and others who battle hate crimes everyday need in order to effectively do their jobs. They need your help in protecting all Americans. The Hate Crimes Prevention Act (HCPA) would specifically add gender, disability and sexual orientation to current law and remove the federally-protected activity requirement. HCPA was re-introduced in this Congress with a record number of 42 co-sponsors in the Senate and 191 in the House of Representatives. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As the leading national grassroots religious organization representing over 100,000 people of faith and goodwill, we are asking both you and the Vice President to take a public stand and to offer strong leadership on this important issue. In addition to our request to you, we have designated June 7th as The Interfaith Alliance National Call to Congress Day on behalf of HCPA legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Governor Bush and Vice President Gore, with the nation focused on the election and the choice of two different visions for the White House, we hope that you will offer the American public a promise concerning civil rights for all Americans. "Equal Justice Under The Law" demands no less.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On October 7, 1999, The Interfaith Alliance Foundation along with the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR), launched an unprecedented campaign - STOP the HATE: Interfaith Vigils Against Hate Violence <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/Initiatives/sth/index.htm">http://www.interfaithalliance.org/Initiatives/sth/index.htm</a>.  Over 350 communities across the country participated in interfaith vigils and events dedicated to raising a united voice against hate violence.  The second annual STOP the HATE is scheduled for October 5, 2000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Founded in 1994, The Interfaith Alliance (TIA) is a non-partisan clergy-led grassroots organization dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in the life of the nation and challenging those who manipulate religion to promote intolerance.  With more than 100,000 members drawn from over 50 faith traditions, clergy-led local Alliances in 38 states, and a national network of activists in every state, TIA promotes civility, mutual respect, and cooperation in our increasingly-diverse society.</i></font></p>
