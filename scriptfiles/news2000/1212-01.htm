- December 12 - While the world waits for the U.S. Supreme 

Court's decision in the recount controversy, the Florida Supreme Court 

could still change the vote count and put Vice President Gore in the lead. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Attorney Gerald Richman filed supplemental papers today to the Florida 

Supreme Court in the appeal of the Seminole County voter fraud case. The &quot;Notice of Supplemental Authority&quot; filed today is based on yesterday's 

Florida Supreme Court clarification. This is a major new grounds for 

victory on appeal in the Seminole County case.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The court's decision in the Palm Beach case is a huge boost for our 

chances to win on appeal,&quot; said Richman. The Florida Supreme Court 

yesterday emphasized that courts are unable to diverge from the plainly 

articulated intent of the legislature. &quot;It is very clear in our case that 

the legislature in 1998 intended to provide for strict compliance with 

Florida's election requirements, especially those pertaining to absentee 

ballots,&quot; he added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier yesterday before the U.S. Supreme Court, Joseph P. Klock, counsel 

for Secretary of State Katherine Harris, argued that voters must follow 

precise instructions in order for their vote to be legally counted. Klock 

argued &quot;the fact is that a legal vote at the very basics has to at least 

be following the instructions you are given&#133;&quot; This also provides important 

support to the argument we are making in the Seminole County case. Voters 

who failed to include voter registration numbers did not follow the 

instructions they were given and the law makes clear these should not be 

counted as legal votes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The appeal is based on the judge's error in determining a series of 

actions to be illegal but unintentional. The key issue in this case is 

that election supervisor Sandra Goard arranged for GOP operatives to alter 

absentee ballot requests. Numerous similar Democratic requests were 

rejected. Florida law requires that only a voter, a family member or 

guardian may complete all information on the absentee ballot application.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Seminole County Board of Elections separated rejected absentee ballot 

applications and gave special privilege to Republicans. Republican 

requests that were incomplete or incorrect received ballots, resulting in 

almost 2,000 additional Republican votes being cast.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Justice in Florida campaign works in cooperation with Palm Beach law 

firm Richman Greer to support the plaintiff in the case and to help defend
