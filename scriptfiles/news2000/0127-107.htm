- January 27 - In yet another blow to the policies of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the federal district court of the Western District of Washington has ruled that the agency continues to violate federal law. The federal judge's ruling validates Greenpeace's concerns, raised for over a decade, that question the health of the ecosystem of the North Pacific waters.

<p></p>

The ruling, released Tuesday in Seattle, found that the NMFS continues to violate the Endangered Species Act (ESA). This ruling follows an earlier decision by the same court that concluded the NMFS had been operating without any understanding of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and, therefore, was neglecting to identify the true impact on the environment of its decision. Specifically, the ruling states that the NMFS has completely failed to consider the effects of its management of the North Pacific groundfish fisheries on endangered species, such as the Steller sea lion.

<p></p>

"The Fisheries Service has undermined its credibility with the Court in its ability to protect the endangered Steller sea lion," said Paul Clarke of Greenpeace. "Greenpeace has long been skeptical of the Fisheries Service's repeated concessions to the industrial trawl fleet. Now the court has shown that we were not mistaken."

<p></p>

In its opinion, the Court notes that the NMFS has broken promises over the years and has utterly failed to meet the mandates of the ESA, even failing to examine the relevant and available data in its latest efforts to comply with the law. The opinion states that the agency's "analysis is admittedly incomplete and its conclusions inconclusive."

<p></p>

Although specific to the North Pacific region, the ruling has the potential to set precedence for questioning the way the NMFS manages the health of marine ecosystems throughout the country. In the New England region, continued mismanagement by the agency has devastated the region's ecosystem and the communities that depend on fishing.

<p></p>

"It seems that only powerful industry forces and not history or common sense can play a role in the way this agency operates," said Niaz Dorry of Greenpeace.  "Despite the accumulated evidence, the Fisheries Service continues to make the same mistakes in New England with the herring fishery and its relationship to the region's endangered and troubled species that drove us to take them to court in the North Pacific."

<p></p>

This week's ruling could have national effects for the NMFS as the role of fisheries and healthy ecosystems will have to be reconsidered by the agency. The recent rulings could force NMFS to examine the individual, combined, and cumulative effects of the fisheries on the regions' ecosystems, and to consider changes to its current fishery management regimes in order to comply with federal laws as it is now required to do with the fisheries of the North Pacific.
