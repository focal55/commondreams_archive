- May 3 - The Union of Concerned Scientists today expressed disappointment in the Clinton administration's initiative on genetically engineered foods.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



The steps outlined by the administration will enable voluntary food labeling, formalize food safety "consultations," and reassess government oversight of environmental risks.</font>

<p>

 

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This initiative is little more than window dressing on what remains a rickety regulatory structure," said Dr. Margaret Mellon, director of the Agriculture and Biotechnology Program at UCS.</font>

<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Such half measures will do little to create confidence in either the technology or government assurances that engineered foods are safe."</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Despite public demand for a strong regulatory system with mandatory safety testing and labeling of genetically engineered foods, the new proposals remain essentially voluntary.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Moreover, formalizing consultations on food safety will mean little as long as it is the biotech companies that still decide what tests to undertake and what information to provide to the government.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Instead, the FDA should establish and require a minimal set of tests to address the safety of genetically engineered foods.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Again, the proposal to enable voluntary labeling of genetically engineered foods utterly fails to meet consumer demand to know which foods contain altered ingredients. Labeling some foods as non-engineered will not meet that demand.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



Ironically, the administration proposal could discourage even voluntary labeling if the FDA ends up requiring the addition of so-called contextual statements drafted by the government. These statements would accompany non-engineered food labels and would tout engineered foods as safe or not different from non-engineered foods.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 



Finally, the proposal to reexamine the regulatory framework comes much too late in the Clinton administration. UCS welcomes a review of current biotech regulations, particularly as it applies to genetically altered fish, which are now considered to be within the purview of the FDA through its oversight of veterinary drugs.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



With a presidential election nearing, the administration proposal could actually weaken rather than strengthen regulation at the EPA, where it could be used as an excuse to delay ongoing efforts to finalize the plant pest rule and reregister Bt crops.</font>

<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The administration has missed a golden opportunity to take concrete steps to bolster oversight and regulation of environmental risks," said Dr. Jane Rissler, a plant pathologist at UCS.</font>

<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"First, it could and should have announced that it would push the long-overdue EPA plant pesticide rule to completion. Second, it should have guaranteed decisions on the reregistration of Bt crops. And third, it should have stopped the ongoing review of genetically engineered salmon until the government is prepared to deal properly with environmental risks."</font>
