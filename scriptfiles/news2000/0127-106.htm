- January 27 - The Ocean Wildlife

Campaign (OWC) -- a coalition of six national conservation groups



working to protect sharks and other giant ocean fishes -- applauded



Rep. Randy Cunningham (R-Calif.) and Chairman Jim Saxton (R-N.J.),



Subcommittee on Fisheries Conservation, Wildlife and Oceans, as



they introduced binding legislation intended to permanently ban the



reckless practice of shark finning -- slicing off a shark's fins



and discarding its carcass at sea -- in all U.S. waters. The bill



further directs the Secretary of State to work toward a similar ban



worldwide.

<p>Cited by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) as

"wasteful of valuable shark resources and pos 1/8ing 3/8 a threat to



attaining the conservation objectives of fishery management", the



practice of finning was banned in federal waters of the U.S.



Atlantic in 1993, but has expanded dramatically during this same



period in portions of the U.S. Pacific. "Our hats are off to Mr.



Cunningham and Mr. Saxton for attacking head-on an issue



characterized by rampant waste, egregious inconsistencies with U.S.



domestic and foreign policy, and inaction by regional fishery



managers," noted Russell Dunn, Assistant Director, OWC.

<p>Despite concerns expressed by conservationists, fishermen,

scientists, the public and the Hawaii State legislature over the



practice, the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council



(WESPAC) has steadfastly refused to act. The move by Cunningham and



Saxton to secure a permanent legislative prohibition on shark



finning follows a litany of warnings to halt the practice by the



Clinton Administration and the successful adoption of H. Con. Res.



189 by the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1999, which



expressed strong opposition to the irresponsible and damaging



practice of shark finning.

<p>The number of sharks killed in the Hawaiian longline fisheries

has climbed from 2,289 in 1991 to 60,857 in 1998 -- a whopping



2,500 percent increase. "Over 98 percent of these sharks were



killed for their fins to meet the huge demand for shark fin soup,"



explained Dr. David Wilmot, OWC Director. "And because shark fins



comprise only one to five percent of the animal's bodyweight -- 95



to 99 percent of the shark is going to waste." NMFS and the



National Oceanic and Atmospheric have pressured WESPAC to prohibit

shark finning for months, but the council balked at agency pressure



in June and October.

<p>The United States has been a leading proponent of international

shark conservation measures and the conspicuous lack of protection



for sharks in the U.S. Central and Western Pacific represents a



glaring gap in otherwise relatively sound U.S. shark policy,



remarked Sonja Fordham, shark fisheries specialist for the Center



for Marine Conservation, an OWC member group. "Our inability to



address the egregious finning problem within our own waters



threatens to undermine U.S. credibility in the international



arena."

<p>According to the OWC, the massive increase in shark landings

coupled with poor information regarding the status and health of



Pacific shark populations is cause for concern. Sharks' unique



biological characteristics -- slow growth, late sexual maturity,



and the production of few young -- make them particularly



vulnerable to overfishing. This biological vulnerability and the



unknown population status of many sharks species in the Pacific



Ocean demand a level of precautionary and proactive management that



is far above the current patchwork of state and federal shark



regulations now in place in U.S. Pacific waters.

The Ocean Wildlife Campaign is a coalition of Center for Marine

Conservation, National Audubon Society, National Coalition for



Marine Conservation, Natural Resources Defense Council, Wildlife



Conservation Society and World Wildlife Fund. It was created to



tackle the complex challenge of conserving and restoring large



ocean fishes, including sharks, tunas, and swordfish. The Ocean



Wildlife Campaign is generously supported by The Pew Charitable



Trusts and The David and Lucile Packard Foundation.
