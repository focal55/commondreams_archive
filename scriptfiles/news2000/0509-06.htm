- May 9 - News Advisory:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A press conference will be held at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday,



May 10, in the Zenger Room of the National Press Club. The speakers



will be:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Joel Reynolds, Natural Resources Defense Council;

<br>

-- Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research;

<br>

-- Dr. Charles Bernard, military expert, U.S. Navy (retired)

-- Dr. Marsha Green, Ocean Mammal Institute;

-- Dr. Naomi Rose, Humane Society of the United States

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmental and animal welfare organizations and marine



scientists will present evidence directly linking the mass



stranding of whales and dolphins in the Bahamas in March 2000 to



the U.S. Navy use of active sonar devices in the area. These



organizations will call for the suspension of further development,



testing and deployment of Low Frequency Active (LFA) sonar, a



particularly dangerous and far-reaching active sonar technology.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Navy's LFA sonar emits noise so loud it can destroy the



vital organs and tissue of marine mammals. Its potential for



deafening, disorienting and disturbing marine mammals over a wide



area is considerable. Other active sonar devices, such as those



used in the Bahamas, emit sounds in mid-range frequencies that may



be particularly dangerous for beaked whale species, the type that



stranded in the greatest numbers in the Bahamas incident.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Navy is turning a blind eye to the evidence that its sonar



technologies are posing a direct threat to marine life. The Navy



continues to declare its technologies harmless with inadequate and



superficial analyses while dead whales and dolphins drift to shore. In a scenario reminiscent of the Department of Defense's "star



wars" program, the Navy is pursuing its testing plans for mid-range



frequency sonar devices and its deployment plans for LFA sonar



despite serious and legitimate doubts about the efficacy of the



technology and concerns about the harmful effects on marine life.



Further Navy testing involving active sonar of the type used in the



Bahamas is scheduled along the east coast of the United States this



summer; a Navy-sponsored research project involving low frequency



sounds and their effect on whales is planned off the Azores this

summer.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The organizations listed above will call for a halt to the East



Coast testing plans until a complete and thorough investigation



into the Bahamas incident is completed and evaluated by the



scientific and environmental communities. Footage of the stranding



of marine mammals will be shown.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Press kits and B-roll footage will be available.</font>
