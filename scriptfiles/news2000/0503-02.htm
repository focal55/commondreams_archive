- May 3 - The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC)

today called for the U.S. Justice Department of Defense to halt

their imminent operation to arrest the people peacefully occupying

the U.S. military's enclave on Vieques, the Puerto Rican island

used for decades for livefire military training. 

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The deal brokered by President Clinton to allow resumption

of the bombing, gunnery practice and military training exercises

flies in the face of common sense and the will of the Puerto Rican

people,&quot; said Martin G&aacute;rate, International Programs

director of the Quaker organization. 

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President should instead be negotiating in good faith

for the swift return of the military-held land to the people of

Puerto Rico, and effective measures for the environmental clean-up

of its devastated ecosystems,&quot; added G&aacute;rate. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The AFSC has supported the efforts by the people of Vieques to

recover their island since the 1970s. The current situation remains

as critical as described by AFSC spokesperson Betty Nute during

a testimony before the UN Committee on De-Colonization on August

6, 1979. Nute noted that when the U.S. Navy expropriated Vieques

sixty years ago,

</font>

<p>

<blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&#133;residents were forced to live in the central part of

the island between a bombing range and a large ammunition dump&#133;.the

Navy's use of the island has destroyed reefs, polluted waters,

denied local fisherman access to the best fishing grounds. Noise

disrupts schooling and other activities, affecting residents emotionally&#133;We

have, and pledge to continue to call on our own government to

end the occupation of Vieques.</i></font></blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

In the last year a peaceful, non-violent, citizens' movement has

arisen in Puerto Rico and on Vieques to press the United States

to end its hold on the island. The movement cuts across political,

ideological, religious, age and class lines, unifying Puerto Ricans.

Serious research and planning efforts are underway by Puerto Rican

citizens--scientists, lawyers, religious figures, environmentalists,

community leaders and peace activists to assess the environmental

damage and cleanup needs. Proposals for a land trust and environmentally

sound development planning to benefit Vieques residents are underway

as well. 

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For the United States to push its way back into training

exercises on Vieques is a serious mistake,&quot; said G&aacute;rate.

&quot;Even if Navy and FBI officials do expel the peaceful protesters,

it will not halt their struggle to recover the land.

AFSC recently issued a four-part study of US military policy and

presence in Latin America and the Caribbean, <i>Still Pulling

Strings</i>, which includes, &quot;Colonial Legacy and Military

Strategy: The US Military in Puerto Rico.&quot; (the studies are

available from AFSC)<br>
