- May 24 - The East Timor Action Network (ETAN) today called on the U.S.

      government to cancel plans to conduct a joint military exercise with the

      Indonesian military (TNI) this summer. This training is part of a proposed

      program to gradually restore military relations frozen since early

      September, when Indonesian troops rampaged through East Timor.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The administration says it must reward TNI for modest reforms

      imposed on it by popular opposition in Indonesia. But the suspension of

      U.S.-Indonesia military ties has helped the Indonesian government make

      progress in bringing its military under control. Resuming military

      cooperation now will only hurt efforts to get the armed forces out of

      politics,&quot; said John M. Miller, spokesperson for the ETAN.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Any resumption of military engagement sends a signal to the

      Indonesian armed forces that the U.S. government believes they have been

      rehabilitated, legitimizing the human rights abuses and terror tactics

      they continue to practice in Aceh, West Papua and elsewhere in Indonesia.

      Militias with TNI support continue to harass East Timorese refugees in

      West Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia. Prosecutions of human rights abuses

      in East Timor and elsewhere are moving slowly and military investigators

      are playing a prominent role in what are supposed to be civilian

      investigations. Indonesia's human rights law remains stalled in

      parliament,&quot; said Miller.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are working with members of Congress and others to make sure

      that U.S.-Indonesian relations promote human rights and democracy rather

      than return to old habits of coddling a military whose commitment to

      reform is tenuous at best. In the past, whenever Congress or the

      administration has blocked military training or certain weapons transfers

      the Indonesian military has taken notice. Each time the U.S. has moved to

      resume or reinforce military ties, TNI has taken it as approval for

      business as usual, not as a reward for any reforms or good behavior,&quot;

      said Miller.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Clinton administration is focusing first on the navy and air

      force, arguing that their human rights records are better than the army's.

      But air force planes and navy ships were integral to the massive,

      well-planned Indonesian military and militia operation which

      systematically destroyed and looted East Timor and forcibly transported a

      third of the population out of the territory following its

      pro-independence vote,&quot; he added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The administration is planning to stage a CARAT (Cooperation Afloat

      Readiness and Training) military exercise with the TNI next July or

      August. CARAT is a large-scale, high prestige exercise involving navy,

      marines, and air force that stages simulated amphibious invasions of

      Indonesian islands. Previous CARATs, including one held last August just

      before the East Timor vote, have included patrolling, live fire training,

      and raids. Some Indonesian officers went directly from last August's CARAT

      to East Timor and participated in the worst violence there.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Journalist <a href="http://www.etan.org/news/2000a/nairnmay11.htm">Allan

      Nairn, speaking</a> before the House of Representatives Subcommittee on

      Human Rights, May 11, said &quot;One of these officers, Lt. Col. (later

      Col.) Willem, helped coordinate the Indonesian naval forces in CARAT and

      then went to Dili where he served as a senior official in KOREM military

      headquarters, the very base from which the Aitarak militias staged their

      terror raids during late September. I saw this first hand since I was a

      prisoner in KOREM and was interrogated by Col. Willem.&quot; Willem has

      since been promoted to head the personal staff of Admiral Widodo, the

      national TNI commander.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On September 9, President Clinton suspended all U.S. ties with

      Indonesia. Soon after, the Indonesian military began to pull out of East

      Timor and Indonesia gave permission for an international peacekeeping

      force to enter the territory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Late last year Congress put part of this ban into law. The FY 2000

      Foreign Operations Appropriations Act stipulates conditions which must be

      met before normal military ties can be restored. These include refugee

      return to East Timor and accountability for military and militia members

      responsible for human rights atrocities in East Timor and Indonesia. They

      also require Indonesia to actively prevent militia incursions into East

      Timor and to cooperate fully with the UN administration in East Timor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Repatriation and Security Act of 2000 (HR 4357) recently introduced

      in the House of Representatives by Jim McGovern (D-MA), Chris Smith (R-NJ)

      and others, would prohibit relations and assistance to the armed forces of

      Indonesia until the Indonesian government provides for the territorial

      integrity of East Timor, the security and safe return of refugees, and

      prosecution of those individuals responsible for crimes against humanity

      in East Timor and elsewhere. A similar bill is expected in the Senate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1998 CARAT was cancelled after the congressional uproar over JCET

      (Joint Combined Exchange Training), the program under which the U.S.

      taught urban warfare and sniper technique in circumvention of the

      congressional ban on U.S. military training for Indonesia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The East Timor Action Network/U.S. founded following the November 1991

      massacre supports a genuine and peaceful transition to an independent East

      Timor. ETAN has 28 local chapters throughout the U.S.&nbsp;</font>
