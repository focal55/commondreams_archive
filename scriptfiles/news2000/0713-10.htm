- July 13 - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) should extend its

comment period on the proposed importation of irradiated food by 90 days, Public Citizen

told the agency today in a letter.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen requested a similar extension on June 28 to give concerned citizens more

time to comment. The USDA did not respond. The request was resubmitted today to emphasize

again the need to give people more time to comment, and because the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Rules Comment page has

been down since last Friday, July 7, severely limiting the public&#146;s ability to submit

comments. Without an extension, the comment period will end on July 25. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter to the agency, Wenonah Hauter, director of Public

Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program, urged the agency to give

people every opportunity to tell the agency what they think about the proposed importation

of irradiated food. The USDA is proposing to allow the irradiation of fruits and

vegetables as an alternative to current treatments used to kill fruit flies and seed

weevils. Public Citizen has serious concerns about the safety of food irradiation; a

process the government approved based on questionable research. </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In the sense of fairness, all citizens should be given every opportunity

to comment using all possible means,&quot; Hauter wrote. &quot;After all, our democracy

depends on citizen participation. Don&#146;t deny concerned citizens the right to comment

on this issue of grave concern.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization with a membership of 150,000, began

researching the impacts of food irradiation more than fifteen years ago. The organization

recently organized a coalition of more than 175 organizations representing 1 million

Americans who oppose irradiation of food because of concerns about the safety and the

wholesomeness of irradiated food</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Friday May 26<sup>th</sup> the USDA&#146;s Animal and Plant Health Inspection

Service announced a proposal to irradiate imported fruits and vegetables with comments due

on July 25. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen requested 90-day extension on the comment period. Before a decision was

Vegetables</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Mr. Reed:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Public Citizen, a national consumer organization founded by Ralph Nader in 1971, on

June 28, requested a 90-day extension (October 25, 2000) to the comment

period so that we have adequate time to notify the public about this docket. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This letter is to reiterate and reemphasize that request. Unfortunately as of Friday,

July 7, citizens have been denied the opportunity to comment on this rule via the

Internet. The USDA APHIS Rules Comment page has been inoperable or &quot;down,&quot; which

severely limits the ability of citizens to participate in this important process.</font></p>

this proposal. using all possible means. After all, our democracy depends on citizen

participation. Don&#146;t deny concerned citizens the right to comment on this issue of

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We look forward to hearing from you about extending the deadline for comments.</font></p>
