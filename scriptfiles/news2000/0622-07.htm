<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- June 22 - Statement of Diann Rust-Tierney 

Director, ACLU Capital Punishment Project: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Civil Liberties Union deplores the decision of the Texas

Board of Pardons and Paroles to allow the execution of Gary Graham to go forward

despite powerful evidence of his innocence.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Right now, the world is watching how America deals out the death penalty and what they

have seen so far is sickening.  The Graham case is yet another example of a system that is

riddled with fallibility, unfairness and racial discrimination. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Graham was convicted on the basis of one eyewitness and without any forensic evidence

tying him to the 1981 shooting murder of Bobby Lambert in Houston. That the board would

not even grant a 30-day reprieve in order to review evidence that no court has been

allowed to hear is shameful. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We understand that Graham's lawyers will be submitting a last-minute appeal to the United

States Supreme Court and we hope that the Court will have the courage and the wisdom to

administer justice where the Texas system has failed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since his conviction, Graham's case has been submitted to dozens of state and federal

courts which have consistently denied his application for a hearing to evaluate evidence

raising serious questions that could prove his innocence. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is by now painfully clear that racism and unfairness are the only consistent factors in the

administration of the death penalty in America.  Overall, the total number of  death

sentences imposed, about 300 a year, still represents only about one percent of all

homicides known to the police.  Of all those convicted on a charge of criminal homicide,

only three percent – about one in 33 – are eventually sentenced to death. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Out of that three percent -- almost  4,000 persons executed since 1930 -- more than 50

percent have been black.  Yet African Americans make up approximately 12 percent of the

U.S. population.  Other minorities also receive death sentences disproportionate to their

numbers in the population. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Texas, where people of color represent approximately one third of the population,

two-thirds of those sentenced to die are black and Latino. This is not primarily because

minorities commit more murders, but because they are more often sentenced to death when

they do. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Poor people are also far more likely to be sentenced to death than those who can afford the

high costs of private investigators, psychiatrists and expert criminal lawyers.  Some

observers have pointed out that the term "capital punishment" is ironic because "only those

without capital get the punishment."  That is certainly the case in Texas. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gary Graham has said that he hopes his state-sanctioned murder will serve as a springboard

for the nation to reconsider the morality of the death penalty. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We fervently hope that it will not take the execution of yet another innocent person to

awaken Americans to the travesty that is capital punishment in this country. Right now, we

are waiting and watching with our colleagues here and around the world who have worked

so hard to save the life of Gary Graham. </font></p>
