- October 26 - Ralph Nader today denounced the big radio

interests that are lobbying to block efforts to expand low-power FM stations

as community radio outlets.



<p>Nader said the effort led by the National Association Broadcasters would

stifle the voices of local organizations, schools, churches and others who

do not have access to the commercial stations. Nader said the low power

stations could be a tremendous boost to democracy throughout the nation. He

noted that the stations are being supported by the Leadership Conference on

Civil Rights, the National Education Association, the National Association

of Evangelicals, and the National Council of Churches.



<p>Nader said an op-ed by Federal Communications Commission Chairman William

Kennard's in the Washington Post of October 23 was "right on the mark" in

stating that the efforts to block the low-power stations was not about

ideology, but about money.



<p>Nader said that the Speaker of House Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority

Leader should take steps immediately to end the closed door maneuvering in

the  Congressional appropriations process to wipe out the expansion of the

low-power stations.



<p>"This is a real test of the Congressional leadership-whether they will side

with communities and local groups who need the low power radio stations or

whether they will side with the money of the big commercial broadcasters,"

Nader said.
