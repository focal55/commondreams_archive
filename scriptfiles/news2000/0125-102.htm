- January 25 - News Advisory:

<p>The following was released today by Life for Relief and

Development:

<p>House Democratic Whip David Bonior (D-Mich.), Rep. John Conyers

(D-Mich.), Rep. Tom Campbell (R-Calif.) and other members of



Congress will join with American Muslims for Global Peace and



Justice and major Muslim and Arab American organizations to call



for an end to the devastating embargo on Iraq.

<p>WHEN:

<br>Wednesday, Feb. 16, at 10:30 a.m.

<p>WHERE:

<br>House Triangle, U.S. Capitol

<br>(in case of rain, U.S. Capitol HC-9

<p>WHAT:

<br>

Last Aug. 6 marked the NINTH anniversary of U.N. Security

Council resolution 661 that imposed a comprehensive embargo on



Iraq. Additionally, it has been NINE years since the bombing of



Iraq in January 1991, which has resulted in the destruction of the



Iraqi civilian infrastructure including water, electrical and



communication facilities. Water plants throughout the country are



using river water with high sewage contamination. Overall poor



sanitary conditions have already led to a four-fold increase in



diseases such as diarrhea among children under five years of age.

<p>-- Iraq "has experienced a shift from relative affluence to

massive poverty. In marked contrast to the prevailing situation



prior to the events of 1990-91, the infant mortality rates in Iraq



today are among the highest in the world, low infant birth weight



affects at least 23 percent of all births, chronic malnutrition



affects every fourth child under five years of age, only 41 percent



of the population have regular access to clean water, 83 percent of



all schools need substantial repairs. The ICRC states that the



Iraqi health care system is today in a decrepit state. UNDP



calculates that it would take 7 billion U.S. dollars to



rehabilitate the power sector country-wide to its 1990 capacity."

<p>

-- U.N. Report on the Current Humanitarian Situation on Iraq,



submitted to the Security Council March 1999.

<p>-- "The Oil-For-Food plan has not yet resulted in adequate

protection of Iraq's children from malnutrition/disease. Those



children spared from death continue to remain deprived of essential



rights addressed in the Convention on the Rights of the Child."

<p>

-- UNICEF Report, April 30, 1998.
