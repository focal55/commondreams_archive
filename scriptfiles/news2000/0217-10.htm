- February 17 - Responding to the recent use of force by the Colombian National Police

against the peaceful U'wa, rural workers throughout the region began a

general strike on February 15. Scheduled to last three days, the strike is

being observed in the districts of Araucanos de Fortul, Saravena and

Arauquita, as well as Cubar&aacute; where businesses remained closed and public

transportation was suspended.



<p>The Colombian newspaper, El Tiempo reported that the body of one of the

victims of Friday's incident, four-month old Nury B&oacute;cota, daughter of Pastor

and Gloria B&oacute;cota, was found. The names of two other children believed dead

were also reported as 10 year-old Jorge Anicuta and 9 year-old Maricio Diaz.

The two were from the Guahibo indigenous community of Geareros (Tame) who

had joined protests in solidarity with the U'wa. Search for the other bodies

is made difficult due to the terrain and the fast current of the Cuboj&oacute;n

River.  The U'wa also claim a fourth infant may have died in the clash.



<p>Families and friends of the four-month old victim conducted a burial service

yesterday.  The children allegedly drowned after the soldiers and anti-riot

police used tear gas, bulldozers and riot sticks to charge the blockade,

forcing the U'wa to jump into the fast flowing Cubuj&oacute;n River. The National

Police had previously denied reports of deaths as a result of the

confrontation.



<p>The U'wa also released the names of four U'wa who were  injured and 11

additional people reported missing following the incident. The injured are

reported as: Maria Antoineta Ihuanito, Chela Ihuanito, Patricia Ihuanito,

and Luis Caballero. The missing are reported as: Eleanora Herrera, Luz Elena

Herrera, Gustavo Delgado, Wilson Diaz, Antonio Delgado, Nelson Diaz, Edgar

Diaz, Tonio Delgado, Freddy Diaz, Alfredo Diaz, Wilson Herrera.



<p>Meanwhile in Washington this week, Larry Meriage, Occidental Petroleum's

Vice President of Public Affairs admitted that Oxy regularly pays off the

Colombian Guerrillas. Testifying before the Criminal Justice, Drug Policy

and Human Resources Subcommittee of the House of Representatives Meriage

stated that: "[our employees] are regularly shaken down by both the FARC and

the ELN. They are required to pay a "war tax" to both of the guerrilla

groups or they are not able to work."



<p>"Meriage's admission that Oxy pays the guerrillas underscores the absurdity

of looking for oil in the middle of a war zone." said Steve Kretzmann of

Amazon Watch. "It also reinforces what the U'wa have always said about this

project - that it will only bring more violence to their region. The only

responsible course of action for Oxy and the Colombian Government is an

immediate suspension of the Samor&eacute; project pending a negotiated settlement

that all sides are party to."



<p>Video footage taken by the U'wa of the February 11 incident has aired on

Colombian Television stations. Copies of any of  the aforementioned

documents are available upon request.
