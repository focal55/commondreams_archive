-  

May 24 - Puerto Rican war veterans have decided to return to President Clinton the

medals and condecorations they once received for defending the United

States, in protest for Clinton's decision to authorize bombing to resume

in Vieques and in support of the demands that the U.S. Navy permanently

stop bombing Vieques.



<p>Among the condecorations that will be returned are several Purple Heart

medals bestowed upon soldiers who were wounded in battle.  The veterans

who will send their medals back to the President fought in World Wars I

and II, Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, the Persian Gulf, Somalia and Kosovo.



<p>Luis Méndez, spokesperson of the Puerto Rico Chapter of the organization

Veterans for Peace, announced today during a press conference in San Juan,

that a ceremony will be held on Memorial Day where Puerto Rican veterans

will have the opportunity to voluntarily turn in their National Defense

Service medals in support of the struggle of the people of Vieques and in

response to the federal government assault on the civil disobedience camps

at the Navy bombing range in Vieques.  The ceremony will be held on

Monday, May 29, 2000 (Memorial Day) at 10:00AM at the Veteran's Monument

in front of the Capitol Building in San Juan.



<p>Veterans for Peace is a national organization structured around a national

office in Washington, DC and comprised of members across the U.S. and

Puerto Rico organized in chapters or as at-large members.  Veterans for

Peace is an official Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) represented at

the United Nations.



<p>Méndez urged all Puerto Rican veterans to join in this ceremony which

"symbolizes our position that the safety and health of the people of

Vieques are not negotiable, and that the concept of national security is

now being used to mean the defense of the economic interests of the

military and industrial complex of the U.S."



<p>Veteran Rubén Lind added that "at this time there is no enemy that's

threatening the security of the United States.  As veterans, we know

first-hand the pain and destruction of war.  We don't want any more war

games in Vieques.  Viequenses have a right to life and to health."



<p>For more information on the ceremony on Monday May 29, and on future

events of Veterans for Peace with regard to Vieques, please contact Luis

R. Méndez at 787-767-2936 or at 787-798-8086.
