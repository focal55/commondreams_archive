introduce a bill in the state&#146;s General Assembly calling for a moratorium on the sale

and distribution of irradiated food in New Jersey until toxicology studies are conducted

demonstrating its safety, Public Citizen said today.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We support this bill and applaud Assemblyman&#146;s Kelly&#146;s efforts to

protect the citizens of New Jersey,&quot; said Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program.

&quot;No long-term studies have been done to determine the health effects of eating

irradiated food. The body of research on irradiated food has yielded conflicting results.

However, we do know for sure that irradiation changes the molecular structure of food and

destroys vitamins.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program, the <a href="http://www.whistleblower.org/">Government Accountability Project</a> and the <a href="http://www.the-inspector.com/njc/index.shtml">National Joint Council of Food

Inspection Locals</a> are leading a campaign on behalf of more than 170 state and national

organizations to reverse the federal government&#146;s decision to permit food irradiation. Members of the coalition

&#150; which includes the Cattlemen&#146;s Legal Fund, U.S. Public Interest Research

Group, the Center for Food Safety, the Campaign for Biodemocracy, Friends of the Earth,

the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, and the Physicians Committee for

Responsible Medicine &#150; worry that food irradiation isn&#146;t safe.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Public Citizen and the coalition&#146;s efforts to stop food irradiation are

commendable, and I am proud to have their support,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;My office has

studied this issue for more than 14 years, and irradiated food has not been proven safe

for human consumption. Until legitimate long-term research proves its safety, I will lead

the fight against irradiated food in New Jersey.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Donald B. Louria, chairman emeritus of the Department of Preventive Medicine and

Community Health at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, said he is

concerned about the effects of irradiated food on the human body.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;One major concern about food irradiation is the potential for chromosomal

damage,&quot; Louria said. &quot;There are only two relevant human studies, conducted in

India and China, which are inconclusive but worrisome. It would not really be a good idea

to feed billions of people around the planet food that might cause chromosomal damage.

Think of food irradiation as the equivalent of a new drug. Would any drug for treatment of

disease be accepted for general use in the United States based on two controversial and

divergent studies carried out overseas? I think not.&quot;</font>
