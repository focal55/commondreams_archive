- February 2 - Following is a statement

today by Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood Federation



of America:

<p>Today the U.S. Senate passed an amendment (80-17) to the

bankruptcy reform law forcing defendants prosecuted under the



Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE) to pay their legal



judgments. Until now, many convicted under the FACE law have



hidden their assets and declared bankruptcy to escape paying their



debt to society. These terrorists will now be forced to face the



full force of the law; steep monetary penalties combined with



prison time should prove a great deterrent to violent attacks,



including death threats, anthrax threats, assaults, bombings, and



shootings.

<p>FACE has proven highly effective in ending violent and

intimidating anti-abortion activities. Now those who attempt



force, the threat of force, or physical obstruction to injure,



intimidate, or interfere with providers of reproductive health care



services or their patients will be held financially responsible.



They will also held responsible for damaging or destroying the



property of a reproductive health care facility.

<p>All of us who truly care about the health and well being of

Americans must work together to ensure that women can continue to



make responsible choices about their lives and health, and that



doctors can work and live without fear. Planned Parenthood will



continue to work closely with law enforcement agencies and officers



to prevent these crimes against patients, staff, volunteers, and



clinics, and to ensure swift prosecution of violators of FACE.

<p>Planned Parenthood applauds Senators Schumer (D-N.Y.), Reid

(D-Nev.), Snowe (R-Maine) and Jeffords (R-Vt.) for their efforts to



make anti-choice criminals pay for their crimes against women.
