- April 26 - Frustrated with the 

planning process of the Millennium March on Washington that 

has excluded grassroots activists and by the assimilationist theme 

of the march, a number of local and national queer groups and 

community activists are planning an alternative march on Sunday, 

April 30. 



<p>"Freaks Are Family: The Millinery March on Washington Uniting All 

Queers" will take place concurrent to the MMOW, but will allow all 

queers and their allies to participate regardless of religious or 

political beliefs, family status, social class, or personal 

appearance. 



<p>The "Freaks Are Family" march -- a response to the MMOW theme of 

"Faith and Family" -- will congregate near the Washington Monument 

at 14th Street and Constitution Ave., N.W., at 9 a.m. and will march 

to a picnic site on the National Mall. Sponsoring organizations 

include Bisexual Insurgence, DC Radical Faeries, and the 

International Wenches Guild. Participants will include members of 

the Lesbian Avengers and of the transgender, leather, polyamorous, 

pagan, and gothic communities. 



<p>Freaks Are Family March demands that all leaders in the QLGBT 

community commit to the following: 



<p>1. Be accountable to the whole QLGBT community as well as their 

own specific identity groups. 



<p>2. Resist the attempts of corporate sponsors, donors, and other 

special interests to control and coopt the QLGBT agenda. 



<p>3. Be vigilant and active in the defense of the rights of the 

most persecuted members of our community, not merely those who 

can win straight acceptance. 



<p>4. Recommit our community to fight HIV/AIDS in poor communities 

in the U.S. and around the world.
