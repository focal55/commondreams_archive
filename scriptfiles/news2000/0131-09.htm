- January 31 - At 9:19 PM, January 18, a  'target" missile lifted off from Vandenberg Air 

  Force Base in California. Ground based radars and an array of satellites 

  tracked its trajectory. Some 20 minutes later, the national missile defense 

  (NMD) prototype missile took off from Kwajalein Atoll to intercept the target, 

  trying to destroy it in a "hit-to-kill" encounter. But six seconds before the 

  anticipated impact, both heat-seeking infrared detectors critical to the 

  interceptor's final maneuvers failed  - in effect blinding the NMD missile and 

  causing it to miss

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week, Secretary of Defense William Cohen responded with Orwellian 

  doublespeak, telling reporters that the NMD program is "on the right track." 

  The interceptor and target were "within 100 feet" of each other, he said, and 

  the flaw was one of "engineering and not science" and one he expects will be 

  corrected.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But as football 's Tennessee Titans know, close is not enough. The Titans 

  were within 3 feet of their goal  - a tying score in the Superbowl  - but they 

  lost. In football, there are second chances; in a nuclear conflict, there 

  aren 't second chances. As President Clinton 's scheduled decision on deployment 

  of a limited national missile decision approaches, a growing number of 

  newspaper editorials reflect the growing doubt and concern about the 

  effectiveness and overall national security value of the system. Below are 

  excerpts of several recent editorials:</font></P>

  shield"</b></A><BR>



            

             "...an aggressor would have to be suicidal 

  to fire a nuclear- or chemical-tipped missile at the United States, knowing 

  full well the projectile would bear his country's return address in big, bold 

  letters and that Washington would retaliate massively. A missile defense would 

  be of no use against a nuclear device secreted into the hold of a freighter 

  docking at a U.S. port or a suitcase bomb smuggled into the country. Sad to 

  say, these frightful scenarios are more plausible than North Korea or Iran 

  lobbing an ICBM in our direction. Can there be any doubt that U.S. security 

  would be better served by the drastic reduction of Russian nuclear warheads 

  ... than by the raising of a highly dubious missile shield?"</font></P>

  Diplomatic Disaster?"</A></b><BR>

"Headlines screamed failure after a Jan. 18 test in which 

  a U.S. rocket streaked into the sky from Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific, only 

  to miss its target, an incoming dummy warhead. [T]his whiff may not alter the 

  schedule for a Presidential decision come summer on whether to deploy a $13 

  billion missile-defense shield against an attack by rogue states. Alas, the 

  proposed system may not reach even this modest goal. A blue-ribbon defense 

  panel recently noted that critical computer simulations are behind schedule. 

  The panel recommended delaying the decision to deploy, advice the Jan. 18 test 

  would seem to bolster. What's more, the diplomatic costs of pursuing this 

  program are high. The White House probably won't listen, however. After all, 

  Bill Clinton has always been a master of the domestic political game. It's the 

  next President who will have to cope with whatever fallout 

  occurs."</font></P>

  Deferring"</b></A><BR>

"By late summer, Clinton is scheduled to 

  decide whether to proceed. Barring some new development, it strike us as too 

  hurried. Why not just keep testing, one step at a time, until the picture is 

  clearer? Deciding not to decide is, in itself, a decision. It can be a 

  completely legitimate one."</font></P>

  Bullet"</b></A><BR>

"The Pentagon 

  suffered another humiliating failure in the latest test of its troubled 

  national missile defense system .... the test clearly demonstrated one thing 

  It 's premature to order deployment of this $12.5 billion shield. It 's not 

  ready. [D]eployment will be seen in some quarters as a provocation, and the 

  decision will force the U.S. to conduct a diplomatic tap dance. ... [T]he 

  outraged Russians have threatened to stall progress on arms control treaties, 

  fearing the U.S. might expand this defense system .... If the U.S. proceeds to 

  deploy, other nuclear powers, such as China, may well build more weapons in an 

  effort to overwhelm it, spurring a nuclear arms race if India and Pakistan 

  follow suit. That's a risk that might be worth taking when the technology for 

  an anti-missile system is ready. But it's not. It's not ready yet."</font></P>

The Clinton administration should ignore the political 

  pressure and shelve a decision on deploying a missile defense system until we 

  have one that works. For $12.7 billion, the initial cost of deploying the 

  system being tested, the country would be buying little more than a false 

  sense of security. The missile defense is scheduled for one more test this 

  spring, but even a success is hardly likely to be conclusive. Further research 

  on a missile defense is certainly warranted, but plans for deployment are 

  not.</font></P>

  Count"</A></b><BR>

"The failure of an interceptor test wounds the 

  anti-missile defense program, but not fatally. They missed. The failed test, 

  however, does not provide conclusive proof that such a system cannot be made 

  to work. But it is significant setback that should give President Clinton 

  pause about his plan to approve the deployment of the system later this year. 

  Deployment quite simply cannot proceed until the Defense Department 

  demonstrates conclusively that a missile can be made to do better than coming 

  close to intercepting another missile."</font></P>

  Enough"</b></A><BR>

"Even though both 

  Moscow and Beijing implicitly recognize that a U.S. system would not 

  significantly affect the balance of power, both bitterly oppose its 

  development. Some NATO allies too have objected .... The potential missile 

  threat from rogue states can't be ignored. But that threat can be met only 

  with a missile interceptor system that has been shown to work in all of its 

  aspects. Rushing ahead with anything less would provide neither deterrence nor 

  defense."</font></P>

  Wars"</b></A><BR>

"President 

  Clinton faces a self-imposed June deadline to decide whether to deploy a 

  limited Star Wars system designed to knock down missiles from rogue nations 

  like North Korea or Iran .... The idea has obvious appeal.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the unfortunate fact is that we do not have the technology to pull off 

  this trick. Even if tests scheduled for this spring are successful, it's clear 

  that knocking missiles out of the sky is so difficult that a president facing 

  a crisis could not be certain that the system would work.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Against that dubious benefit, weigh the concrete costs of deploying a 

  system. The Pentagon says it would cost $12.5 billion, which means the bill 

  will probably be at least twice that. More important, deployment would break 

  the 1972 ABM treaty with the Russians, and our repeated attempts to convince 

  them we mean no harm have all failed. They will respond, probably by refusing 

  to cooperate with other disarmament initiatives. China has threatened to 

  escalate its missile programs as well if we deploy. The result of our 

  deployment would be more danger, not less."</font></P>

"The Pentagon's second 

  test of a prototype interceptor missed its target over the Pacific Ocean last 

  Tuesday, capping a string of tests that have failed or been of questionable 

  success.<B> </B>It is clear that a deployment decision 

  would be premature. A vigorous research and development program should 

  continue, but the rush to deployment is getting way ahead of the true 

  technical feasibility, and that's both unwise and a waste of taxpayer monies. 

  Internationally, it is feared deployment of such a system by the United States 

  will trigger a new nuclear arms race. That's debatable, but at the very least 

  the risks associated with it should not be run for a system that is not going 

  to work."</font></P>

  Defense"</A></b><BR>



"The 

  failure of a prototype missile interceptor to hit its target in a crucial test 

  this week makes it glaringly clear that the Pentagon has not yet perfected the 

  technology needed for an effective national missile defense, even one of 

  limited scope. President Clinton, who has said under political pressure that 

  he will decide this summer whether to start building such a system, should 

  defer his decision until a fuller testing record can be established.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until reliable missile defenses can be mounted without wrecking arms 

  control, Washington should continue to meet threats from North Korea and Iran 

  the way it met missile threats from Russia during the cold war -- through 

  America's capacity for devastating retaliation and efforts to restrain the 

  spread of nuclear materials and missile technology."</font></P>

"Almost 

  only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. To be effective, an interceptor 

  missile must make a direct hit on an incoming missile. In the vastness of 

  space, that 's a pretty tall order. This latest test follows reports of another 

  test in October that at first was said to be successful. It later turned out 

  that it, too, failed. Should the United States continue its research and tests 

  into such a system? Yes. After all, technology does change. But there is no 

  need to rush into a costly and possibly unworkable system too soon."

"Unfortunately, the administration also has 

  set a late-summer deadline for a decision on whether to build the system, and 

  that is foolish. The system isn't likely to be ready, and in any case, time is 

  needed to address issues raised by our allies and by abrogating a key weapons 

  treaty, which the U.S. has never done. The risk of a bad decision is 

  high."</font></P>

"President Clinton rhas promised to decide by 

  this summer whether to move ahead with deployment of a national missile 

  defense system. The promise was made mainly for political reasons; it was a 

  way of buying time and maneuvering room on the issue a year ago. It has become 

  increasingly clear, however, that by summer Mr. Clinton won't have sufficient 

  information to make a reliable decision. Tests of the elaborate technology 

  have been inconclusive and likely will remain so. The decision should be 

  deferred; the administration should begin to lay the groundwork for deferral 

  now. The issue is too important to be driven by election-year considerations. 

  This is not the right way to measure which party is strongest on national 

  defense, and the president should muster the courage to say so."</font></P>

"The failure Jan. 18 of the Pentagon 's latest

  our nation 's spending priorities. Even the Pentagon 's own expert panel has 

  admitted the program is riddled with waste and is on a headlong  rush to
