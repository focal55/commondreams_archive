- October 25 - Today, Jubilee 2000/USA joins with millions of people across the



globe in rejoicing and congratulates the U.S. Congress for passing



$435 million towards debt relief for some of the world's most



impoverished countries where most people live on less than $1 a



day. In addition, Congress authorized the reevaluation of



International Monetary Fund gold reserves to be used solely for the



purposes of debt relief. To strengthen the bill, Congress also



called on international financial institutions to discontinue user



fees in health and education in heavily indebted poor countries.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are heartened by the show of bipartisan support in the



Congress," said Dan Driscoll-Shaw, national coordinator for Jubilee



2000/USA. "We also congratulate all the members and supporters of



Jubilee 2000/USA, as well as so many others in this country who



have worked so hard to free up these funds for debt relief. We



believe this demonstrates that the people of the United States are



serious about our commitment to walk with our sisters and brothers



of Africa, Latin America and Asia."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jubilee 2000/USA, while celebrating this victory, realizes that



there is much more work to be done to achieve its goals of



canceling the crushing foreign debt of the world's most



impoverished countries. This crushing debt prevents these



countries from financing the basic needs of it population, such as



clean water, nutrition, health care and education. A healthy,



educated population is the basis of economic growth in any country.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Debt burden statistics are alarming. In Tanzania, the



government spends nine times more on foreign debt payments than on



health care. In Mozambique, one in four children dies before age



five due to infectious disease, yet the government spends four



times more on debt servicing than on health care.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">United Nations figures indicate that 19,000 children die each



day of malnutrition and preventable disease in the world's most



impoverished countries due to the burden of unjust foreign debt.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Debt cancellation has the potential to:

<br>

-- Save 21 million children from disease and hunger in Africa

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Preserve the environment. Debt induced poverty leads to



greater exploitation of natural resources, contributing to global



warming and general environmental degradation

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Increase global security. Debt creates social unrest and



war.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Debt cancellation can make an immediate difference in the lives



of those living in the world's poorest countries. In Uganda,



resources freed as a result of debt cancellation combined with



other sources have led primary school enrollment to double in just



three years.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Now that Congress has acted, it is up to the countries to make



sure that the money freed as a result of debt cancellation is spent



in a transparent way for the betterment of their people,"



Driscoll-Shaw said. "Jubilee 2000/USA will do all in its power to



support our colleagues in civil society in the countries that



receive debt relief to see that these funds go to the poorest



sectors of the population. In that way we both overcome this



economic injustice and build up democracy from the grass roots."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Jubilee 2000 campaign is inspired by the scriptural idea of



the Jubilee year: periodically, ever 7x7 or 50 years, debts are



forgiven and slaves are set free. Jubilee is a time to apply



self-righting mechanisms for restoring balance to society.</font>
