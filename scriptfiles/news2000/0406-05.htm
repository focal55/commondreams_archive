<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- April 6 - Statement of Athan Manuel, PIRG Arctic Wilderness Campaign, on the Senate

Vote on the Roth Arctic Refuge Amendment:</font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">



<p>Today's vote against the Roth Arctic amendment is a cynical gesture meant

to please BP Amoco and ExxonMobil.  Opening the Arctic National Wildlife

Refuge for oil drilling will not solve our energy problems or lower the

price of gas.  The Arctic Refuge, the only part of America's Arctic that is

not open for oil and gas drilling, should be preserved, not plundered.</p>



<p>Senators voted 51 to 49 to table an amendment offered by Senator Philip

Roth (R-DE) that would have stripped the Senate Budget resolution of

language that would have assumed revenue from leasing and drilling

activities in the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge.</p>



<p>We are very disappointed in the votes cast by Senators Gordon Smith of

Oregon and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, who sided with Big Oil over

America's Arctic.  Senator Smith originally voted with Roth, then switched

his position ten minutes later and voted against the amendment.  Senator

Moynihan is a past cosponsor of legislation to preserve the Refuge from

drilling.</p>



<p>The U.S. will never drill its way to energy independence.  At current rates

of consumption there is enough oil in the Arctic Refuge to last the U.S.

for about six months.  Any oil thought to be in the Refuge would take more

than 10 years to reach U.S. consumers.</p>



<p>If the Senate really cared about energy independence they would vote to

increase corporate auto fuel economy standards.  The U.S. needs an energy

policy that focuses more on energy efficiency and renewables than on

ruining some of the last unspoiled areas left in the U.S.   We have plenty

of oil rigs -- and plenty of pollution from the burning of fossil fuels --

but there is only one Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
