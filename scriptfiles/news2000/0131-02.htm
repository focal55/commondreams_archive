<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- January 31 - A national coalition of 42 religious and environmental groups today called

on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to conduct a review of the

environmental impacts of merging the Exxon and Mobil oil companies. Final

approval of this merger would create the largest oil company in the world.

The Campaign ExxonMobil coalition filed comments today arguing that given

the environmental records of both companies and current law, the FTC is

obligated to examine the environmental impacts of their merger, including

the impact on global warming. The group also called on the FTC to examine

the effects of the proposed 16,000 job cuts on health and environmental safety.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Federal law and common sense dictate that before we create the world's

biggest oil company we take a look at how the merger will affect the

environment and public health," said Peter Altman, National Coordinator of

Campaign ExxonMobil (CEM). "We must not allow the company that brought us

the Exxon Valdez oil spill to get even bigger without having some idea of

the environmental impacts."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Federal law requires an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) be conducted

when proposing actions that may significantly affect the quality of the

human environment. To date, however, no environmental impact review of any

kind has been completed nor has it been suggested that one is in consideration.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Environmental Impact Statements are required for projects as small as

adding sand to beaches, or building footbridges across swamps. It is

disturbing that no environmental analysis has been proposed for the creation

of the world's largest oil company," said CEM member Sister Pat Daly, of the

Dominican Sisters of Caldwell, New Jersey



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The comments submitted today note that one of the stated purposes of the

merger was to "meet the increased costs of exploration." Campaign ExxonMobil

asserts that any increased oil exploration would have impacts on the

environment and human health including:



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Damage to old growth frontier forests in 22 countries 

Impacts to fragile coral reefs in 38 countries 

Damage to mangrove ecosystems in 46 countries 

Threats to indigenous peoples on every inhabitable continent 

Increased air pollution in US cities and subsequent contribution to global

warming

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The FTC has a legal obligation to do an Environmental Impact Statement when

the possible effects are as great as they are with the Exxon Mobil merger.

We think that few actions by the federal government could have a greater

impact on the environment than approving this merger." said Sanford Lewis,

the attorney who prepared the comments. "Ironically, it was a lawsuit

brought by Mobil and other oil companies in 1977 that established the

obligation of the FTC to prepare an EIS before approving this type of merger.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Supporters of Campaign ExxonMobil are especially concerned with the

potential impact of the merger on global warming. With increased

exploration, production and consumption of fossil fuels, the production of

greenhouse gases will be continue to increase.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The merger of Exxon and Mobil has an enormous potential to worsen the

situation regarding global warming", said Reverend Michael Crosby of

Milwaukee, Wisconsin. "We are very concerned about the merged company's

impact on global climate."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Concern about global warming was reflected in last Thursday's State of the

Union Address, in which President Clinton noted that, "The greatest

environmental challenge of the new century is global warming. The scientists

tell us the 1990s were the hottest decade of the entire millennium. If we

fail to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, deadly heat waves and

droughts will become more frequent, coastal areas will flood, and economies

will be disrupted. That is going to happen, unless we act."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Campaign also called on the FTC to examine the environmental and health

safety implication of job cuts resulting from the creation of ExxonMobil.

The company recently announced that it intends to cut 16,000 jobs as a

result of the merger. "How many of these positions would be maintenance or

safety related positions," asked Bill Somplatsky-Jarmon of the Presbyterian

Church, USA. "We know that shortages of staff in maintenance-related

positions often leads to safety and environmental problems."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The FTC originally opposed the merger of Exxon and Mobil. After negotiations

with the companies, a proposed settlement was agreed upon, requiring the

divestiture (sale or assignment) of approximately 2,431 Exxon and Mobil gas

stations. In addition, an Exxon refinery in California; terminals; interests

in a pipeline; Exxon's jet turbine oil business and other assets were to be

sold before the merger would be approved.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the merger goes through, the new corporation will have annual revenues of

over $165 billion and will rank as the number one corporate emitter of

greenhouse gases, producing more than 170 million tons of carbon a year. 



</font></p>

organization's web site: <a href="http://www.campaignexxonmobil.org/">www.campaignexxonmobil.org</a>.
