<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN FRANCISCO 

- May 3 - </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prepared by:<br>

David Brower and David Phillips, Earth Island<br>

Joshua Floum, Partner, Legal Strategies Group<br>

William Snape, Senior Counsel, Defenders of Wildlife</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On April 11, 2000, a coalition of environmental groups, including

Earth Island Institute, Defenders of Wildlife, Humane Society of the U.S.,

and ASPCA, won a major victory for dolphins in the San Francisco federal

court of Judge Thelton Henderson.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        Judge Henderson ruled in "Brower v. Daley" that the Clinton/Gore

Administration violated the law when they weakened the standards for

allowing tuna to be labeled "dolphin safe."</font>

<p>



        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"(The Court) concludes" Judge Henderson wrote, "...the (Commerce)

Secretary acted contrary to the law and abused his discretion when he

triggered a change in the dolphin safe label standard on the ground that he

lacked sufficient evidence of significant adverse impacts."  Judge

Henderson restored strong "dolphin safe" standards favored by environmental

groups and chastised the government for ignoring the best available

scientific evidence.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        A copy of the full decision by Judge Henderson can be found at

<a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/</a>.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        The Clinton/Gore Administration, a vitriolic Mexican government,

and Greenpeace Mexico have issued official statements which misstate the

legal ruling and vilify Judge Henderson, the pro-dolphin coalition, and the

U.S. legal system.  These false claims must be challenged.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        In a press release dated April 12, 2000 ("Commerce Secretary

Disappointed at Federal Court Ruling"), the Clinton/Gore Administration

claims that "The completed portions of the research study did not

demonstrate that depleted dolphin stocks are significantly adversely

affected by the encirclement fishing practice."</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        This statement is false.  The extensive research conducted by

biologists for the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) concluded that

depleted dolphin populations are not recovering as expected, and in fact

some populations may be continuing to decline.  Furthermore, the NMFS

scientists concluded that "the information suggests but by no means

conclusively that the fishery has been the source of significant adverse

impact on these two (depleted dolphin) populations." (NMFS Report to

Congress, March 1999).</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        As Judge Henderson states in his powerful written decision:

"...the scientific information that was available from the mandated studies

-- that is, from population abundance surveys and the stress literature

review -- and other relevant sources, all pointed in the direction of a

significant adverse impact."</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        It is clear that the Clinton/Gore Administration blatantly ignored

their own scientists in order to weaken the standards for the "dolphin

safe" tuna label.  The Mexican tuna millionaires and free trade bureaucrats

won out at the expense of dolphins and American consumers.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        The Mexican government's statement also mischaracterized the ruling

("Mexico Says San Francisco Court Ruling on Tuna Ban Misinformed, Unfair,"

April 13, 2000), claiming:  "Judge Henderson's ruling is not only unfair

but totally misinformed, since he omitted considering all of the scientific

evidence that the U.S. Government presented..."  Again, this statement is

completely false -- Judge Henderson had before him every piece of relevant

U.S. Government scientific evidence and cited them extensively in his

32-page written decision.  All the studies, furthermore, reach conclusions

totally opposite those sought by the Mexican tuna industry and the

Clinton/Gore Administration.  In fact, no credible scientific information

was obtained suggesting any cause, other than the chasing and netting of

dolphins in the tuna fishery, for the failure of depleted dolphin

populations to recover.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        Greenpeace Mexico inexplicably claimed (Associated Press April 12,

2000) that authorities "...should not pass off protectionist measures in

the name of conservation."  Since the ruling applies equally to U.S. and

Mexican tunaboats, it cannot constitute a trade "protectionist measure" by

any stretch of the imagination.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        Furthermore, Greenpeace Mexico claimed that dolphin-safe fishing

practices kill "thousands of marine species," ignoring the facts of the

case:</font>

<p>



<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The large foreign tuna fleets that set nets on dolphins also

routinely set their nets on floating objects, with high bycatch of

nontarget species, when the opportunity is present, and they have done so

for decades.  Only with the success of the "dolphin safe" campaign have

tuna fishing nations raised the "red herring" of nontarget fish losses in

"dolphin safe" fishing practices.

</font>

<p>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tellingly, there have been no efforts, either by the Clinton/Gore

Administration or by the Mexican government, to restrict net sets on logs

or other floating objects, where the highest bycatch occurs, by the massive

fleets of Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia.  These nations' vessels continue

to set nets without restraint on dolphins, on schools of tuna, and on

floating objects with high bycatch.

</font>

<p>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "dolphin safe" campaign, which includes a prohibition on the

use of high seas drift nets, has made a major worldwide contribution to the

reduction of bycatch and ridding the oceans of senselessly destructive

fishing practices.  Organizations supporting the strong and verifiable

"dolphin safe" label have been in the forefront of efforts to protect the

entire ocean ecosystems of the world, including whales and dolphins.

</font>

<p>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Clinton/Gore Administration, the Mexican Government, and

Greenpeace Mexico are not telling the truth about dolphins and the tuna

fishery, nor are they telling the truth about Judge Henderson's landmark

decision to ensure the integrity of the "dolphin safe" tuna label.

</font>

<p>

</ul>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American public deserves better.
