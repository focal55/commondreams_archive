- October 27 - Vieques, Puerto Rico, is a small, inhabited island which has been used as a

bombing range by the United States Navy for over fifty years, in violation

of fundamental precepts of safe practices, respect for human rights, and

simple common sense. I first spoke out against this tragedy more than 20

years ago.



<p>In fifty years of bombing, Vieques has suffered vast ecological damage,

decimating the agriculture and fishing-based economy of the island. Coral

reefs have deteriorated, and the land has been contaminated with toxins,

including lead. Air, water and soil pollution are believed to be linked with

high levels of cancer in the population.



<p>The people of Vieques have been fighting the Naval devastation of their

island for decades. That fight has been hampered by the lack of

representation in Washington for citizens who live in Puerto Rico.



<p>We should:

<ul>

<li>Permanently ban the use of live bombs and live ammunition on Vieques

island.</li>

<li>Ensure that the United States Navy will end all operations on the island

within one year.</li>

<li>Survey the environmental damage on the whole island and surrounding

waters, and develop a    comprehensive cleanup plan.</li>

<li>Provide funds for ecologically sustainable economic development to set

Vieques on the road to economic recovery.</li>

<li>Find a way to provide citizens who live in Puerto Rico with Congressional

representation and meaningful votes in presidential elections.

 

</li>

</ul>
