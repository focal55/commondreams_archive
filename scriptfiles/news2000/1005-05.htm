- October 5 - The following was released



today by Handgun Control Inc.:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. John McCain's appearance in two TV ads supporting the



ballot initiatives in Colorado and Oregon issues a special



challenge to Gov. George W. Bush.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The two initiatives are based on the language of the Lautenberg



amendment, passed by the Senate on Vice-President Gore's



tie-breaking vote in May of 1999, shortly after the Columbine



tragedy. However, the Colorado and Oregon bills are actually



stricter in their definition of a gun show; any venue in which 25



or more firearms are sold would be included under these measures.



On May 18, 1999, The Boston Globe reported that Gov. Bush said that



his vice-president would not have voted for the Lautenberg measure,



implying that he would not have supported the same bill that Sen.



McCain is now supporting.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gov. Bush's campaign reiterates its support for an



"instant-check" at gun shows. This is dishonest. The Lautenberg



Amendment used the existing federal law on "instant-check" as



defined in 18 USC 922(t) and applied it to sales by unlicensed



sellers at gun shows. Licensed dealers, both in their stores and at



gun shows, currently abide by the current law, including the



provision allowing for three business days for problems. Under the



current "instant-check" used by licensed dealers, 95 percent of



purchasers get their firearms within two hours. According to the



FBI it is the last five percent who are most likely to be



prohibited purchasers - felons, the mentally ill, and those with a



domestic violence restraining order. The three-day period, which



is not a waiting period but simply the amount of time the FBI has



to check suspect purchasers, is now the standard for all sales by



federally licensed firearm dealers, whether at gun stores or gun



shows. The Colorado and Oregon initiatives would apply this



standard to all sales at gun shows, including those by so-called



'private collectors.'

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the time of the Senate debate on this issue, the Republican



Senate leadership (and Sen. McCain) supported an alternate measure,



sponsored by NRA Board Member and U.S. Sen., Larry Craig, which



would have provided only "voluntary" background checks at guns



shows. Gov. Bush also supported the NRA-backed Dingell amendment in



June of 1999 that would have provided an inadequate time frame of



only 24 hours to conduct background checks on problematic



purchasers. Had this been the law for licensed firearm dealers, the



ATF estimates that approximately 17,000 prohibited purchasers would



have had their firearms sales approved in a year, due to the lack



of time to perform an adequate background check. It is this phony



"closing of the gun-show loophole" that the Bush campaign supports



-- unless they offer evidence to the contrary.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's Denver Post explains Sen. McCain's reasons for publicly



supporting the two initiatives. "Since (the Senate vote) he said



in the interview, he's been swayed by a Treasury Department report



showing that nearly all background checks take just minutes, and



that the delays often turn up old convictions. Now, he says, 'the



72-hour situation isn't nearly as important to me as preventing



sellers from selling to criminals.'"

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Senator McCain has shown courage and just plain common sense in



offering his voice in support of these measures," said Michael



Barnes, president of Handgun Control, Inc. "This year, we have



seen Republican leaders like Governors Pataki and Owens support



sensible gun laws. We have seen pro-gun candidates like George



Allen in Virginia and Bill McCollum in Florida flip-flop and



attempt to hide their pro-gun votes. Senator McCain's public



support demonstrates that the Republican party does not have to be



owned and operated by the NRA."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We challenge Governor George Bush to come to the same



conclusion."

Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974 by



Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. "Pete" Shields, two victims of gun



violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law



enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups across



the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and local gun



control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI has more than



500,000 members and supporters nationwide, making it the nation's



largest citizens' gun control lobbying organization. More



information about HCI and its sister organization, the Center to



Prevent Handgun Violence, can be found on our website at
