- February 24 - In support of Senator Robert Torricelli's (D-NJ) Senate Resolution condemning the discriminatory practices prevalent at Bob Jones University and challenging Congress to stand against divisive practices of the South Carolina school, <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/tia/press/wcg-bio.html" name="Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy">the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy</a>, issued the following statement:</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"On behalf of concerned people of faith, I urge members of the United States Senate to denounce any association of bigotry, discrimination, and intolerance with religious faith.  When a university, or any institution, in our society ties prejudice to spirituality, people of conscience must protest.  For Bob Jones University to foment bigotry in the name of Christianity is the height of hypocrisy if not heresy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Interfaith Alliance has persistently called for the practice of civility during the 2000 electoral campaign.  Many politicians-both Republicans and Democrats-have endorsed our Framework of Civility for Political Candidates (www.civility.net).  A pledge to civil campaigning, however, must not be used as an excuse for refusing to address issues that affect the moral health of our society.  Civility is not to be equated with politeness, passivity, or silence in the face of haunting questions regarding prejudice, morality, and religious discrimination. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Members of the United States Senate have an opportunity to say unequivocally to every person in our nation that they have zero tolerance for institutions, campaigns, and ideologies that foster disrespect and divisiveness in our pluralistic society."</font></p>
