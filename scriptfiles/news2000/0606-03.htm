- June 6 - As the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prepares

to announce measures to protect the public from unsafe exposures to

the pesticide chlorpyrifos, Consumers Union today released an update

to its <a href="http://www.consumersunion.org/food/do_you_know1.htm">1999 report</a> Do You Know What

You're Eating?  That study found that pesticide residues in foods

children eat every day often exceed safe levels.  The follow up study

reaffirms that pesticide residues on kids' foods continue to be too

high. <br>

</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each year, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s

Pesticide Data Program (PDP) tests thousands of fruit and vegetable

samples - domestic and imported, fresh and processed - for pesticide

residues.  CU has done its own analysis of those data.  The new

report, Update: Pesticides in Children's Foods, An Analysis of 1998

PDP Data on Pesticide Residues, adds the most recent year's PDP data

to CU's earlier study. <br>

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Highlights of CU's analysis include:<br>

</font></p>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#183; Different foods have different pesticide residue

   profiles.  Some contain high levels of relatively toxic residues -

   including winter squash, peaches, apples, pears, grapes, green

   beans, and spinach, and new in 1998, strawberries and cantaloupe -

   while others have few residues - like bananas, broccoli, canned

   peaches, canned/frozen peas, canned/frozen corn, milk, orange

   juice, apple juice, and new in 1998, grape juice.<br>

   

   

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#183; Parents can give their kids a healthy diet AND reduce

   pesticide exposures by making smart choices.  They can choose

   foods with low residue levels, and should peel and wash

   high-residue foods.  They should also consider organically grown

   varieties of high-residue foods.<br>

   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#183; U.S.-grown produce generally is more likely to have

   higher residues than imported fruits and vegetables.  There are a

   few significant exceptions - such as tomatoes grown in Mexico -

   but the data do not support the stereotype that imports have worse

   pesticide problems than domestic produce.<br>

   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#183; Organochlorine pesticides banned in the 1970s still show

   up in foods that kids eat today.  For instance, dieldrin remains

   in soil, and crops such as squash, cantaloupe, soybeans, sweet

   potatoes and spinach contain significant residues.  Although its

   use is banned, FDA "action levels" permit dieldrin residues in

   foods that are higher than the EPA says is "safe." <br>

   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#183; Chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate insecticide, was

   detected in 22 foods the PDP tested from 1994 through 1998.  The

   highest chlorpyrifos residues show up in apples from New Zealand,

   grapes from Chile, tomatoes from Mexico, and domestically grown

   soybeans. <br>

   </font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is important that parents feed their children a healthy diet

containing a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables," said Dr. Edward

Groth, a senior scientist at CU and one of the co-authors of the

report.  "Parents can feed their kids healthy foods and minimize

their family's pesticide intake, if they choose wisely."<br>

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), EPA is required to

review all pesticide exposure limits to make them safer for young

children.  CU has called on EPA to focus its attention on high-risk

pesticide uses.  CU's analysis of five years' worth of  PDP data

shows that about 20 pesticides, each used on a handful of foods kids

eat a lot of, collectively account for over 95 percent of the dietary

risk.  <br>

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"EPA could vastly reduce kids' dietary exposure by focusing its

efforts on the 100 worst pesticide-food combinations," said Groth. 

"Eliminating just 100 uses - out of over 9,000 registered uses -

would mitigate the risk enormously." <br>

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA is scheduled to announce measures to deal with the risk from

chlorpyrifos later this week.  CU has called on EPA to ban all

non-agricultural uses, as well as severely limit its use in

agriculture.  EPA appears poised to focus its decision primarily on

home and garden uses.<br>

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In addition to those risks," Groth said, "chlorpyrifos is a major

dietary risk factor on a few foods, and contributes to the overall

risk on a large number of others.  If EPA is serious about protecting

children, it needs to eliminate these unsafe exposures.  We'll be

watching closely to see what EPA does on chlorpyrifos.  But just

taking action on this one pesticide isn't enough - EPA must address

the other major risk drivers as well." <br>

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), should also

reexamine "action levels" for the organochlorines.  Groth said,

"Current legal limits set long ago permit significant dietary

exposure and risk.  Lower action levels would spur growers to plant

those crops that tend to take up organochlorines on uncontaminated

land." <br>
