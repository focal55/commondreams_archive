- VIEQUES, PUERTO RICO  

- May 5 - Carlos Zenon, President of the Vieques Fishermen's Association and leader of 

Camp Mount David in the live impact area in Vieques, announced that there are 

still men and women in the live impact area acting as human shields against 

any attempt to renew bombing in Vieques.

<p>

Zenon explained that "The strategy in Camp Mount David has always been that 

we were not going to resist arrests with violence, but we were not going to 

make it easy for the U.S. Navy and the federal marshalls.  We kept our 

promise.  When the raid against the demonstrators began, members of Camp 

Mount David and Camp Mapepe (another of the civil disobedience camps) went 

deep inside the live impact area and are in two secret camps whose location 

and existence was never revealed."



<p>Zenon added that there is water and provisions in both secret camps and that 

"the presence of these courageuos men and women in the live impact area 

serves as an incentive to the people and to provide continuity to our 

struggle and to stopping the bombings."  The Viequense fisherman added: "In 

fact, as long as there remains even one person hiding in the live impact 

area, the federal marshals themselves during their search would also be 

acting as human shields against the bombings."



<p>Zenon was able to identify at least seven (7) people who are still in the 

live impact area.  From Camp David there are: (1) his son Pedro Zenon, (2) 

his son Cacimar Zenon, and (3) Magaly Santos, and from Camp Mapepe (4) Miguel 

Gonzalez, (5) Miguel Velazquez, (6) Carlos Garcia, and (7) another Viequense 

youth.  Zenon explained that there might be more people hiding in the live 

impact area, and said that "although one can expect almost anything from the 

U.S. Navy, the fact is that as long as these demonstratos remain in the live 

impact area, the Navy cannot resume bombing."



<p>Finally, Zenon stated: "As a father, and my wife as a mother, we are 

concerned about what may happen to our sons in circumstances in which they 

are alone and in subhuman and dangerous conditions.  Yet there are so many 

Viequense families who have suffered the atrocities committed by the U.S. 

Navy here in Vieques for so long, that we are willing to pay that price in 

order to contribute to putting an end to the suffering of our people."
