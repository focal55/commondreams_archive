- October 25 - Environmental groups



today urged the Republican leadership not to hold passage of the



Everglades restoration plan hostage to an agreement to pass a



costly and environmentally destructive water projects bill. The



groups include American Rivers, Coast Alliance, Defenders of



Wildlife, Environmental Defense, Friends of the Earth, Sierra Club



and the National Wildlife Federation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senate leaders have told Senator Bob Smith (R-NH) they will not



permit approval of the Everglades restoration bill unless he also



agrees to support a water projects bill filled with new subsidies



and questionable projects Smith opposes.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last Friday, the House of Representatives passed a $6 billion



Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) that contains scores of new



dredging, flood control and "infrastructure" projects that have not



been subject to environmental and economic review. Despite recent



reports of abuses by Army Corps planners, WRDA failed to include



significant reforms and instead included new subsidies for deep



port dredging and risky beachfront development.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senators Smith and Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman and the



highest-ranking minority member of the Senate Environment



Committee, have rejected questionable projects and provisions



during negotiations with House members.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House and Senate WRDA includes the bipartisan Everglades



Restoration Act.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congressman Bill Young, Chairman of the House Appropriations



Committee, has previously stated that he will move the Everglades



bill separately if there is no agreement on a broader water



projects bill.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This new pressure is an effort to force Senator Smith, who has



championed the Everglades bill, to agree to a water projects bill



that violates established procedures for approving new projects,



conservation groups say.</font>
