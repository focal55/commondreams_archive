- June 20 - If the two executions set to take place in Florida and Texas in the next few hours go

     ahead, this will show once again how little regard US authorities have for international

     standards of justice, Amnesty International said today.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Using the death penalty against the mentally ill and those convicted of crimes

     committed when they were children clearly flouts international safeguards, " Amnesty

     International said. 

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Governors of Florida and Texas, brothers Jeb and George W. Bush, must

     comply with the fundamental principle prohibiting the use of the death penalty where

     the level of culpability of the defendant, through youth or mental impairment, is in

     question." 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Thomas Harrison Provenzano is scheduled to die in Florida this evening. The judge

     who held extensive hearings into his mental state is in no doubt that this severely

     mentally ill man believes he is going to be killed because he is Jesus Christ. The judge

     made no secret that he was "troubled" in ruling that under the "minimal" domestic

     standards that govern such cases, Thomas Provenzano can be executed.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Gary Graham, also known as Shaka Sankofa, is in line to be killed in Texas on

     Thursday for a crime committed when he was 17. The USA leads the world in

     violating the international ban on the use of the death penalty against children. Amnesty

     International knows of 16 executions of child offenders worldwide since January 1993

     -- 11 of these have been carried out in the USA.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     In further violation of international minimum safeguards, Gary Graham was denied his

     right to adequate legal representation at his trial. Convicted on the basis of a single,

     disputed, eyewitness testimony, his execution would also contravene the international

     principle that the death penalty may only be imposed "when the guilt of the person is

     based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative

     explanation of the facts". 

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The USA claims to be a bastion of human rights," Amnesty International said. "Yet in

     the next few hours another layer of hypocrisy could be added to that claim."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Florida legislator Howard Futch commented last year that if Thomas Provenzano

     believes he is Jesus Christ then the state should "just crucify him". 

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Representative Futch's statement showed once again that the death penalty is more

     about state sanctioned vengeance than about a genuine attempt to confront violent

     crime," Amnesty International said.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Background</b><br>

     One hundred and eight countries in the world have abandoned the death penalty in

     law or practice. Although recent months have seen increasing domestic concern over

     the fairness and reliability of US death sentencing, executions continue apace.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Forty-eight prisoners have been executed so far this year in the USA. Three are

     scheduled for the next three days; Thomas Provenzano in Florida today, Russel

     Burket in Virginia tomorrow, and Gary Graham in Texas on Thursday.</font>
