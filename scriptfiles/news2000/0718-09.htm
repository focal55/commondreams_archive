- July 18 - The Grocery Manufacturers

of America, the dietary supplement lobby and other industry forces have been pressing

Congress to enact a bill that would nullify dozens of state and local safety and labeling

requirements relating to the regulation of food and dietary supplements nationwide. The

legislation -- the &quot;National Food Uniformity Act of 2000&quot; (S. 1155) -- was

approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee on June 29. Key Senate staff have said that a

version of this bill may be attached as a rider to the Senate Agriculture Appropriations

bill, which will likely be taken up by the Senate today or tomorrow.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If enacted, S. 1155 would threaten any state and municipal

protections that are more stringent than federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

standards, such as requirements related to dietary supplements, warning labels,

irradiation, adulteration of food and food additives. The only way for a state to avoid

automatic nullification of these protections<b> </b>would be to petition the FDA for a

waiver, which would be granted only if the state proved to the FDA that the provision both

protected an important public interest and did not &quot;unduly burden&quot; interstate

commerce. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under S. 1155, a Louisiana regulation requiring warning labels on

shellfish, which frequently contain pathogens that can cause illness and even death, would

be invalidated unless the state were able to elicit special permission for the rule from

the FDA. California&#146;s popular Proposition 65, a voter

initiative that requires carcinogens and agents that may cause birth defects to be

disclosed on product labels, could also be nullified. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;For years, consumers have relied on state and local labeling

requirements and safety standards to fill regulatory gaps left by the FDA,&quot; said

Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook. &quot;Now, the special interests are pressuring

Congress to exempt them from these important consumer safeguards. Their goal is to avoid

any state and local consumer protections that are stronger or more protective of consumers

than what the FDA requires -- even in areas, such as dietary supplements, where the FDA

has very limited authority to regulate and very few resources to enforce existing

protections.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, as a July 11, 2000, General Accounting Office (GAO) report

recently found, the FDA has neither the resources nor the authority to ensure the safety

of dietary supplements. For example, even though the National Institutes of Health has

concluded that St. John&#146;s Wort may decrease the efficacy of a drug used to treat HIV

infection, this important information is still missing from the labels of some supplements

containing the substance. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some states, such as Texas, have attempted to fill the gap,

requiring warning labels on supplements such as ephedrine, a substance that has been

associated with hundreds of illnesses and several deaths. S. 1155 would invalidate this

Texas provision unless the state was able to elicit a special waiver from the FDA. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill also would have grave consequences for growing consumer

opposition to irradiated and genetically engineered foods. If S.

1155 were law, states could no longer prohibit the sale of irradiated fruits and

vegetables within their borders. States could not even require that irradiated ingredients

in foods be disclosed on product labels, because the federal standard is that irradiation

need only be disclosed when the entire product has been irradiated. Similarly, states

could not require that genetically engineered food be labeled, as there is currently no

relevant labeling requirement for genetically engineered food at the FDA.</font>
