- May 8 - Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Black Congressional Caucus, including Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), Barbara Lee (D-CA), and Maxine Waters (D-CA), joined the Black farmers and small family farmers from around the country in front of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) on May 8, to protest decades of on-going discrimination by the agency and to demand support for America's small family farmers. This rally has been organized by Food First/Institute for Food &amp; Development Policy and Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In January 1999, lawyers representing Black farmers in a class-action suit against the USDA (Timothy Pigford, et al. v. Glickman) signed a consent agreement compensating each farmer with $50,000 for discrimination suffered in the distribution of loans and disaster relief by the USDA between the years 1981 and 1996. Now the USDA is stalling in paying the compensation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Gary Grant, President of the BFAA, "the Consent Decree is no panacea for what has happened to us, but the terrorism with which the Decree is being implemented, with over 40% of farmers already rejected, it will lead to sure death of black family farmers in this nation."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1920, 925,000 farmers were African Americans. In 1999, less than 18,000 African American farmers remained. In 1990 a House of Representatives committee found that Black owned farms were going out of business at a rate five times that of white farmers, and that Black farmers, who represented less than 1% of U.S. farmers, were on the verge of extinction. Black farmers point to USDA discrimination as a major contributing factor in their declining numbers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Anuradha Mittal, Co-Director of Food First, "Black farmers have been the proverbial "canary in the mineshaft" of American agriculture. Everything that happened to them, happened to all family farmers later." She added that, "last year American taxpayers paid a record $22 billion in farm support payments, which went overwhelmingly to the largest and wealthiest 25% of American farms. That's a lot to pay for a system that drives family farmers off the land, destroys rural America, and erodes our soil, while subsidizing Cargill and ADM."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the rally organizers, America needs a healthy Rural America that strengthens family farmers of all races and protects American farmland for future generations. The rally has called for:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fulfillment of the consent decree;

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Return of foreclosed lands to the Black farmers;

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Access to credit without discrimination in the future for all family farmers;

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Support for outreach, technical assistance and funding of education;

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democratization of the USDA/Farm Services Agency;

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Full implementation of the Civil Rights Action team (CRAT) and National Small Farm Commission Recommendations;

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Farm Bill to strengthen America's family farmers.

</font>

</ul>
