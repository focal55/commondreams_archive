- October 3 - Ralph Nader today called his exclusion from the

presidential debates an “affront to democracy,” and cited a long list of

Americans from all points in the political spectrum who have said that

he should be given the chance to debate the major party candidates.

This list includes: Senators Russ Feingold, Paul Wellstone and Barbara

Boxer, former Senator Howard Baker, Representative Jesse Jackson Jr.,

Governors Jesse Ventura and Gary Johnson, former Governor Mario Cuomo,

former third-party presidential candidates John Anderson and Barry

Commoner, and media figures Brian Lamm, John McLaughlin, Don Imus, Phil

Donahue, and William F. Buckley.



<p>Polls have consistently shown support for having Nader and Pat Buchanan

in the debates. A September 13 Zogby poll showed that 58.7 percent want

Nader to participate in the presidential debates, while only 34.2

percent agree with the decision of the Commission on Presidential

Debates and major party campaigns to exclude him. A FoxNews/Opinion

Dynamics Poll from July showed that 64 percent of the American people

want to see Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan in the debates, a number that

was duplicated in many informal polls, including an NBC News Today Show

Poll.  Numerous polls have also shown that the public disagrees with the

15 percent threshold set by the CPD for including candidates in the

debates.



<p>Additionally, many newspapers have editorialized in favor of including

Ralph Nader in at least one presidential debate.  These include the

Washington Post, the Seattle Times, the Houston Chronicle, the L.A.

Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, The (St. Paul) Pioneer Press, The

Christian Science Monitor, and the Worcester Telegram & Gazette.

<p>NARROW SCOPE OF PARTY-CONTROLLED DEBATES THWARTS DEMOCRACY



Bush, Gore allowed to ignore important issues due to Nader lock out



<p>BOSTON, MASS. – The first presidential debates at the University of

Massachusetts at Boston will bring to light a democracy that has been

weakened by the great concentration of corporate power over our society,



<p>Ralph Nader said today.



<p>“On a campus closed even to its own students, before an audience and

moderator handpicked by the Democrats and Republicans, Al Gore and

George W. Bush will discuss a narrow set of issues and avoid proposing

serious ways to shift power from big business to workers, consumers,

taxpayers and voters. Both men do not want to step on the toes of their

major corporate paymasters,” Nader said.



<p>Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate, has been barred from

participation in the debates despite polls showing that he has the

support of millions of voters and that the majority of Americans want to



see him in the debates.  Nader was excluded by the Commission on

Presidential Debates, a private company created and controlled by the

two major parties and funded by many of the same corporations –

including beer, auto and tobacco firms – that contribute to both the

parties.



<p>“Commanding the money, the media and the access to both the ballots and

debates, the Republican and Democratic parties have designed and

enforced a closed system that largely shuts out significant new parties

and old and new ways to strengthen our democracy,” Nader said. “It is

the citizenry who will lose out Tuesday night as Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore

are allowed to sidestep subject matters that are important to millions

of Americans and the solutions that would improve their lives.”



<p>Important issues that will be avoided by Bush and Gore at Tuesday’s

debate include:



<p>Universal, Accessible Health Insurance for All Americans Now



<p>More than 45 million Americans lack basic health insurance, and one

third of seniors have no prescription drug coverage. Nader promises to

ensure single-payer, universal, accessible health care for all Americans



now. He also proposes to negotiate patient-affordable prices of all

prescription drugs developed with taxpayer money.  However, in the

interim there should be a liberal benefit for all elderly accompanied by



government-negotiated prices so that they are affordable to the

government that pays for these medicines just the way the Veterans

Administration and the Department of Defense do now.  Generic drug

company competition should also be encouraged. Both Gore and Bush oppose



controlling any prices of prescription drugs developed with taxpayer

money. Gore supports only gradual steps on health care and Bush opposes

universal health care.



<p>Ending Corporate Welfare



<p>Massive federal and state corporate welfare giveaways, through

subsidies, handouts and bailouts for almost every major industry in our

country, result in the loss of hundreds of billions annually.* Those

billions could be used back in communities and neighborhoods to repair

and expand schools, clinics, libraries, public transit systems, drinking



water plants and many other public works in gross disrepair. These

monies can also be used to abolish child poverty and fund universal

health insurance. Nader proposes to end these corporate welfare

giveaways, while Bush and Gore both support corporate giveaways and

never raise the issue between them.



<p>Empowering Working People



<p>One third of U.S. workers make less than $10 per hour, hardly enough for



even two workers to support a family in today’s “new economy;” and less

than 10 percent of American workers in the private sector are unionized.

<p>

Nader advocates a repeal of the anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act, which is

keeping tens of millions of low-wage workers from forming trade unions.

He would renegotiate international trade agreements to fully protect

labor rights and American jobs, and institute environmental and

consumer-rights standards. Nader also advocates a living wage of $10 per



hour, which will allow all working people to stay above poverty. Bush

and Gore do not support a living wage or the repeal of the Taft-Hartley

Act and are both strong supporters of NAFTA and the World Trade

Organization opposed by labor.



<p>Ending Cash Register Politics



<p>Year after year, big business invests in politicians and political

parties by giving them millions of dollars, and in return, those

businesses get corporate welfare, weak law enforcement and tax breaks

worth billions of dollars. The biggest single obstacle to honest, just

government action – government of, by and for the people – is the

corruption of special-interest money in our election campaigns. Nader

accepts no corporate or any other kind of soft money or PAC

contributions, and would end cash register politics with full public

financing of public campaigns, believing public elections should be

financed just like public libraries and parks. Bush and Gore, who both

benefit from hundreds of millions in corporate soft money and PAC

contributions, oppose public financing of elections.



<p>Other important decisions that will be avoided by Bush and Gore on

Tuesday include: media concentration; racism; renewable energy; criminal



justice systems; environmental protections such as solar power and

fuel-efficiency standards; consumer justice; weak enforcement against

corporate crime, fraud and abuse; and the disastrous war on drugs, Nader



said.



<p>“Democracy is in a serious crisis when more than 94 million voters –

more than half of all eligible voters – stay at home and turn their

backs on the precious right to select the people who will lead the

nation. Debates controlled by the two major parties about a narrow set

of issues that do not present solutions to our most pressing problems

further thwart voter interest and participation,” Nader said.



<p>“Throwing away your vote is throwing it in the direction of the two

major parties who have wasted democracy in this country.”
