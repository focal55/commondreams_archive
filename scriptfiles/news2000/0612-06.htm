- June 12 - The National Abortion



Federation (NAF) today applauded the court's recent decision in NAF's



lawsuit against the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority



(MARTA).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With this decisive ruling, the court has sent a clear message to



MARTA that it cannot infringe on our constitutional right to free



speech," said Vicki Saporta, executive director of NAF. "We are



hopeful that MARTA will do the responsible right thing and run our



ads, so that women in Atlanta will have access to the same



information as other women across the country."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The case, National Abortion Federation vs. Metropolitan Atlanta



Rapid Transit Authority, was filed in April of last year, after NAF



tried unsuccessfully to run its public service campaign on Atlanta



buses, subway cars, and bus shelters. NAF was informed that MARTA's



advertising policy allowed it to reject any advertising supporting

or



opposing a subject of "public controversy." In the lawsuit, NAF



claimed that MARTA had violated NAF's first amendment right to free



speech.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With this decision, the court has unequivocally supported our



claim," said Saporta. She explained, "U.S. District Judge Charles A.



Pannell has found that MARTA has been inconsistent in applying its



advertising policy." For example, MARTA has accepted other public



interest ads on subjects that might be considered controversial, such



as AIDS awareness and racial and religious tolerance.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The court also ruled that MARTA does not have a compelling state



interest in violating NAF's right to free speech." MARTA had argued,



among other things, that the NAF ads could result in violence against



the transit riders or the staff of MARTA. Saporta stated, "Not only



have we run the ads in numerous other cities without incident, but



several transit systems have asked us to re-run the ads. We have also



received phone calls on our hotline from women who saw the campaign



and were grateful that they were able to access accurate information



about abortion."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decision also found that MARTA's advertising policy is on its



face unconstitutional, because it is vague and overly broad. U.S.



District Judge Charles A. Pannell wrote, "For example, under the



definition of 'public controversy' contained in MARTA's advertising



policy, a MARTA official could reject ads promoting the Atlanta



Braves. The Braves are widely reported on by the local media and they



certainly arouse strong feelings in a great number of people."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The court has sent a message loud and clear: it is



unconstitutional to censor advertising about a legal medical



procedure," said Saporta.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Abortion Federation's public service campaign focuses



on the close to half of American women who will choose abortion, and



the dedicated physicians who face many obstacles to provide this care



safely to them. The campaign also features NAF's toll-free hotline



number, 800-772-9100. The hotline is the only one in the country that



provides accurate, unbiased information about abortion and referrals



to qualified abortion providers.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The campaign has run in a total of 11 cities since it was launched



in March, 1999: Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Las Vegas, Miami,



Minneapolis, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, St. Louis, and



Washington, D.C. It is also scheduled to go up in additional cities



this year.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">------



The National Abortion Federation is the largest association of



abortion providers, with member clinics throughout the U.S. and



Canada. NAF is dedicated to ensuring that abortion remains safe,



legal and accessible.
