- July 24 - The Sierra Club today declared that possible

     Republican Vice Presidential nominee Richard Cheney had a strong

     anti-environmental voting record as Wyoming's sole member of the House

     of Representatives from 1979-89.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     During his tenure in Congress, Cheney consistently voted against the

     environment, with a lifetime average score of 13 percent, according to

     the non-partisan League of Conservation Voters, including a zero

     percent pro-environment voting record in 1988, his last full term in

     Congress. Reports indicate that Gov. George W. Bush is strongly

     considering the selection of Cheney as his running mate.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Adding Cheney to Bush's ticket would make a bad situation for the

     environment worse," said Dr. Robert Cox, President of Sierra Club.  "A

     Bush-Cheney ticket would be just what the oil industry wants.  They

     both support weakening the Clean Air Act, oppose protection of public

     lands, and have consistently opposed efforts to protect the health and

     safety of our environment."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Polls consistently demonstrate that voters of all political persuasion

     want their elected officials to protect the environment.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We're disappointed that Gov. Bush may ignore this national consensus

     by selecting a running mate with a dirty record," concluded Cox.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Cheney's record is littered with anti-environment votes, including the

     following:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * Voted Against Clean Water: voted to sustain President Reagan's veto

     of the Clean Water Act on February 3, 1987.  He was only one of 26

     House members to oppose overriding President Reagan's veto.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * Voted Against Clean Air: voted to postpone sanctions against clean

     air violators, on December 3, 1987.  The oil industry strongly

     supported this vote.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * Voted Against Community Right To Know: voted against an amendment to

     require oil, chemical and other polluting facilities to report on

     their toxic emissions, on December 10, 1985.  The oil industry

     strongly opposed this amendment.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * Voted Against Citizens' Rights to Sue Polluters:  voted against an

     amendment to allow citizens to sue in federal court if they were

     harmed by pollution from abandoned toxic waste sites.  The vote was on

     December 10, 1985.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * Voted Against the creation of Great Basin National Park in Nevada:

     voted strike this provision from H.R. 3302 on April 30, 1986.  Great

     Basin is the only National Park in Nevada.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * Supported drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge:

     cosponsored H.R. 1082 by Rep. Don Young (R-AL), in the 100th Congress.

      This bill was and remains a top priority of the oil industry.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Cheney has also had a poor environmental record as Chairman and Chief

     Executive Officer of the Halliburton Company.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * One of Halliburton subsidiaries is a responsible party at the

     Tri-State Mining District Superfund toxic clean-up site in

     southwestern Missouri.  The site contains lead and zinc contamination.

</font>

<p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * According to the Halliburton website, it had  an "increased

     environment incident rate for 1998," the last year data was listed.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * At the end of 1999, Halliburton also had 107,650 open asbestos

     claims, which is 30% more than in 1998.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     * Many of Halliburton's facilities produce a great deal of pollution.

     For instance, the Halliburton facility in Duncan, Oklahoma is in the

     top 20% for dirtiest facilities in the United States, according to EPA

     data from 1997, collected under the Community Right to Know Act.
