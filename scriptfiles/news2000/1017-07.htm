- October 17 - The following was



released today by the Alaska Wilderness League:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GOVERNOR BUSH ON OIL: MYTH VS. FACT

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In anticipation of tonight's presidential debate, the Alaska



Wilderness League today offered the following corrections to



Governor George W. Bush's energy plan and his continued call for



the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling.</font>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">---

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

MYTH: "...Open only 8 percent of the Arctic National Wildlife



Refuge to environmentally responsible exploration, which could



replace the oil that U.S. now imports from Iraq."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FACT: Bush is actually proposing to allow drilling in the



entire area that the Regan Administration's own scientists



called the "biological heart" of the Arctic Refuge, the 1.5



million-acre coastal plain. He neglects to point out that 95



percent of Alaska's oil rich North Slope is already open to oil



exploration or drilling. The refuge coastal plain is the only



area along Alaska's Arctic coast protected from oil drilling.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MYTH: "The vice president ... would rather protect this



refuge than gain the energy, but this is a false choice...We can



do both -- taking out the energy and leaving only footprints."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FACT: The oil industry made the same promise before the



Exxon Valdez oil spill. It's simply not believable. The Arctic



Refuge's landscape is so fragile that vehicle tracks from nearly



two decades ago are still visible from the air. Even with the



best technology, drilling the refuge would require hundreds of



miles of pipelines, roads, airports, and other facilities. Oil



development in Alaska's Arctic already sprawls over 1,000 square



miles -- an area bigger than Rhode Island. At Prudhoe Bay,



there's an average of more than 400 spills a year and twice as



much air pollutants emitted as Washington, D.C.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MYTH: "America, more than ever, is at the mercy of foreign



governments and cartels -- at the mercy of big foreign oil."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FACT: Bush neglects to point out that the biggest oil



operator on Alaska's North Slope is in fact a foreign,



multinational oil company, British Petroleum. The U.S. actually



imports much of its oil from Canada, Mexico, and other non-OPEC



countries. We also export about 1 million barrels of oil and



refined petroleum products every day. And since a ban on Alaska



oil exports was lifted in 1995, North Slope oil has been shipped



to China and other foreign nations.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MYTH: "On the Clinton-Gore watch, Saddam Hussein's Iraq has



become a major supplier of oil to America. This means that one



of our worst international enemies is gaining more and more



control over America's economic future."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FACT: The Clinton Administration has actually increased oil



and gas production from U.S. federal lands. It has even leased



4 million acres on Alaska's North Slope -- an area far larger



than the coastal plain of the refuge. New discoveries have



extended the life of Alaska's oil fields until 2040 and more



than 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas (the energy



equivalent of 6 billion barrels of oil) is available from



already developed Alaska fields. Still, the U.S. simply can't



drill its way to energy independence or lower prices. We have



less than 3 percent of the world's known oil reserves. Even if



we plundered every national park, wildlife refuge, and



coastline, we would still be importing more than half our oil.



Only by decreasing our dependence on oil can we become less



dependence on imported oil. A modest increase in the fuel



economy of our nation's cars and light trucks of just 3 miles



per gallon would save more than a million barrels of oil per day



-- far more than might be in the Arctic Refuge.</font>
