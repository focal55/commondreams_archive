- March 21 - The following was



released today by Handgun Control Inc.:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the wake of the Columbine massacre and other recent



shootings, the National Rifle Association has doggedly tried to



deflect any discussion of new or stronger gun laws with a simple --



and simplistic -- response: "Enforce the laws already on the



books." Arguing that the Clinton administration has failed to



enforce existing laws, the NRA claims that more gun laws aren't



needed.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, as Congress prepares to take up a package of legislation to



improve the ability of federal law enforcement agencies to



prosecute gun criminals, Handgun Control and the Center to Prevent



Handgun Violence have released a new report demonstrating the basic



hypocrisy of the NRA's enforcement mantra. The Enforcement Fable:



How the NRA Prevented Enforcement of the Nation's Gun Laws details



the NRA's systematic weakening of federal gun laws and how the



NRA's actions have made law enforcement's job of catching criminals



more difficult. The report considers three important components of



our gun laws: The McClure-Volkmer Act, the Brady Law, and funding



of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NRA-sponsored Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, also



known as the McClure-Volkmer Act, is perhaps the most damning



evidence of NRA hypocrisy on enforcement. With its passage, the NRA



accomplished the following:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Allowed unlicensed individuals to sell their personal



firearms as a "hobby," allowing for the sale of massive numbers of



firearms to criminals and juveniles without background checks.



This provision not only created a vast secondary market, but also



opened up the "gun show loophole" which Congress is now charged



with closing;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Facilitated the sale of guns to criminals and juveniles by



turning gun shows into a booming business;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Allowed criminals to keep or regain their rights to own guns;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Severely restricted the ability of the ATF to conduct



inspections of the business premises of federally licensed firearms



dealers; and

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Raised the burden of proof for violations of federal gun laws.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The seven-year battle to pass the Brady Bill and the NRA's



ongoing attacks on the National Instant Check System show that the



NRA's claim to support background checks is utterly specious.



Namely:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Before the Brady Bill was passed, 32 states lacked a



background check system. A criminal could walk into a gun store,



sign the form stating he is not a prohibited purchaser and walk out



with a gun. The form would simply get filed away, with no



follow-through to make sure the purchaser's statements were



accurate. The Brady Bill was designed to close this loophole by



providing for a background check and waiting period, and the NRA



worked tirelessly to defeat it;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Only when it realized that the Brady Bill was unstoppable did



the NRA shift its efforts towards weakening the law as much as



possible by attempting to push through an immediate reliance on an



"instant check" system, a system that was not technically feasible



at the time;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Even after embracing an "instant check" system, the NRA has



continually sought to undermine the system's integrity and



efficiency by preventing law enforcement from maintaining any



records on the background checks it conducts;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Most telling is the NRA's continued opposition to background



checks on all gun purchasers, including all gun show sales and



private sales. If the NRA supports background checks, why do they



want to keep this gaping loophole open in our laws?

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, it is no secret that the NRA has little love for



federal law enforcement, particularly the ATF. NRA rhetoric



combined with its campaign to financially cripple the ATF



demonstrate the gun lobby's singleminded thoroughness in carrying



out its extremist agenda: You don't just make the laws weak and



difficult to enforce, you also debilitate the agency that has



primary responsibilty for enforcing those laws.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Enforcement Fable provides a thorough account of the NRA's



campaign to hobble the enforcement of our nation's gun laws," said



Michael Barnes, president of Handgun Control and the Center to



Prevent Handgun Violence. "This report makes it clear that the



NRA's sole concern has been to make gun ownership and gun commerce



as easy and widespread as possible -- all at the expense of public



safety."

Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974 by



Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. "Pete" Shields, two victims of gun



violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law



enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups across



the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and local gun



control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI has more than



400,000 members nationwide, making it the nation's largest



citizens' gun control lobbying organization. Handgun Control's



sister organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, was



founded in 1983 and is also chaired by Sarah Brady. It seeks to



reduce gun violence through education, legal advocacy, research,



and outreach to the entertainment community. The Center's national



initiatives include violence prevention programs for youth,



education programs on the risks associated with guns, legal



representation for gun violence victims, reform of the gun



industry, and research on the risks associated with guns and on the



efficacy of gun control laws. More information about both HCI and



CPHV can be found on our Web sites at <a href="http://www.handguncontrol.org">www.handguncontrol.org</a>
