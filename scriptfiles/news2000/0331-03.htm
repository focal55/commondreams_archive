- March 31 - The following analysts are available for interviews about the just-released

Trustees’ report on Social Security and Medicare:



<p>MARK WEISBROT, (202) 822-1180 ext 228, (202) 333-6141, <a href="mailto:weisbrot@cepr.net">weisbrot@cepr.net</a>,

<a href="http://www.cepr.net">http://www.cepr.net</a><br>

	Co-author of "Social Security: The Phony Crisis" and co-director of the

Center for Economic and Policy Research, Weisbrot said today: “Social

Security is financially rock solid -- something that one would never know

from listening to politicians argue about who is going to ‘save’ the

program. From what? This latest Trustees’ report shows that Social Security

could be left on automatic pilot for the next 37 years and everyone would

get every dollar of their promised benefits. Of course, it’s silly to make

projections further out than that -- economists cannot even forecast the

federal budget surplus one year out within a margin of 80 percent. But for

those who want to speculate about the science fiction future, the Trustees’

report also shows that the program’s shortfall over the next 75 years is

considerably less than one percent of our national income. Is anyone really

worried that people earning 50, 60 and 70 percent more than we do today

might have to cough up this little bit more to support the elderly?”



<p>DIANA ZUCKERMAN, (202) 216-9507, <a href="mailto:cpr4wandf@aol.com">cpr4wandf@aol.com</a>,

<a href="http://www.cpr4womenandfamilies.org">http://www.cpr4womenandfamilies.org</a><br>

	Executive director of the National Center for Policy Research for Women and

Families, Zuckerman said today: “The new report is great news for everyone,

and especially women. It provides the reassurance that everyone needs,

proving that Social Security and Medicare are remarkably solid programs that

can withstand the burden of the retirement of the baby boomers, and even the

boomers’ efforts to live forever. Of course, we still need to further

strengthen the fiscal integrity of these programs, but it would be

incredibly foolish to change the underlying structure of Social Security....

Personal, private accounts would be a very radical, unnecessary step and

would benefit the wealthiest Americans -- while not benefitting most women

and families.”



<p>JOHN HESS, (212) 866-8699<br>

	A former reporter for The New York Times who is a policy analyst on

economics and aging issues, Hess said today: “The notion that Medicare and

Social Security are going broke has been a great hoax used repeatedly since

1975. Whole generations of Americans have been needlessly frightened into

believing that these programs will not be there. This makes people sit still

for things like raising the age when you receive Social Security benefits

and cutting Medicare.”
