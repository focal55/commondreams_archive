- July 1 - The Missouri Prisoners Labor Union (MPLU) announced today that it is

initiating an international boycott against all products produced either

directly or indirectly by Colgate Palmolive



<p>This action is being taken in response to Colgate Palmolive's failure to

provide a letter of endorsement in support of the Missouri Prisoners Labor

Union and /or aims and objectives  for three points which are summarized as

follows:



<p>1.)  The establishment of minimum wage pay for all Missouri Prisoners.

<p>2.)  Abolishing all forced labor and abuse perpetrated by the Missouri

Department of Corrections in particular and the State Government in

general.

<p>3.)  Colgate Palmolive's active involvement in persuading the State of

Missouri Legislature to impose a                   Bill of Moratorium on

all executions of Prisoners in the State of Missouri.



<p>In a letter to Colgate Palmolive spokesperson Bill F. Shanahan, MPLU

National Communications Officer Michael Lee stated "Let me reassure you

that neither myself or anyone directly associated with the Missouri

Prisoners Labor Union has any intention of causing physical harm to either

you personally or Colgate Palmolive employees -property. Our tactic is to

simply fold our arms and turn a blind eye to your products." 

<p>The letter

goes on to reiterate what MPLU elected leadership stated in their 06-04-00

letter to Colgate Palmolive "...we realize  that your company didn't put us

in prison. This is a matter of Colgate Palmolive reaping immense profits

for our incarceration and as the largest single consumer block you have a

social obligation to us. The situation I am outlining, is the same argument

organized labor has used to oppose sweat shop labor employed by Kathy Lee

Gifford, Nike, etc. I would also like to add that we are not asking for

anything from society except that we be treated in a fair manner as defined

by the United States Constitution and numerous legal cases. We are not

advocating for a cushy life style but simply a fair days pay for a fair

days work and a safe, non-abusive work environment."



<p>The MPLU is a 500 member organization which was created by Prisoners and

supporters. It was legally chartered by the State of Missouri on August 3,

1998. It is our desire to better the living and working conditions of

Missouri Prisoners in particular and two million United States Prisoners in

general. We provide Prisoners a much needed political forum from which to

promote the principles of social justice, economic and political issues

confronting Missouri Prisoners and workers. Our commitment to non-violence

has been demonstrated continuously. One of the linchpin principles of the

MPLU is that there is nothing more powerful then a worker with arms folded

refusing to pick up tools or perform any labor.



<p>Since our inception, members have been subjected to all forms of abuse and

harassment propagated by the Missouri Department of Corrections. On

February 17, 2000 President White-Bey was finally released from

Administrative Segregation (the hole) after being confined there for almost

two years. His offense was simply to advocate that as workers we have the

right to organize and the Human and Civil Rights of Prisoners must be

respected . Presently several of our members still remain in the hole and

are subjected to daily abuse. But the Union rolls on!



<p>In this campaign we focus on calling for a moratorium on the continued use

of the death penalty specifically in the State of Missouri and across the

United States in general. It is our great concern that if the State has

such tremendous power to execute someone then it has the power to perpetrate

any abuse on our membership simply for demanding a fair days pay for a fair

days work. Continual use of the death penalty is a human rights violation

and an ineffective manner in which to combat anti-social behavior.



<p>For the first time in history Prisoners who do not face the ultimate

punishment are calling for a moratorium on its use. We do so as part of our

social responsibility as an organization of economic self-defense and in

defense of the Human and Civil Rights of all Prisoners.



<p>As of July 1,200 we are requesting that all Prisoners and their

family/friends, MPLU members and our supporters to non-violently decline to

purchase Colgate Palmolive. In support of our efforts we have requested

that all members of organized labor, peace and social justice activists and

the NAACP to also refrain from purchasing Colgate Palmolive products until

at such time our demands are met.
