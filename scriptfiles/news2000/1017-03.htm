- October 17 - Companies should not be able to use lawsuits to determine the

identities of people who anonymously post messages on the Internet, two advocacy

organizations said in <a href="http://www.citizen.org/litigation/briefs/HritzvDoe.htm">a brief</a> filed

recently.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To best protect freedom of speech on the Internet, companies should be required to meet

stringent legal standards before courts order the disclosure of the identities of people

who post Web messages about those companies, the consumer advocacy organization Public

Citizen and the civil liberties group <a href="http://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier

Foundation</a> (&quot;EFF&quot;) said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The brief was filed Friday in U.S. District Court, the Eastern District of Virginia, on

behalf of an individual, Jane Doe, who posted several comments on a Yahoo! message board

devoted to AK Steel (formerly Armco Steel), a company based in Middletown, Ohio. Among

these messages were statements that John Hritz, executive vice president and general

counsel of AK Steel, was too litigious. Hritz promptly filed a petition alleging that

&quot;John and/or Jane Doe&quot; had made &quot;threatening, libelous and

disparaging&quot; comments on the Internet.

(Ohio law allows Hritz to file a petition for discovery even though he has not yet filed a

lawsuit against Doe.) Hritz then used that petition to issue subpoenas to Yahoo! and AOL

to identify Doe.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This lawsuit is a blatant attempt to intimidate all of AK Steel&#146;s employees

and other members of the public,&quot; said Paul Levy of Public Citizen Litigation Group, who will argue

the case on behalf of Doe. &quot;Hritz is in effect warning workers and others<b> </b>not

to exercise their First Amendment right to speak freely about the company on the

Internet.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Internet, Levy argued, is &quot;the modern equivalent of the Speakers&#146; Corner

at Hyde Park, the British venue where anybody can stand up and voice their opinions --

however silly, profane or brilliant they might seem -- to anyone who chooses to listen. It

would be disturbing if courts were to permit the routine disclosure of the identities of

people who post messages anonymously. The First Amendment guarantees people a right to

speak out and participate in public debates. A message board is just that -- an ongoing

public debate.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The only Web posting about himself that Hritz cited in his request for discovery was

&quot;Hritz will litigate the time of day. OOPS I will be in court.&quot; As Doe explains

in her brief, not only is this statement purely opinion, and hence not actionable as

libel, but the filing of this case against Doe seems to substantiate Doe&#146;s criticism

of Hritz.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen and EFF got involved in the matter because of the free speech

implications and to combat the growing problem of powerful entities increasingly turning

to their lawyers when they find something online they don&#146;t like. Lauren Gelman,

EFF&#146;s director of public policy, explained, &quot;This is just one more example where

the legal system is being misused to chill Internet conduct. Lawyers are churning out

subpoenas with the sole purpose of intimidating individuals into self-censoring speech.

That's especially clear here where Hritz hasn't even filed a lawsuit.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Doe argues in her brief that because the main purpose of such suits is often to unmask

a company&#146;s critics, the identification of those critics should be treated as a major

form of relief that cannot be awarded without proof of wrongdoing. A company should not be

able to deny members of the public the right to speak anonymously simply by filing a

complaint and making vague allegations of wrongdoing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Given the complete lack of evidence that Hritz was libeled, his use of the court

as his own private detective agency constitutes a blatant disregard for the Supreme

Court&#146;s ruling that the First Amendment protects Jane Doe&#146;s right to speak

anonymously,&quot; Gelman said. &quot;This is unacceptable behavior, especially from a

lawyer for a major corporation.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robert Corn-Revere and Ronald Wiltsie of the Washington, D.C.-based law firm of Hogan

and Hartson, and Timothy Connors and Mark Belleville of the Ohio-based<b> </b>law firm of

Calfee, Halter &amp; Griswold, also are representing Doe as local counsel in the Virginia

and Ohio courts, respectively.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization founded by Ralph Nader, has been

involved in several similar cases. It recently represented an employee in a similar case

involving an employee of Thomas &amp; Betts Corporation (T&amp;B), a Tennessee electrical

manufacturer. Public Citizen intervened to protect the employee as well as the identities

of other message posters. T&amp;B dismissed the suit. The EFF (<a href="http://www.eff.org">http://www.eff.org</a>) is the

leading civil liberties organization working to protect rights in the digital world. EFF

was a plaintiff in <u>ACLU v. Reno</u>, the landmark case in which the Supreme Court ruled

that the Internet is a constitutionally protected medium.</i></font></p>
