- October 12 - “I am disgusted and disappointed at the 11th hour attempt by the Republicans to

ram through ill-conceived, unjust, and imbalanced bankruptcy reform through the

Senate by co-opting an unrelated conference report, but I am not surprised.  The

fact that the Senate Majority Leader is willing to trample the traditions of the

Senate in his rush to pass this legislation speaks to the tremendous clout and

financial resources of the financial services industry.



<p>“Make no mistake, this is a tactic straight out of “Invasion of the Body

Snatchers.”  The House and Senate Republicans have taken a secretly negotiated

bankruptcy bill and stuffed it into the hollowed-out husk of the State

Department authorization bill – not one provision of the original State

department bill remains.  Of course, State Department authorization is the last

of many targets.  The majority leader has talked about doing this on an

appropriations bill, on a crop insurance bill, on the electronic signatures

bill, on the Violence Against Women Act.  So desperate are we to serve the big

banks and credit card companies that no bill has been safe from this

controversial baggage.



<p>“There is no question that this is a significantly worse bill than the one that

passed the Senate.  In fact, there’s no pretending that this is a bill designed

to curb real abuse of the bankruptcy code.  Does this bill take on wealthy

debtors who file frivolous claims and shield their assets in multi million

dollar mansions?  No, it guts the cap on the homestead exemption adopted by the

Senate.  Not does this bill contain another amendment adopted by the Senate that

would prevent violators of the Fair Access to Clinic Entrances Act – which

protects women’s health clinics – from using the bankruptcy system to walk away

from their punishment.  



<p>“Instead, this legislation will deny a “fresh start” to low and moderate income

families who file for bankruptcy out of desperation.  The inflexible, arbitrary

means test will force many working families inappropriately into the Chapter 13

bankruptcy debt repayment process - which 67% of such debtors fail to complete

under current law.  But the bill would also impose mandatory credit counseling

on all debtors before they can seek bankruptcy relief regardless of

circumstances; end the practice under current law of stopping eviction

proceedings against tenants who file for bankruptcy; and impose new filing and

paperwork requirements that would make bankruptcy process even more onerous.



<p>“This legislation is terrible for working families and it rewards the predatory

and irresponsible lending by banks and credit card companies which fed the

crisis in the first place.  For that reason, a broad coalition of consumer

groups, unions, women’s and children’s groups, civil rights organizations, and

religious groups have united in opposition to this bill.



<p>“In the months since the Senate passed Bankruptcy Reform, any pretense that this

legislation is urgently needed has evaporated.  The number of bankruptcies has

fallen steadily over the past year, charge offs on credit card debt are down

significantly and delinquencies have fallen to the lowest levels since 1995. 

Now proponents and opponents agree that nearly all debtors resort to bankruptcy

not to game the system but rather as a desperate measure of economic survival

and that only a tiny minority of Chapter 7 filers – as few as 3% – could afford

any debt repayment. 



<p>“Should the Majority Leader follow through on his reckless strategy, I will use

all my procedural rights as a Senator to slow down this conference report.  A

conference report is hard to stop, but if the majority Leader wishes to take a

few days of the Senate’s precious remaining time to consider the ramifications

of this bill on working families, and the ramifications of his tactics on the

vitality of the Senate as a legislative body, then I am prepared to accommodate

him.”
