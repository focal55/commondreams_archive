- May 2 - Following a meeting of the National Board of Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), the nation’s oldest independent liberal political organization, endorsed Vice President Al Gore for the presidency.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National Director, Amy Isaacs, said, “ADA’s core values are at the heart of Mr. Gore’s campaign.  We believe he is the best candidate because he will continue the fight for social and economic justice, protect a woman’s right to choose and push for quality, affordable health care for all as well as greater educational opportunities.”</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Board also noted was that the next President will likely have an unusual opportunity to appoint several new Justices to the Supreme Court and judges to the Federal Bench.  Isaacs said, “The issues on which these judges and Justices will rule will reverberate for generations to come.  Of the major Presidential candidates, only Vice President Gore can be trusted to take into account the impact those rulings will have on all of our nation’s citizens, not just the privileged few.”</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gore’s ADA Lifetime Voting Record from his terms in the House and the Senate is a moderate 66%.  The ADA voting records are one measure of an elected official’s political ideology.  Isaacs said, “It is important to remember that his voting record stops in 1992 when he became Vice President.  Since then, he has changed and grown.”</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Isaacs continued, “There are positions on which we continue to disagree with him on, and he will be sure to hear from us when we do.  But we cannot afford to underestimate the power he will have as President to keep in check a potentially antagonistic, conservative Congress.”</font></p>
