- March 8 - After steadfastly opposing common-sense strategies to

     lower oil prices, Senator Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska) today is

     launching a battle to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife

     Refuge.  Rather than working to reduce America's addiction to foreign

     oil, Sen. Murkowski would allow oil drilling in the fragile Arctic

     Refuge, destroying an area known as "America's Serengeti," home to

     polar bears, wolves and migratory birds and the calving grounds for

     the 129,000-member Porcupine River Caribou Herd.

     Sen. Murkowski wants to let his buddies in the oil industry drill for

     oil that might not even be there, in the wilderness areas of the

     American Serengeti.  Yet Sen. Murkowski has consistently opposed

     sensible, sustainable solutions to our energy needs.  Now he suddenly

     wants to be our savior?  It is only fair that we respond with

     skepticism.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Thankfully, there are other solutions that will work:

     --   Stop exporting Alaskan crude oil from the North Slope to other

     countries.  We had a ban on the export of Alaskan crude oil until

     1995.  Guess who sponsored the legislation to repeal the ban?  Senator

     Murkowski.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     --   Get our automakers to use existing technology to improve

     automobile fuel efficiency, so we don't need as much foreign oil.  The

     U.S. Senate has stymied attempts to raise our nation's fuel economy

     standards.  Guess who voted the wrong way?  Senator Murkowski.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     --   Ensure that the oil industry remains competitive, and avoid a

     monopoly on Alaskan oil that could raise prices even higher.  British

     Petroleum wants to takeover Arco which would create an Alaskan oil

     monopoly, and lead to a stranglehold on domestic supply and local pump

     prices.  Guess who is supporting the merger?  Senator Murkowski.
