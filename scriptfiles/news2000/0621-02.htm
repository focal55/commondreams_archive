- June 21 - Predicting that the environment will be a key issue for swing voters in the 2000 elections, the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) today named four more congressional candidates to its "Dirty Dozen" list and targeted them for defeat.   Through the Dirty Dozen campaigns, LCV exposes the poor environmental records of candidates for the U.S. House and Senate who are in highly competitive races, encouraging voters to cast their ballot against the environmental foe.<br>

<br>

 



The four candidates added to the 2000 Dirty Dozen list today are Rep. Jim Rogan (R-Calif.), Rep. Steve Kuykendall (R-Calif.), Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) and former Governor George Allen (R-Va.).  Rep. Jim Traficant (D-Ohio) was named to the Dirty Dozen in February of this year.  The remaining Dirty Dozen candidates will be disclosed in upcoming months.<br>

<br>



"Candidates named to the Dirty Dozen share the dishonorable distinction of waging assaults on the environment by catering to corporate polluters and standing in the way of cleaner air and water protections," said LCV political director Betsy Loyless.  "We need members of the U.S. Congress who work to give Americans cleaner air to breathe and safer water drink.  These Dirty Dozen candidates put polluters before people and it's time that voters in their states and districts put them out of a job."<br>

<br>



Calling the environment "the ultimate backyard issue," Loyless predicted that concerns about clean air and water will resonate with key swing voters this fall.  "People in all parts of the country - Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike - care deeply about the quality of their air and water, the safety of their communities and the quality of their lives.  By exposing the disastrous environmental records of the Dirty Dozen candidates, we give the public a powerfully persuasive reason to vote against these anti-environment candidates."<br>

<br>

  



The Dirty Dozen campaigns use a combination of strategic grassroots organizing, polling, earned media and advertising to inform voters about the poor environmental records of Dirty Dozen candidates in their district and state.  In the last two elections, LCV has helped defeat 16 of the 25 candidates named to its Dirty Dozen list.<br>

<br>



"Voters expect their elected officials to 'do the right thing' when it comes to protecting the environment.  Unfortunately, too many candidates are willing to mortgage the public's health to protect their own political future in the deep pockets of polluters," Loyless said.<br>

<br>



The first five Dirty Dozen candidates of 2000 are in highly competitive races and each have, according to LCV, "demonstrated blatant disregard for the environment."<br>

<br>



<b>Sen. Spencer Abraham (R), 1999 LCV score = 0%</b><br>

<b>Michigan Senate</b><br>

Senator Abraham has the worst environmental record of all 16 senators from the Great Lakes region, consistently voting against tougher drinking water protections and failing to help clean up Michigan's waterways.<br>

<br>



<b>Former Governor George Allen (R), Lifetime LCV score = 13%<br>

Virginia Senate</b><br>

Former Governor Allen is an anti-environment extremist.  As governor from 1993 to 1997, Allen's pro-polluter policies, questionable political appointments to key environmental positions, and undeclared war on the Environmental Protection Agency posed serious threats to Virginia's air, water and quality of life.<br>

<br>



<b>Rep. Steve Kuykendall (R), 1999 LCV score = 25%<br>

California's 36th Congressional District</b><br>

Representative Kuykendall has compiled a failing voting record on the environment.  He frequently works with polluters and developers to roll back environment and public health protections, regardless of the potential harm to the citizens in his district and the nation.<br>

<br>

  



<b>Rep. James Rogan (R), 1999 LCV score = 19%<br>

California's 27th Congressional District</b><br>

Representative Rogan is out of step with the citizens of his Southern California district, voting against air, water and land protections 94 percent of the time in 1999.  Rogan's consistent efforts to weaken clean air laws threaten the health of the more than one million residents who suffer from asthma and other respiratory illnesses in his district.<br>

<br>



<b>Representative Jim Traficant (D), 1999 LCV score = 19%<br>

Ohio's 17th Congressional District</b><br>

Representative Traficant ranked among the bottom three percent of House Democrats for his votes to roll back public health and safety protections.  Over the last 15 years, his environmental record has gone from respectable to irrefutably poor.  Because of his lack of environmental leadership, residents of this district continue to grapple with polluted rivers and toxics in the land, air and water.<br>

<br>



The League of Conservation Voters is the political voice for the national environmental and conservation community.   LCV works to elect pro-environment candidates to federal office, and is the only group dedicated full-time to holding federal officials accountable on the environment.  Since 1970, LCV has produced the National Environmental Scorecard that annually rates U.S. Representatives and Senators on key environmental votes.
