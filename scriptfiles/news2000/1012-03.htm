- October 12 - Land mines are a cruel and indiscriminate weapon, killing and maiming

civilians, including many children, for years or decades after

hostilities have ceased.  Over 20,000 people around the world are killed

or maimed by land mines each year.



<p>Land mines are dangerous to American troops: 34% of American casualties

in the Gulf War were caused by land mines.  Land mines, in many cases

American land mines, caused large numbers of casualties for American

troops in Vietnam and Korea as well.



<p>Land mines are not necessary for our defense.  Many military experts,

including Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf and Gen. Robert G. Gard, have joined

the consensus of human rights activists who support this treaty, arguing

that the prohibition of landmines would not in any way threaten national

security.  Our future military strength rests in mobility and superior

technology; these low-tech, indiscriminate weapons can be safely

eliminated.



<p>I would:



<p>· Sign the 1997 Mine Ban treaty, and press the Senate to ratify it.

<p>· Declare an immediate moratorium on the production, export and

placement of anti-personnel land mines, including mixed anti-personnel

and anti-tank mines.

<p>· Increase technical and material aid to efforts to remove land mines

that are killing and maiming innocents around the world.



<p>I call on Vice-President Gore and Governor Bush to take a clear position

on this issue.  There is a great difference between Gore’s rhetoric and

the reality of the administration’s policy on land mines.  Bush has yet

to make a statement on the issue.  Both need to answer the question:

would you, as President, commit to signing the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty?
