- October 27 - The Nation Editors announce their editorial position on



Election 2000 in "The Election and Beyond," in the



Nov. 6 issue of The Nation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In another season, when our insurgent values have



accumulated more momentum and self-confidence, we might see



things differently," The Nation Editors write. "This time



around, we believe the practical priority of keeping the Bush



squad from winning power takes precedence, while we also urge



that, if possible, progressives help Nader score a blow to the



status quo."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Editors urge progressives to vote for Al Gore in the



states that are too close to call on Election Day. In states



where either Gore or Bush has a commanding lead, they encourage



voters to support Ralph Nader. They add, "In either case, the



imperative is to end Republican control in Congress by electing



Democrats, also vital to the prospects for progressive change."



And, as an extension of "The Election and Beyond," The Nation



has created an online poll watch, which aggregates state polling



data daily to determine exactly which states are too close to



call, available at <a href="http://www.thenation.com">www.thenation.com.</a>

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resonance of Ralph Nader's voice has been one of the



precious few bright spots of the campaign, far eclipsing Pat



Buchanan's right-wing version of insurgency. If Nader draws



enough voters to carry the Green Party over the 5 percent



hurdle, that vehicle provides concrete opportunity.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, The Nation Editors warn, there is greater urgency to



preventing Bush from "capturing all three branches of government



for the right-wing agenda." They argue, "The real argument for



Gore is named Bush, and it's the most compelling case. The



implications of a Bush victory are well understood," for the



Supreme Court, reproductive freedom and public education, among



other issues.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In urging progressives to support Gore, The Editors write,



"The Democratic candidate is a smart and capable man who, at



different points in his career, has displayed a forward-looking



vision on great public problems."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"After the past two decades of loss and retreat," The Nation



Editors explain "it takes nerve to sound so hopeful." Despite



its disappointments, Election 2000 "might yet turn out to be the



progressive moment-when we stopped backing up and started moving



forward."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Established by abolitionists in 1865, The Nation is America's



oldest weekly magazine and one of its premier journals of



opinion.
