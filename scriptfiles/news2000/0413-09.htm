- April 14 - As thousands gather in Washington to protest the policies of the World Bank

and the International Monetary Fund, the following analysts are available for

interviews:

<br>

A member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Kucinich (D-Ohio) said

today: "Unless debt relief is delinked from a requirement of countries to

follow IMF economic policies, the main beneficiary of Congressional funding

for debt relief is the IMF. That's because the IMF will receive hundreds of

millions of taxpayer dollars, while poor countries will have to follow IMF

dictates about government spending, health and education policy, monetary

policy, privatization. But the IMF deserves much of the blame for the

poverty, environmental degradation and unemployment of heavily indebted poor

countries, since it has been telling them what they could and could not do

for decades. If the U.S. gives a real gift to the world's poorest countries,

it should be freedom from the IMF."

<br>

Author of "The Debt Trap: The IMF and the Third World" and "Lent and

Lost: Foreign Credit and Third World Development," Payer said today:

"Although the official raison d'etre of the IMF is purportedly to prevent

and alleviate foreign currency and debt crises of poor countries, over its

54-year history the prescriptions of the IMF have done more to cause such

crises, and exacerbate them, than any other factor. The IMF and the World

Bank have persistently and without exception urged countries to spend down

their reserves (rather than conserving and budgeting them), to borrow

foreign currencies without regard to their ability to repay, and to override

their own democratic institutions and decision-making processes in order to

attract and placate potential sources of foreign investment."

<br>

Executive director of Jobs with Justice, a national labor, student and

religious coalition, Azcarate said today: "The lending policies of the IMF

have a direct connection to the depression of workers' wages around the

world by fostering privatization, allowing for the creation of sweatshop

working conditions and denying workers the right to organize. The IMF lends

money to a developing nation based on certain conditions, like limiting the

enforcement of the minimum wage or putting public projects in private hands.

The WTO sets the rules for global trade; the IMF and World Bank help enforce

these trading policies on governments with their lending practices. GE's

Jack Welch can say that he wants to put GE's factories on barges, so they

can move from country to country with the weakest labor and environmental

laws; companies like GE are helped in this by the WTO, IMF and World Bank --

and workers both in the U.S. and abroad suffer as we have a race to the

bottom."
