- March 29 - Family planning



campaigner Peter H. Kostmayer, executive director of the



environmental organization Zero Population Growth, is urging



Governor Jeb Bush and state law makers to "end an appalling



discrimination against Florida women" and support an all-out effort



to require health insurers to comprehensively cover contraceptives.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Full contraceptive coverage is good for women, good for business



and good for equality," says Kostmayer, a former seven-term U.S.



Congressman.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The effort, if translated into law, would make it illegal for



health insurers to refuse women coverage of all five FDA-approved



methods of contraception (see note A). It would slash health



costs for millions of women statewide. It would also provide



a formidable weapon against the vexing problem of unintended



pregnancy.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Half of all the pregnancies in America every year are unintended.



30 percent of all the births result from unintended pregnancy. That



means that in Florida, almost 60,000 births are the result of



unintended pregnancy. Equally disturbing is the fact that women have



to pay almost 70 percent more than men in out-of-pocket healthcare



costs. Access to affordable contraceptives is the key to breaking



this cycle. A comprehensive contraceptive coverage law would change



the situation dramatically," Kostmayer stressed.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opponents of the legislation only examine the short term costs of



providing contraceptive coverage but fail to mention the big medium



and long-term savings. For example an insurance industry study



concluded that providing comprehensive coverage for contraceptives



would cost only $16 per person per year as compared to $5,512 for



prenatal care and delivery. And while the vast majority of insurance



plans cover child birth and abortion, they do not cover the



relatively inexpensive contraception.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kostmayer added, "Since thousands of abortions in Florida result



from unintended pregnancy, even anti-choice lawmakers can join us in



supporting this critical effort."

</font>

Note (A): Five FDA-approved methods of contraception: oral,



injectable, inserts, IUD and diaphragm.
