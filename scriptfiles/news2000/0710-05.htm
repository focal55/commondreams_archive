- July 10 - Seven war tax resisters attempted to enter Washington's IRS headquarters around noon today to invite prosecution for failure to comply with tax regulations, only to find the doors of the taxing institution closed to the public.<br>

<br>

The closed doors were not a complete surprise to the resisters, who had predicted that the IRS would duck the issue to avoid publicizing the fact that there are people in the United States who regularly flout the tax laws with impunity. "We attempted to turn ourselves in," said longtime resister Robert Randall of Georgia, "but the IRS doesn't want to deal with us." The six other resisters were Carol Moore of Washington, Dan Lundquist and Judith Felker of Minnesota, Clare Hanrahan and Steve Megan of North Carolina and Bill O'Connell of Alabama.<br>

<br>

When they were unable to find an IRS official to surrender to, the protesters—some of whom have resisted federal taxes for more than 20 years—gave a helpful officer of the Federal Protective Services documents they had prepared as part of their challenge to the tax agency. Officer Bill Kunkle promised to deliver the documents to an IRS official as soon as he could find one.<br>

<br>

A form of conscientious objection, war tax resistance—holding back all or part of federal taxes in order to prevent their use for war—has a long and honorable history in the United States, dating back to the colonial era and including such famous resisters as Henry David Thoreau. The IRS has not prosecuted a resister for decades. A letter from Randall that was among the documents given to Officer Kunkle explained why he and his fellow resisters were now challenging the tax agency: <br>

<br>

"Peaceful citizens who are simply constrained by faith and conscience from paying for killing are marginalized as criminals though without the rendering of such a verdict by a jury of our peers. Since I am such a criminal, I believe it is time that you cease being derelict in your duties. I am turning myself in for prosecution as the nefarious threat to society which I am. I will not kill and I will not pay the United States to kill in my name. It is against the law for me not to pay for killing. Prosecute me."<br>

<br>

The surrender was part of a day-long protest against militarism in the federal budget priorities held by the War Resisters League (WRL) and the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee (NWTRCC). It began at 9:00 a.m. at the base of the Washington Monument, where demonstrators held a penny poll in which about 200 passersby "voted" on federal budget priorities they would like to see. The results were:<br>

<br>

Health Care: 27%				Housing: 15%<br>

Arts/Education: 23%				Debt Paydown: 11%<br>

Environmental Protection: 18%		Military: 6%<br>

<br>

Those results—83% for human resources and 6% for military expenditures—are consistent with similar polls held across the country in recent years, revealing that the public's priorities diverge substantially from those of the Congress on the issue of military spending. According to WRL's "Where Your Income Tax Really Goes" brochure for 2000, the current federal budget allocates 33% of federal outlays for human resources, 23% for current military expenditures and 24% for past military expenditures.<br>

<br>

The penny poll and war tax resister surrender were part of a 40-day People's Campaign for Nonviolence sponsored by the Fellowship of Reconciliation with broad participation from peace and justice organizations including WRL and NWTRCC. Today's events came at the end of a weekend-long international conference on war tax resistance and peace tax campaigns. More than 120 people from 17 countries participated in the conference, the seventh of its kind and the first one held in the United States.<br>
