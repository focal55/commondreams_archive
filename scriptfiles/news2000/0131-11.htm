<p>Pacifica Radio's top free-lance reporters and contributors, backed by several nationally-recognized, free-speech organizations today struck Pacifica's national-news program to protest on-going censorship at the 50-year-old community-radio network. 



<p>"We believe Pacifica management seeks to intimidate and censor those who try to report on matters that management prefers to keep quiet," said PNN contributor Aaron Glantz from his base in Berkeley. "Management has not only failed to stop censoring the news, management has not even bothered to contact us to respond to our concerns. So we have no choice but to strike," Glantz added. 



<p>Dozens of journalists from across the Americas, Europe and Asia, many of whom have won the industry's top awards, will strike for the next three months unless Mary Frances Berry, who chairs both the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and the Pacifica Foundation, publicly renounces censorship throughout the network, and reasserts the editorial independence of Pacifica's local and national-news divisions. The striking journalists comprise a majority of active contributors and reporters to Pacifica Network News, PNN, a daily, half-hour news program that airs on some 70 radio stations nationally. In a recent two-month period, nearly 70% of Pacifica's stories came from its stringers. 



<p>The striking reporters delivered a <a href="http://www.savepacifica.net/strike/letter_to_management.html">letter</a> one week ago outlining their demands to Pacifica's entire national board, including chair Mary Frances Berry, via certified mail, fax and e-mail. To date, there has been no official response from Pacifica. Several attempts by the reporters to reach Pacifica management--which has not released its phone number to the public--have been unsuccessful. 



<p>Since the <a href="http://www.savepacifica.net/strike/letter_to_management.html">letter</a> was delivered to management last Monday, additional stringers have joined the action, and several affiliates are considering a boycott of Pacifica Network News as an act of solidarity with the striking reporters. 



<p>The strike is supported by the media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, Project Censored and the National Association for Freedom of Expression. "The survival of PNN as a reliable source of information is very much in doubt," said syndicated media critic Norman Solomon, "this strike may be the last chance to make PNN something trustworthy."



<p>Pacifica has long been a bastion of free speech--from broadcasting Allen Ginsberg's "Howl," to defying the HUAC witch hunts, to airing the commentaries of death-row journalist Mumia Abu Jamal. Since the crisis last spring, when armed guards were called in to lock out staff at KPFA, Pacifica reporters say management has subjected journalists, contributors and independent producers to repeated acts of alteration, suppression and censorship of news stories and public-affairs programming, which they say are of vital interest to the listeners of Pacifica and the broader communities it serves. Reporters also note that management has repeatedly silenced programs in mid-broadcast, and ousted signature voices such as Polk award-winner Larry Bensky. 



<p>In November, Pacifica Network News director Dan Coughlin was "removed" after airing a story on a boycott by sixteen Pacifica affiliates over the issue of censorship. Most recently, veteran news anchor Verna Avery-Brown, the only African-American national-news anchor in public broadcasting, resigned amidst the crisis at PNN. Brown cited, among other concerns, censorship and a disturbing trend away from progressive coverage in Pacifica's national news. The strikers are also demanding that Coughlin be reinstated. 



<p>The type of direct censorship of news personnel and programming which Pacifica management has been engaging in throughout the network's recent crisis would be reprehensible at any U.S. media outlet, not just one which claims to present an alternative viewpoint," added former Pacifica Network News director and former National Public Radio producer JoAnn Kawell.
