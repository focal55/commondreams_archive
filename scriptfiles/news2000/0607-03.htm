- June 7 - Today will mark the two-year anniversary of the murder of James

Byrd Jr., an African American who was chained to the back of a truck and

dragged to his death on a backwoods road in Jasper, Texas at the hands of

neo-Nazis. In remembrance of James Byrd Jr. and others who were tragically

murdered because of hatred, Congress should pass the Hate Crimes Prevention

Act (HCPA) without delay, according to the Human Rights Campaign.

        <p>"It is shameful that after the high-profile murders of James Byrd

Jr. and Matthew Shepard Congress has still not had the courage and wisdom to

pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act," said HRC Political Director Winnie

Stachelberg. "We urge Congress to take action now on hate crime legislation

in memory of James Byrd Jr., so his legacy can be one of helping to end hate

violence in America."

        <p>Following James Byrd's death, the Byrd family emerged as one of the

nation's most powerful voices fighting for all people, including gay and

lesbian Americans, against hate and intolerance. James Byrd Jr.'s sister

Louvon Harris and his nephew Darrell Verrett, who also serves as the

Executive Director of the James Byrd Jr. Foundation, have been key advocates

for both state and federal hate crime legislation. The family has spoken in

support of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act at press conferences with HRC and

appeared at Equality Rocks in April to promote their message of ending hate

violence in America.

<p>In July 1999 the Senate passed the Hate Crimes Prevention Act for the first

time as an amendment to the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill.

But in November 1999, the language was dropped in conference at the urging

of the Republican leadership.

<p>The HCPA would extend current federal hate crime protection - which covers

race, religion, color and national origin -- to gender, sexual orientation

and disability. HCPA would serve as a tool to help law enforcement by

allowing federal assistance, when necessary, in the investigation and

prosecutions of hate crimes. HCPA has broad support from notable law

enforcement agencies and state and local leaders including 22 state

attorneys general, the Police Foundation and the National Sheriff's

Association. The Hate Crimes Prevention Act currently has 191 cosponsors in

the House and 42 in the Senate and would pass if allowed to come up for a

full House and Senate vote, according to HRC.

<p>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay political

organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies

Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that

lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and

in the community.
