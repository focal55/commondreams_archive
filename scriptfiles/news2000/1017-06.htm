- October 17 - If his record in Texas is any indication, a George W. Bush



White House would do little to address the environmental and



health concerns facing communities across the nation. This was



the assessment of three courageous women battling pollution in



Texas, who were in St. Louis today highlighting the Republican



presidential nominee's record of pollution as governor. The



women were joined by Deb Callahan, president of the League of



Conservation Voters, and Dr. Neil Carman of the Lone Star



Chapter of the Sierra Club.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I love my state of Texas," said LaNell Anderson, a



grandmother who is working to highlight the environmental and



health impacts caused by pollution in the Houston Ship Channel



area. "But I am fearful of the prospect of a George W. Bush



presidency. He has failed to protect Texas citizens. I live in



a city that has the filthiest air in the nation. The state of



Texas has violated the Clean Air Act every year that George Bush



has been our governor. Americans deserve better."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tamara Maschino lives in the community of Clear Lake, which



is bordered by 52 chemical plants that make up the Bayport



Chemical Complex. She is the founder of Clean Air Clear Lake,



a grassroots environmental group, dedicated to addressing the



health and environmental impacts caused by pollution from these



plants. According to Maschino, there are entire families in the



Clear Lake area that suffer from asthma and other health



problems. "We asked Governor Bush for help and he's refused to



do anything," Maschino said. "I want to have children someday,



but I'm afraid to."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chris Wilson, a former chemical engineer, is a stay-at-home



mom and president of Lakeway Parents Concerned About Sewage



Spray, a non-profit group founded after the Texas Natural



Resource Conservation Commission decided to place an



experimental wastewater disposal system next to her children's



elementary school. According to Wilson, her group is working



with Texas communities regarding wastewater permits and is



currently drafting legislation that would change the Texas



Environmental Code to require stronger wastewater treatment



standards.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Wilson, Anderson and Maschino come from different



backgrounds, all three women share the common bond of working,



to no avail, to get the Governor's office and Texas'



environmental agency -- whose members are appointed by Bush --



to be more responsive to pollution concerns in the state.



According to LCV's Callahan, voters who care about clean air and



water in Missouri and across the nation have to ask themselves



whether this legacy of pollution in Texas, is something they



want for their families and communities.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"When it comes to protecting the environment, there is a



contrast between Al Gore and George W. Bush" said Dr. Carman, a



former inspector of industrial plants for the state of Texas.



"People are hungry for the facts about their candidates. Before



they head to the polls, voters want to know the positions of Al



Gore and George Bush on clean water, clean air and protecting



our wilderness areas."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A national poll conducted for LCV by Peter D. Hart Research



Associates found that among Independent voters who believe clean



air and water is an important issue, support for Bush



disintegrates from 34 percent to 25 percent once they hear his



record on the environment, while support for Gore increases from



30 percent to 36 percent. In addition, support for Gore among



women voters increases from 48 percent to 52 percent when they



are told about his record, while Bush support drops from 35



percent to 32 percent. The poll was conducted from Sept.



13-17 and has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.5 percent.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The environment is at risk in this election and the stakes



are real," Callahan said. "For this reason, LCV and the Sierra



Club are working highlight the differences between the



environmental records of Al Gore and George Bush. Voters who



care about clean air and water and protecting their families



from pollution have a real choice on Election Day."

the national environmental community. LCV was the first



national conservation group to endorse Gore for president. For
