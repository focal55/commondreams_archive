- February 24 - Kerry Lobel, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, issued the following statement today in response to Senator John McCains endorsement of California's Proposition 22, also known as the Limit on Marriages Initiative:

<p>

"We are distressed that our lives as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered (GLBT) people are once again being used as fodder by a right-wing politician's campaign. John McCain calls himself a Reagan Republican. But it was Ronald Reagan who actively opposed the anti-gay and lesbian Briggs Initiative back in 1978. Real Reagan Republicans don't believe in government intrusion into our private lives.

<p>

"Proposition 22 is unfair, divisive and intrusive. It is unfair because it targets GLBT people for discrimination. It is divisive because it uses the wedge issue of marriage to polarize the people of California. It is intrusive because it injects government into the most private and personal decision any two people can make together. We call upon Senator McCain, as a so-called Reagan Republican, to reflect upon his endorsement. A real reformer would recognize the value of all families and fight to end discrimination."
