- May 26 - The following was released



today by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its own backyard, a state court has put an end to the bully



tactics of the biggest retailer in the world. Wal-Mart lost its bid



to suppress employees' basic workplace rights. Judge James Spears of



Fort Smith, Arkansas today dissolved a temporary restraining order



obtained by the giant retailer against the United Food and Commercial



Workers International Union (UFCW).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last fall, Wal-Mart used its size and influence to get its



hometown county judge to ban the distribution of workers' rights



information to Wal-Mart employees nationwide. The judge was



subsequently forced to recuse himself from the case after the UFCW



challenged his close financial ties to the company and exposed his



portfolio of more than a half a million dollars in Wal-Mart stock.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UFCW international organizers across the country had been banned



from distributing workers' rights information to Wal-Mart employees



by the order of this Benton County, Arkansas judge.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Judge Spears, sitting by designation in the Chancery Court of



Benton County, Arkansas dissolved the nationwide restraining order



after an hour-long hearing this morning.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A fair court has finally put a stop to Wal-Mart's heavy-handed



bully tactics and the irresponsible actions of Wal-Mart's hometown



judge. Wal-Mart may be a big company, but it doesn't own the American



legal system, it can't sidestep the law and it can't run rough- shod



over employees," said Mike Leonard, Director of the UFCW Strategic



Programs Department.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The giant retailer relied on the suspect actions of the county



court to prevent workers from receiving information about their



rights on the job. The state court affirmed today that in this



circumstance of this particular case, a county court ruling should



not extend beyond the state line.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to UFCW attorneys, Wal-Mart used the county court in



an attempt to sidestep federal law that guarantees the rights of



workers and the Bill of Rights that protects all citizens. During the



civil rights era of the 1950s and 60s, small town judges used the



same tactics to block actions to integrate public accommodations and



to register voters.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wal-Mart is the nation's largest private employer with 900,000



employees. Wages at Wal-Mart are from $2 to $3 below average for the



retail trades. Over 600,000 Wal-Mart workers are not covered under



the company health benefit plan.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The UFCW is the largest organization of retail workers in North



America, with 1.4 million members. Workers at retail food industry



leaders such as Kroger and Safeway are members of the UFCW.
