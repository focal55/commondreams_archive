<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- March 8 - On the day the President sent legislation to

Congress to cement Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status for

China, Senator Paul Wellstone greeted the move with a warning to his

Senate colleagues not to rush to judgment on a matter of such

importance. Wellstone sent a letter to his colleagues arguing that the

legislation granting PNTR for China is much too important to be rushed

through the Senate.  Wellstone cited a litany of concerns prompted by

the prospect of granting PNTR status for China including, Chinas

deteriorating record on human rights, a race to the bottom of labor

and environmental standards, recent statements made by the Chinese

government toward Taiwan, and an increase in our bilateral trade

deficit.  Proponents of granting China PNTR have suggested that a quick

debate and Senate vote early this spring in favor of PNTR could give the

legislation needed momentum going into a much tougher battle in the

House of Representatives.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This debate will bring to the fore the central issues of our role in

the global economy, said Wellstone.  It ought not be treated lightly.

There are a whole set of issues dealing with human rights and

environmental and labor standards that had, until the recent events in

Seattle, been off the radar screen in this country and the Congress.

People in the country have real worries that this deal may hurt them

more than it will help.  What Seattle showed was that there is

increasing concern in our country about the costs of globalization.

More people see the importance of maintaining basic labor and

environmental standards. For the U.S. Senate to give these topics short

shrift would be irresponsible.  These are the central economic issues of

our time and we ought to have a full debate.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The letter, sent today by Wellstone and Senator Ernest Hollings

(D-S.C.), notes a list of issues that raise troubling questions about

whether or not it is wise to grant PNTR status to China.  The letter

states the following concerns:

 The U.S. can obtain most, if not all, the benefits of Chinas WTO

accession without granting PNTR

 Chinas accession agreement will increase our bilateral trade deficit

 Chinas record on human rights has deteriorated

 Mainland China has made troubling threats against Taiwan

 Encouraging the export of more jobs to China would put downward

pressure on global labor and environmental standards.

 The confidential WTO accession agreement with China has not been

declassified and the public and news media have not had adequate

opportunity to examine it closely.
