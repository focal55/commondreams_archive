- March 3 - The Sierra Club demanded that "Republicans for Clean Air"

     withdraw their commercial running California, New York, and Ohio,

     because it includes factually incorrect information about George W.

     Bush's environmental record.  The Sierra Club also revealed that Sam

     Wyly, the funder of "Republicans for Clean Air," and his family have

     given hundreds of thousands of dollars to anti-environmental

     politicians who have voted to weaken the Clean Air Act.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These ads are polluting the airwaves with false information about

     George W. Bush's terrible environmental record," said Carl Pope,

     Sierra Club Executive Director.  "`Republicans for Clean Air' should

     pull these ads that paint a false picture of Gov. Bush's poor record

     governing the most polluted state in America."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The ad claims that "Bush clean air laws will reduce air pollution more

     than a quarter million tons a year."  In fact, the utility

     deregulation bill signed by Bush would require coal fired power plants

     to reduce their emissions by only 117,000 tons annually, which is less

     than half of the figure cited in the ad.  The ad optimistically

     assumes that the rest of these reductions will occur under Texas's

     voluntary pollution reduction program, which is unlikely because few

     plants are participating in it.  In other words, the ad's claim about

     pollution reductions is false.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     According to Federal Election Commission records, Sam Wyly, his

     brother, and other immediate family members have donated over $200,000

     to politicians who have voted to weaken the Clean Air Act, and who

     have an average pro-environment voting record of 8% (according to the

     nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters).  (See attached list)  Many

     of these politicians voted against the environment every time in 1999,

     including Reps. J.C. Watts and Joe Barton, and Sens. William Frist,

     Don Nickles, Rick Santorum and Kay Bailey Hutchinson.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This group should be called `Republicans for Dirty Air,'" said Daniel

     J. Weiss, Sierra Club Political Director. "There are much better ways

     to clean the air than contributing to enemies of the environment and

     running false ads."<br>

<br>

All of these Senators &amp; Representatives have voted to weaken the Clean

     Air Act. This means they have voted for H.R. 2099 in 1995 or

     cosponsored H.R. 1984, the Klink Bill, in the 105th Congress-- see

     1995 &amp; 1997 League of Conservation Voters Scorecards.
