- July 14 - U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone today strongly called on

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to move swiftly to investigate the

reported murder and disappearance of  71 civilians in February in El Salado and

six civilians this past weekend in La Union, Colombia., and see to it that those

involved in these atrocities are brought to justice.  According to an article in

today’s New York Times, on February 17th  a paramilitary group killed 36 people

in El Salado, sixteen of which were executed in the town's basketball court.

Another 18 were killed in the surrounding countryside, and 17 are still missing.

Both massacres were allegedly committed by paramilitary groups in collaboration

with members of the Colombian Armed Forces.  Yesterday, President Clinton signed

a bill that will provide hundred of millions of dollars in military assistance

to the Colombian government to support its counter narcotics efforts.



<p>In his letter to Albright today, Wellstone wrote:

“During the debate surrounding Plan Colombia, the Administration and the

Colombian government pledged to work to reduce the production and supply of

cocaine while protecting human rights.  The continuing reports of human rights

abuses in Colombia confirm our grave reservations regarding the Administration’s

ability to effectively manage the use of the resources that will be provided

while protecting the human rights of Colombian citizens.”                       

    

<p>During the debate in Congress over Plan Colombia, Wellstone and others objected

to the plan’s military component, the “Push into Southern Colombia,” given the

detailed and abundant evidence of continuing close ties between the Colombian

Army and paramilitary groups responsible for gross human rights violations. The

final package was conditioned on the Administration and the Colombian government

ensuring that ties between the Armed Forces and paramilitaries are severed, and

that Colombian Armed Forces personnel who are credibly alleged to have committed

gross human rights violations are held accountable.



<p>Wellstone put the following questions to Secretary Albright:

<p>“1) How will the Administration ensure a vetting process guaranteeing that

Colombians indirectly facilitating human rights violations, as well as those

accused of direct violations, will not serve in battalions being trained by the

United States military?



<p>2) What will the Administration do to ensure that the alleged murders and human

rights abuses in El Salado are investigated, and that those responsible are

prosecuted?



<p>3) How will the Administration address  the needs of the victims at El Salado,

including the nearly 3,000 residents displaced by the incident?” 



<p>While the evidence in this case strongly indicates the link between the armed

forces and the paramilitaries in the massacre at  El Salado, it clearly confirms

a negligence of the duty of the Colombian military and police to protect the

civilian population. Similarly, on July 8, helicopters and soldiers from the

Colombian 17th Army Brigade appear to have facilitated killings of six men by a

paramilitary unit in La Union. 



<p>“We are very concerned about the credibility of the vetting process used to

insure that Colombian soldiers accused of human rights violations will not serve

in the battalions scheduled to receive training from the United States military.

It is our understanding that the vetting process checks only for those

accusations of direct involvement in human rights violations and does not

consider the fact that soldiers may indirectly facilitate abuses. This is

reported to have been the case in El Salado,” Wellstone wrote.



cIn June, Wellstone  blasted the Clinton Administration’s “Push into Southern

Columbia” military plan during Senate debate, and offered an amendment to the

Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill that sought to transfer $225 million from

aid earmarked for the Columbian military into U.S. domestic drug treatment

programs.  The Wellstone amendment failed by a vote of 89-11following an

intensive lobbying effort against it by the Administration.
