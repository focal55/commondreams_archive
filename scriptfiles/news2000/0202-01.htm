- February 2 - The voters in New Hampshire yesterday dramatically demonstrated 

        that the issue of special-interest money in politics matters with voters 

        and will be a pivotal issue in campaign 2000.      

<p align="left">According to a Washington Post poll, for supporters of Senator 

        John McCain, campaign finance reform was the &quot;most important issue 

        in deciding whom to support.&quot; A New York Times poll found that those 

        voting for McCain said that his stand on campaign finance reform mattered 

        more to them than Social Security/Medicare, education, taxes and abortion. 

        More than eight out of 10 voters who supported McCain ranked campaign 

        finance reform as the most important issue. And on the Democratic side, 

        in the close race between Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill 

        Bradley, campaign finance reform was a key issue where both candidates 

        competed to show their credentials on the issue. </p>

      <p align="left">New Hampshire showed us that if candidates talk about reform, 

        voters will respond. But ultimately, voters bear their share of responsibility 

        for making this happen. Citizens have to demand that the candidates take 

        a stand on reform, and citizens have to realize - despite what entrenched 

        special-interests want them to believe - that their voices do count, and 

        that their votes truly matter.<br>
