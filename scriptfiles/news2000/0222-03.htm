Action and the National Priorities Project (NPP) announced the



release of NPP's State of California 2000.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The State of California 2000 is part of a nationwide release,



which includes individualized reports for all 50 states. The



national State of the States 2000 report will be released in



mid-March.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report measures how the people of California are faring in



five areas: economic security, education, the environment, health



care and housing. It tracks the changes in need and federal



expeditures in these areas over a 20-year period and juxtaposes this



analysis with a critique of excessive federal spending on the



Pentagon.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In California, the level of need exceeds the level of federal



spending committed to meet it, according to the National Priorities



Project. For exaxple, 2.2 million California children lived in



poverty in 1998, up from 947,000 in 1980. At the same time, the



federal Head Start program receives funds sufficient to serve only



one-third of the children eligible in California.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also gives information specific to local cities



ranging from San Diego to San Francisco. It points out that while the



child poverty rate for California as a whole is 23.6 percent the rate



for Los Angeles is 33.7 percent. Other reported facts about



California include:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 87 percent of schools are in need of significant repair;<br>

-- 7.4 million had no health insurance in 1998, up from



4.7 million in 1987;

<br>

-- 1 million California residents drink polluted water.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A proposed six year, $100 billion increase in Pentagon spending



will take more money from California programs, according to the



report. The increase would include the purchase of the F-22 fighter



jet program and more nuclear submarines. According to Lawrence Korb,



former assistant secretary of defense under the Reagan



administration, these weapons systems are designed to fight a war



with a kind of technologically advanced enemy that does not exist.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's easy for candidates to say they're committed to



education,," said Danielle Babineau, California Peace Action's



Southern California political director. "But the fact is, if you're



committed to education, health care, housing or the environment, then



you cannot continue throwing our tax dollars at unnecessary weapons



programs. This is what we mean when we ask elected officials'What are



your priorities?"

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Priorities Project is a privately funded, research



and education organization that offers citizens and community groups



tools and resources to shape federal budget priorities which promote



social and economic justice. For more information about NPP, visit



our website at <a href="http://www.natprior.org">www.natprior.org</a>.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">California Peace Action is the state affiliate of a nationwide



grassroots citizens' lobby that works to abolish nuclear weapons,



stop US weapons sales to dictators and end wasteful miltiary



spending. Previously known as SANE/Freeze, the organization has a



statewide membership of 33,000 and offices throughout California.
