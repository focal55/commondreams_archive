- April 27 - The Humane Society of the



United States (HSUS) with more than 7.3 million members and



constituents, commends U.S. Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt and



the National Park Service for the decision announced today to ban the



recreational use of snowmobiles in national parks.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The national parks are too valuable to all Americans and to the



wild creatures that inhabit them to allow them to be despoiled and



degraded by the clamor and fumes of hordes of snowmobiles," said Paul



G. Irwin, HSUS President and CEO. "We thank Secretary Babbitt and the



National Park Service for their courageous and far-sighted decision



and know that the parks will greatly benefit from this action."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The harmful impacts of smowmobiles on wildlife, air quality and



the experience of park visitors are so well-demonstrated and so



serious, that the prohibition is more than justifiable. In



Yellowstone National Park alone, it is reported that the number of



annual snowmobilers has risen dramatically from about 27,327 in the



late 1970's to 78,765 in 1998 (source: The Citizens' Solution for



Winter Access to Yellowstone). Inefficient 2-stroke engines on



snowmobiles emit air pollutants at levels so high that they would be



unhealthy and unacceptable even in the downtown areas of major



cities, much less be tolerated in national parks.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The HSUS believes that if the National Park Service is to fulfil



its legal mandate to "conserve the scenery and the natural and



historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the



enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave

them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations," then no



other course of action is possible.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The decision to ban recreational use of snowmobiles is critical



toward protecting the natural environments of our national parks,"



said Dr. John Grandy, HSUS Senior Vice President of Wildlife



Programs. "Without the noise and pollutants from the vehicles,



wildlife can live in peace and visitors can enjoy the parks as they



were meant to be experienced."</font>
