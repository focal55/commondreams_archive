- July 20 - The planned July 22 flight test by the Army and the Ballistic Missile

Defense Organization (BMDO) of the mobile Theatre Missile Defense (TMD)

system at White Sands, N.M. is another step toward creating regional

instability in Asia.  The Global Network Against Weapons & Nuclear Power in

Space is calling for a cancellation of the entire TMD system.



<p>The Army's Patriot PAC-3 system is intended to intercept short- and medium-

range "theatre" missiles.



<p>The BMDO is now working on three separate TMD programs.  The Air Force is

developing the Airborne Laser while the Navy is seeking to deploy a

ship-based system.  According to Global Network Coordinator Bruce Gagnon,

"The Army's land-based, mobile system now being tested at White Sands, would

complete the so-called triad that would be forward deployed in Asia

effectively boxing in China.  Recent statements by China indicate that they

see the TMD system as an attempt by the U.S. to spur an arms race in their

region that they will be forced to match.  Now is the time to negotiate a

global ban on all ballistic missile defense and space-based weapons

systems."



<p>China and Russia have requested such negotiations at the United Nations but

the U.S. has refused stating that there is no problem to negotiate about.



<p>The U.S. has recently expanded arms sales in the region to both South Korea

and Taiwan.



<p>The Army's land-based mobile TMD system would likely be deployed in South

Korea.  The Navy TMD system would be based on U.S. Aegis destroyers now

homeported in Japan.



<p>Just as NATO  has grown in order to virtually surround Russia, the U.S. is

now moving to dramatically expand its military presence in the Pacific

Ocean.  "Viewing China as a certain economic competitor in the years to

come, the U.S. intends to use TMD deployments as a checkmate to 'control and

dominate' China," Gagnon said.



<p>Key proponents of the TMD system are now strongly promoting deployment of

the system as the "first choice" in ballistic missile defense because it

would allow for simpler circumvention of the ABM Treaty and make it easier

to mollify European opposition to NMD.
