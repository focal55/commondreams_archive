- July 19 - The US Attorney’s Office and EPA’s Criminal Investigation Division have launched an investigation of Royal Caribbean Cruises for evidence brought to them by the environmental group Bluewater Network. A special agent from San Francisco EPA’s Office of Criminal Enforcement contacted Bluewater Network earlier this month upon hearing that the group had notified the company of intent to sue for illegally dumping pollutants into San Francisco Bay by its cruise ship Mercury. Bluewater shared its evidence with officials, leading EPA and the US Attorney’s Office to open an investigation. “The cruise ship industry claims they never dump in California waters; this is obviously a farce, since they’ve once again been caught red-handed. We’re thrilled that EPA and the US Attorney have stepped in to investigate this crime,” said Kira Schmidt, Director of Bluewater Network’s Cruise Ship Campaign. “Over 100 cases have been brought against cruise ships for illegal dumping; how much more taxpayer money will be wasted before they get the message that pollution cannot continue to be business as usual?”



<p>The dumping was witnessed on the morning of September 21, 1999 when the Mercury was disembarking its passengers after an 11-day Alaska voyage. The ship was docked at San Francisco’s Pier 35. The witnesses, passengers on the ship, were on their verandah watching a family of sea lions playing nearby when they smelled a very strong, noxious chemical odor emanating from below. They looked down at the water and saw the source of the odor -- a white, frothy liquid being discharged from the ship, accompanied by the unmistakable rainbow sheen of an oil slick. The discharge continued for some 30 minutes or more, and was so caustic that the sea lions left the area at once as it spread out. The couple said they believed they recognized the chemical odor as that of perchloroethylene, or “PERC,” the acutely hazardous chemical used by the ship’s onboard dry cleaning facility. The eyewitnesses, a couple from Las Vegas, brought their account to Bluewater Network’s attention after being given the run-around by EPA in their repeated attempts to report the incident. 



<p>Bluewater Network, with counsel Michael Lozeau of the Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, sent a notice of violations of the Clean Water Act and intent to sue to Royal Caribbean on June 30, 2000. Royal Caribbean’s lawyers and executives have requested a meeting with Bluewater. 



<p>Last July, in a criminal case brought by the US Department of Justice, Royal Caribbean pled guilty to 21 felonies, six of which were for illegal discharge of PERC into several US ports. The other felonies concerned routine illegal dumping of oil and the falsification of documents to cover it up. The company paid a record $18 million in fines and promised this would never happen again.



<p>The exposure of this incident comes at a particularly inopportune time for the cruise industry, which in recent weeks has been claiming that it no longer dumps any waste in California waters and hasn’t for more than a year. This is the cornerstone of the cruise industry’s frenetic lobbying efforts to defeat a California bill which would enable greater oversight of the massive amounts of waste cruise ships generate. The bill, AB 2746 (Nakano), is sponsored by Bluewater Network in an effort to make the cruise industry more accountable for its wastes. “We hope this will serve as a wake up call to legislators of the need to tighten the reins on cruise ship pollution, and to the cruise industry that they cannot continue to unabashedly pollute the seas,” said Schmidt.
