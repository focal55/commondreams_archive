- July 17 - A new report by the environmental organization 

Bluewater Network concludes that large ships are the dirtiest 

transportation source, causing smog and sulfur emissions across the world's 

most heavily plied ocean shipping routes as well as in major port areas 

such as Los Angeles, San Diego, Baltimore, Port Arthur, and New York. The 

report entitled, "A Stacked Deck: Air Pollution from Ships," (available 

online at <a href="http://www.bluewaternetwork.org">http://www.bluewaternetwork.org</a>) concludes that ship emissions 

significantly threaten the health of people living in major port areas, and 

cause climate changes across the world's oceans due to their very dirty fuels.



<p>Large vessels employ fuels considered to be the dirtiest available, with 

sulfur levels up to 5,000 times higher than diesel trucks or buses, which 

contributes to very high levels of sulfur over the world's oceans. A 

Carnegie Mellon study recently concluded that this is causing climate 

changes due to ship exhaust's effect upon cloud formation, possibly masking 

human-caused global warming. The report concludes that ships also cause 

considerable smog-forming emissions from their oversized engines across 

ocean routes and in port areas.



<p>The Environmental Protection Agency, concerned that regulating ship fuels 

would cause ships to fuel in other countries such as Canada or Mexico, has 

decided to let the International Maritime Organization, an organ of the 

United Nations, take control of pollution from ships in a treaty known as 

MARPOL Annex IV. However, as Bluewater Network made clear to EPA before the 

rule was finalized, Annex V -- which is so weak it would still allow ship 

emissions to grow by 13 percent by 2030 -- is not an enforceable agreement 

and is unlikely to be anytime soon. The agreement will only go into effect 

when countries responsible for at least 50 percent of the world's shipping 

traffic ratify the treaty. So far only two nations have done so, 

representing only 5 percent of world shipping. Without the treaty being 

signed, emissions will grow by 35 percent by 2030.



<p>"A single container ship belches more pollution than 2,000 diesel trucks. 

With the explosion in global trade, 95 percent of which occurs in ships, 

oceans are beginning to look like freeways," said Russell Long, Executive 

Director of Bluewater Network. "It's outrageous that the EPA regulates all 

other transportation sources but is stacking the deck for ships."



<p>A lawsuit was filed in the US Circuit Court February 24, and an initial 

brief was filed today seeking to compel the Environmental Protection Agency 

to create strong emission standards for large sea-going vessels that impose 

a significant smog burden on US port cities. According to EPA, those 

vessels belch 273 thousand tons per year  748 tons each day  of nitrogen 

oxides (NOx) into U.S. air, and are one of the largest sources of 

particulate matter emissions in port cities. The lawsuit, filed by 

Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund on behalf of the Bluewater Network, 

challenges EPA's failure to set any standard for NOx emissions.



<p>"EPA's refusal to regulate emissions from these ships is not only 

illegal, it places an unnecessary obstacle in the way of efforts to improve 

U.S. air quality," said Martin Wagner, attorney for Earthjustice Legal 

Defense Fund.
