- April 3 - The Marianas Audubon Society and Center for Biological 

Diversity, represented by Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, filed suit in 

federal district court today against Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of the 

Interior, and Jamie Rappaport Clark, Director of the United States Fish and 

Wildlife Service (Service), for failing to designate critical habitat, as 

required by the federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), for seven 

endangered species from Guam.  The seven Guam species are the Mariana crow 

(Corvus kubaryi), Guam rail (Rallus owstoni), Guam Micronesian kingfisher 

(Halcyon cinnamomina cinnamomina), Guam broadbill (Myiagra freycineti), 

Guam bridled white-eye (Zosterops conspicillata conspicillata), Mariana 

fruit bat (Pteropus mariannus), and little Mariana fruit bat (Pteropus 

tokudae).



<p>The Service listed all seven Guam species as endangered in 1984, and their 

continued survival remains in doubt, due largely to predation by the 

introduced brown tree snake and continued fragmentation and destruction of 

their native habitat.  While all seven species were once common throughout 

Guam, only two -- the Mariana crow (“åga” in Chamoru) and Mariana fruit bat 

(fanihi) -- are now known to occur naturally in the wild on Guam and are 

restricted to a few distinct forested areas.  Captive breeding programs 

have allowed the Guam rail (ko’ko’) and the Guam Micronesian kingfisher 

(sihek) to avoid extinction.  As part of these efforts, the Guam rail has 

recently been reintroduced to native forest habitat in the northern part of 

Guam.



<p>“Now that we are starting to get a handle on how to control the brown tree 

snake, protecting native habitat becomes all the more important,” said 

Gretchen Grimm, president of the Marianas Audubon Society.  “If we do not 

protect essential areas through critical habitat designation, wild and 

reintroduced populations of Guam’s endangered animals will not have any 

place to live, and the only place we will be able to see these unique parts 

of Guam’s natural heritage is in the zoo.”



         

<p>“Critical habitat” consists of those areas that must be managed to 

permit an endangered species to recover to the level where it is safe, in 

the foreseeable future, from the danger of extinction.  Under the ESA, 

federal agencies may not carry out, fund, or approve any actions that 

result in destroying or adversely modifying critical habitat.  Since the 

restrictions associated with critical habitat designation are directed 

solely at federal agency actions, designation generally has little direct 

effect on private landowners.  However, designating critical habitat also 

performs an important educational role, informing the public as well as 

local governments about areas essential to the conservation of imperiled 

plants and animals.



<p>“Some on Guam have raised concerns that designating critical habitat would 

prevent the Navy or Air Force from returning “excess” military lands to the 

Government of Guam or to local families, but that’s simply not true,” said 

David Henkin, attorney with Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund.  “Designating 

critical habitat has nothing to do with who owns the land.  It simply 

ensures that any federal action -- whether it involves a land transfer, 

road construction, or military training -- will not result in adverse 

modification or destruction of habitat that Guam’s endangered species need 

to survive and, eventually, to recover.”



         

<p>The Guam species face threats from a variety of federal actions, 

including military training exercises; the clearing and fragmentation of 

forest habitat for roads, warehouses or other construction projects; the 

construction of resorts, golf courses, and other recreational facilities 

where federal permits are required; and the release or exchange of excess 

military property without adequate assurances for habitat protection.



         

<p>“Without critical habitat, we risk losing these magnificent 

species forever,” said Peter Galvin, conservation biologist for the Center 

for Biological Diversity.  “We have an obligation to protect this essential 

habitat, so that future generations will have the chance to study and enjoy 

these unique animals in the wild, not just in picture books.”

<p>The Marianas Audubon Society is a chartered chapter of the 

National Audubon Society organized in 1983 and is dedicated to preserving 

the Mariana Islands’ unique wildlife, plants, and culture.



         

<p>The Center for Biological Diversity is a science-based 

environmental advocacy organization founded in 1989 with more than 5000 

members nationwide.  It is currently working to protect biological 

diversity and habitat in the western United States, northern Mexico, and 

the Pacific.



         

<p>Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund (formerly Sierra Club Legal 

Defense Fund) is a non-profit, public interest, environmental law 

firm.  Earthjustice’s Mid-Pacific office opened in Honolulu, Hawai`i in 

1988 and has represented dozens of environmental, native Hawaiian, and 

community organizations in litigation and administrative proceedings.
