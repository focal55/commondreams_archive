- June 5 - Physicians for Social



Responsibility (PSR) today expressed deep disappointment at the lack



of progress towards disarmament at the U.S.-Russia Summit in Moscow.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Presidents Clinton and Putin had a great chance at this meeting



to negotiate deep cuts in nuclear weapons," said Anne Gallivan,



"They've blown that chance."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The two Presidents have agreed on two limited accords, one for the



removal of 64 tons of weapons plutonium from stockpiles, and the



second for the opening of a joint early warning center in Moscow to



monitor global missile launches. These are necessary steps, but not



new.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The early warning center was agreed in principle at the



Clinton-Yeltsin Summit in Helsinki in 1997, and was originally due

to



be open by early 1999. The enter will help cover gaps in the decaying



Russian early warning capability by monitoring global missile

launches. However, this stop-gap solution is far less effective than



simply removing all missiles from their current, highly dangerous



status of hair-trigger alert.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If the U.S. and Russia could simply agree to back away from the



brink of nuclear disaster, reducing the alert status of their



missiles and thereby the risk of accidental nuclear war, this new



center would be irrelevant," said Kimberly Roberts, PSR program



associate.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The agreement to remove plutonium from the stockpiles is a welcome



move, but does little more than confirm implementation of previous



policies. Furthermore, if the plutonium is to be converted into Mixed



Oxide (MOX) fuel for nuclear reactors, it may contribute to



proliferation danger by spreading plutonium around the globe -- even



in this adulterated form it could potentially be used for a crude



nuclear weapon.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At this Summit, the two Presidents completely ignored the agenda



for progress in disarmament set forward at the Non-Proliferation



Treaty Review Conference on May 19. Both the U.S. and Russia agreed



there to undertake measures including:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Early entry into force and implementation of START II

<br>

-- Negotiation of START III

<br>

-- Strengthening the ABM Treaty

<br>

-- Early Entry into Force and Implementation of the Comprehensive



Test Ban Treaty

<br>

-- Concrete measures for reducing alert status of nuclear forces

<br>

-- Increased transparency by nuclear states

<br>

-- Unilateral nuclear cuts to complement treaty cuts

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is deeply disappointing that a comprehensive disarmament



agenda, agreed to by 187 nations including the U.S. and Russia only



three weeks ago, has been swept under the rug, "said Dr. Peter Wilk,



president of PSR. "The world expected the two Presidents to do their



duty to make the world safer, and instead they chose to eat a nice



dinner and ignore the risks of nuclear war."</font>
