<p>As Oil Giant Forced to Sell Alaskan Assets, Greenpeace Warns BP Amoco Still Wields Too Much Power</p>

- March 16 - Greenpeace warned today that despite 

BP Amoco's forced sale of ARCO's Alaskan assets, the multinational oil giant 

is still 'directing' Alaskan oil policy to the detriment of the environment and the public. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The sale of Arco's Alaskan assets to Philips Petroleum was announced earlier 

today in a joint BP Amoco - ARCO press conference in order to meet Federal Trade 

Commission requirements before the merger would be allowed to proceed.  

The FTC opposed the merger on the grounds that BP Amoco already wields excessive 

market power in Alaskan oil exploration and production. 

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This market power means political power in Alaska and all the way to Washington 

DC. BP Amoco still controls over half of Alaskan North Slope oil production and 

will continue to call the shots," said Iain MacGill, energy policy analyst for 

Greenpeace.  "The Alaskan oil industry may have a new name but it's still the 

same dirty game." 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The intense lobbying of Governor Tony Knowles and the State's Congressional 

legislators in support of the merger has highlighted BP Amoco's Alaskan power 

base. At the national level, Senator Frank Murkowski's has introduced a bill 

this month that would open the National Arctic Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. 

BP Amoco, the major beneficiary, has been lobbying for such a move for years. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The undue influence of BP Amoco in Alaska is also evident in the company's 

effort to thwart Greenpeace's campaigns against the company's Northstar 

offshore oil project now under construction in the Arctic Ocean.  The project 

uses untested and untried pipeline technology, which the Army Corp of 

Engineers estimates will expose the fragile Arctic environment to a one in 

four chance of a major oil spill.  BP Amoco recently failed a spill clean up 

test; nevertheless, the project has been permitted to proceed. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

And late last week at the Northstar site, three Greenpeace activists holding a 

banner reading "Global Warming Starts Here" and standing peacefully outside the 

"No Trespassing Zone" were arrested by Alaska State Troopers who traveled to the 

scene in a BP Amoco bus and departed on a BP Amoco jet shortly afterwards.  

The activists, who were part of a renewable energy camp the international 

environmental organization has set up next to the Northstar site, were arrested 

just before a contingent of journalists arrived on the scene.</font>
