- February 14 - Environmental and agribusiness groups today joined together to praise Frito-Lays

decision to discontinue using genetically modified corn in their products.  The

Sierra Club and the American Corn Growers Association jointly applauded

Frito-Lay's recognition of consumers' concern for the health and environmental

impacts of genetically modified food.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Many people have doubts about the safety of genetically modified corn for their

health and the environment," said Laurel Hopwood, Chair of the Sierra Club's

Biotechnology Task Force.  "We applaud Frito Lay for its decision to respond to

consumers' concerns."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Farmers must grow what their customers demand," noted Gary Goldberg, Chief

Executive Officer of the American Corn Growers Association. "If we don't,

farmers will lose even more than the $200 million in lost corn export sales in

1999.  If the customer wants food that has not been genetically modified, then

it is the responsibility of the American farmer to provide that product."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ms. Hopwood also cited the recent studies on Monarch Butterflies and the

persistence of toxins produced from genetically modified corn that stay in the

soil.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We're also gravely concerned about how Bt corn  and other genetically modified

crops impact the environment. No one should give this technology a green light

when it kills unintended insects and beneficial microorganisms

indiscriminately."  Adding her support for organic farming, she adds, "Pollen

carrying genetically modified traits is already contaminating crops grown

organically."



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club supports a moratorium on further use of genetically modified

products until extensive, rigorous research is done which addresses the

long-term impacts.  The Sierra Club also supports proper labeling of genetically

modified products.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The real issue is the consumer's right to exercise caution in selecting food

products," added Hopwood.  "Without a label alerting the consumer to the

presence of genetically-modified corn in Frito-Lay's products, concerned

citizens were forced to go elsewhere.  Now, with this courageous decision,

Frito-Lay has taken the initial steps to reassure the public that their products

are free of uncertain health and environmental threats."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club is the nation's largest grassroots environmental organization,

with more than 550,000 members.
