<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN FRANCISCO 

- February 10 - After having been sued repeatedly by numerous 

environmental and fishing groups, the National Marine Fisheries Service 

moved Monday to protect thousands of square miles of western freshwater 

streams used by salmon and steelhead for spawning and rearing. The critical 

habitat designation, finalized on Monday, February 7, 2000, includes the 

reaches of all streams currently occupied by or accessible to salmon and 

steelhead in Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and California, and also includes 

lands adjacent to the streams necessary to control erosion and sediment 

deposition, ensure bank stability, and provide woody debris. In California, 

the designation covers much of the California coast, the San Francisco 

Bay-Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta, and the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers 

and their tributaries.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The designation is the culmination of years of litigation brought by 

Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund against NMFS first to compel the agency to 

list declining populations of west coast salmon and steelhead under the 

Endangered Species Act, and then to designate their critical habitat.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Critical habitat designation adds another layer of legal protection to 

these imperiled salmon and steelhead runs: Federal agencies must now 

"insure" not only that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by the 

agency does not "jeopardize the continued existence" of the fish, but also 

that such action will not result in the "destruction or adverse 

modification" of the designated critical habitat. Before taking any action 

that could either jeopardize salmon or steelhead or result in the 

destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat, federal 

agencies must first consult with NMFS.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We applaud NMFS for finally taking this action," said Earthjustice staff 

attorney Mike Sherwood, who represented many of the environmental and 

fishing groups in several lawsuits against NMFS. "It's a shame that we had 

to sue NMFS to get to this point, wasting time and resources that should 

have been used for salmon and steelhead recovery. But better late than 

never, and we hope NMFS will now aggressively take the steps necessary to 

recover these magnificent species."  Sherwood noted, however, that the 

critical habitat designations do not go far enough because they omit 

portions of streams upstream from dams that block upstream migration, and 

also omit entirely the ocean habitat of these anadromous fish where they 

spend their adult lives. "There is more work to be done," said Sherwood. 

"We hope that NMFS will fill in the gaps and that further litigation will 

not be necessary."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most west coast populations of steelhead (an anadromous form of rainbow 

trout) and coho, chinook, chum, and sockeye salmon have declined 

precipitously in the last decade largely because of the destruction and 

loss of their freshwater spawning and rearing habitat due to human 

activities such as the building of dams and water diversions for irrigated 

agriculture, grazing, and logging activities within the watersheds, and 

water pollution. The new critical habitat designation will require a hard, 

new look at those activities on federal lands with an eye to salmon and 

steelhead survival and recovery.
