- July 17 - For the first quarter of



this year, the nation's public transportation systems have recorded

a



4.8 increase in ridership over the same period in 1999, according to



the American Public Transportation Association's (APTA) newly



released 2000 transit ridership quarterly report.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The continuing increase in ridership builds on last year's



year-end total of more than 9 billion trips, the highest peak in



annual ridership since 1960. Total ridership in 1999 was 4.5 percent



higher than in the previous year. This year's Leap Day, February 29,



accounted for 1.4 percent of the total quarterly increase.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The positive trend continues. The strong economy and the public



transportation industry's ongoing efforts to listen to our customers



and invest in new services have helped keep ridership growing," said



William W. Millar, president of the American Public Transportation



Association (APTA).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The increase was broad-based, with every mode of transportation



and every population group showing a positive trend. Among the



transit modes, bus systems serving populations from 50,000 to 100,000



in population showed the largest increase with 12.1 percent, followed



by rail transit systems with 7.4 percent; bus systems serving areas



from 250,000 to 500,000 in population at 6.6 percent; 5.5 percent for



trolley bus systems; 5.4 percent for commuter rail, and 4.8 percent



for light rail.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seen throughout the U.S., first quarter growth continues to cut



across small towns, suburban regions, and large cities. Smaller bus



systems with quarterly increases exceeding 10 percent included: Fort



Myers, FL (20.4 percent), Grand Rapids, MI (11.5 percent), Phoenix,



AZ (10.6 percent) and Salt Lake City, UT (20.9 percent).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority,



which opened a major extension of its Metro Red Line subway during



the quarter, led the heavy rail sector with a 62.3 percent jump in



ridership. Other heavy rail systems showing increases included the



San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, 15.6 percent; MTA New



York City Transit, 8.8 percent; the Washington Metropolitan Area



Transit Authority (WMATA), 8.5 percent; Philadelphia's Southeastern



Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, 7.5 percent; and the Chicago



Transit Authority, 7.2 percent.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among bus systems serving populations of more than one million,



WMATA in Washington, D.C., 13 percent; MTA New York City Transit,



6.8 percent; and Tri-Met in Portland, OR, (6.5 percent) also



accounted for significant gains in ridership.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Altamont Commuter Express in San Jose, CA showed a 50 percent



ridership increase during the first quarter, the highest among



commuter rail systems. Other leaders in the sector were Virginia



Railway Express (20.4 percent), CALTRAIN in San Francisco-San Jose

CA



(18.1 percent), and Dallas (15.5 percent).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leaders in the light rail sector included San Diego Trolley



(33.5 percent), Memphis (29.9 percent), Santa Clara VTA in San



Jose CA (23.9 percent), and Denver's Regional Transportation



District (19.1 percent).
