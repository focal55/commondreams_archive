<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Hagel Campaign Finance Bill:

<br>

An Illusionary Reform

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By Fred Wertheimer

<br>

President, Democracy 21

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In October 1999, Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) introduced a campaign



finance bill that he offered as a potential compromise-alternative



to the McCain-Feingold soft money ban.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When Sen. Hagel introduced his legislation, Senator Mitch



McConnell (R-KY), the Senate's leading opponent of campaign finance



reform, commented favorably on the bill, saying, "This is our best



hope for a thoughtful, constructive debate." The Hagel bill, he



also said, represented a "responsible middle ground."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. McConnell who chairs the Senate Rules Committee, is



scheduled to begin a series of hearings this week on the Hagel



bill, and is expected to have the Committee mark up the legislation



in mid-May.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Hagel bill is completely illusionary reform.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In real terms, the Hagel bill would not prevent any unlimited



soft money contributions from being raised by federal candidates



and spent through their political parties to benefit their



campaigns.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same time the Hagel bill would triple all the hard money



limits on individual contributions -- including the overall



aggregate limit on what an individual can give to all federal



candidates and their political parties in a calendar year.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hard money limits apply to funds raised by federal candidates



and their political parties that are spent on influencing federal



elections. Soft money is raised outside federal contribution limits



and is spent by the political parties ostensibly on "party



building" activities.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In reality, however, soft money is simply a means for evading



the hard money limits. Soft money is raised by federal candidates



and spent by their parties, like hard money, to help elect federal



candidates.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the McCain-Feingold bill, there are three essential



components in establishing an effective soft money ban:



&nbsp;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- National parties are banned from accepting, soliciting,



directing, or spending soft money.



-- State parties are prohibited from spending soft money to



influence federal elections, such as by paying for so-called "issue



ads" that in reality promote or attack a federal candidate.



-- Federal officeholders and candidates are prohibited from



raising or directing soft money contributions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These provisions combine to ensure that national parties,



federal officeholders and federal candidates stop dealing with soft



money, and that state parties stop serving as vehicles for



laundering soft money into federal races.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Hagel bill purports to establish a so-called "cap" or limit



on soft money contributions. But the "cap" applies only to



contributions to national parties, and the other two essential



elements of a soft money ban found in the McCain bill are totally



absent.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a result, the Hagel bill won't stop unlimited soft money



contributions from being raised and spent to support federal



candidates. Under the Hagel bill:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Individuals, PACs, corporations, and labor unions are allowed



to make soft money contributions to national parties of $60,000 per



year, or $120,000 per election cycle.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even under these so-called "limits," huge soft money



contributions will continue to be made to national parties. A



corporation and its PAC, for example, could contribute a combined



total of $120,000 in soft money per year or $240,000 per election



cycle. A labor union and its PAC could do the same. A corporate



CEO, his corporation, and the corporation's PAC could contibute a



combined total of $180,000 in soft money per year or $360,000 per



election cycle.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- There are no restrictions on federal officeholders and



candidates raising unlimited soft money contributions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And, there are no restrictions to prevent state parties from



being used as a vehicle to spend soft money to support federal



candidates -- such as by spending soft money on so-called "issue



ads" that promote and attack federal candidates. (Most soft money



spent to help federal candidates today is already being spent



through state parties.)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The absence of these key restrictions means that regardless of



the unacceptable soft money "caps" provided in the Hagel bill, the



legislation will have no real effect in stopping the flow of



unlimited soft money contributions to help federal candidates.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Federal officeholders and candidates will continue to raise



unlimited soft money contributions from donors, as they do now. And



it is this direct relationship between federal officeholders and



candidates, and the donors of huge unlimited contributions intended



to help them, that is the fundamental "corruption" danger involved



here.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead of having these contributions given to their national



parties, however, and then transferred to state parties to be spent



on "issue ads," federal officeholders or candidates, under the



Hagel bill, will simply have the contributions given directly to



the state parties to be spent on these ads.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nothing will change.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All that will happen under the Hagel approach is that a



mechanical modification will be made. The current middleman in this



operation -- the national parties -- will be dropped, but the



corrupting unlimited soft money scheme will continue unabated.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following two examples of current activities show just how



easily this adjustment will be made.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In late 1999, Governor George W. Bush's campaign set up a



joint fundraising committee with 20 Republican state parties to



raise hard money for the state parties to use in the 2000 federal



elections.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the Hagel bill were law, all the Bush campaign would have to



do is establish a similar joint fundraising committee with



Republican state parties to raise soft money.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush and his "Pioneer" fundraisers would raise unlimited soft



money contributions for this joint fundraising committee, which



would then transfer the funds to the state parties to be spent on



ads promoting Bush and attacking his opponent. (As noted earlier,



most soft money being spent today to help federal candidates is



already being spent by state parties. The soft money



is transferred to the state parties by the national parties.)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vice President Gore, of course, could do the same thing.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Hagel bill would not cover or prevent any of this.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In 1999, First Lady Hillary Clinton's campaign set up a joint



fundraising committee with the national party's Democratic Senate



Campaign Committee (DSCC) to raise unlimited soft money



contributions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The joint committee -- called New York Senate 2000 -- then



transferred the soft money funds to the DSCC, which transferred the



money to the New York Democratic state party. The state party then



spent the soft money on ads promoting Hillary Clinton.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the Hagel bill, all you would have to do is eliminate the



DSCC from the process. Hillary Clinton would continue raising the



same unlimited soft money contributions that she is raising now.



The funds would go to a joint fundraising committee set up directly



with the New York Democratic state party, instead of with the DSCC.



The state party would then spend the soft money on ads promoting



Hillary Clinton, just as they are doing now.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mayor Rudy Giuliani has just set up a similar joint fundraising



committee with the National Republican Senate Committee (NRSC) to



raise soft money. The Mayor's committee is called Giuliani Victory



Fund.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In these circumstances, the joint fundraising committees at the



DSCC and NRSC function, in effect, as "bank accounts" for the



Senate candidates. The candidates could just as easily establish



these "bank accounts" with the New York Republican and Democratic



state parties, with no impact on the raising or spending of



unlimited soft money.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joint fundraising committees have been set up by the Democrats



to raise soft money for Senate races being held this year in New



York, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan and Missouri.



Joint fundraising committees have been set up by the Republicans to



raise soft money for Senate races in New York, Missouri and



Pennsylvania.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This relatively new approach -- reportedly pioneered by the



Republicans -- institutionalizes and systematizes direct



relationships between the federal candidate and the candidate's



soft money donors. It totally undermines the limits on



contributions to federal candidates, and makes this evasion of the



campaign finance laws even more brazen and dangerous.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bottom line here is that the soft money "caps" in the Hagel



bill will not restrict the flow of any unlimited soft money



contributions into federal elections.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The tripling of the hard money individual contribution limits in



the Hagel bill means:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The amount an individual could give to a federal candidate



would increase from $1,000 per election to $3,000 per election, or



a total of $6,000 for a primary and general election combined.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The amount an individual could give to a national party



committee would increase from $20,000 per year to $60,000 per year.



(Each national party has three separate committees for the House,



the Senate and the National Committee.)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The overall aggregate amount that an individual could give to



all federal candidates and parties in a given year would increase



from $25,000 to $75,000, or $150,000 per election cycle. A couple



could contribute $150,000 per year or $300,000 per election cycle



year.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- An individual could contribute $60,000 per year in soft money



and an aggregate total of $75,000 per year in hard money for a



combined total of $135,000 per year, or $270,000 per election



cycle. A couple could give $270,000 per year or $540,000 in



combined hard and soft money in an election cycle.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- On top of all this, individuals, PACs, corporations and labor



unions would remain free to give unlimited soft money contributions



that were raised by federal officeholders and candidates and sent



directly to state parties to be spent on "issue ads" and other



activities promoting their federal candidacies and attacking their



opponents.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This does not constitute campaign finance reform.
