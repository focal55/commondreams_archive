- June 6 - The

          Virginia Supreme Court heard oral arguments today in a closely

          watched case that centers on whether the state can issue revenue bonds

          on behalf of TV preacher Pat Robertson's Regent University. On one

          side of the <i>Virginia College Building Authority v. Barry Lynn, et

          al<b> </b></i>case are the multi-millionaire religious broadcaster and

          his state government allies; on the other side are advocates of

          church-state separation. The conflict is considered a major showdown

          over the line between religion and government.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Background</i></b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regent

          University, a graduate-level university in Virginia Beach founded by

          Robertson in 1977, has applied for $55 million in revenue bonds from

          the Virginia College Building Authority. Although the state would not

          be liable in the event of a default, government issuance of the bonds

          would save Regent about $30 million in interest over the 30-year life

          of the loan.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Opponents

          charge that Regent is ineligible for the bonds because the school

          promotes its fundamentalist religious viewpoint in hiring, admissions

          and curriculum. (In legal terms, the school is &quot;pervasively

          sectarian.&quot;)</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Americans

          United for Separation of Church and State and the Virginia affiliate

          of the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit to block the bond

          issue. The lead plaintiff in the case is the Rev. Barry W. Lynn,

          executive director of Americans United and a Virginia resident.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn

          is one of the nation's leading advocates of church-state separation

          and a long-time critic of the Religious Right's efforts to combine

          government and religion. A McLean, Va., resident, he is both an

          attorney and an ordained minister in the United Church of Christ.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Pat

          Robertson is trying to force the citizens of Virginia to support his

          ministry,&quot; said AU Executive Director Lynn. &quot;I am confident

          the state supreme court will not let that happen.</font>

          

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Robertson

          and his religious school both have millions of dollars sitting in the

          bank,&quot; Lynn continued. &quot;He's got some nerve asking the state

          for a handout.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Legal

          Issues</i></b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In

          addition to the U.S. Constitution prohibition on public aid to

          religion, several sections of the Virginia Constitution bar government

          support for sectarian schools.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last

          July, Richmond Circuit Judge Randall G. Johnson ruled against the

          Regent bond request, holding that the school is thoroughly religious.

          Documents submitted to the court demonstrated that the school imposes

          religious requirements on faculty, requires prospective students to

          submit a clergy recommendation and states upfront that the school's

          &quot;ultimate purpose is glorifying God and His Son Jesus

          Christ.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In

          a similar case from 1991, the Virginia Supreme Court ruled unanimously

          that industrial development bonds could not be granted to Liberty

          University, a fundamentalist Christian institution in Lynchburg

          founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. Americans United sponsored that

          case,<i> Habel v. Industrial Development Authority of the City of

          Lynchburg</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The group

          argues that the facts in the Regent dispute are essentially the same.</font></p>

<h2 align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Regent

          U.: Big Money, Big Plans</i></b></font></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Robertson

          wants to use the bond money to pay for a new satellite campus in

          Alexandria, Va., and to fund the construction of a new events center

          and student housing at the main campus. The university offers 20

          graduate degrees through its schools of education, law, government,

          business, communications, divinity and counseling, and Robertson has

          talked about using its graduates to bring his sectarian views into

          those professions.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ironically,

          the school is hardly in need of state assistance. In 1997, Regent had

          an endowment of over $276 million, a huge sum that places the

          university in the top 100 of college endowments. Since the school has

          an enrollment of just over 1,400 on the main campus, that means an

          endowment of nearly $200,000 per student. (A large part of the

          endowment was received in 1997 when Robertson gave the school $147.5

          million in proceeds from the sale to Rupert Murdoch of the Family

          Channel, a commercial spin-off of his tax-exempt Christian

          Broadcasting Network.)</font></p>

<h2 align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Robertson's

          Power</i></b></font></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In

          recent years, Robertson has greatly stepped up his political activism

          in Virginia. He has donated large sums to Republican campaigns in

          Virginia and has even taken the credit for the GOP takeover of the

          Virginia legislature. This case could be an interesting test of

          Robertson's influence in the state.</font></p>
