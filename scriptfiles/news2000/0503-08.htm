Environmental Groups Say $100 Million Give-Away to Florida Sugar Industry

                          Will Harm Everglades

- May 3 - The Sierra Club and other environmental groups sent a letter today

to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman asking that he conduct a formal

environmental review before granting $100 million to Florida's sugar industry.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

On April 27, the Wall Street Journal reported that the sugar industry and its

congressional allies were lobbying Secretary Glickman and the White House for a

$100 million federal subsidy to compensate for low sugar prices.  The

environmental groups' letter states that such a subsidy would have a profound

effect on Florida's Everglades, and requests that Secretary Glickman conduct a

formal review to determine its potential effects on water quality before making

a decision.

</font>

<p>

 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If Secretary Glickman has an extra $100 million to give away," said Frank

Jackalone, Director of the Sierra Club's Florida Office, "It would be better

spent on acquiring land to protect the Everglades than by subsidizing a crop

responsible for Everglades destruction."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Under the National Environmental Policy Act, federal agencies are required to

review how their decisions would affect the environment. Artificially increasing

the price of sugar could prolong or increase sugar production in south Florida,

and potentially cause a major disturbance to the Everglades.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is an industry that has continuously damaged the Everglades by polluting

the waters of this fragile ecosystem or diverting enormous amounts of water from

the area for their own use," said Jackalone. "Not only should Secretary Glickman

produce this study to protect the Everglades, he is required to under federal

law."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Meanwhile, the Senate is scheduled to begin hearings on a multi-billion dollar

Everglades restoration plan on May 11. The groups noted this contradiction in

their letter to Glickman. "It is particularly ironic that you are considering a

$100 million subsidy to an industry responsible for polluting the Everglades at

the same time the Administration is seeking Congressional approval for an

ambitious, $7.8 billion plan to restore the Everglades.  The prospect of another

subsidy to the sugar industry is completely inconsistent with the

Administration's commitment to restoring the Everglades."

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Florida Everglades is a national treasure that deserves to be protected and

saved," said Jackalone. "We strongly oppose a bailout of Big Sugar and hope that

the Clinton Administration will assess the potential environmental damage and

deny the sugar industry this federal prize money."</font>
