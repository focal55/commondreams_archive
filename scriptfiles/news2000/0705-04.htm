- July 5 - At its June 25th meeting, the Board of Directors 

        of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) approved a minute which 

        endorses the economic sanctions announced by the National Association 

        for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) against the state of South 

        Carolina. 

      </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sanctions were adopted to urge the state to remove the Confederate 

        battle flag from all grounds under state sovereignty. A belief in the 

        worth of all people is the foundation of all AFSC program work. AFSC has 

        long worked in communities of great racial and cultural diversity in this 

        country. 

      </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Board united with African Americans who feel that to display this 

        flag which represents oppression is a personal and moral affront to our 

        sense of what is right and just. AFSC is sharing its concern over the 

        issue with all of the officials in the five states involved who have a 

        direct interest in this matter. They include the governors and other state 

        administrative officials and the state offices responsible for tourism 

        and commerce. This minute of concern will also be shared throughout the 

        Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). 

      </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Board of Directors hopes that elected officials in these states will 

        remove the Confederate battle flag from all official positions where it 

        would fly under state sovereignty.
