<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- March 8 - The battle against California's anti-gay Proposition 22 -

while unsuccessful -- has paved the way for gains in the future, the Human

Rights Campaign said today.

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Today's defeat was painful, but the organizing and educational

efforts that resulted from the campaign have laid a rock-solid foundation

for our future," HRC Executive Director Elizabeth Birch said Tuesday.

"Thanks to the extreme right wing, for the first time Californians became

acquainted with countless gay and lesbian families and their needs. While

the forces of intolerance were victorious today, by unnecessarily elevating

this issue they may have ensured civil marriage rights for same-sex couples

tomorrow."

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">California voters approved the ballot measure Tuesday by a vote of

61to 39 percent. Proposition 22 -- also known as the Knight Initiative for

its sponsor, Republican state Sen. Pete Knight -- prevents California from

recognizing same-sex marriages if they become legal and are performed in

another state. Currently, no state recognizes same-sex marriages.  While the

loss is a temporary setback in efforts to attain civil marriage rights for

same-sex couples, the battle to defeat the initiative united the gay and

lesbian community in California and across the country, according to HRC.

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The 'No on Knight' campaign led by Mike Marshall did an outstanding

job of mobilizing voters and educating the public despite being outspent

nearly 2 to 1," said Birch. "We applaud their tremendous efforts and thank

them for leading the fight for fairness. One day we will look back and

realize that they blazed the trail that our community followed to

recognition of civil marriage rights for same-sex couples."

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Efforts to defeat the Knight Initiative were complicated by the

fund-raising advantage of proponents, who spent $8 million, compared to $5.5

million spent by the opposition. Outspoken support from Mormon, Roman

Catholic and evangelical Christian church leaders contributed to the

lopsided fund-raising advantage.

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, other religious leaders opposed the initiative, including

three Southern California bishops - Episcopal, Lutheran and Methodist - who

issued a joint statement saying it could lead to discrimination.

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HRC raised more than a half-million dollars to fight the Knight

Initiative and activated its 40,000 California members to volunteer and

vote.  HRC leaders in key cities, including Los Angeles, New York and

Dallas, hosted fundraisers for the "No on Knight" campaign.

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The presidential hopefuls were divided on the initiative, with

Democrats Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore opposing the measure,

while Republican Sen. John McCain favored it. A regional chairwoman for

Republican Gov. George W. Bush's campaign told the Associated Press that

Bush was "not taking a position" on the initiative because it was a state

issue. California Gov. Gray Davis opposed the Knight Initiative, as did many

prominent California Republicans, including: Rep. Tom Campbell; Ward

Connerly, regent, University of California; all Republican candidates for

mayor of San Diego; San Diego Mayor Susan Golding; Los Angeles Mayor Richard

Riordan; and Assemblyman Jim Cunneen. Additionally, Pete Knight's gay s on,

David, opposed the initiative in a column he wrote for the Los Angeles

Times.

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay political

organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies

Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that

lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and

in the community.
