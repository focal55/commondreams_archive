- February 3 - Congressman Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Chair of the 53-member Congressional Progressive Caucus, announced today that the Caucus has approved a position paper opposing permanent most-favored nation (MFN) status for China. The Caucus approved the position paper late yesterday.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Progressive caucus opposes awarding China permanent most-favored nation trading status at this time,&quot; the Caucus statement said. &quot;We believe that it would be a serious setback for the protection and expansion of worker rights, human rights and religious rights. We also believe it will harm the U.S. economy. We favor continuing to review on an annual basis China's trading status, and believe it is both legal and consistent with U.S. WTO obligations to do so.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those advocating MFN claim Congress must grant China permanent MFN status in order for U.S. businesses to take advantage of China entering the WTO. The Progressive Caucus pointed out there is no legal requirement for granting <i>permanent</i> MFN, only unconditional MFN. The legal requirements are set forth in the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and in the Uruguay Round Agreement that established the WTO. Both of these documents are silent on the duration of an MFN grant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the U.S.-China trade relationship is governed by a 1979 bilateral agreement. Article III of this agreement includes a broad MFN requirement in &quot;economic and trade relations.&quot; Article V of this agreement requires reciprocal grants of MFN in the area of &quot;financial, currency and banking transactions.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Attached is the entire Progressive Caucus statement in opposition to permanent MFN for China.</font></p>

<P align="left">&nbsp;The Progressive 

        Caucus opposes awarding China permanent Most Favored Nation trading status 

        at this time. We believe that it would be a serious setback for the protection 

        and expansion of worker rights, human rights and religious rights. We 

        also believe it will harm the U.S. economy. We favor continuing to review 

        on an annual basis China's trading status, and we believe it is both legal 

        and consistent with U.S. WTO obligations to do so.

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Progressive 

          Caucus believes that trade relations with the U.S. should be conditioned 

          on the protection of worker rights, human rights and religious rights. 

          If Congress gives China permanent MFN status, the U.S. will lose the 

          best leverage we have to influence China to enact those rights and protections. 

          At the current time, the U.S. buys about 40 percent of China's exports, 

          making it a consumer with a lot of potential clout. So long as the U.S. 

          annually continues to review China's trade status, we have the ability 

          to debate achievement of basic worker and human rights and to condition 

          access to the U.S. market on the achievement of gains in worker and 

          human rights, if necessary. But once China is given permanent MFN, it 

          permanently receives unconditional access to the U.S. market and we 

          lose that leverage. China will be free to attract multinational capital 

          on the promise of super low wages, unsafe workplace conditions and prison 

          labor and permanent access to the U.S. market.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Giving China permanent 

          MFN status would be a serious defeat for the cause of worker rights, 

          because recent history shows that the current Chinese regime is unwilling 

          to reform on its own. That history is marked by Chinese promises to 

          improve worker rights, followed by their reneging on those promises. 

          That is precisely the sequence of the 1992 Memorandum of Understanding 

          between the United States and China on prison labor, when China agreed 

          to take measures to halt the export of products made with forced labor. 

          According to a recent U.S. State Department report, &quot;In all cases 

          [of forced labor identified by U.S. Customs], the [Chinese] Ministry 

          of Justice refused the request, ignored it, or simply denied the allegations 

          without further elaboration.&quot; If Congress gives up its annual review 

          of China's trade status, Congress will be unable to do anything about 

          worker rights there. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">China's history 

          of making promises and breaking them extends to many other areas as 

          well. China has violated memorandums of understanding on market access 

          (1992, 1994), and intellectual property rights (1992, 1996), as well 

          as agreements on non-proliferation of weapons and human rights. Recent 

          public comments made by Chinese officials regarding its bilateral trade 

          agreement with the U.S. indicate that China will be unwilling to implement 

          that agreement as well. As reported in &quot;Guangzhou Ribao&quot; on 

          January 6, 2000 and translated by the BBC, Long Yongtu, China's trade 

          negotiator, said, &quot;On the issue of allowing more &#133; meat products 

          into China, some people think that China has made a substantial compromise. 

          In fact, no substantial compromise was made on the meat product issue&#133;. 

          [P]eople [in the United States] think that China has opened its door 

          wide for the import of meat. In fact, this is only a theoretical market 

          opportunity. During diplomatic negotiations, it is imperative to use 

          beautiful words.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, giving 

          China permanent MFN will be harmful to the U.S. economy, since the record 

          trade deficit with China (and attendant problems such as loss of U.S. 

          jobs, and lower average wages in the U.S.) will worsen. For 1999, the 

          trade deficit is likely to be nearly $70 billion. Once China is awarded 

          permanent MFN and WTO membership, the trade deficit will worsen. In 

          a September 30, 1999 report, the U.S. International Trade Commission 

          concluded that China's accession to the WTO would cause &quot;an increase 

          in the U.S. trade deficit with China&quot;.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress has a 

          choice, however. Congress can continue to review China's trade status 

          on an annual basis. According to the Agreement establishing the WTO, 

          the U.S. is only obligated to provide China with unconditional MFN treatment. 

          The WTO is silent on the question of the duration of the MFN grant. 

          We believe therefore that annual grants of MFN are perfectly legal and 

          consistent with U.S. WTO obligations.</font></P>
