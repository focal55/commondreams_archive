- July 11 - </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAMIS ANDONI, <a href="mailto:andonil@cs.com">andonil@cs.com</a>, <a href="http://www.tari.org">http://www.tari.org<br>

</a>An independent analyst and journalist who has covered the Mideast for nearly

two decades, Andoni said today: "U.S. officials are apparently presenting a

package to the Israelis and Palestinians, hoping that will become the basis

for negotiations instead of international law. U.S. officials have been making

references to achieving an agreement that will address the Israeli desire to

end all Palestinian claims. Arafat is certainly the weak party, but he cannot

accept something that prevents Palestinians from acquiring their rights in

the future, especially since Palestinians are very disillusioned with the Oslo

Accords."

Associate professor at Boston University School of Law teaching immigration

and refugee law, Akram has just returned from a year-long Fulbright

fellowship in Jerusalem researching durable solutions for Palestinian

refugees. She said today: "Refugee issues are the lynchpin to a lasting

peace in the Middle East. The world community has ignored implementing

the rights of Palestinian refugees for over 50 years, the longest and largest

refugee population. There is neither a moral nor a legal justification for

failing to apply the same standards that are applied to all other refugees

in the world to the Palestinians. The most important are those articulated

in UN Resolution 194: rights of return, restitution and compensation. Israel

is attempting to force an agreement that will extinguish individual

Palestinian refugee claims to those rights."

</a>Communications director of the Institute for Public Accuracy, Husseini said

today: "The administration waged war last year against Yugoslavia

proclaiming that ethnic cleansing must be stopped; now it is putting its

political weight behind solidifying the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians."

</a>Author of "Image and Reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict" and "The

Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering,"

Finkelstein said today: "The figure that Israel will withdraw from 90

percent of the West Bank is deceptive. Expanded 'Jerusalem,' plans for

long-term leases in the Jordan Valley, the dubious promise of future

redeployments as well as bypass roads make it more like 60 percent. More

importantly, it is not contiguous and thus resembles Bantustans more than a

sovereign state... Israel will have the last word on external security

(including immigration and emigration), trade and crucial water rights."

</a>Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and author of "Calling the Shots:

How Washington Dominates Today's UN," Bennis said today: "The key challenges

will be Jerusalem and refugees. However Barak and Clinton may try to finesse

the language, Palestinians know full well that Abu Dis is not Jerusalem. It

would be the equivalent of expanding the city limits of New York to include

Newark, New Jersey, and then announcing Newark could be called 'New York.' A

limited agreement to allow some handpicked Palestinians back home, based on

'empathy' rather than international law, stands in direct violation of the

U.S.-backed UN Resolution 194 defining the right of return and compensation

for all refugees from 1948."</font></p>
