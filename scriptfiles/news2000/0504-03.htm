- May 4 - Handgun Control (HCI), the



nation's largest citizens' gun control lobbying organization, today



kicked off a new ad campaign with a discussion of the gun record of



Texas Governor George W. Bush.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently appointed Handgun Control President Michael Barnes,



former White House Press Secretary James Brady and HCI Political



Director Joe Sudbay discussed the record of Governor Bush on guns.



Handgun Control also unveiled a new television ad featuring a top



NRA spokesman's off-the-record (but recorded) comments on his



organization's view of the Governor of Texas.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At an NRA activist meeting held in California on February 16 and



17, NRA First Vice President Kayne B. Robinson (who is also Chair



of the Republican Party in Iowa) alluded to Governor George



W. Bush saying, "If we win we'll have a president, with at least



one of the people that's running, a president where we work out of



their office -- unbelievably friendly relations."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nina Butts, Executive Director of Texans Against Handgun



Violence (TAGV), an Austin, Texas-based gun control advocacy group,



was also in attendance to talk about the gun record of Governor



George W. Bush. Ms. Butts discussed a report which TAGV released



last year based on information from the Texas Department of Public



Safety (DPS) that indicated that there may be a large number of



dangerous, convicted felons in illegal possession of firearms in



Texas. These felons are at large and have not been prosecuted,



despite their having provided the state of Texas with their names,



addresses, color photos, fingerprints and certification of their



proficiency in the use of handguns when they applied for a license



to carry a concealed handgun. The report shows that, despite



Governor Bush's calls for tough enforcement of existing gun laws



and more prosecutions of gun crimes, it is the governor's own



support for the carrying of concealed weapons that has conclusively



demonstrated that Texan felons can continue to own guns.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today Handgun Control also launched a new Internet website,



http://www.bushandguns.com, to provide voters with information about



Governor George W. Bush's true record on gun control and gun



safety.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As a former member of Congress, I know what it's like to have



a public record," said Handgun Control President Michael Barnes.



"Governor Bush is going to have a lot of explaining to do to defend



his atrocious record on guns to the American people -- the majority



of whom overwhelmingly support new common-sense gun control laws."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"To understand Governor Bush's record on guns, you need to look



at two things: the Governor's actions and the NRA's words," said



HCI Political Director Joe Sudbay. "Governor Bush says he's a



'Reformer with Results.' But only the gun lobby likes the results



of the Governor's gun 'reforms' in Texas."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"When you read this Bush's lips, the message is 'I can't say no



to the gun lobby,'" added James Brady, former White House Press



Secretary under President Ronald Reagan. "It is important for



everyone who cares about public safety to know where George Bush



stands on the gun issue. And, the NRA has really helped clarify



that dangerous record."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Handgun Control is the nation's largest gun control advocacy



group. Today's briefing was the first in a series that will focus



on the gun records of various national and state-wide elected



officials.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">------



Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974 by



Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. "Pete" Shields, two victims of gun



violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law



enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups across



the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and local gun



control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI has more than



400,000 members nationwide, making it the nation's largest



citizens' gun control lobbying organization. More information about



HCI and its sister organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun



Violence, can be found on our website at <a href="http://www.handguncontrol.org">www.handguncontrol.org</a>.
