- March 9 - Planned Parenthood



Federation of America President Gloria Feldt reinforced concern



about the alleged profiteering of fetal tissue donated by women for



medical research in Kansas, which was a subject of the ABC News



show "20/20" last evening.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ABC "20/20" segment detailed alleged abuses by private



sector tissue and organ procurement companies that receive and



distribute donations of fetal tissue for research.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Where there is wrongdoing, it should be prosecuted and the



people who are doing that kind of thing should be brought to



justice," said Feldt to ABC's correspondent Chris Wallace during



their conversation for the "20/20" show.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a separate letter sent to Wallace, Feldt reaffirmed that



Planned Parenthood believes that fetal tissue research is an



important endeavor with the potential to save lives and ameliorate



disease.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Planned Parenthood supports research using fetal tissue in



accordance with legal and ethical guidelines and are deeply



concerned about the attempt by some to profit from the humanitarian



contributions of courageous women," said Feldt.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are confident those Planned Parenthood affiliates offering



women the option to donate tissue are doing so in accordance with



the law and medical ethics," added Feldt.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a related proactive step, several leading women's



reproductive healthcare and policy organizations, including Planned



Parenthood, have sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice



calling attention to the private sector tissue and organ



procurement companies implicated in the news program. In addition,



Planned Parenthood is urging the Chairman of the House Health and



Environment Subcommittee of Commerce, Rep. Michael Bilirakis



(R-FL), who is planning to hold hearings on the matter, to seek



enforcement of the existing statutes, including the National Organ



Transplant Act and the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter to Chairman Bilirakis, Feldt affirmed the critical



status of the issue, but expressed concern that "the public nature



of Thursday's inquiry may undermine the important research being



conducted by scientists looking for cures to debilitating diseases,



and may potentially stigmatize the donation of fetal tissue."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feldt concluded, "We will not stand silent while anti-choice



zealots engage in offensive and perhaps illegal behavior, so



lacking in compassion that they would sacrifice potentially



lifesaving medical research to further their political goals, which



is to deprive women of the fundamental right to choose abortion."<br>
