<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- September 28 - Commercial Alert applauded First Lady Hillary Clinton for

proposing to ban advertising targeted to preschoolers, and asked her to

explain her ideas in greater detail. According to yesterday's New York

Times, Mrs. Clinton said "Too many companies simply see our children as

little cash cows that they can exploit."



<p>"Mrs. Clinton's worthy proposal should have been enacted by

Congress years ago," said Gary Ruskin, Director of Commercial Alert.

"Preschoolers desperately need protection from corporations that promote

our noxious culture of  violent entertainment, video games, gambling,

materialism, alcohol, junk food and tobacco.  But older children are

vulnerable and need these safeguards too."



<p>"Parents can't cope with the fusillade of ads on their own, "

Ruskin said.  "They just need help."



<p>Mrs. Clinton also proposed a ban on advertising in public

elementary schools.  Such a proposal apparently would not substantially

affect Channel One, an in-school marketing company based in New York that

compels 8 million children to watch two minutes of ads each school day.

"Mrs. Clinton proposal would be a small step forward, but ought to be

extended to older children too.  The public classrooms are for learning,

not advertising."



<p>"Mrs. Clinton ought to explain precisely what she would do to

protect children from the influences of corporate advertisers," Ruskin

said.  "For example, would she support a ban corporations such as Channel

One, ZapMe! Coca-Cola and Pepsi from marketing in the public schools?

Would she prohibit the use of the public schools to promote violent

entertainment?"



<p>Last year, Commercial Alert wrote a letter, signed by sixty

psychologists, asking the American Psychological Association to protect

children against the use of psychology to influence or exploit children

for commercial purposes.  The letter is at

Following is an excerpt of the September 27 edition of the Bulletin's

Frontrunner.



<p>Hillary Proposes Ban On Ads To Young Kids. The New York Times (9/27,

Nagourney) reported, "Declaring that advertisers were directing a 'barrage

of materialistic marketing' at young children, Hillary Rodham Clinton

today called on the Federal government to ban commercials aimed at

preschool children, and to prohibit advertising inside public elementary

schools." Mrs. Clinton "said the Federal Trade Commission should be

authorized to ban advertising that it determines is intended for young

children susceptible to manipulation. She also called for legislation that

would prohibit the marketing of materials to children in elementary

schools, as on book covers with advertisements." Mrs. Clinton said, "Too

many companies simply see our children as little cash cows that they can

exploit. We know that advertisers target the youngest of our children.

Imagine. They are advertising to children who have not yet even reached

kindergarten. They are trying to get these children to be influenced in

what they want to buy and own." The New York Daily News (9/27, Lewine,

Siegel) reported, "Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed banning all TV

advertising directed at preschoolers yesterday and making public

elementary schools ad-free zones." With her proposals yesterday, the First

Lady "again borrowed from the playbook of her husband, who scored points

embracing such popular, narrowly drawn issues as school uniforms and the V

chip for TV sets. In seeking to limit TV ads aimed at preschoolers,

Clinton reopens a debate that raged when the Federal Trade Commission

under President Jimmy Carter was slapped down in its attempt to enact such

curbs. Under her proposal, the FTC would have the power to halt any such

commercials. " Clinton also "blasted a new generation of marketing and

advertising in elementary schools, such as free curriculum materials

sponsored by McDonald's and ads through media such as Channel One and the

Internet service ZapMe!"
