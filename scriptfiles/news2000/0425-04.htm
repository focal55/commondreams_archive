- April 25 - The Sierra Club today kicked off Environmental Voter

     Education Campaigns (EVEC) in 17 states and Congressional Districts

     around the country in an effort to highlight the environmental records

     of Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and other

     public officials.  Local Sierra Club chapters launched TV and radio

     ads to inform their communities about the environmental positions

     taken by their public officials, and to urge the public to ask their

     officials to take specific actions to support the environment.



     <p>"Americans care about protecting clean water, stopping sprawl and

     other environmental issues, and they want to know whether their public

     officials measure up on the environment," said Sierra Club Executive

     Director Carl Pope.  "In the 30 years since the first Earth Day, we've

     cleaned up pollution in some very tangible ways -- the Cuyahoga River

     no longer burns, smog no longer chokes Los Angeles.  Unfortunately,

     Congress refuses to tackle the insidious but less tangible problems

     still looming over our environment and our families' health.  Our ads

     tell Americans whether their public officials are making progress on

     the environment or blocking it."



    <p>During the course of its six-month effort, the Sierra Club expects to

     spend $8 million on its EVEC activities.  The Sierra Club EVEC

     grassroots lobbying activities spotlight the environmental records of:



     <p>Rep. Mark Udall (D, CO-2)<br>

     Rep. Chris Shays (R, CT-4)<br>

     Rep. James Maloney (D, CT-5)<br>

     Rep. Lane Evans (D, IL-17)<br>

     Rep. Dennis Moore (D, KS-3)<br>

     Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI)<br>

     Rep. David Bonior (D, MI-10)<br>

     Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT)<br>

     Rep. Rush Holt (D, NJ-12)<br>

     Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R-NY)<br>

     Rep. Shelley Berkley (D, NV-1)<br>

     Rep. Don Sherwood (R, PA-10)<br>

     Rep. Joseph Hoeffel (D, PA-13)<br>

     Former Governor George Allen (R-VA)<br>

     Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA)<br>

     Rep. Jay Inslee (D, WA-1)<br>

     Rep. Adam Smith (D, WA-9).



     <p>In Michigan, the TV ad shows children cannonballing into one of the

     Great Lakes, and informs viewers that even though toxins are closing

     the state's beaches, Sen. Abraham voted against a bill to clean up

     water pollution.  It then urges viewers to call Sen. Abraham to ask

     him to vote in future budget bills to clean up the Great Lakes.  A

     TV ad in Washington focuses on the state's treasured salmon and on

     Sen. Gorton's efforts to pass legislation that would devastate

     salmon runs. It asks viewers to call Sen. Gorton to ask him to vote

     "to protect Washington's water, salmon and our way of life -- for

     our families, for our future."



     <p>Pennsylvanians care deeply about suburban sprawl, and a TV ad there

     informs viewers that "fortunately, our Congressman Joe Hoeffel has

     voted to provide our communities with the tools we need for smart

     growth."  It asks that voters urge Rep. Hoeffel to vote for budget

     bills that help control sprawl.  In Connecticut, a radio ad pays

     tribute to the great fisheries of Long Island Sound, and informs

     listeners that Rep. Shays is leading the fight to help the Sound

     recover from sewage pollution that has contaminated shellfish beds.

     Listeners are asked to call on Rep. Shays to continue his leadership

     to restore the Sound.



     <p>This year's efforts build on the experience of the Sierra Club's past

     Environmental Voter Education Campaigns in 1996 and 1998.  In addition

     to launching TV and radio ads, in the coming months Sierra Club

     members in the EVEC sites will conduct a variety of grassroots

     lobbying activities: distributing voting charts and voter guides

     door-to-door, posting signs, holding rallies and conducting other

     creative actions.



     <p>Ad scripts, documentation, and VHS, beta and audio dubs are available

     by calling Allen Mattison at 202-675-7903.
