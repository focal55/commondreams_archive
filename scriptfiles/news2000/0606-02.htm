- June 6 - The Sierra Club today criticized the World Bank for

     voting to approve the construction of an oil pipeline project in Chad

     and Cameroon.  The project poses serious threats to the environments

     of both countries and could exacerbate  human rights abuses. The

     Sierra Club was particularly disappointed that the U.S. Executive

     Director to the World Bank voted in favor of the project.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Last month, in response to protests in Washington, DC, the World Bank

     announced it would incorporate greater environmental considerations

     into development projects.  Additionally, in a report released last

     week, the Bank admitted that its lending policies in Africa had failed

     over the past 40 years.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Despite promises, we're still seeing the 'old' World Bank," said

     Alejandro Queral of the Sierra Club's Human Rights and Environment

     Program. "There are serious environmental concerns that have yet to be

     properly addressed."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The Sierra Club supports development projects that are environmentally

     responsible and prioritize respect for human rights. In its current

     form, the Chad and Cameroon Oil and Pipeline Project could have

     disastrous environmental consequences and lead to gross abuses of

     those who criticize or oppose the project, including environmental

     activists.  In a joint campaign with Amnesty International USA,

     entitled "Defending Those Who Give the Earth a Voice," the Sierra Club

     has made the pipeline project a priority case where environmentalists

     are threatened.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Some of the major concerns include:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     *  The U.S. State Department discovered harrowing records of abuses to

     human rights and restrictions of freedom. Additionally, both Chad and

     Cameroon have made the activities of non-governmental organizations

     working on social and environmental issues on the project increasingly

     difficult and possibly life-threatening.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     *  The World Bank's approval of this loan comes at a time of increased

     civil unrest and  patterns of human rights abuses in Chad, where a

     civil war in the North is now spreading to southern Chad, where the

     projected 300 oil wells are to be drilled.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     *  The 650-mile pipeline poses risks of soil and water pollution from

     oil spills, and threatens pristine rainforest habitats in Cameroon.

     According to studies and comments made by foreign and US government

     agencies, the oil spill response plan is too general and it is

     severely underfunded to properly respond to an oil spill.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     *  Local populations have not been properly consulted and farmers in

     Chad have not been properly compensated for their land and fruit

     trees.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The political climates of these countries mean there is a great

     potential for ecological damage and for violence against those who

     would protect their environment," continued Queral.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The Sierra Club, along with several other organizations, had asked the

     World Bank to put a two-year moratorium on the pipeline in order to

     insure that the project and its host countries would be able to

     address all environmental and human rights concerns.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     In addition to approval from the World Bank, the Sierra Club is

     concerned that the Export-Import Bank of the United States will rush

     through a decision to provide loan guarantees for political and

     commercial risk insurance.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Export-Import Bank should consider the outstanding environmental,

     social, human rights, and institutional capacity issues raised by

     Chadian, Cameroonian, and international organizations," said Queral.</font>
