- April 3 - Representative Sam Farr (D-CA) will join with the Sierra

     Club on Wednesday to urge President Clinton to adequately protect

     California's giant sequoia forests from destruction by nearby logging.

     Later this month, President Clinton is expected to designate a

     National Monument protecting up to 400,000 acres of giant sequoia

     forests, but details are still being finalized.



     <p>If President Clinton's National Monument designation fully protects

     the giant sequoia, his action would fulfill the century-old dream of

     Sierra Club founder John Muir, who called these forests "nature's

     masterpiece."



     <p>Current U.S. Forest Service policy protects the sequoia trees

     themselves, but permits other tree species surrounding the giant

     sequoia to be logged.  And contrary to what most people believe, over

     half the remaining giant sequoias have no permanent protection.

     Logging around the sequoia groves has the potential to kill the

     sequoia just as an ax or a chainsaw does.  Because sequoia trees are

     very vulnerable to disruption, protecting the forest around the

     sequoias will ensure these towering trees can survive in their

     healthy, natural habitat.



     <p>Speaking at Wednesday's press conference will be Rep. Sam Farr (D-CA),

     who is leading the Congressional fight for the Giant Sequoias, and Joe

     Fontaine, chair of the Sierra Club's Yosemite Committee, who has

     worked for decades to save the sequoia forests.  Protecting the

     sequoia has been one of the Sierra Club's top goals for a century.
