<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN DIEGO - February 23 - The San Diego City Council by a 7-2 vote last night adopted

a resolution putting the second largest city in California on record as

opposing Proposition 22, the so-called Limits on Marriage initiative on

California’s March 7 ballot.  The resolution was recommended by the

City’s Human Relations Commission and sponsored by Christine Kehoe, San

Diego’s first openly lesbian council member.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The resolution states that the Knight Initiative would “cause

divisiveness and run contrary to … the right and opportunity of all

people to be free from discrimination based on sexual orientation.” Many

Council members echoed this sentiment in their statements explaining

their opposition to Prop 22  and several referred to a San Diego

Union-Tribune editorial which called Prop 22 a solution in search of a

problem and encouraged readers to vote “No” in March.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I know that gay and lesbian San Diegans have suffered a great deal of

pain and confusion and feelings of unfairness around Prop 22," said

Councilmember Kehoe. "Human dignity does not thrive in an atmosphere of

contempt, mockery or stereotyping.  Prop 22 does not protect traditional

marriage, but it does back all gays and lesbians into a corner of denial

and scorn.”



 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's why I asked the City Council to go on record opposing the

initiative.  The bigotry it enflames is painful and unfair to gay and

lesbian San Diegans--our constituents. It promotes prejudice and can

lead to hate and even violence," Kehoe stated.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking before a Council chamber nearly filled with supporters sporting

“No on  Knight” stickers – many of whom had waited more than six hours

for the item to come to a vote –  proponents of the resolution cited the

fact that Prop 22 would not change California law banning same sex

marriage.  Supporters did note, however, that passage of the Knight

Initiative could be used to overturn non-discrimination laws, domestic

partnerships, and other rights and benefits currently legally available

to gay and lesbian couples.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“You don’t have to support same sex marriage to oppose Prop 22,” says

San Diego “No on Knight” campaign spokesperson Rick Foglia.  “You just

have to reject divisive, mean-spirited politics and believe that

government should not intrude into people’s personal lives. That’s why

the San Diego City Council, whose members are primarily Republican, have

gone on record against the Knight Initiative.”
