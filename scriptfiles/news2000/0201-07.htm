- February 1 - The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination 

          Committee (ADC), the nation&#146;s largest grassroots Arab-American 

          organization, applauds the new Congressional letter to President Clinton 

          calling for the lifting of economic sanctions against the people of 

          Iraq, which was delivered to the White House at noon today. The letter, 

          which was prepared by Reps. Tom Campbell (R-CA) and John Conyers (D-Mich) 

          and was also signed by a bipartisan group of 67 other members of Congress, 

          calls on the President to &#147;lift the economic sanctions&#148; against 

          Iraq.</font>

        

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Congressional letter points out that &#147;Reports 

          from UNICEF (the United Nation's Children's Fund) and other United Nations 

          agencies operating in Iraq estimate that over one million civilians, 

          mostly children, have died from malnutrition and disease as a result 

          of the embargo. UNICEF also reports that, despite the UN's Oil-for-Food 

          program, several thousand children under the age of 5 die every month.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ADC President Hala Maksoud said &#147;We applaud the 

          moral position taken by these members of Congress, and are gratified 

          by the growing support for the lifting of sanctions. This sensitive 

          response to the plight of the Iraqi people will be the yeast for a future 

          of understanding between the American and Iraqi peoples. Such courageous 

          moral leadership will constitute the grounds on which reconciliation 

          can be built.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Congressional letter reflects the increased public 

          opposition to the sanctions which have imposed siege-like conditions 

          on Iraqis for almost a decade. In recent months a growing and increasingly 

          visible and vocal constituency of conscience has been pressing the case 

          against sanctions as the human tragedy in Iraq has grown out of all 

          proportions. In the fall, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops 

          called for the lifting of sanctions, and 24 leaders of 23 major denominations 

          and religious organizations joined in a similar statement. Several city 

          councils and labor unions have called for an end to sanctions, as have 

          numerous student government organizations. In October, activists from 

          around the country met at a National Organizing Conference on Iraq. 

          In September, a group of Congressional aides traveled to Iraq to study 

          the humanitarian crisis, and dozens of delegations of educators, public 

          health professionals, human rights activists and religious leaders have 

          made the same trip. Sanctions against Iraq have been criticized by UN 

          Secretary General Kofi Anan, the Vatican, UN Humanitarian officials 

          Denis Halliday and Hans von Sponeck, the Red Cross, and even some UN 

          Weapons Inspectors, among many others. In October, 1998, a similar letter 

          to the President initiated by Rep. Conyers gained 43 Congressional signatures.</font></p>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TEXT OF LETTER:</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear President Clinton:</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are again writing to you to ask that you de-link economic sanctions

from the military sanctions currently in place against Iraq.



</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than nine years of the most comprehensive economic embargo imposed

in modern history has failed to remove Saddam Hussein from power or even

ensured his compliance with his international obligations, while the

economy and people of Iraq continue to suffer.



</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reports from UNICEF, (the United Nation's Children's Fund) and other

United Nations agencies operating in Iraq estimate that over one million

civilians, mostly  children, have died from malnutrition and disease as

a result of the embargo. UNICEF also reports that, despite the UN's

Oil-for-Food program, several thousand children under the age of 5 die

every month ("Situation Analysis of Women and Children in Iraq," 1998,

UNICEF).



</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this year, a special United Nations Security Council panel

reported that "the gravity of the humanitarian situation is indisputable

and cannot be overstated." Iraq has "experienced a shift from relative

affluence to massive poverty."  Prior to sanctions, Iraq's healthcare

was regarded as amongst the best in the Middle East.  Today, children

die from epidemics of once preventable diseases.  The special Security

Council panel reported "infant mortality rates are among the highest in

the  world."  Meanwhile the embargo effectively prevents Iraq from

purchasing  equipment and spare parts required to restore water

purification, sewage treatment, medical infrastructure, electrical,

transportation, agricultural, and industrial production systems that

were severely damaged during the 1991 Gulf War.



</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Administration has argued that sanctions remain necessary to

prevent Iraq from threatening its neighbors and rebuilding its arsenal.

The goal of these sanctions, however, seems to have changed.  The

original UN resolutions imposed sanctions to pressure Iraq to eliminate

its weapons of mass destruction programs.  Statements by U.S. officials,

including Secretary Albright and Sandy Berger, however, suggest that

sanctions will remain in place until Saddam Hussein is removed, or even

beyond.  This policy clearly undermines the original intention of the

sanctions, around which the international consensus against Iraq was

originally based, and makes the children and families of Iraq into

virtual hostages in the political deadlock between the U.S.

and the government of Iraq.  Morally, it is wrong to hold the Iraqi

people responsible for the actions of a brutal and reckless government.

Politically, this policy deprives the Iraqi regime of any incentive to

comply with UN resolutions and international norms.



</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The time has come to turn a new page in our dealings with Iraq.  While

we have no illusions about the brutality of Saddam Hussein, the people

of Iraq should be allowed to restore their economic system. We simply

ask you to do what is right:  lift the economic sanctions.  At the same

time, we support the continued embargo on military equipment and

materials.
