- May 24 - Nine college students, one joined by her mother and 

grandmother, were detained at Ft. Benning this morning, Wednesday, May 24, as 

they demonstrated their ongoing commitment to close the School of the 

Americas (SOA).  They were acting in response to the last Thursday's vote in 

the House of Representatives, which affects cosmetic changes to the School, 

including a name change to Defense Institute for Hemispheric Security 

Cooperation. 



<p>In front of SOA headquarters, those assembled rolled out a banner which read 

"The Road To Shame," and listed atrocities committed by SOA graduates.  To 

one side protesters, dressed in black shrouds and white masks, held a banner 

that read "New Name -- Same Shame: Wrong Way." On the other side protesters 

held a banner reading "For the People, Not The Military.  This Way."  Others 

sowed seeds and read a statement in English and Spanish.



<p>In recent House debate, Congressman John Baldacci (D-ME) stated the SOA "is 

both a waste of taxpayer money and an affront to our common principles of 

freedom, democracy and respect for human rights...  H.R. 4205, the Defense 

Authorization Bill purports to close the SOA.  It does not.  Instead, it 

simply makes a few cosmetic changes... gives it a fancy new name and then 

turns a blind eye to the repeated human rights violations committed by SOA 

graduates." Congressman James McGovern (D-MA) stated "... history will not go 

away by hanging a sign with a new name over the same entry gate to the School 

of the Americas."



<p>SOA graduates continue to be implicated in Human Rights abuses.  Graduates, 

Major David Hernandez Rojas and Captain Diego Fino Rodriguez, were cited by a 

US State Department's Human Rights Report for the murder of a peace 

commissioner/former Vice Minister for Youth and two others on March 14, 1999. 

 A February 23, 2000  Human Rights Watch Report on Colombia cites seven SOA- 

trained Colombian military for recent human rights atrocities and for support 

of paramilitary forces.  Both reports establish collaboration between the 

military and the paramilitary death squads of Colombia.



<p>Martha Baldoni of Toledo, OH  who was detained, stated: "Each day this 

institution remains open, under whatever name, we run the great risk of 

sponsoring more human rights violations in Latin America.  We are here to 

call attention to the egregious track record of the SOA and to offer an 

alternative vision of US foreign policy. A policy based on mutual cooperation 

rather than military means. We are not fooled.  The SOA has a new name, but 

the same shame.  We will be at Ft. Benning by the thousands in November, and 

we will be in the halls of the new Congress in January to demand this school 

be closed."
