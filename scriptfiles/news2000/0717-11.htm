- July 17 - Consumers Union (CU) today called on the

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to phase out all uses of the

pesticide diazinon within four years.  The recommendation came in the

form of comments submitted to EPA in response to the agency's request

for comments on its proposal to reduce risk from exposure to the

widely used insecticide.  The comments were submitted as part of CU's

ongoing pesticide policy reform efforts.

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Children's exposure is a major concern with diazinon," said Adam

Goldberg, a policy analyst at Consumers Union. "Not only is it in

foods kids eat on a regular basis, but it is also commonly found in

drinking water.  Plus, it is used on lawns and in parks and other

recreational settings.  These are the places where kids like to play,

and if diazinon is used there, they can't avoid it."

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Diazinon is an organophosphate insecticide with a wide range of

agricultural, ranching, home and urban applications.  Diazinon is

used on many of the foods that kids eat every day, including grapes,

green beans, peaches and spinach.  Multiple uses create many

different sources of exposure and as a result significant harm can be

done not only to human beings, but to populations of birds, fish,

bees, and other non-target organisms.  It is a neurotoxicant and a

affects key developmental processes.  Diazinon poses a risk to

farmworkers who use the insecticide in their work, and to their

children who are exposed in the fields, from drift, and from being

exposed to it on their parents clothing.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CU has worked with Pierre Mineau of the Canadian National Wildlife

Research Centre to study the chemical's effect on wildlife.  Dr.

Mineau's research shows that even small exposures to diazinon can be

lethal for many different species of bird.  

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Charles Benbrook, a CU consultant, said, "It is no wonder diazinon

is responsible for so many bird kills in parks, people's backyards

and in and around treated farms.  It is the most toxic pesticide

registered for widespread use in these sensitive environments.  These

are places that attract birds and people for the same reasons. 

Diazinon is over six-times more toxic to birds than chlorpyrifos, an

insecticide that EPA recently all but cancelled for most home and

urban uses."

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Consumers Union believes that EPA has, in fact, made a strong

case to ban all diazinon uses based on its risk to the environment,

and to birds in particular.  The levels at which this insecticide is

found in water, air, rain and fog makes it a danger to most common

bird species, as well as other animals.  And, of course, if the birds

are being exposed, so are people," Benbrook points out.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA's review of diazinon is being done under the Food Quality

Protection Act (FQPA).  The FQPA, which Congress passed unanimously

in 1996, requires EPA to review all pesticide exposure limits to make

sure they are safe for young children.  Review of the more than 9,000

pesticide tolerances on the books is ongoing, and the law gives EPA

until 2006 to complete the task.  EPA must not only review each

individual pesticide use, but must examine the effects of exposure to

more than one pesticide at a time, as well as exposures from multiple

sources.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The diazinon review comes on the heels of EPA's review of another

controversial pesticide, chlorpyrifos.  In that case, EPA eliminated

most non-agricultural uses, severely restricted its use on grapes and

apples, and prohibited its use on tomatoes.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There are a number of effective alternatives for diazinon, and

more are in the pipeline," Benbrook said.  "There is no reason,

knowing what we know about this chemical, that it should remain on

the market.  EPA should phase out uses and lower tolerances to zero

over the next few years, locking in major risk reduction within two

years, but still giving farmers time to make the transition to safer

biointensive IPM systems.

 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"EPA made the right decision with chlorpyrifos," Goldberg added. 

"Now EPA needs to take an equally critical look at diazinon.  If it

does, it will reach the same conclusion we did - this insecticide

should be taken off the market."
