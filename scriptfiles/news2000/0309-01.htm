- March 9 - Americans have only



until March 31 to cast their votes to save salmon and remove



four federal dams on Washington's lower Snake River, American



Rivers, a national conservation group said today.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an emergency announcement, the group named the lower



Snake River the nation's Most Endangered River for 2000, and urged



citizens to visit http://www.salmonforever.org to submit comments



as part of the public hearing process on the dams.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a press conference in Washington, D.C., followed by a migration



to the White House to deliver thousands of public comment forms, the



conservation group said dam removal is the only solution that will



save the salmon, honor treaty obligations with Indian Tribes, protect



the Northwest economy and quality of life, and save billions of



taxpayer dollars.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our country is in the middle of a salmon crisis. Americans must



act now to save this legendary fish and vote to remove these dams



that simply don't make sense. If we delay any longer, the fish will



go the path of the buffalo and a national treasure will be lost



forever," said Rebecca Wodder, president of American Rivers.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Rivers will release the full list of the nation's Most



Endangered Rivers for 2000 on April 10. Wodder explained that the



group made the early emergency announcement about the Snake River to



spur the public to speak up before the public comment period ends on



March 31.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Americans hold the fate of the salmon in their hands. If you want



your children and your children's children to be able to experience



one of the most magnificent creatures ever to grace our waters, visit



www.salmonforever.org," Wodder said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Every study has shown that dam removal is the best -- and



probably only -- way to restore the salmon. And if we don't remove



the dams, federal taxpayers will be stuck with a billion-dollar



bill," she added.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Failure to remove the dams will require significant spending for



more expensive salmon-recovery options. And, according to federal



estimates, the four Columbia/Snake River Indian tribes guaranteed the



right to fish by federal treaty could be entitled to over $10 billion



in compensation -- money that would come from federal taxpayers --



if there is not enough salmon to support tribal fisheries.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's announcement comes near the end of a series of public



hearings held across the Northwest and Alaska, where dam removal



supporters have greatly outnumbered those who favor keeping the dams.



To date, more than 100,000 public comments supporting dam removal



have been generated.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wodder called dam removal the best solution for salmon, the



people, and the economy of the Northwest.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Science supports dam removal: Studies by the National Marine



Fisheries Service, U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, State and Tribal



fisheries agencies, and independent scientific committees all support



dam removal as the cornerstone of an effective salmon recovery



strategy.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dam removal is less costly than other options: Economic studies



show that dam removal is less expensive than other salmon recovery



options, such as new restrictions on farming, logging, and commercial



fishing. Measures such as acquiring water from Idaho irrigatorsto



speed migration of fish to the seaand repairing the dams to comply



with the Clean Water Act would cost more than $500 million annually



and eliminate more than 4,000 jobs.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Benefits of the dams can be replaced: Studies also show that the



benefits the dams provide can be replaced by investing in highways



and rail and upgrading irrigation equipment. The power produced by



the dams can be easily and affordably replaced -- without harming the



environment. The dams produce less than 5 percent of the region's



electricity. Shutting down the dams would increase the average



residential electricity bill by only $1 to $5 per month, and still



the region would enjoy the lowest-cost power in the nation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dam removal would create new jobs, economic benefits: Removing the



dams will also generate approximately $300 million in



recreation-related income for the region. Dam removal would create



12,000 temporary jobs and more than 2,000 permanent jobs. A recent



study by the Idaho Fish and Wildlife Foundation found that a restored



salmon and steelhead fishery would produce $170 million annually in



economic activity for Idaho alone.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber recently became the first major



political figure to endorse breaching the four dams and allowing the



river to return to a natural free-flowing condition.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Clinton-Gore Administration is legally obligated to decide



this year whether to remove the four lower Snake River dams



as part of its salmon recovery plan.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joining Wodder at today's press event were Rep. Tom Udall



(D-N.M.); Don Sampson, executive director of the Columbia River



Inter-Tribal Fish Commission; Jim Martin, retired, Chief of



Fisheries, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and Conservation



Director, Pure Fishing, the nation's largest fishing tackle



company; and Lewis and Clark, in costume.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The four dams (Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose, and



Lower Granite) were built by the Army Corps of Engineers in the



1960's and '70s. They kill salmon by flooding spawning habitat,



interfering with migration of young salmon to the sea -- exposing



them to predation and disease -- and by creating obstacles to adult



salmon returning to spawn.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Rivers will announce the full list of the 15th annual



report, America's Most Endangered Rivers at press events across the



country on April 10.<br>
