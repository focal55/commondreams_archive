- July 3 - A nationwide opinion



poll of 1,014 households released for the Fourth of July holiday



reveals that Americans view a number of their constitutionally



guaranteed rights as being less than secure.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most endangered? Equal access to the courts. According to the



survey, fewer than 1 out of every 3 Americans (28 percent) believe



that rich and poor people have equal access to the federal courts a



right of access guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In this survey, Americans are saying it's a fact of life that



they no longer have access to the federal judicial system," says Jeff



Barge, a New York-based public relations consultant who commissioned



the study. "Historians will look back and wonder why we allowed this



right to be taken from us."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The random telephone poll of 1,015 American households was



conducted by Opinion Research Corp. International. of Princeton, N.J.



and has a margin of error of 3 percent.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Courts Get Failing Grade, But Other Rights Fare Better

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While panning the poor job federal courts have done in



guaranteeing equal access to the federal justice system, Americans



feel much more sanguine about their other constitutional rights as



they approach the first Fourth of July of the new millennium. Among



other results:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 87 percent of those surveyed say that rich and poor have equal



access to free expression of religion. But while 90 percent of those



aged 65 and older felt this right was secure, only 80 percent of



those aged 18-24 felt this to be true.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 83 percent feel that rich and poor have equal access to the



right to vote. Little difference of opinion existed on this issue



regardless of age, race or income.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 64 percent feel that rich and poor have equal access to the



right to free speech. But only 58 percent of those in the 18-34 age



group felt this to be the case, compared to 76 percent of those aged



65 and older.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 41 percent say they truly believe that rich and poor have equal



access to the right to run for political office. But only 35 percent



of those in the 18-34 age group feel this way, compared to 48 percent



of those aged 55 and older. By race, 45 percent of Hispanics,



43 percent of whites and 32 percent of blacks felt equal access



to run for political office exists.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 28 percent feel rich and poor have equal access to federal



courts. By race, only 1 in 5 black Americans say they truly believe



that rich and poor have equal access to the federal courts



(20 percent), with only 28 percent of whites and 27 percent



of Hispanics feeling that way. Among those aged 55-to-64 belief



in equal access to the courts plummets to 23 percent, while



a third of respondents aged 18-24 (33 percent) believe equal



access exists.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Survey: Cost, Bias Deny Equal Judicial Access

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the study, several factors appear to explain why the



judicial system got the thumbs down when judged on the job it has



done in protecting equal access to federal courts. Among the top



factors is a perception of bias on the part of federal judges:



49 percent of those surveyed feel that federal judges are "at



least occasionally biased" against the poor, while one out of



three Americans (34 percent) feel that federal judges are "often"



biased against the poor when making their decisions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of those surveyed feel the judicial selection process has



become politicized and biased. Forty- seven percent of those surveyed



believe that federal judges are appointed nowadays because they



have helped raise money for political parties or candidates;



and 37 percent believe that most federal judges being appointed



today are wealthy white people.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Forty six percent of those surveyed say that if they had a legal



problem they would not have enough money to hire a lawyer. More than



two out of every three Americans (68 percent) with annual incomes



below $25,000 feel this way. But even the richest Americans feel



locked out: One out of every three (34 percent) Americans with annual



income exceeding $50,000 per year say they couldn't afford a lawyer



if they needed one.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall, 80 percent of those surveyed believe that most people who



bring lawsuits in federal courts without a lawyer will lose because



the courts have become too complicated for the average person to



understand.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">View of Judicial System: Reality Based

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recent events in the news may account in part for the poor



perception of the federal judiciary when it comes to protecting equal



access. One of the highest profile judicial news stories in past year



has been the decades-long refusal of Supreme Court justices to hire



black or minority law clerks.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Americans were stunned to see Supreme Court justices Souter and



Rehnquist testify before Congress this year that it's impossible for



them to find a single black law school graduate in the entire country



qualified to work on their staffs," said Barge. "Someone has given



the Supreme Court some very bad advice on this issue. This is not



a problem of public relations, but of substantive discrimination."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other factors influencing Americans' view of vanishing judicial



equality include a study released in April 2000, "And Justice for



Some," funded by several of the nation's leading foundations. The



study says black youths convicted of drug offenses are 48 times more



likely to be sentenced to juvenile prison as white youths. Overall,



black youths with no record are six times as likely as whites to be



imprisoned.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As to civil suits brought by the poor, a study by the Hastings



School of Law in San Francisco of civil suits brought in federal



court by poor people who can't afford attorneys showed that federal



judges allow just one out of of 650 suits to go to trial -- or



just 0.0015 percent. When Hastings School of Law asked the federal



Judicial Conference for its assistance in determining the cause



of this apparent bias, the assistance was refused. The Judicial



Conference makes policy for the U.S. courts.
