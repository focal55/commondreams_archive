- April 6 - After a year of organizing, rallying and attempting to negotiate, the University of Kentucky

anti-sweatshop campaign came to a boiling point Tuesday at 5:15pm when 18

students took over the basement of the Administration Building.  The

students entered with two demands- UK would withdraw its membership in the

Fair Labor Association and UK would join the Workers' Rights Consortium.

Their demands related to their campaign for UK to adopt strong policies

that would prevent UK apparel from being made in sweatshops.  The students,

who had locked down with chains, PVC pipe, and bike locks, attempted to

negotiate with the administration for eight hours.  



<p>Over the course of that eight hours, students inside the building were

subjected to intimidation and threats from the UK administration.  "They

were experts at singling us out one by one and intimidating us.  They told

us we wouldn't graduate.  They told us we couldn't get accepted to the bar.

 They told us we would lose scholarships.  They were very skilled at

harassment.  They've obviously had practice.  Additionally, there were

indirect threats of injury when the arrest process began," said Lindsey

Clouse, one of the students arrested at 1:45am Wednesday morning.



<p>After dropping all of their demands and merely asking for a public audience

with President Wethington, the administration still resorted to strong-arm

tactics.  "Our goals for the campaign still stand.  However, when inside we

essentially dropped all of our original demands; yet the administration

still insisted on arresting us," said Leslie Merrill, another arrestee.



<p>"It makes pretty clear to me that the administration has no trouble

resorting to authoritarian tactics to silence student voices.  Too bad for

them that we're not going away," said Amanda Lewis, also arrested early

Wednesday.



<p>As for the 100 supporters waiting outside the building, intimidation was

also a factor, this time from the police.  "Towards the end, people were

getting shoved to the ground and grabbed by the neck.  The police tried to

herd the crowd over top of people that had already fallen down.  One

student was hospitalized for a neck injury when she was assaulted by an

officer," stated Amy Shelton, a supporter who had been outside the building

all night.



<p>Despite the completely inappropriate response from the administration,

students are still focused on their original message.  "This only makes us

that much stronger and creates that much more support for our key issue

here: that UK should not support the abuse of workers' rights.  Now we've

learned that they will do the same to their own students," said Kristin

Hall, also arrested.
