- February 22 - U.S. Sen. Barbara



Boxer (D-Calif.) today introduced legislation that would require



labeling of genetically engineered (GE) foods on supermarket



shelves.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The legislation affects foods with genetically engineered



ingredients, or foods processed with genetically engineered



material. Popular products that would likely require labeling

include Frosted Flakes (GE corn), Coca-Cola (GE corn syrup),



Hershey's chocolate (GE soy used in lecithin), Heinz ketchup



(GE tomatoes, GE corn syrup).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Sen. Boxer just gave voice to over 30 million more Americans



who want to know if the food they are eating has been manipulated,"



said Larry Bohlen, director of Friends of the Earth's Safer



Food-Safer Farms Campaign. "As long as this stuff is on the shelf,



citizens should be able to choose whether or not they want to promote



biopollution like genetically engineered corn."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Boxer legislation is similar to labeling legislation



introduced in the House by Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio)



in November 1999. The Kucinich legislation now has more than



40 co-sponsors. Other Congressional action has included a letter



to the FDA by 49 House members led by Rep. David Bonior (D-Wis.)



in October calling the failure of FDA to require labeling an



"important food safety and consumer protection matter." Their



letter stated that the "current FDA policy regarding genetically



engineered or modified food is flawed."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Boxer bill introduction comes just as the FDA is planning to



release its decision on labeling and safety testing of genetically



engineered foods after a series of field hearings in November and



December.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A diverse, nationwide set of organizations including religious,



farm groups, consumer groups, and environmentalists has emerged to



call for labeling and safety testing of GE foods.
