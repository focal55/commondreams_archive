- April 7 - Common Cause today released "Under The Radar: Attack of the Stealth PACs on our Nation's Elections," a report about the so-called "Stealth PACs," organized under Section 527 of the tax code which can hide their donors, activities, and even their very existence from public view. 



<p>"These shadowy groups represent a dangerous and emerging trend in a campaign finance system already near a state of collapse," Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger said. "These committees are throwbacks to the off-the-books slushfunds of the Watergate era - and Congress needs to act now to shut down the 527 loophole. Already in this election season, we have seen the effect of these 'Stealth PACs' involved in last-minute anonymous smears. It's a bipartisan problem requiring a bipartisan solution." 



<p>The loophole in question allows these groups to claim - for the purposes of tax law - that they are devoted to influencing elections. But, these groups also are claiming - for the purposes of election law - that they are not influencing the outcomes of elections - thereby sparing themselves the disclosure requirements and the limits on the sizes and sources of contributions that other PACs have to abide by. 



<p>"Just when you thought that the current campaign finance system couldn't get any worse - it does," Harshbarger said. "And these Stealth PACs are flying under the radar to avoid detection from the public at large."
