- March 2 - Statement by Judith L. Lichtman, President,

National Partnership for Women &amp; Families





</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



The clock is ticking. A new countdown to meaningful managed care reform begins today as conferees meet to debate patient protections.  They have 43 days to deliver comprehensive, common-sense protections.  Americans are watching and have already waited too long for Congress to deliver the basic patient protections all families need and deserve. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

We support the Norwood-Dingell bill, which passed the House with strong bipartisan support and endorsements from over 300 organizations representing millions of patients, doctors, nurses, working people, small businesses and people of faith. Norwood-Dingell is the only legislation that provides real protections for patients and holds health plans truly accountable for delivering quality care -- the care people need, when they need it. We applaud President Clinton for standing firm, and demanding strong patient protections like those included in this bill. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

If conferees provide anything less, American voters will rightly see it as an act of sabotage and hold them accountable. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Congressional leaders have vowed to send a patient protection bill to the President by spring recess.  We call on the conferees and all members of the House and Senate to prove they are putting patients before profits. It is time to pass a strong patients’ bill of rights worthy of President Clinton’s signature.
