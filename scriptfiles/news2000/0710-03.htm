- July 10 - The following was



released today by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wal-Mart will stop at nothing to prevent its employees from having



a voice on the job. The world's largest retailer recently pulled out



legal maneuvers to stall a union election at the New Castle, Pa.,



Supercenter.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Employees in the Tire &amp; Lube Express department of the Wal-Mart



Supercenter in New Castle, Pa., stood up for a voice on the job and



filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board on June 13,



2000. Frustrated by poor treatment and favoritism, workers organized



to get a voice on the job with United Food and Commercial Workers



Union (UFCW) Local 880.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The workers are fed up with Wal-Mart's lousy treatment and lack



of respect for their hard work. They risk their health and safety



every day on the job and Wal-Mart hasn't taken the proper steps to



make their workplace safer," said Lou Maholic, organizing director



for UFCW Local 880.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wal-Mart challenged the workers' petition, causing unnecessary



hearings and delays before the workers have a chance to vote in a



union election. This is a typical Wal-Mart delay tactic. The Labor



Board has already certified unionization efforts in separate



departments such as the meat department in a Wal-Mart Supercenter and



auto departments at other department stores like Sears.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Wal-Mart's delay tactics are going to backfire. These workers are



standing up for a voice, so they can make their workplace a better



workplace. Dragging workers through legal maneuvers will only



strengthen their resolve to stand together for a better future with

a



union," said Maholic.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In February, meat department workers at Wal-Mart's Jacksonville,



Texas, store voted for union representation with UFCW Local 540, and



are demanding that the company obey the law, respect their choice and



begin immediate good-faith bargaining. Meat department workers in



Palestine, Texas, filed numerous charges with the NLRB for the



company's federal labor law violations during their union election



campaign in May 2000.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UFCW Director of Strategic Programs Mike Leonard said, "These



workers are determined to gain union representation, and they're not



alone. The UFCW is standing with them all the way and so are



Wal-Mart and Sam's Club employees across the country who daily



contact the UFCW, wanting to know about their rights to form a



union."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UFCW Local 880 currently represents more then 27,500 workers in



Northeast Ohio and Western Pennsylvania at Giant Eagle, Tops and



other major grocery stores. The UFCW is the largest organization of



retail workers in North America, with 1.4 million members. Workers

at



retail food industry leaders such as Kroger and Safeway are members



of the UFCW.
