- May 19 - Statement of Daniel Becker, Director, Sierra Club Global Warming and

     Energy Program

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Sierra Club is outraged that the Republican leadership has yet

     again prevented action to cut auto pollution, we are profoundly

     disappointed that the Democratic leadership didn't fight back; we urge

     the President to veto the DOT appropriations bill to remove the rider.

     Once again, Congress has used a rider to bar the Department of

     Transportation from even studying raising Corporate Average Fuel

     Economy (CAFE) standards.  With fuel economy at its lowest level since

     1980, action is clearly needed.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A bipartisan coalition of more than 100 Representatives signed onto a

     letter urging increased fuel economy standards.  This is a strong

     showing of support for tackling this urgent problem. These

     Representatives heard the demand from Americans who want to save money

     at the gas pump, cut our addiction to foreign oil and reduce global

     warming pollution.  Polls show that an overwhelming majority of

     Americans want to improve miles per gallon standards for SUVs --

     including SUV owners themselves.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is the first major anti-environmental rider of the 21st Century.

      It is essential that the Republican leadership stop polluting our

     laws with riders.  It is equally essential that when they do, the

     Democratic leadership stand and fight.  And when Congress doesn't do

     its job, the President must use his veto power.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In 1975, Congress passed the CAFE law to conserve oil and improve the

     nation's gas mileage.  From 1975 to 1989, CAFE doubled the nation's

     fuel economy.  Since then, fuel economy has remained stagnant.  Every

     year since 1995, a rider has been attached to the Transportation

     Appropriations bill to prevent the Department of Transportation from

     examining the need to improve CAFE standards."</font>
