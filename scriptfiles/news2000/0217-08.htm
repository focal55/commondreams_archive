- February 17 - The following was

released today by Handgun Control Inc.:

<p>Reports that Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch is considering

dropping gun safety legislation from the juvenile justice bill again



demonstrate that the Congressional Republican leadership is out of



touch with what Americans want for public safety.

<p>Last year, after the Columbine tragedy, the Senate passed juvenile

justice legislation with provisions that would help keep guns out of



the hands of juveniles and criminals. The Senate voted to restrict



possession of assault weapons by juveniles, prevent violent juveniles



from purchasing firearms as adults, eliminate the sale of large



ammunition magazines and, most important and with a dramatic



tie-breaking vote by Vice-President Gore, close the gun-show loophole



by requiring background checks for all gun show purchases. The



House, however, after voting for an artfully worded amendment that



would actually have widened the gun-show loophole, dropped all gun



provisions from the bill and left it to a House-Senate conference to



restore the integrity of the legislation. With a lot of help from



the gun lobby, that legislation has now been stalled since last



summer.

<p>Stripping the gun provisions out of the juvenile justice bill

would not go unnoticed in an election year in which both Democratic



presidential candidates support much more stringent regulation of gun



access, while the three remaining Republican candidates have long



records of pro-gun votes and support. Recent polls demonstrate as



much as 89% support for closing the gun show loophole and as much as



74% support for the gun licensing system proposed by President



Clinton in the State of the Union address. In 1998 and 1999, a



referendum closing the gun-show loophole passed in Florida, while a



referendum to allow the carrying of concealed weapons failed in



Missouri despite massive NRA support. Survey after survey



demonstrates widespread public support for common-sense gun control,



particularly among women and suburban voters.

<p>"Talk about shooting yourself in the foot," said Sarah Brady,

Chair of Handgun Control. "If the Republican leadership in Congress



tries to pass juvenile justice legislation without gun control



provisions, they will continue to be seen as the party that puts gun



lobby money ahead of the safety of our children. We welcome a renewed



Congressional debate on stopping juvenile gun violence, and so, I



suspect, will the American people."

citizens' gun control lobbying organization. Based in Washington,



D.C., HCI works to enact stronger federal, state and local gun



control laws, but does not seek to ban handguns. Founded in



1974, HCI has more than 400,000 members nationwide and works



with local groups around the country to enact and protect reasonable



gun control laws. More information about HCI and its affiliated
