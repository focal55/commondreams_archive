- June 30 - Japan today announced that it intends to have Greenpeace expelled from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in Adelaide, Australia, next week.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Japanese Government’s attempt to exclude Greenpeace from next week’s meeting shows just how desperate they are to continue the unsustainable practice of commercial whaling. We have a legitimate role to play in representing the views of millions of people around the world who want to see an end to these hunts," said Greenpeace campaigner, John Frizell.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is not the first time the Japanese Government has attempted to silence Greenpeace. They also tried at this year’s Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, where they unsuccessfully pushed to overturn the current ban on trade in whale products, and at last year’s IWC meeting in Grenada.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Japanese factory ship, the 'Nisshin Maru' rammed the Greenpeace vessel 'Arctic Sunrise' in December 1999, whilst Greenpeace was protecting whales from illegal Japanese whaling in the Antarctic Southern Ocean whale sanctuary. Japan, however, is accusing Greenpeace, a non-violent organisation, of aggressive and violent actions and of ramming its ship.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace supports proposals by Australia and New Zealand 

Governments to establish a South Pacific whale sanctuary that would be permanently off limits to commercial whaling. Whales that feed in the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary migrate to the South Pacific to breed. Japan is aggressively lobbying against the proposal.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Japan will also announce plans to extend its 'scientific' whaling 

programme at next week’s meeting to kill 50  Bryde’s whales and 10 sperm whales this year in the North Pacific, despite the IWC’s moratorium on commercial whaling that came into effect in 1986. Japan already hunts 440 minke whales in the protected Southern Ocean whale sanctuary each year by exploiting a loophole in the IWC’s regulations that allows 'scientific' whaling. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"People may think that whales have been saved but this is not the case. There is nothing scientific about Japan’s whaling programme and it has repeatedly ignored calls by the IWC to stop. If whales are to be saved, commercial whaling must end and sanctuaries must be established to protect whales in key areas like the South Pacific," said Frizell. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Notes to Editors:</b> 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace representatives have attended annual IWC meetings for more than 20 years to push for an end to commercial whaling. Greenpeace has consistently called on the Japanese Government to cancel its illegal Antarctic whaling programme as it is in violation of international law.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JAPAN REQUESTS GREENPEACE BAN FROM CONFERENCE

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Japan will request the observer status credentials of Greenpeace 

be withdrawn for next week's International Whaling Commission 

conference, Japan's Commissioner to the IWC, Mr Minoru Morimoto, announced today.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The withdrawal would effectively ban Greenpeace from attending 

the 52th International Whaling Commission conference, which is 

being held in Adelaide from July 3-6. Mr Morimoto will make the 

request at the opening plenary session of the meeting on Monday.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This request is consistent with past decisions of the Commission 

concerning attendance of observers", said Mr Morimoto.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At it's meeting last year, the Commission withdrew the credentials 

of two non-government organizations following a demonstration at 

the IWC headquarters in the UK. Previously, the Commission has 

withdrawn the observer credentials of the organization called Sea 

Shepherd Society for its illegal actions against whaling vessels.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr Morimoto said the Greenpeace campaign against Japan's 

research program in the Antarctic earlier this year involved illegal and violent action that caused a collision with Japan's research vessel and risked the lives of scientists and crews -- a stark contrast to the organisation's claims of peaceful protest.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Their campaign of violence against a program authorized by the 

International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling should be 

strongly condemned by the Commission."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Scientific research is an essential part of conservation and 

management of all marine resources including whales, and the 

International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling requires that its regulations shall be based on scientific findings."  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"That is why Japan is continuing its whale research program in the 

Antarctic. It is the only long-term study providing information 

necessary for the management of whales and is also investigating the role of whales in the ecosystem and the effects of environmental changes on whales."  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr Morimoto said Japan's research program had been the subject of extensive review by the International Whaling Commission's Scientific Committee, which had noted that it had provided considerable data which could assist with the management of minke whales.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr Morimoto said Greenpeace did not contribute any scientific knowledge to the conference and he urged supporters of the organisation to question how much of their donations went directly 

to learning about whales and their environment.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In contrast, Greenpeace has nothing to show but a long list of 

arrests for violent and illegal actions."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr Morimoto said he understood that people held differing views about the whaling debate but he condemned organisations which tried to impose their views on others via violent means.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The IWC should strongly condemn such behaviour and remove them from the conference", Mr Morimoto said.
