- June 8 - The Violence Policy



Center (VPC) today criticized the National Shooting Sports Foundation



(NSSF) trigger lock giveaway at the Fairfax, Va. County Fair



this weekend and a recent decision to distribute in Washington



state. The following is a statement from Josh Sugarmann, Executive



Director of the VPC:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This gesture of 'goodwill' by the NSSF is the latest hypocritical



attempt to help burnish the image of the firearms industry, even as



they brazenly market their deadly products to America's children and



youth.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The NSSF is among the leaders in marketing guns to kids,



realizing that the industry needs to reach out to children --



both as future customers and political foot soldiers in future



gun control battles. The NSSF acknowledges the importance of



this effort in their marketing pamphlet stating:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"'Capturing their interest (children and youth) is vital to the



continued health of the shooting sports industry and the NSSF has



been working hard at it, placing pro-shooting messages in youth



magazines, educational programs in schools and promotional material



in stores, clubs, and classrooms across the country.'

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As to what age is best for children to start shooting, the NSSF



states in the pamphlet When Your Youngster Wants a Gun:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"'Age is not the major yardstick. Some youngsters are ready



to start at 10, others at 14. The only real measures are those



of maturity and individual responsibility. Does your youngster



follow directions well? Is he conscientious and reliable? Would



you leave him alone in the house for two or three hours? Would



you send him to the grocery store with a list and a $20 bill?



If the answer to these questions or similar ones are 'yes,'



then the answer can also be 'yes' when your child asks for his



first gun.'

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"All trigger locks lack minimum safety standards, but these cable



locks are clearly inadequate. With a child's curiosity and ingenuity



and a pair of wire cutters or garden shears, the mechanism that is



supposed to keep children safe is rendered useless. The NSSF itself



acknowledges this on their website, where they admit 'cable can be



cut.'

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Even taking the NSSF's motives at face value, handing out trigger



locks will have little impact on gun violence in America. The real



issue is the easy and ready accessibility of handguns. The only way



to keep children safe is to keep handguns out of homes."
