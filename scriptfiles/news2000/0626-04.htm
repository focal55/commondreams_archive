- June 26 - The American Civil Liberties Union warned that the assembly of a "working draft" of the human genome today makes the need for Congress to enact protections against genetic discrimination more urgent than ever before. </font>

<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This medical breakthrough should be a cause for celebration, but instead many people are scared that genetic tests will be used against them," said Ronald Weich, a legislative consultant to the American Civil Liberties Union. "No one should lose a job or insurance policy because of a genetic predisposition. Americans should be judged on their actual abilities, not their potential disabilities." </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



The two groups that have been competing to be the first to complete the mapping of the human genome -- the Human Genome Project and Celera -- announced at a joint White House news conference that they have completed the first "rough draft" of humans' genetic code.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



President Clinton also signaled his support for an effort by members of Congress, led by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO) and Representative Louise Slaughter (D-NY), to pass legislation that would ban genetic discrimination. Gephardt and Slaughter announced the launch of a discharge petition on H.R. 2457, the "Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act" last week. If proponents gather 218 signatures on the petition, the bill would be taken from the Commerce Committee where it has languished and put before the full House for a vote.</font>

<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's time for Congress to stop dragging its feet on legislation that would protect Americans from genetic discrimination," Weich said. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



The House Republican leadership has refused to hold hearings on the bill, which would:</font>

<p>

<blockquote>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Prohibit health insurers from restricting enrollment or adjusting fees on the basis of predictive genetic information.

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bar health insurers and employers from requiring genetic testing and from obtaining predictive genetic information.

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prevent employers from discriminating based on genetic information in all areas of employment, including hiring and compensation.</font>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



The ACLU noted that genetic tests can only indicate that someone has a predisposition to a health condition, not whether or not he or she will actually ever develop the condition.</font>
