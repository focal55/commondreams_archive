- February 18 - In recent days, Bob Jones University and the decision of certain candidates for public office to speak there have been the subject of much controversy in the national news media. As this issue continues to be addressed and as the nation moves to elect its first leaders of the new century, The Interfaith Alliance offers this statement on Bob Jones University and the decision of candidates for our nation's highest office to speak there.

<p>As a national clergy-led grassroots organization dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in the life of the nation and one that challenges those individuals and organizations who manipulate religion to promote social intolerance, we have serious concerns about the religious and social views being expressed and promoted by Bob Jones University. Furthermore, we have serious reservations about candidates for public office giving the appearance of an endorsement of Bob Jones University's philosophy by using the University as a backdrop for certain political purposes.</p>



<p>As a faith based organization comprised of over 50 different faith traditions dedicated to promoting civility, mutual respect and cooperation in our increasingly diverse society, we believe that Bob Jones University works against these goals and needs to greatly reassess the values that it is embracing as an educational institution. </p>



<p>Over the last ten years, officials at Bob Jones University have made statements regarding Catholicism and organized religion in general that we not only find to be hurtful but factually flawed and ignorant. In addition to directly attacking people of organized religion who differ from its own views, Bob Jones University's segregationist policies are reminiscent of arguably the saddest days of our nation's struggle for equality for all Americans. </p>



<p>Sister Mary Carol Bennett, an activist of The Interfaith Alliance, voiced serious concern over the prominence of Bob Jones University's attitudes toward Catholicism and racial tolerance.  "As a person of faith, I am deeply troubled by the embrace of Bob Jones University by several presidential candidates," said Sister Bennett.  "While Catholics do not represent a monolithic group theologically or politically, we should take careful note of those who spread a blanket condemnation on the 50 million of us.  In addition, in a country whose population includes nearly fifty percent racial minorities, a call for racial purity in relationships ought to be seen as waving a red flag.  It recalls a lesson we ought to have learned 50 years ago."</p>



<p>Therefore, we at The Interfaith Alliance call on all candidates for public office and public officials to carefully consider what their relationship with Bob Jones University is now, and what it shall be in the future. 

</p>

<p>We ask candidates for public office and public officials to carefully consider the message they are sending to the general public by using Bob Jones University campus as a forum to discuss any topic besides the continued need for civil rights education for all people in this nation. </p>



<p>We call on public officials who do speak to the university audience to implore them as a university community to consider the implications of their policies and their views and to re-evaluate them because our society recognizes the equality of all peoples regardless of their religion, sexual orientation, race or gender.  </p>
