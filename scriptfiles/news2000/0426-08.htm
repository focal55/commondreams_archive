- April 26 - In the Ohio Poll released



today, Ralph Nader -- just two months after declaring his candidacy



for President on the Green Party ticket -- received the highest net



favorability rating among the four tested presidential candidates:



Bush, Gore, Nader and Buchanan.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader's net favorability was 24 percent, higher than Bush at 22



percent, Gore at minus 3 percent and Buchanan at minus 36 percent.



Net favorability was calculated by subtracting the unfavorability



rating from the favorability rating received for each candidate.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Ohio Poll, Ralph Nader is also the only candidate



tested who received a positive net favorability rating among



Democrats (40 percent), Independents (20 percent) and Republicans (10



percent).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll was conducted by the Institute for Policy Research at the



University of Cincinnati from April 5-April 22. A random sample of



531 likely voters from throughout the state was asked by telephone:



"I'm going to ask you about several people in politics. First would



you say that you have a favorable opinion of (insert)...an

unfavorable opinion...or that you know too little about him to say

or



that you have not heard of him?" According to the poll, in 95 of 100



cases, the statewide estimates will be accurate to plus or minus 4.3



percent.
