- April 6 - The Humane Society of the 

United States (HSUS), the nation's largest animal protection 

organization with over 7.5 million members and constituents, today 

announced its opposition to granting permanent "normal trade 

relations" to China. 



<p>Congress is expected to vote on the issue next month. Approving 

permanent normal trade relations would eliminate the annual 

Congressional review of the U.S.-China trade status and remove an 

important tool for encouraging China to protect animals. 



<p>The HSUS says that free trade, while potentially improving 

economic conditions in China and other nations, also undermines 

animal protection efforts. Laws protecting depleted dolphin 

populations, endangered sea turtles, wild animals trapped for their 

fur, animals used in cosmetics testing and other animals are 

threatened under the World Trade Organization, which has ruled that 

animal protection laws represent unfair barriers to free trade. The 

HSUS organized peaceful protests during the WTO meeting in Seattle 

and, along with the Animal Welfare Institute, dressed protesters in 

sea turtle costumes to highlight the plight of these and other 

animals. 



<p>"China's record on animal protection is abysmal," said Patricia 

Forkan, HSUS executive vice president. "The protestors in Seattle 

demonstrated that the American people do not want free trade if the 

price includes extinction and animal suffering." 



<p>The HSUS cites the following examples of China's poor record on 

animal protection: 



<p>Investigations conducted by The HSUS in 1998 and 1999 in China 

documented the widespread killing of dogs and cats for their fur. 

An estimated two million dogs and cats are killed by extremely 

inhumane methods for this international trade. 



<p>Trade in bear, tiger and rhino parts flourishes in China despite 

international agreements and domestic laws prohibiting such sales. 

Several of these species are highly endangered due in large part to 

the Asian medicinal trade. 



<p>China harbors an extensive illegal ivory trade network that 

undermines international efforts to protect elephants. 



<p>Forkan says that granting China permanent normal trade relation 

status will undoubtedly lead agri-businesses to move operations 

from the United States to China to avoid U.S. environmental, animal 

protection, labor and safety regulations. "Not only will American 

consumers unknowingly purchase and consume meat, eggs and dairy 

products produced under conditions inhumane for both people and 

animals, the likely growth of agri-business in China may lead to a 

collapse of the already fragile U.S. farm economy." 



<p>The HSUS and AWI are organizing a peaceful demonstration against 

granting permanent normal trade relations to China on April 12 on 

the East steps of the Capitol. Demonstrators dressed in sea turtle 

costumes will rally from noon to 1 p.m.
