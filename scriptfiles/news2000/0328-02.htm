- March 28 - The American Planning

Association is leading a coalition of national organizations in

creating the Community Post Office Partnership Web site, located on

the internet at <a href="http://www.stampoutsprawl.org">www.stampoutsprawl.org</a>.

<p>With more than 40,000 facilities nationwide, the U.S. Postal

Service is the most visible federal institution in America's

communities. Yet, the Postal Service has chosen not to abide by

local planning, citizen participation, zoning, land-use, historic

preservation and environmental standards that apply to all other

businesses.

<p>The Web site was launched on Monday, March 27. A main objective

of the site is to create increased pressure on Congress for action

on H.R. 670 and S. 556, bills that would force the postal service

to consult with the local citizens and comply with community

regulations and plans when closing or relocating a post office. The

bill has more than 230 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives,

but no final action has yet been taken. Chief authors of the

legislation, Rep. Blumenauer (D-OR) and Sen. Jim Jeffords (R-VT)

and Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) will call for action in June.

<p>"Until today, communities have been beholden to the whims of the

Postal Service," said Rep. Blumenauer, "As the Internet connects

the growing national movement, this website will provide a huge

boost for the Post Office Community Partnership Act."

<p>All too often the Postal Service creates a blueprint for sprawl

by closing existing locations in favor of new facilities on the

edge of town. Post offices in small towns and city centers are

vital to ensuring the continued vibrancy of downtown businesses and

maintaining the unique character of the community. A 1993 study by

the National Trust for Historic Preservation found that 80 percent

of people who shopped downtown planned their trip around a visit to

the post office.

<p>The site offers case studies of communities affected by post

office closings or relocations such as Tallahassee, FL; Portland,

OR; Ball Ground, GA; Pittsboro, NC; Christiansburg, VA; and

Livingston, MT. Other features include resources for citizens and

communities struggling with this issue, interactive forms for

sharing information about what's happening locally, direct links to

e-mail Representatives and Senators, and online subscription for

e-mail updates on this issue.

<p>The Web site is part of a new approach to legislative advocacy

-- the use of the Internet to focus on a key issue and pending

legislation, while providing citizens with a direct link to

information and lawmakers. Organizations joining APA in this effort

include the National Trust for Historic Preservation, National

League of Cities, International Downtown Association, and

Preservation Action.

<p>"Through the world wide web," said Rep. Blumenauer, "the

magnitude of the problem and the scope of potential solutions to it

will become clear. We will bring citizens directly into the

democratic process, in numbers we could never have been able to

reach before."

<p>In addition to partner organizations, the post office

legislation being promoted by the website has been endorsed by the

Bike Federation of America, National Association of Counties,

National Alliance of Preservation Commissions, National Association

of Home Builders, National Association of Postmasters of the U.S.,

National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, Sierra

Club and the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

<p>------

rural and regional planning. APA encourages planning that

contributes to public well being by developing communities and
