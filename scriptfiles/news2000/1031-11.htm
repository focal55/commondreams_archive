- October 31 - Corporate crime inflicts enormous damage on society, but the government

fails to take the problem seriously. The FBI's annual report Crime in the

United States deals exclusively with street crime, while ignoring corporate

and white-collar crime.



<p>Corporate crime costs Americans hundreds of billions of dollars each year.

And corporate crime is often violent crime. Every year, about 6,000

Americans die from on-the-job accidents (frequently the result of criminal

recklessness), and 50,000 die from occupational diseases (a conservative

estimate from the government's National Institute for Occupational Safety

and Health). Environmental crimes also cause death, disease and injury.



<p>Corporate crime usually goes unpunished. For every company convicted of

health care fraud, hundreds rip off Medicare and Medicaid. For every company

convicted of violating anti-pollution laws, many escape prosecution because

their lawyers offer up a low-level employee in exchange for a promise not to

prosecute the company or high-level executives. For every corporation

convicted of reckless homicide, hundreds aren't even investigated when a

worker is killed on the job.



<p>Even egregious instances of corporate crime go unpunished. For decades, the

makers of leaded gasoline systematically suppressed information about the

severe health hazards of their product. They were not prosecuted.

Warner-Lambert recently offered a diabetes drug called Rezulin. The Food and

Drug Administration forced the drug off the market, after 61 confirmed

deaths and 28 non-fatal liver failures. Despite evidence that, prior to the

marketing of Rezulin, Warner-Lambert knew of the correlation between the

drug and liver toxicity, no prosecution has been brought. Earlier this year,

an explosion at a Phillips Petroleum plastics plant killed one person and

injured 74. It was the third fatal accident at the complex in the last 11

years and the fourth explosion within the last year.



<p>This record of repeated disaster has produced no criminal prosecution. When

corporate criminals are punished, they often receive lenient treatment. For

example, earlier this year four Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd. executives pleaded

guilty to an international conspiracy to eliminate competition in the

vitamin industry-perhaps the largest criminal antitrust conspiracy in

history. Their prison terms ranged from three to four months. The

Clinton/Gore Administration has been soft on corporate crime. Clinton and

Gore talk about street crime and putting more police on the streets, but not

about corporate crime and putting more prosecutors in the suites.

Prosecution of environmental crimes has fallen sharply during the

Clinton/Gore Administration. Weak enforcement policies have characterized

the administration in every arena where corporations are big players,

including foreign corrupt practices, food and drug, occupational safety and

health, trading with the enemy laws, and financial and securities fraud.

What can be done? In addition to increasing budget allocations for

inspectors, corporate-crime prosecutors and field agents, we should: *

Require publicly held corporations to report their histories of wrongdoing

to the Securities and Exchange Commission;



<p> Establish a corporate crime data base and create a corporate crime strike

force at the Department of Justice;



<p> Encourage private attorney general actions;



<p> Add citizen bounty-hunting provisions to federal laws;



<p> Strengthen whistleblower laws;



<p> Dissolve corporations convicted of serious crimes;



<p> Debar recidivist corporate criminals from federal contracts;



<p> Mandate adverse publicity sanctions; and



<p> Eliminate country club prisons.



<p>First, though, the government must take corporate crime seriously.
