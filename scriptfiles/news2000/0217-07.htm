     <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 17 - An intense publicity blitz and lobbying

campaign launched by auto manufacturers to influence the government&#146;s pending air bag

rule contains misleading information that could lead to a substandard safety test, a

coalition of consumer groups said today.</font></p>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen, the <a href="http://www.autosafety.org/">Center for

Auto Safety</a>, Parents for Safer Air Bags and the <a href="http://www.consumerfed.org/">Consumer

Federation of America</a> on Thursday sent a letter to President Bill Clinton, pointing

out flaws in the auto industry&#146;s arguments.</font></p>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At issue is which higher-speed crash test should be used to test air

bags -- the 25 mph unbelted barrier crash test, which the industry wants, or the 30 mph

unbelted crash test, which the consumer groups say will better protect the traveling

public.</font></p>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The auto industry is distorting the facts in an attempt to

manipulate both public opinion and the government&#146;s decision-making process,&quot;

said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen. &quot;The fact that this could result in

a substandard safety test is unconscionable.&quot;</font></p>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto

Safety. &quot;The air bag standard should not be written just to make it easier for auto

manufacturers to comply. It should be set for the benefit of auto drivers and

passengers.&quot;</font></p>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The key issue is how best to protect all drivers and passengers from

being injured. The industry contends that the 30 mph test will make air bags too powerful,

but consumer groups say that governments tests show that air bags will not have to be

repowered to meet the 30 mph barrier test. The groups also point out that technology is

readily available to ensure that all passengers of all sizes are protected. This

technology includes dual-inflation air bags, which inflate at lower intensities in

low-speed crashes while inflating at higher intensities to protect occupants involved in

high-speed crashes, telescoping steering wheels and<b> </b>pedal extenders for shorter

drivers, deep dish steering columns that move the air bag away from the occupant, air bag

suppression, tethers, controlled inflation and much more.</font></p>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Consumers Union firmly believes that the automobile industry

has the ability to devise and place in all vehicles by 2005 air bags that will protect all

categories of passengers,&quot; said Sally Greenberg, senior products safety counsel for

Consumers Union, which also supports the 30 mph test. &quot;We urge the government to

insist that the industry rise to its technological abilities and be true to the concept of

advanced air bags.&quot; </font></p>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 25 mph test, Claybrook said, will not adequately protect

automobile occupants in high-speed crashes, which are the kind of crashes that take the

most lives. In fact, 50 percent of fatalities in frontal crashes occur at speeds higher

than 30 mph, government data shows. Claybrook noted that unbelted male teenagers are more

often fatality victims than other people. </font></p>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Air bag deaths -- now being used by the auto industry to fuel its

argument -- have occurred in low-speed crashes involving speeds <i><b>under 20 mph</b></i>.

Setting the higher speed test at 25 mph would save automakers from redesigning their air

bags, thus reducing their production costs, consumer group representatives said.</font></p>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">March 1 is the statutory deadline for the U.S. Department of

Transportation&#146;s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to issue an

advanced air bag rule that will improve the protection of all automobile occupants of all

sizes, whether the are wearing a seatbelt or not, while minimizing risks of injury or

death from air bags. Legislation requiring issuance of the rule called for the use of

advanced air bag technology. </font></p>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Automotive industry groups have launched a campaign to sway

policymakers, visiting high-level administration officials and testifying before Congress.

This week, they took out full-page ads in major newspapers in an open letter to Clinton.

They have solicited nonprofit groups they fund to join their campaign.</font></p>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the letter to Clinton, Claybrook, Ditlow and Sanders noted that:</font></p>

     <blockquote>

      <blockquote>

       <ul>

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 80<b> </b>million vehicles were manufactured between 1987 and 1999 with air

        bags involved in more than three million deployments that meet the 30 mph unbelted male

        barrier crash test. Despite all the real world experience with vehicles meeting the 30 mph

        test, the auto industry has produced no data showing that smaller adults or children were

        injured or killed by such air bags in higher speed crashes.</font></li>

       </ul>

       <ul>

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the companies believe the air bags installed to meet the 30 mph test are dangerous,

        they should immediately notify all owners and recall these cars. Yet they have not done

        so.</font></li>

       </ul>

       <ul>

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Air bags that have been depowered will not have to be repowered to meet the 30 mph test,

        as the industry implies. Virtually all of the DOT unbelted male crash tests of recent

        model depowered air bag vehicles with unbelted males pass at 30 mph, and these vehicles do

        not yet contain the newer technologies available to meet the advanced air bag standard;</font></li>

       </ul>

       <ul>

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOT has estimated that as many as 397 lives will be lost annually if the 25 mph test is

        used as opposed to the 30 mph test;</font></li>

       </ul>

       <ul>

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over half of all fatalities occur in barrier equivalent crashes of 30 mph or above. And

        speed limits on roads have increased dramatically, with 29 states setting limits at 70 mph

        and higher, and 11 states permitting speeds or 75 mph and higher.</font></li>

       </ul>

      </blockquote>

     </blockquote>

     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We do not have to choose between saving unbelted occupants in

high-speed crashes and having safe air bags,&quot; said Rob Sanders, director of Parents

for Safer Air Bags. &quot;Both goals can be met with good design and engineering.&quot; </font></p>
