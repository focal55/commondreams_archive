FAIR Denounces Debate Commission's Exclusion of Minor-Party Candidates</div>

- September 27 - With a show of solemnity yesterday, the Commission on Presidential

Debates carried through its vow to exclude all minor-party candidates

from the nationally televised debates. Protests against the Commission

and its plans for restricted debates are expected to grow, including at

the site of the first debate in Boston, Oct. 3



<p>Established by the two major parties in 1987 with the publicly stated

intent of excluding competition to the two parties, the Commission cited

its "Nonpartisan Candidate Selection Criteria" in announcing its

decision. But the Commission, run by the former chairs of the national

Republican and Democratic parties who founded the group, contains no

representatives of third parties or independent voters. That's why the

Commission was able to establish an arbitrary 15 percent poll-support

barrier against third-party candidates just a year after Jesse Ventura

brought 10 percent poll support into the Minnesota gubernatorial

debates, and ended up winning the election

with 37 percent of the vote.



<p>The Commission went forward with its exclusion in the face of growing

calls for broader debates from editorial pages, columnists and political

figures across the political spectrum (Mario Cuomo, John B. Anderson,

Jesse Ventura, Oliver North, etc.). It ignored a Zogby poll (released

Sept. 13) indicating that roughly 60 percent of the American people want

Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan included in the debates.



<p>"Through the Internet and other sources, many Americans have educated

themselves about the illegitimacy of this Commission, which took control

of the debates from the genuinely nonpartisan League of Women Voters,"

commented FAIR's director Jeff Cohen. "The Commission is bent on debates

that limit ideas, viewpoints and ultimately viewers, especially young

and disaffected voters. The Commission and the two parties that set it

up seem happy with a political process aimed at shrinking numbers of

voters."



<p>The 1992 presidential debates that included Ross Perot (with 7-9 percent

poll support, he would have been excluded under today's threshold) had

record-breaking TV viewership, and the audience grew with each

successive debate.  Voter turnout in November went up in 1992, reversing

a 20-year decline. With Perot excluded by the Commission in 1996,

viewership nose-dived, as did voter turnout.



<p>The major party-dominated Commission on Presidential Debates is funded

by corporations such as AT&T and Anhueser-Busch that give major soft

money donations to those two parties.  The Commission seems unwilling to

adapt to the present-day reality of rising numbers of independent voters

and declining major-party affiliation.



<p>FAIR's Cohen concluded: "Americans who want broader, more democratic

debates

can speak out by calling on the TV networks to find a genuinely

nonpartisan sponsor for more inclusive debates. And they can speak out

by joining the protests in Boston."
