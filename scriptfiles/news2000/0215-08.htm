          CA - February 15 - The following was released today by the Center for 

          Marine Conservation: </font> 

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conservationists 

            gathered in California for an international shark conference expressed 

            outrage at today's announcement that the secretary of commerce has 

            bowed to pressure from Massachusetts politicians and is delaying a 

            long-overdue management plan for over-fished dogfish sharks off the 

            New England and Mid-Atlantic coasts. This decision, coupled with the 

            secretary's continued failure to put an end to the wasteful practice 

            of shark finning in the Western Pacific, has prompted a coalition 

            of environmental groups to send a letter to President Clinton and 

            Vice President Gore requesting that the administration address these 

            urgent shark management issues. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Through inaction 

            and delay, the administration is allowing sharks in U.S. waters to 

            be grossly over-fished and killed solely for their fins. These short-sighted, 

            risky policies affect some of the ocean's most vulnerable animals," 

            said Sonja Fordham, shark specialist for the Center for Marine Conservation, 

            who serves on two federal advisory panels for dogfish and other sharks. 

            "We are calling on the administration to put an end to this abuse 

            of sharks and the process by which they are managed." </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sharks are among 

            the most biologically vulnerable species over which the Department 

            of Commerce has management responsibility. Their slow growth, late 

            maturity, and small number of offspring leave them exceptionally vulnerable 

            to over-fishing and slow to recover from depletion. At the same time, 

            sharks, as top predators, are essential to maintaining the balance 

            of life in the sea. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Off the New England 

            and Mid-Atlantic coasts, spiny dogfish sharks are completely unprotected 

            from an intense, selective fishery for mature females. Regional fishery 

            management councils have spent years developing a plan to stop over-fishing 

            and rebuild the depleted breeding stock within ten years, as mandated 

            by the Sustainable Fisheries Act. After months of delay, the secretary 

            of commerce finalized the plan last month, but has now further delayed 

            implementation in response to political pressure from a handful of 

            members of Congress from Massachusetts -- the top dogfishing state. 

            </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The short-term 

            economic interests of one state are now jeopardizing the health of 

            the region's marine ecosystem as well as the conservation record of 

            the nation," said National Audubon Society scientist Dr. Merry Camhi 

            author of several reports examining shark management in state waters 

            and member of the dogfish advisory panel. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Delaying the 

            dogfish shark plan could cause the collapse of the population and 

            subverts the public process for conserving our nation's public marine 

            resources," added Wildlife Conservation Society's Dr. Ellen Pikitch, 

            who chairs the New England Fishery <br>

            Management Council's Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC). More 

            than a year ago, the SSC warned the Council that immediate restrictions 

            on dogfish catch were needed to avoid serious and long-standing population 

            decline. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Off Hawaii, shark 

            finning, slicing off a shark's valuable fins and discarding the sometimes-live 

            body at sea, has increased in recent years by more than 2000 percent. 

            Finning is banned in the U.S. Atlantic, and Department of Commerce 

            officials have repeatedly warned the Western Pacific Fishery Management 

            Council that continuation of this wasteful practice will not be tolerated. 

            Despite the council's refusal to act, the secretary of commerce has 

            failed to follow through with a ban. In response, Reps. Cunningham 

            (R-Calif.) and Saxton (R-N.J.) have introduced a bill to prohibit 

            finning in all U.S. waters. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Shark finning 

            in the U.S. Western Pacific is an egregious waste of public resources 

            and contributes to over-fishing of poorly understood shark populations," 

            stated Russ Dunn of the Ocean Wildlife Campaign. "While we strongly 

            support the efforts of Congress to halt finning, we are gravely concerned 

            that the secretary of commerce has left such a glaring stewardship 

            void." </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups are 

            calling on the administration to immediately enact the dogfish plan 

            and to ban shark finning in all U.S. waters. These actions would improve 

            consistency with U.S. shark policies in other regions of the country 

            as well as internationally. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In recent years, 

            the United States has emerged as a leading proponent of several global 

            initiatives aimed at conserving shark populations worldwide," added 

            Andy Oliver, program officer with the World Wildlife Fund who was 

            involved in the design of the 1999 United Nations International Plan 

            of Action for Sharks. "Failure by this administration to address these 

            glaring inconsistencies in U.S. shark policy undermines our nation's 

            credibility and leadership role in the international fisheries arena."
