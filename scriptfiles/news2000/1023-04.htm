<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK CITY 

- October 23 - News Advisory:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>WHO: </b>Susan Sarandon, Actress; Tim Robbins, Actor; 

          Michael Moore, Filmmaker (to be confirmed); Greg MacArthur, Businessman<b><br>

          WHAT: </b>Conference Call for Reporters<b> <br>

          WHEN: </b>12 Noon E.D.T., Wednesday, October 25, 2000 </font>

</p>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In an effort to encourage 

          independents, disgruntled Democrats and McCain supporters to vote for 

          presidential candidate Ralph Nader, a group of celebrities is announcing 

          an advertising campaign in states where Vice President Al Gore or Gov. 

          George W. Bush is strongly in the lead. </font>

<p></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Citizens for Strategic Voting says voters in all but 

          a small number of swing states can vote Nader without hurting Gore's 

          chances of beating Bush. This is the first ever national political advertising 

          campaign to target voters in non-swing states. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Political analysts believe that Nader could receive 

          the necessary five percent or more of the national popular vote to win 

          matching federal funds in 2004 if people understand that casting ballots 

          for Nader won't help Bush to be elected. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Why Voting for a Candidate Who Can't Win Is the Smartest 

          Thing You'll Ever Do," the full-page newspaper ad headline reads. "And 

          Don't Worry, a Vote for Nader is Not a Vote for Bush." </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins and filmmaker Michael Moore 

          will discuss the ad campaign during a conference call with reporters 

          on October 25, 2000. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The independent expenditure ad campaign was paid by 

          Citizens for Strategic Voting &#151; a group started by businessman 

          Greg MacArthur, grandson of billionaire insurance executive John D. 

          MacArthur (founder of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation) 

          and son to J. Roderick MacArthur, who created the MacArthur "genius 

          awards". Greg MacArthur is a businessman, documentary film producer 

          and former foreign correspondent for the Associated Press. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"People must understand that the President is chosen 

          by the electoral college and not by the popular vote," said MacArthur. 

          "This means that in all but a few swing states, people can follow their 

          hearts and vote for Nader without fearing that they will help elect 

          Bush." </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Gore and Nader can both win," MacArthur said. "Gore 

          needs the majority of electoral college votes to become President. Nader 

          needs at least five percent of the popular national vote to win matching 

          funds for a potential presidential run in 2004. Both are easily achievable 

          if people in states where either Gore or Bush is strongly ahead vote 

          for Nader." </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Citizens for Strategic Voting is running ads in newspapers 

          read by a large percentages of Democratic and Independent voters. The 

          papers include The New York Times (national edition), the Village Voice, 

          the Boston Globe, the Boston Phoenix, the Los Angeles Times, the Los 

          Angeles Weekly, the Austin American Statesman, the Austin Chronicle, 

          the San Francisco Chronicle, the San Francisco Examiner, the San Francisco 

          Bay Guardian and the Boulder Camera.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It does not matter if Gore or Bush win a state by one 

          vote or by one million votes," said MacArthur. "But a vote for Nader 

          can invigorate democracy by creating an equal playing field for fresh 

          new ideas.&quot; </font></p>
