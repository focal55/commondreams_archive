- June 5 - On June 2, 2000, the

        U.S. Trade Representative and Department of Commerce agreed to appoint environmentalists

        to two trade advisory committees dealing with paper and wood products. The two agencies

        dropped their appeal of a district court decision requiring the appointments to be made.

        The agencies have nearly two dozen advisory committees on trade policy that are comprised

        solely of industry representatives. Environmentalists went to court to shut down these

        committees until they had environmental representation. </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmentalists hailed the action: &quot;Finally, the first steps are being taken to

        right a long-standing wrong,&quot; said Earthjustice attorney Patti Goldman, who filed the

        lawsuit leading to the appointments. &quot;In a democracy, industry should not be the only

        interest represented in setting our trade policies.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On November 9, 1999, Federal District court Judge Barbara Rothstein ruled that the

        Trade Representative and Commerce Secretary had violated the Federal Advisory Committee

        Act by limiting membership on the paper and wood products committees to industry

        officials. The law requires that the advisory panels&#151;there are approximately two

        dozen concerned with international trade&#151;be &quot;fairly balanced.&quot; Judge

        Barbara Rothstein found that excluding environmentalists rendered the committees dealing

        with forestry imbalanced. This ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Earthjustice Legal

        Defense Fund on behalf of the Northwest Ecosystem Alliance, the Pacific Environment and

        Resources Center, Defenders of Wildlife, Sierra Club, Buckeye Forest Council, and the

        International Forum on Globalization.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Immediately following the judge&#146;s ruling, the paper products committees met

        without any environmental representatives. The environmental groups had to go back to

        court and obtain another ruling on December 7, 1999, directing the Administration to have

        an environmental representative at the next committee meeting. While the Administration

        made two environmental appointments, it did so under duress. In January, it appealed the

        judge&#146;s ruling. In dropping the appeal, the agencies will allow the environmentalists

        to stay on the committees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is a broader set of societal interests at stake here than those timber

        companies represent. So it's only right that citizens who want to protect forests get a

        seat at the table alongside corporations that exploit them for profit,&quot; said Doug

        Norlen of Pacific Environment &amp; Resources Center, who was appointed to the Paper and

        Paper Products committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The government&#146;s action extends only to the wood and paper committees. Another

        lawsuit seeks to add environmental representatives to the industry-only committee on

        chemicals, and more than a dozen industry committees, including committees on mining,

        energy, and tobacco, lack environmental representation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Victor Menotti of International Forum on Globalization observed: &quot;While this is a

        welcome first step, the government is forcing us to challenge each committee in court

        before it will comply with the law. Instead, it should revamp its entire system of giving

        industry preferred access.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dan Seligman of the Sierra Club agreed, &quot;The Administration has exposed its

        hypocrisy by calling for more public participation in the WTO but then retaining

        industry-only advisory committees at home.&quot;</font>
