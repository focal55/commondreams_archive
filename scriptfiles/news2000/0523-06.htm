- May 23 - A national environmental



group criticized China today for permitting the export of a highly



toxic material that has been used in feed and fertilizer in the



United States, and demanded that Chinese exporters take back the



material. So far, they have refused to do so.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to internal government memos that were leaked to the



Environmental Working Group (EWG), both federal and state



authorities are searching nationwide for products that may have



been made using the toxic, imported Chinese material. The



contaminant is cadmium, a heavy metal known to cause cancer and



other health problems. The cadmium was detected at extremely high



levels in shipments of zinc sulfate from China, a material used to



boost the nutritional value of animal feeds and farm and garden



fertilizers.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is very dangerous material to anyone exposed to the



product, from workers in the fertilizer and animal feed industry to



children playing in a garden where it may have been used," said



Todd Hettenbach, an analyst with EWG who has published a number of



reports on toxic chemicals in fertilizers. "Cadmium can cause lung



cancer and kidney disease, and the reported contamination levels in



these Chinese shipments are very, very high," Hettenbach said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This stuff could turn a vegetable garden into a Superfund



site," he added. "China must take this material back."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The unpublicized government investigation has found that "as



much as 1.3 million pounds (of contaminated material) entered the



U.S. at 10 different ports since the first contaminated shipment



was detected in November, 1999," according to one Environmental



Protection Agency memo. "With customs information we have



identified 14 importers that have received shipments of suspect



zinc sulfate."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cadmium-laced zinc sulfate has turned up so far in



California, Oregon, Washington and Mississippi. Chinese exporters



have refused to take the material back.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EWG, an environmental research organization, has conducted a



number of studies on the risks of toxic chemicals in both farm and



garden fertilizer products.</font>
