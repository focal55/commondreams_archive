- July 20 - As the Secretary General of the United Nations re-launched

his Global Compact with business today, an international coalition of human

rights and environmental organizations sent Kofi Annan a letter blasting

the initiative.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same time that the UN issued its <a href="http://www.corpwatch.org/trac/globalization/un/corplist.html">list of global corporations</a> which

endorsed the Compact-including Nike, Royal Dutch Shell and mining giant Rio

Tinto--the activist groups released their letter.  The groups, including

Third World Network, Greenpeace International and the Institute for Policy

Studies told the Secretary General that  "asking corporations…to endorse a

vague statement of commitment to human rights, labor and environmental

standards draws attention away from the need for more substantial action to

hold corporations accountable for their behavior."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Nike continues to move its sweatshops to union busting countries, Shell is

deeply involved in human rights and environmental violations around the

world, and mining colossus Rio Tinto is involved in so many debacles that

labor and environmental groups are engaged in a global campaign to halt its

abuses," said Kenny Bruno, UN Project Director for the Transnational

Resource and Action Center (TRAC) a watchdog group that continues to expose

misguided UN-corporate collaborations on its Corporate Watch website

<a href="http://www.corpwatch.org">www.corpwatch.org</a>.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"To believe that by signing a voluntary code such as the global compact

these companies will shape up is misguided," said Bruno.  "This initiative

will most likely provide abusive corporations with a prestigious platform

from which they can greenwash themselves."

</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Secretary General's office also issued guidelines today for

UN-corporate collaboration.  One of those guidelines allows for the

corporate use of the United Nations name and logo.  Although the criteria

limits the way corporations can use the UN name and logo, it still opens

the door to corporate greenwashing," said TRAC Director Joshua Karliner.

"For instance, in Nigeria a company like Shell could work with the UN to

fund a tree planting program in the Niger Delta-an area where it has

extracted billions of dollars in profits and wreaked social and

environmental havoc for decades.  Under the new guidelines the program

might have the logos of Shell and the UN superimposed , improving Shell's

public image, but doing little to alleviate the damage the company

continues to cause there." </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">July 20, 2000

</font></p>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan<br>

Secretary General<br>

Room 3800<br>

United Nations, NY 10017

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Secretary General,

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We write to you as individuals who care deeply about the United Nations and

on behalf of organizations that have worked for years to strengthen and

support it.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are writing to express our concern and reservations about the Global

Compact.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the one hand, we recognize the importance of bringing business behavior

in line with the universal values and standards represented by the nine

principles of the Global Compact.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, there are two aspects of the Global Compact that trouble us.

First, the text implies a universal consensus that open markets are the

primary force for development. As you are aware, there is intense debate

over the benefits and harms of free trade and market liberalization as

currently promoted by the WTO and other institutions.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many sectors of society do not concur with the Global Compact's vision of

advancing popular social values "as part and parcel of the globalization

process," to "ensure that markets remain open."  Many do not agree with the

assumption of the Global Compact that globalization in its current form can

be made sustainable and equitable, even if accompanied by the

implementation of standards for human rights, labor, and the environment.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We recognize that corporate-driven globalization has significant support

among goverments and business. However, that support is far from universal.

Your support for this ideology, as official UN policy, has the effect of

delegitimizing the work and aspirations of those sectors that believe that

an unregulated market is incompatible with equity and environmental

sustainability.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our second concern is the purely voluntary nature of the Global Compact,

and the lack of monitoring and enforcement provisions. We are well aware

that many corporations would like nothing better than to wrap themselves in

the flag of the United Nations in order to "bluewash" their public image,

while at the same time avoiding signficant changes to their behavior. The

question is how to get them to abide by the principles in the Global Compact.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Without monitoring, the public will be no better able to assess the

behavior, as opposed to the rhetoric, of corporations. Without independent

assessment, the interpretation of whether a company is abiding by the

Global Compact's principles or not will be left largely to the company itself.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the corporations being asked to endorse the Global Compact suggest

that while corporations SHOULD be responsible, efforts by governments to

hold corporations accountable to international values and standards are

harmful to development, innovation and human progress. Many in the NGO

community reject this premise. On the contrary, we stress that markets

cannot allocate fairly and efficiently without clear and impartially

enforced rules, established through open, democractic processes. Asking

corporations, many of which are repeat offenders of both the law and

commonly accepted standards of responsibility, to endorse a vague statement

of commitment to human rights, labour and environmental standards draws

attention away from the need for more substantial action to hold

corporations accountable for their behavior.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you are aware, the UN Subcomission on the Promotion and Protection of

Human Rights is currently drafting a legal instrument on TNCs and human

rights. We would look for your support for this initiative.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although it may take years before we can hope to achieve a binding legal

framework for the transnational behavior of business in the human rights,

environmental and labor realms, we believe it is necessary to start down

that road, and to begin building the political support for that goal now.

Therefore, the undersigned groups respectfully request you to re-assess the

Global Compact, taking into account the concerns above.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, we offer an alternative, the Citizens Compact, for your

consideration. The Citizens Compact stresses the importance of a legal

framework for corporate behavior in the global economy. The Citizens

Compact also provides suggested guidelines for interactions between the UN

and the private sector.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We invite your comments on the Citizens Compact and hope you will consider

endorsing it.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Again, we believe that bringing corporate behavior in line with the

universal principles and values of the United Nations is a goal of

extremely high importance. We look forward to working with you and the

entire United Nations system toward that goal.

</font>
