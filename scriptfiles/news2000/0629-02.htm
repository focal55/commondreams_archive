- June 29 - Today, 45 leading China experts sent a letter to President Clinton urging

him to delay the decision on deployment of national missile defense (NMD).

The letter called on President Clinton to allow more time to assess NMD's

impact on U.S -China relations and nuclear weapons proliferation. President

Clinton is scheduled to make a decision later this year whether to proceed

with the proposed NMD system. 



<p>Signatories include Arthur W. Hummel, Jr., former ambassador to China,

David Lampton, Director of China Studies at Johns Hopkins-SAIS, Harlan

Jencks, China security expert at the University of California, Berkeley;

William Kirby, director of Harvard's Asia Center, Lucian Pye, MIT China

scholar, David Shambaugh, China expert at George Washington University, and

John Holden, President of National Committee on U.S.-China Relations.



<p>"We are concerned that a precipitous decision to deploy [NMD] would

adversely affect U.S. relations with China by unnecessarily increasing

tensions between the two countries and provoking a series of negative steps

by China that would undermine American security..." the letter stated. 



<p>"Current plans for NMD deployment are likely to serve as a catalyst for

China to accelerate nuclear weapons modernization, since it believes that

even a simple missile defense configuration will leave its nuclear arsenal

vulnerable. A deployment decision at this time may also make U.S.

cooperation with China on a range of issues more difficult, particularly

with respect to Taiwan and regional security questions. In addition, the

U.S. plans to expand trade and economic relations with China would be

adversely affected by a precipitous NMD deployment decision." 



<p>"We urge you not to endorse deployment at this time," the letter concluded.



<p>In the past few weeks, similar letters to President Clinton by Russia

experts and former national security officials, including former Defense

Secretary William Perry and General John Shalikashvili, have called for a

delay in the deployment of NMD.  President Clinton has said he plans to

make a decision this fall.



<p>A growing number of foreign policy experts, scientists and policymakers are

calling on President Clinton to delay the NMD deployment decision," said

John Isaacs, president of Council for a Livable World, an arms control

organization. "This recent letter from China scholars highlights the wide

opposition to NMD deployment at this time."



<p>The full text of the letter and list of signatories is available by request.
