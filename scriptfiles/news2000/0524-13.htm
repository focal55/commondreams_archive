- May 24 - The following was released



today by Friends of the Earth:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After a long battle and a multi-million dollar campaign by big



business, Congress dealt the environment a blow today when it



approved Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China.



Environmentalists, however, cited the heated debate and last minute



victory as evidence that the end may be near for undemocratic trade



deals with no environmental safeguards.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The China PNTR deal proves how U.S. trade policy has been



captured by corporate polluters and fat cat campaign contributors,"



said Friends of the Earth (FoE) president Brent Blackwelder. "This



agreement addresses tariffs for everything from golf carts to



weasel tail hair, yet manages to completely ignore the air and



water we depend upon for survival."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Several Congressional environmental champions fought hard to



break the stranglehold big business has on U.S. trade policy," said



Courtney Cuff, Legislative Director for FoE. Cuff cited Reps.



DeFazio (D-Ore.), Miller (D-Calif.), Andrews (D-N.J.), Bonior



(D-Mich.), Pelosi (D-Calif.), Stark (D-Calif.), Kaptur (D-Ohio),



Woolsey (D-Calif.), Holt (D-N.J.) and Markey (D-Mass.) as the trade



deal's most vocal opponents on behalf of the environment.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cuff said the deal ignores opportunities to address vital



environmental problems like trade in endangered species, global



warming and potential destruction caused by invasive species.



Friends of the Earth claims the U.S. should have sought assurances



that China would not seek to weaken endangered species regulations



and invasive species protections once it enters the World Trade



Organization (WTO). The group also noted that the trade deal fails



to promote the export of clean, renewable energy technology to



China, where two million people die annually due to air and water



pollution.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Corporate interests spent millions so the environment could get



shortchanged," said Blackwelder. "But that won't stop us from



fighting the David against Goliath battle to ensure trade



agreements don't put the planet in jeopardy."</font>
