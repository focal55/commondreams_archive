<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 8 - Today's U.S. Defense Department review

of the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia shows that the alliance has

failed to learn from its mistakes in killing civilians, Human Rights

Watch charged today.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Pentagon review, released today in the course of Defense Secretary

William Cohen's testimony before Congress, states that the bombing

campaign was "the most precise and lowest-collateral-damage air

operation ever conducted" (p. xvii), but provides no evidence to

substantiate this summary assertion, nor any discussion of how many

civilians died, why, or whether these deaths could have been avoided.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, a 79-page Human Rights Watch report released yesterday

documents that the number of incidents in which civilians were killed in

the NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia is at least three times as high as

what the Pentagon has claimed.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Congress should insist that the Pentagon produce a franker and more

critical self-assessment," said Kenneth Roth, executive director of

Human Rights Watch.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Roth noted that for every bomb dropped and missile launched, civilians

were roughly twice as likely to die in Yugoslavia as they were during

the 1991 allied bombing campaign in Iraq.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The Pentagon failed to draw some important lessons about minimizing

civilian casualties in the Gulf War," said Roth.  "And it doesn't appear

to have learned anything from the Yugoslav experience, either.

Unfortunately, the lack of critical self-scrutiny in the Pentagon report

means that the many needless deaths in Iraq and Yugoslavia may well be

repeated in the next  war."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In its report on the Yugoslav bombing, Human Rights Watch identified

four areas in which NATO fell short of its obligation to minimize

civilian deaths.  These included: its use of cluster bombs in populated

areas, its attacks in populated areas during the day when civilians were

most likely to be present, its attacks on mobile targets without

ensuring that they were military in nature, and its decision to strike

some targets of little or no military value despite a substantial risk

of civilian death, such as Serb radio and television headquarters in

Belgrade.  Roughly half of the 500 civilian deaths in Yugoslavia are

attributable to such conduct, which violated international humanitarian

law.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the war, NATO tacitly but belatedly admitted several of these

errors.  In mid-May President Clinton secretly ordered an end to the use

of cluster bombs.  NATO commanders also ordered an end to daytime

strikes in populated areas and insisted on greater certainty that mobile

targets were military in nature before attacking them.  These

operational changes were welcome, but the Pentagon's report contains no

acknowledgment of any need for changes in NATO doctrine or practice.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Both targeting doctrine and bombing practice need to be updated

immediately to improve civilian protections," said William Arkin,

military consultant to Human Rights Watch.  "This was a war advertised

as humanitarian in purpose, in which the Pentagon stressed that it was

doing everything possible to minimize civilian casualties.  Yet its

report does not mention one measure taken or one lesson learned."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the contrary, the report contains a feeble justification of the

ongoing utility of cluster bombs without acknowledging their

unacceptable danger to civilians (p. 90).  Similarly, in commenting on

the Human Rights Watch report, Secretary Cohen and other NATO and

Pentagon officials have made diversionary references to the more

murderous conduct of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and to the

fact that the 500 civilian dead is supposedly smaller than pre-war

Pentagon estimates.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Those arguments are besides the point," said Roth.  "NATO has an

absolute duty to minimize civilian costs regardless of the conduct of

its adversary and regardless of the accuracy of its pre-war

predictions."



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many of the lessons to be drawn from NATO's bombing campaign in

Yugoslavia should also have been drawn from Operation Desert Storm in

Iraq, including lessons regarding the hazards of cluster bombs, the

danger of daytime bombing in populated areas, and the importance of

positively identifying mobile targets.
