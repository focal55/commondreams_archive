<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- February 14 - The Internal Revenue Service should

          investigate a New York City church for violating federal tax law by

          endorsing Democratic candidate Al Gore for president, says Americans

          United for Separation of Church and State.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In

          a formal complaint filed with the IRS today, Americans

          United Executive Director Barry W. Lynn charged that the Rev. Floyd

          Flake knowingly violated the Internal Revenue Code by inviting Gore to

          address his congregation on Feb. 13 and then endorsing the candidate

          during Sunday morning worship services at Allen African Methodist

          Episcopal Church in New York City.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to numerous press

          accounts, Flake, referring to Gore, told his congregation, &quot;I

          don't do endorsements from across the pulpit because I never know

          who's out there watching the types of laws that govern separation of

          church and state. But I will say to you this morning and you read it

          well: This should be the next president of the United States.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wrote Lynn in his letter to the IRS,

          &quot;This statement indicates that Flake is aware of the provisions

          in the Internal Revenue Code that bar houses of worship from endorsing

          or opposing candidates for public office but chose to ignore them.

          Such a flagrant violation of the law cannot be ignored.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under IRS rules, houses of worship

          and other non-profit organizations are barred from endorsing or

          opposing candidates for public office. The provision, found in section

          501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, is designed in part to prevent

          tax-exempt churches from being used for partisan political purposes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Rev. Flake seemed fully aware

          that his actions were wrong,&quot; said Lynn. &quot;In fact, he seemed

          to revel in flouting federal tax law. This type of brazen challenge to

          our nation's laws cannot and should not be ignored.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans United runs a special

          election-year effort called &quot;Project Fair Play.&quot; Under the

          project, Americans United seeks to educate churches about the law

          governing tax-exempt institutions and political activity. In cases of

          serious abuses of the law, AU reports offenders to the IRS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The IRS has signaled an increasing

          willingness to enforce the law. In 1995, it revoked the tax exemption

          of the Church at Pierce Creek, a Binghamton, N.Y.-area congregation

          that paid for full-page newspaper ads in late October of 1992,

          advising people that voting for Bill Clinton was a sin. Americans

          United had filed a formal complaint with the IRS about the church's

          partisan politicking.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Church at Pierce Creek sued

          unsuccessfully in federal court to win back its tax exemption. During

          the legal proceedings, the IRS stated that it has launched

          investigations of 31 houses of worship over allegations of partisan

          politicking.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans United is a

          non-partisan organization that works to protect religious freedom by

          defending the separation of church and state. Founded in 1947, the

          group has 60,000 members nationwide and his based in Washington, D.C.
