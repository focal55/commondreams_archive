- March 13 - Defenders of Wildlife,



11 other environmental groups and one individual today filed



suit against the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Fish



and Wildlife Service (FWS) in the U.S. District Court for the



District of Columbia seeking protection of the Canada lynx under



the Endangered Species Act (ESA). This suit is the fourth by



conservationists in a nearly 10-year legal battle to win such



a listing.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The goal of getting the Fish and Wildlife Service to protect the



lynx seems more elusive than the small cat itself," said Defenders



president Rodger Schlickeisen. "The Clinton administration's track



record in repeatedly delaying federal protection for the lynx is



one of the more flagrant abuses of the Endangered Species Act that



we've seen."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1997, Federal Judge Gladys Kessler ruled that the FWS had



unlawfully refused to propose listing the lynx under the ESA. The



ruling stated that FWS had "relied on glaringly faulty factual



premises, and ignored the views of its own experts" that the lynx



should be listed.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1998, Judge Kessler approved a settlement that called for FWS



to propose listing the lynx under the ESA on or before June 30, 1998.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FWS missed that deadline. A month later, FWS proposed listing the



lynx as threatened in the lower 48 states. A final listing decision



was due by July 1999, but once again the deadline was missed. FWS



extended the date by six months until January 8, 2000, but failed to



meet that deadline. The final rule reportedly is being held up by



the Office of Management and Budget, an agency with no legal



authority to delay ESA listing determinations. Conservationists



today filed suit against FWS over its failure to meet the ESA's



statutory deadline for publishing a final lynx listing rule.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Clinton administration's complete disregard for the law and



the conservation of the lynx is simply unconscionable," said Jasper



Carlton, executive director of the Colorado-based Biodiversity



Legal Foundation, one of the 11 groups. "It appears that this time



the Office of Management and Budget has illegally played a role in



delaying a final listing decision."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Canada lynx, the only lynx species in North America, is a



medium-sized wild cat that lives in far northern forests. The lynx



has large feet that function like snowshoes, allowing it to hunt in



deep snow. The species feeds primarily on snowshoe hares, other



small mammals and birds. Historically the lynx roamed throughout the



Northwest, the northern Great Plains and the Northeast. The U.S.



population has declined to a few hundred scattered individuals mostly



in Maine, Montana and Washington. One of the biggest threats to the



lynx is continued logging and roadbuilding in northern forests. A



predator high in the food chain, the lynx is an important species in



boreal forests and needs undisturbed habitat to survive.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Defenders and other environmental groups predict that habitat



destruction, trapping, hunting and loss of prey will soon drive the



lynx to extinction. FWS biologists, through extensive research on the



lynx and its habitat, have concluded that the U.S. lynx population

is



on the brink of extinction. Current populations are being splintered



into smaller, isolated populations that cannot connect with each



other owing clearcutting and roadbuilding.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plaintiffs in the suit include Defenders of Wildlife,



Biodiversity Legal Foundation, Northwest Ecosystem Alliance, Fund for



Animals, Humane Society of the United States, Kettle Range



Conservation Group, Oregon Natural Resources Council, Predator



Conservation Alliance, Restore: The North Woods, Superior Wilderness



Action Network, American Lands Alliance, Conservation Action Project



and Mark Skatrud. The plaintiffs are represented by Eric Glitzenstein



of the Washington, D.C. law firm of Meyer and Glitzenstein.
