- April 3 - A year to the day before his assassination on April 4, 1968, Martin Luther

King Jr. gave a landmark speech in which he denounced the Vietnam War -- and

challenged global economic relations (see: 

<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/speeches/contents.htm">http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/speeches/contents.htm</a>). Now, 32 years

later, hundreds of organizations are preparing to protest the policies of

the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in mid-April in

Washington, D.C. (see <a href="http://www.a16.org">http://www.a16.org</a>). The following activists are

available for interviews:

A colleague of King and pastor emeritus of the Holman United Methodist

Church in Los Angeles, Lawson said: "What Clinton and others call

'globalization,' King would call simply another way of continuing the

economic, political and military domination of Africa, Latin America and

Asia by the United States.... King envisioned a 'world house' where all

nations and all peoples would be moving towards authentic peace and human

solidarity. He saw the economic injustice of racism as a major obstacle for

the 'world house.'"

</a>Co-director of School of the Americas Watch, Richardson said: "In the same

tradition as King -- confronting violence with nonviolence -- we have

organized demonstrations to shut down the School of the Americas, which

trains Latin American militaries. The SOA has always been about protecting

U.S. economic interests. You can't have the economic policies of the IMF and

the World Bank without the military muscle to enforce it."

<a href="http://www.afsc.org">http://www.afsc.org</a>

Regional director of the American Friends Service Committee in San

Francisco, Riles said today: "Dr. King talked of a 'radical revolution of

values'; he spoke against greed, war and the weapons industry. Today, some

of the same corporations are using the IMF, World Bank and World Trade

Organization to further their interests. Developing countries need money -- 

but

as conditions for loans, they are forced to allow these transnational

corporations to exploit them, from their laborers to mineral resources to

genetic patents."

</a>Longtime peace activist and resident of Jonah House in Baltimore, McAlister

said: "We are living in a state where the government is of, by and for the

wealthy including the major corporations. They protect their interests by

any means necessary -- and that means war and weapons of mass destruction,

and poisoning the earth and the people of the earth." She is married to

Philip Berrigan, who last week was sentenced to 30 months in prison for

hammering a plane that bombed Iraq and Yugoslavia with depleted uranium.
