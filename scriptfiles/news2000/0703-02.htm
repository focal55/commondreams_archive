- July 3 - News Advisory:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On July 7, the Department of Defense is scheduled to conduct



only the third of 19 planned tests of the Clinton administration's



proposed national missile defense system. As the President



prepares to announce his decision on whether to deploy the system,



he is under increasing pressure from independent scientists,



military and diplomatic experts, Republicans and Democrats, as well



as U.S. allies, Russia and China not to make a precipitous decision



on NMD deployment.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The President has said he will base his decision on an



assessment of four criteria: the nature of the threat; the



feasibility of the technology; the cost; and the net effect on



national and international security. The third test will be the



last before the Pentagon's Deployment Readiness Review and the



President's deployment decision. What will the third test really



tell us about the feasibility and operational effectiveness of the



system? If it can be proven to "work" as designed, is it really



capable of stopping ballistic missiles? These and other issues will



be explored at a media briefing organized by the Coalition to



Reduce Nuclear Dangers on Thursday, July 6, at 9:30 a.m. at the



Murrow Room of the National Press Club.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The panel will include:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Henry Kelly, PhD, is president of the Federation of American



Scientists (FAS). Kelly is a physicist and was the assistant



director of technology at the Office of Science and Technology



Policy, and has served at the Office of Technology Assessment, the



Department of Energy and the Arms Control Disarmament Agency, where



he worked on energy and arms control issues. The FAS Board of



Sponsors includes more than 50 American Nobel Laureates.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Lisbeth Gronlund, PhD, is a staff scientist for the Union of



Concerned Scientists (UCS) and the MIT Security Studies Program.



Gronlund is a physicist specializing in technical issues related to



nuclear arms control and international security. She is a



co-author of the UCS-MIT report, "Countermeasures: A Technical



Evaluation of the Operational Effectiveness of the Planned US



National Missile Defense System."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Robert Park, PhD, is a professor of physics at the University



of Maryland and director of the Washington office of the American



Physical Society (APS). APS is the leading professional



organization of physicists, with 42,000 members worldwide. It has

just developed an organizational statement on NMD technical



feasibility and deployment.
