- October 9 - "Since 29 September, Israeli security forces have frequently

used excessive force on demonstrators when lives were not in

immediate danger," Amnesty International said today.



<p>In  preliminary conclusions from Amnesty International's

delegation in Israel and the Occupied Territories the human

rights organization reiterated its condemnation of the excessive

use of force by law enforcement officials.



<p>"In many cases the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), the

Israel Police and the Border Police have apparently breached

their own internal regulations on the use of force, as well as

international human rights standards on the use of force and

firearms," Amnesty International said.



<p>More than 80 people, including children, nearly all of

them Palestinians from the Occupied Territories and Israel, have

died since clashes began on 29 September 2000 between Israeli

security forces and Palestinian demonstrators all over the West

Bank and the Gaza Strip, as well as in Israel. There have also

been armed confrontations between the Israeli and Palestinian

security forces.



<p>An Amnesty International delegation is currently in

Israel and the Occupied Territories, including the areas under

the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, to examine

policing of demonstrations in view of the loss of life. The

delegation is composed of  Dr. Stephen Males, a former senior

Police officer of the UK police with special expertise in

sensitive public order policing, and Dr Elizabeth Hodgkin, a

researcher from the International Secretariat of Amnesty

International.



<p>The delegates have met NGOs, doctors and over 50

witnesses to the events. They have visited to sites in Ramallah,

Nablus, East Jerusalem, Nazareth, Arabah and other parts of

northern Israel, places where demonstrators have died after the

Israeli security forces fired on demonstrators and rioters. The

delegates have seen large quantities of expended and some live

ammunition, rubber-coated metal bullets, CS grenades and

projectiles, during visits to sites of demonstrations, as well as

bullets embedded in surrounding homes and much bullet damage.

<p>Amnesty International has compiled the following

preliminary conclusions:



<p>- In many cases security forces apparently used firearms when

their lives and the lives of others were not in imminent danger.

However, according to internationally adopted principles, law

enforcement officials shall only use firearms, if other means

remain ineffective or without any promise of achieving the

intended result. Firearms may be used against people, after

appropriate warnings are given, only to prevent death or serious

injury where less extreme  means are insufficient to achieve

these objectives. The standards underscore that law enforcement

officials may resort to the intentional lethal use of firearms

only when strictly unavoidable to protect life.



<p>- In some instances, Israeli security forces impeded wounded

persons from receiving access to medical assistance. Security

forces also reportedly fired on people helping to remove the

wounded, in two cases killing ambulance men. The International

Committee of the Red Cross has publicly appealed to all parties

to protect and assist the injured and all medical personnel in

their vital life-saving operations.



<p>- In instances where the security forces have not been deployed

against demonstrators, riots have generally not evolved and

crowds have dispersed. For example, after two days in which two

Palestinians were killed in demonstrations in Um al-Fahm in

Israel on 1 and 2 October, on 3 October security forces did not

arrive to police a demonstration and demonstrators dispersed

peacefully.



<p>Two Palestinian refugees were also reported killed in

south Lebanon on 7 October when Israeli troops opened fire across

the Lebanese-Israeli border on demonstrators protesting against

Israel.



<p>On 7 October, three Israeli soldiers were captured at

about noon by the Lebanese armed group Hizbullah. Amnesty

International calls on Hizbullah to accord the three soldiers

prisoner of war status and to allow them immediate access to the

International Committee of the Red Cross.  Amnesty International

notes that Hizbullah has publicly stated its intention to use the

three Israeli soldiers to secure the release of Lebanese and

other Arab prisoners held in Israel.



<p>Amnesty International reminds Hizbullah that

hostage-taking is prohibited by international law and is

inconsistent with fundamental principles of international

humanitarian law. Amnesty International has long called for the

release of Lebanese detainees held in Israel as hostages,

including Shaykh 'Abd al-Karim al-'Ubayd and Mustafa al-Dirani.



<p>A national commission established by the Israeli

government will investigate killings which occurred in Israel.

However, it is important that all killings are investigated which

occurred in circumstances suggesting that they violated

international law and standards. Investigations should be

conducted by an independent and impartial body and by one which,

in the current highly-charged political atmosphere, is perceived

as such.



<p>Amnesty International is therefore calling on the United

Nations to establish urgently an independent international

investigation, to include criminal justice experts known for

their impartiality and integrity, to investigate all killings of

civilians that took place since 29 September in Israel, the

Occupied Territories and south Lebanon.



<p>"To ensure independence and impartiality of the

international investigation, its members should exclude persons

whose background could appear to lack impartiality," Amnesty

International said.



<p>"The investigation should be properly resourced and

include ballistic, forensic or other technical experts that may

be required. It should report to the Commission on Human Rights,

the General Assembly and the Security Council, and the

authorities concerned should be obliged to cooperate fully with

the investigation."
