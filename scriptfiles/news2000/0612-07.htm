- June 12 - Representatives of several anti-gay organizations will meet

today with Procter & Gamble (P&G) executives to try to pressure the company

into reversing its decision not to sponsor a proposed Paramount television

show featuring "Dr." Laura Schlessinger, who has made repeated defamatory

remarks about gays and other groups of people.

<p>"Procter & Gamble has been a model of corporate responsibility for

refusing to profit off of 'Dr.' Laura's intolerance," said HRC spokesperson

Wayne Besen.  "We hope this meeting will not change or affect Procter &

Gamble's commitment to fairness and to treating all of its valued customers

with the dignity and respect they deserve."

<p>Today's meeting comes only one day after anti-gay Reform Party presidential

candidate Pat Buchanan named Schlessinger as a potential vice-presidential

running mate. Buchanan has made several  anti-gay statements in the past,

including, "The poor homosexuals. They have declared war on nature, and now

nature (AIDS) is exacting an awful retribution."

<p>According to a Family Research Council (FRC) news release, FRC Senior

Director of Cultural Studies Robert Knight will lead the meeting with P&G

officials at the company's Cincinnati headquarters to "encourage the company

to renew its support of Dr. Laura." After the meeting, the anti-gay

coalition will hold a press conference.

<p>P&G announced its decision not to advertise on the proposed program in a May

15 written statement saying, "We've chosen not to be involved with a show

that will require time and resources to deal with this kind of controversy."<p>

Other major companies who have distanced themselves from Schlessinger

include Xerox, AT&T, United Airlines, Toys 'R' Us and American Express.

<p>

Schlessinger has called gays "deviant," "biological errors," and has claimed

that "a huge portion of the male homosexual populous is predatory on young

boys." 

<p>The Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) has also blasted

Schlessinger, finding she uses "abusively discriminatory" language against

gays on her daily radio show. The CBSC's decision also suggested that

Schlessinger's anti-gay rhetoric may "fertilize the ground" for "brutality"

against gays and lesbians.  Schlessinger also has referred to marriages

between two people of different religions as "interfaithless" marriages.

<p>"Companies look at the derogatory comments she and her cohorts, such as

Knight and Buchanan, have made and are concerned about associating their

brand names and reputations with language that could lead to discrimination

or violence against gay and lesbian people," said Besen.

<p>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay political

organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies

Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that

lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and

in the community.
