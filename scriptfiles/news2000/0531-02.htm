- May 31 - Calling on their company to start making amends for the legacy of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, 5.3% of ExxonMobil shareholders voted in support of a resolution to cancel drilling plans in the Arctic Refuge at the company's annual meeting today in Dallas, Texas.



<p>"Eleven years after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the worst environmental disaster in US history, ExxonMobil shareholders called on their company today to start acting like a responsible corporate citizen in Alaska," said Athan Manuel, author of the resolution and director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group's (PIRG) Arctic Wilderness Campaign. "A record number of ExxonMobil shareholders -- more than 5% -- called on ExxonMobil to clean up its act and stay out of America's Arctic." 



<p>The Arctic Refuge shareholder resolution was one of three resolutions supported by Campaign ExxonMobil. Concerns about ExxonMobil's irresponsible corporate behavior led to the formation of Campaign ExxonMobil, which includes religious shareholders, environmental groups including U.S. PIRG, and socially responsible investors including Trillium Asset Management of Boston. Trillium filed the Arctic resolution in concert with the PIRG's Arctic Wilderness Campaign.



<p>The other resolutions supported by Campaign ExxonMobil call on the company to evaluate the impact of its proposed pipeline through Chad and Cameroon and to start work to reduce emissions that contribute to climate change.



<p>The ExxonMobil resolution was the third Arctic Refuge resolution filed and voted on by oil industry shareholders this year. All three received record shareholder support. On April 13, more thanthirteen percent of BP Amoco shareholders supported a resolution calling on BP Amoco to stay out of the Arctic Refuge, abandon their Northstar offshore oil field, and put more emphasis on solar power. Two weeks later more than seven percent of Chevron shareholders voted in support of a similar resolution. 



<p>For the last two years, the PIRG Arctic Wilderness Campaign has filed 5 shareholder resolutions and generated more than 35,000 e-mails, phone calls, and letters to ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP Amoco, and ARCO (recently merged with BP Amoco) in support of protecting the Arctic Refuge.
