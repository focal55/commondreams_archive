- February 8 - The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination 

          Committee (ADC), the nation's largest grassroots Arab-American organization, 

          strongly condemns the Israeli bombing of civilian areas in Lebanon last 

          night. The Israeli bomb attacks, which injured numerous civilians, including 

          women and children, and destroyed three major electrical power plants, 

          were in blatant violation of 1996 cease fire agreements brokered by 

          the United States which barred attacks on civilian targets. Israel has 

          declared the agreement &quot;null and void.&quot;</font>        

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Israeli attacks come in response to a series of 

          successful military actions by Lebanese resistance forces against Israeli 

          occupation troops in Lebanon. These actions were directed solely against 

          military targets and were staged away from civilian areas. Once again, 

          Israel has chosen to respond to actions directed against its occupation 

          troops by attacking civilian targets. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Israel has occupied southern Lebanon since 1978, when 

          the UN Security Council, including the United States, unanimously demanded 

          in Resolution 425 that Israel withdraw its troops from Lebanon &quot;forthwith&quot; 

          and without condition. For 22 years, Israel has ignored its obligations 

          under UNSCR 425 with impunity. ADC affirms that the Lebanese people 

          have an absolute right to resist Israeli military occupation of their 

          country. ADC also notes that Lebanese resistance against Israeli occupation 

          forces is in furtherance of the demands of UNSCR 425.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Israeli attacks on civilian targets are designed to 

          terrorize the Lebanese population and impede the rebuilding of the country. 

          The Lebanese people suffered for years without adequate electricity 

          during and after the civil war, and Israel has repeatedly attacked Lebanon's 

          power system, most recently in June, 1999. It is outrageous that Israel 

          should be attacking key civilian infrastructure sites at a time when 

          Lebanon is trying to rebuild itself. These unjustifiable bombings are 

          also a major blow to the prospects for peace, and cast further serious 

          doubts over the intentions of Israeli Prime Minister Barak.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ADC demands an immediate end to the unjustifiable Israeli 

          attacks on Lebanon. ADC President Hala Maksoud said &quot;we urge the 

          U.S. government take immediate action to put an end to these attacks. 

          Israel must at long last abide by UNSCR 425 and end its brutal occupation 

          of Lebanon. The international community, including the United States, 

          must ensure that the Lebanese are allowed to concentrate on putting 

          their lives back in order, instead of having their civilians terrorized 

          and their painstakingly rebuilt infrastructure destroyed by Israel.&quot;</font></p>
