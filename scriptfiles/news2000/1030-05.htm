- October 30 - Calling on political candidates and

their surrogates to refrain from using houses of worship as places to

endorse candidates and partisan agendas, the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy,

executive director of The Interfaith Alliance, issued the following

statement:



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“With only 8 days before Election Day, votes are getting more and more

precious.  But the urgency of campaigns can not be allowed to weaken our

protection of religious integrity.  In recent weeks, The Interfaith

Alliance has issued a call to religious leaders across the country,

asking them to reject partisan voter guides and reject candidates using

their houses of worship as places to campaign.  Political candidates

violate the sanctity of religion by seeking votes from pulpits.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Yesterday, President Clinton visited Alfred Street Baptist Church in

Alexandria, VA and Shiloh Baptist Church in Washington, DC, and

implicitly asked members of these congregations to support particular

candidates and a specific political agenda.  The President is not the

only politician to speak in a house of worship during this campaign.

Other candidates have made recent appearances in churches touting their

partisan agendas.  With the same vigor with which The Interfaith

Alliance has denounced the distribution of partisan voter guides in

houses of worship by organizations like the Christian Coalition, we are

also calling on all political candidates to refrain from politicizing

pulpits and imploring partisan votes from within worshipping

congregations.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The Interfaith Alliance has issued <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/Newsroom/press/001030BCltr.html">public calls to President Clinton</a>,

<a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/Newsroom/press/001030-cand_ltr.html">Governor Bush and Vice President Gore</a> asking them not to use houses of

worship across the country for partisan get-out-the-vote operations.  As

political candidates who have professed their faith openly to the

American people, it is my hope that they understand the risks they pose

to houses of worship that engage in this political activity.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“While I wholeheartedly encourage efforts of clergy to inform and to

inspire their congregants to cast informed votes on Election Day,

political endorsements, or even the appearance of a political

endorsement, from the pulpit or any sacred desk threatens to compromise

the sanctity of religion.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The campaigns of this election cycle have contained an unprecedented

amount of religious rhetoric with candidates making overt declarations

about the importance of religious faith in their lives.  People of faith

will play a decisive role—perhaps even the decisive role—in the outcome

of this election.  I see that as a positive prospect because the core

values that cut across our varied religious traditions are values that

strengthen the moral fabric and political process of our nation.  We

need people of faith involved in electoral politics.    Indeed, many of

us see voting as a spiritual discipline.  However, how people of faith

vote—for whom people of faith vote—is a matter of individual choice.”



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this fall, The Interfaith Alliance issued an “<a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/tiaf/aeygfhow.html">Election Year

Guide for Houses of Worship</a>,” which provides religious leaders with key

legal and ethical guidelines for the roles they can and should play in

this election year.  To read it online, visit

Drawing on shared religious principles, TIA advances a mainstream faith-based agenda dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in public life and challenges those who manipulate religion to promote an extreme political agenda.
