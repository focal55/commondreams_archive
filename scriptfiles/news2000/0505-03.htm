- May 5 - The Feminist Majority Foundation condemns the public stoning of a woman to 

  death in Northern Afghanistan by the Taliban militia for allegedly committing 

  adultery and calls for an end to the brutal gender apartheid regime that continues 

  to terrorize the women and girls of Afghanistan. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The on-going and increasing brutality of the Taliban regime is evident in 

  this latest appalling human rights atrocity," proclaimed Eleanor Smeal, president 

  of the Feminist Majority. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second reported public execution of a woman carried out in the past six 

  months, the stoning took place in a sports stadium in Mazar-e-Sharif before 

  several thousand people. There has been no report of what happened to the man 

  involved in the alleged affair.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Feminist Majority Foundation calls on President Clinton and Secretary 

  of State Albright to publicly condemn this brutal murder and to increase US 

  pressure to restore the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan fully and permanently. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Official Taliban decrees, punishable by beating, stoning, and death, ban women's 

  work, education, and mobility. Afghan women and girls risk their lives daily 

  to realize the very basic human needs. Even after international condemnation, 

  the Taliban have only made slight and unofficial changes to their gender apartheid 

  policies. Despite these changes, the overall reality of Afghan women and girls 

  has remained unchanged. Women and girls in Afghanistan continue to live under 

  virtual house arrest. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Afghan's continue to make up the world's largest refugee population with an 

  estimated 2.5 million refugees in Pakistan and Iran alone. On-going Taliban 

  military offensives have resulted in gross human rights violations and massive 

  displacement of the civilian population, particularly women and children. According 

  to UN estimates, over the course of 1999 an additional 200,000 persons have 

  fled the fighting and an estimated 258,600 remain internally displaced. Ironically 

  Afghanistan's estimated one million war widows ranks it among the countries 

  with the highest female-headed household population. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 160 women's and human rights organizations join The Feminist Majority 

  Foundation's Campaign to Stop Gender Apartheid in Afghanistan in imploring the 

  United States and the United Nations to do everything in its power to help restore 

  the rights of Afghan women and girls. The Campaign continues to press the United 



  States government to deny the Taliban recognition until the rights of women 

  and girls are fully and permanently restored, to increase humanitarian assistance 

  directed to Afghan women and children, and to increase refugee admission of 

  women and girls fleeing the brutal gender apartheid regime.
