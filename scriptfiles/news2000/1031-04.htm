- October 31 - Farmers, Vietnam veterans, health-impacted and environmental



health and justice groups today issued a warning that the dioxin



industry is funding six members of the review panel scheduled to



review the EPA's reassessment of the chemical dioxin tomorrow and



Thursday (Nov. 1 &amp; 2).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"For 50 years, the tobacco industry kept our government from



taking action against smoking," explained Lois Gibbs, executive



director of the Center for Health, Environment and Justice (CHEJ),



a Falls Church, Va.-based nonprofit organization. "The tobacco



companies did this by paying certain scientists to go to meetings



like tomorrow's meeting of the Dioxin Reassessment Review Committee



of the US EPA Science Advisory Board. The tobacco industry-funded



scientists questioned every study that showed that nicotine was



addictive and that cigarettes were making people sick. The



cigarette scientists raised doubts and insisted that there needed



to be more research before any protective action could be taken.



That's exactly what we can expect from the dioxin industry-funded



scientists tomorrow."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Six of the committee members -- Stephen Brown, Kenny Crump, John



Graham, William Greenlee, Genevieve Matanoski and Dennis



Paustenbach -- have received organizational support from 91



dioxin-polluting corporations. A full list of the firms and those



who received contributions is attached. Two of the committee



members, Morton Lippmann and Genevieve Matanoski, were involved in



a 1990 controversy in which they did not disclose their ties to a



tobacco industry-funded think tank while serving on an EPA panel



reviewing the health effects of secondhand smoke.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Industry doesn't have to control a majority of the scientists



on a committee to advance their agenda," said Charlotte Caldwell,



of the Indigenous Environmental Network. "The 50-year history of



the tobacco industry's control of public policy shows that you just



need a few, well placed scientists on every decision-making body to



serve as the skeptics."</font>
