          Gore today to honor a promise he made to the people of the Ohio River 

          Valley and western Pennsylvania eight years ago by shutting down the 

          Von Roll Waste Technologies Industries incinerator.  The incinerator 

          has both failed test burns and been criticized in a damning 1994 GAO 

          report that Vice-President Gore himself requested.  &#147;Mr. Gore,&#148; 

          Nader stated, &#147;after seven years of double-talk and delays, the 

          time has come to shut down this incinerator.  Workers should be given 

          two years full severance pay by their negligent employer, WTI.&#148;</font>

        <p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 

          hazardous waste incinerator in East Liverpool, OH burns 60,000 tons 

          of hazardous waste every year, making it one of the largest incinerators 

          of its type in the world, despite the fact that its permit expired in 

          1995.  It is located in an area with a history of environmental contamination, 

          on a flood plain, and less than 400 yards away from an elementary school, 

          in violation of numerous state and federal environmental regulations.  

          Among the toxins that the incinerator releases into the air are dioxins, 

          furans, and metals such as chromium, mercury, lead, and arsenic.  &#147;Any 

          incinerator that emits almost a pound of mercury into the air every 

          day can&#146;t be good for our children&#146;s ability to learn,&#148; 

          Nader noted.</font></p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Campaigning 

          for Vice-President in 1992, Al Gore called the incinerator, then in 

          construction &#147;unbelievable,&#148; adding: &#147;the Clinton-Gore 

          administration is going to give you an environmental presidency to deal 

          with these problems.  We&#146;ll be on your side for a change.&#148;  

          Today Nader commented: &#147;this is just the sort of phony populist 

          rhetoric that Mr.  Gore has tried to sell the American public in this 

          election year.&#148;</font></p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After 

          the 1992 election, Gore called for a GAO report on the incinerator, 

          arguing that: &#147;a thorough investigation is urgently needed.  Too 

          many questions remain unanswered about the impact of this incinerator 

          and the process in which it was approved.&#148;  Yet on January 8, 1993 

          despite promises from President Bush&#146;s EPA Administrator William 

          Reilly for a smooth transition, accommodation from the Bush administration 

          on other environmental issues, and a meeting between Reilly and top 

          Gore aide Katie McGinty, a permit for trial-burns was issued.  &#147;Last 

          week I wrote a letter to Al Gore asking him to disclose whether he asked 

          the Bush EPA to postpone the approval of a test burn,&#148; Nader told 

          an audience today in East Liverpool. &#147;He has not responded to this 

          question.&#148;</font></p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 

          trial-burns that were conducted in 1993 revealed that the incinerator 

          released toxins in quantities greater than the already dangerously high 

          levels allowed by the EPA.  Mercury and dioxin levels were far higher 

          than expected, giving the Clinton Administration ample reason to deny 

          approval of full commercial operation to the Von Roll WTI incinerator.  

          As the September 1994 GAO report that Gore himself requested noted, 

          toxic emission standards were lowered by Gore&#146;s own EPA in order 

          to allow the incinerator to operate. &#147;In each case [where toxic 

          emissions exceeded allowable levels],&#148; the report explains, &#147;EPA 

          responded to the trial burn results by changing the operating conditions 

          under which the incinerator could continue to operate.&#148;</font></p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#147;I 

          am challenging Al Gore and the Clinton EPA, which Gore has overseen, 

          to adhere to their own declared principles,&#148; Nader stated.  &#147;If 

          Gore can&#146;t stand up for the people against this outrageously dangerous 

          polluter, should anyone believe he will ever fight for the people, and 

          not the powerful?  He hasn&#146;t even made good on his current election 

          year promise to conduct a binding review of the EPA&#146;s relationship 

          with WTI that was due in May.&#148;</font></p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#147;Al 

          Gore knows how to talk the talk on environmentalism and public health,&#148; 

          Nader said, &#147;but when it comes time to stand up to corporate power 

          and get results, he won&#146;t even attempt to walk the walk.&#148;
