- July 13 - To best protect freedom of speech on the Internet, companies should

be required to meet stringent legal standards before courts order the disclosure of the

identities of people who post Web messages about those companies, Public Citizen said in a

brief filed this week.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen filed the <i>amicus curiae</i>

(friend of the court) brief in a New Jersey case in which Dendrite International, a

supplier of sales force software products and support services to the pharmaceutical

industry, sued four anonymous people who posted messages about the company on a Yahoo!

message board. Dendrite is alleging that three of the message posters made false

statements, that two of them who identified themselves as employees violated employment

agreements, and that three of them published secret information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen contends that the court should not order Yahoo! to disclose their

identities unless Dendrite provides direct proof to support the allegations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This lawsuit is a blatant attempt to intimidate all of Dendrite&#146;s

employees,&quot; said Paul Levy of Public Citizen

Litigation Group, which filed the brief. &quot;The company is in effect warning

workers not to exercise their First Amendment right to speak freely about the company on

the Internet.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Internet, Levy argued, is &quot;the modern equivalent of the Speakers&#146; Corner

at Hyde Park. That&#146;s where anybody can stand up and voice their opinions -- however

silly, profane or brilliant they might seem -- to anyone who chooses to listen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It would be disturbing if courts were to permit the disclosure of the identities

of people who post messages anonymously,&quot; Levy said. &quot;The First Amendment

guarantees people a right to speak out and participate in public debates. A message board

is just that: an ongoing public debate.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this case, Dendrite is a public figure for the purposes of the First Amendment, Levy

argued. Public figures must meet higher standards to prove they have been defamed. Levy

also noted that Yahoo! reminds users that the message boards are not connected with the

company, and that messages are only the opinions of the posters. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dendrite is suing over a wide range of statements. One person, for instance, posted a

message complaining about pressure from management to produce, while another said that

employees were leaving Dendrite in droves. Some of the statements were too vague to be

deemed capable of being defamatory, Levy said. Others should not be subject to such a

lawsuit because they are pure opinion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Some of the statements at issue in this case, especially the statements that

workers are not treated very nicely by management, are hardly the stuff over which the

typical libel suit is filed,&quot; Levy said. The sole reason to sue, Levy said, is to

find out who posted the messages and possibly subject them to retribution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen argued in its brief that, because the main purpose of such suits is

often to unmask the company&#146;s critics, the identification of those critics should be

treated as a major form of relief that cannot be awarded without proof of wrongdoing. A

company should not be able to deny members of the public the right to speak anonymously

simply by filing a complaint and making vague allegations of wrongdoing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen filed the brief because it champions free speech rights. The

organization is currently representing a person who posted anonymous messages on a Yahoo!

message board about Thomas &amp; Betts Corporation, a Tennessee manufacturer of electrical

components. In that case, too, the company has gone to court to compel Yahoo! to reveal

the person&#146;s identity, as well as the identities of other message posters. The

company contends that they made statements that were defamatory or contained proprietary

information to drive down the company&#146;s stock price.</font>
