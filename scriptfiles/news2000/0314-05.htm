<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BOSTON 

- March 14 - </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1. What is the situation now?</b> </font>

</p>

<p></p>

<ul>

	

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Torrential rains and flooding in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland 

	  and South Africa have left tens of thousands of families homeless. An 

	  estimated 1.5 million people have been affected by the floods in Mozambique, 

	  another 0.5 million in Zimbabwe. Of these, 251,000 people in Mozambique 

	  and 20,000 in Zimbabwe have been displaced from their homes. It is impossible 

	  to know just how many people were swept away by the rising waters, but 

	  estimates run into the thousands. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While most attention has been given to Mozambique, in neighbouring 

	  Zimbabwe the country's major rivers also overran their banks, destroying 

	  homes, bridges, dams, roads, schools, clinics and farmland. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In both countries the greatest damage occurred in the Limpopo and 

	  Save river basins, in eastern and southern Zimbabwe and southern Mozambique. 

	  The Mutirikwi and Runda rivers in Zimbabwe also flooded, as did the 

	  Buzi in Mozambique. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rescue in the sense of plucking people out of trees has wound down 

	  this week. However, thousands remain stranded on islands of high ground 

	  and require food and water. As the waters recede, people will return 

	  to homes where they will continue to require outside assistance to reestablish 

	  the provision of clean water, as well as food and shelter. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Health concerns are pressing. There is an immediate threat of a cholera 

	  outbreak, due to contaminated water and crowded conditions. The floodwaters 

	  have also provided excellent breeding grounds for malaria-bearing mosquitoes. 

	</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>2. What is Oxfam doing?</b></font></p>

<ul>

	

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oxfam America is supporting the relief efforts of our long-term development 

	  partners; Oxfam America has been working in Mozambique since 1980. OA 

	  is also collaborating with other members of Oxfam International, under 

	  the coordination of the emergency relief section of Oxfam Great Britain. 

	</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oxfam has concentrated its activities in Mozambique's Gaza Province, 

	  first assisting in the rescue mission of stranded people, and providing 

	  water and sanitation facilities to camps of displaced peoples in Macia 

	  which now hold 40,000 people. This is being done in concert with Mozambican 

	  emergency coordinating committees. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oxfam procured and transported relief goods not immediately available 

	  in Mozambique. These included plastic sheeting, blankets and water kits, 

	  which were airfreighted to Maputo for distribution. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oxfam undertook a full public health assessment and deployed a water 

	  and sanitation team (five engineers, two public health specialists, 

	  and two logisticians) plus 20 tons of equipment and supplies in Macia, 

	  the most affected zone in Mozambique. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oxfam is currently providing water for most of the 52,000 displaced 

	  people in and around Macia. Installation of equipment continues in hopes 

	  of increasing the number of litres per person provided per day. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oxfam has built some 200 latrines in the camps in the Macia area, 

	  and will soon launch a public health education campaign focused on cholera 

	  prevention. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oxfam has also conducted aerial and ground surveys of Chibuto in the 

	  Limpopo, Save and Buzi river basins. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Outside of the work in displaced peoples' camps, Oxfam has produced 

	  and distributed five hundred family survival kits in Gaza and Maputo 

	  provinces. These kits contain essential household items, including plastic 

	  sheeting, blankets, biscuits, salt, sugar, tea, beans, oil, sardines, 

	  saucepans, soap, utensils, plates and cups, and matches. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lastly Oxfam responded quickly to the second wave of flooding on February 

	  26-27 by procuring inflatable boats with outboard motors in South Africa, 

	  and deploying them in collaboration with a local partner organization 

	  and South African volunteers. In the Limpopo basin, they rescued more 

	  than 1,000 people. The boats have now been passed over to the new central 

	  coordination unit. </font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>3. What needs to be done next?</b></font></p>

<ul>

	

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oxfam plans to extend its water and sanitation work to other areas 

	  as the flood waters recede, including Chibuto, Chokwe and Xai-Xai in 

	  <b>Mozambique's </b>Gaza province. In the Save Valley area of southern 

	  Sofala province and northern Inhambane province, Oxfam will provide 

	  further technical support in water and sanitation to relief efforts 

	  being carried out by other organizations. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Camps sheltering 5,500 displaced people near the towns of Chibuto, 

	  Chokwe and Xai-Xai require immediate water and sanitation facilities. 

	  In addition, functioning water facilities must be reestablished throughout 

	  the zone before displaced people begin moving back to their homes. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Save Valley, Oxfam plans to provide equipment and staff to 

	  improve the temporary water supply in camps housing 10,000 displaced 

	  people, as well as temporary water provision in the towns of Mambone 

	  and Machanga. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Mozambique, once the flood waters recede, Oxfam will assist local 

	  organizations to help people rebuild their lives, providing materials 

	  such as seeds, tools and building supplies. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In <b>Zimbabwe</b>, waters have receded and people are returning to 

	  their homes. Emergency shelter is needed for families to live in as 

	  they rebuild their homesteads. Oxfam plans to support the reconstruction 

	  and rehabilitation efforts of two longstanding partners, Zimbabwe Project 

	  Trust and ORAP in eastern and southeastern parts of the country. This 

	  will include home-building, re-drilling of collapsed boreholes and reconstruction 

	  of breached dams. Food aid will be essential in the medium term. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The situation changes daily and Oxfam adapts its relief efforts accordingly. 

	</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>4. How can I help?</b></font></p>

<ul>

	

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cash or credit card donations are the best way, so that supplies may 

	  be purchased in the region. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please do not donate goods, since they cannot be transported efficiently. 

	</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many Mozambicans and Zimbabweans have volunteered in relief and rescue 

	  efforts, so volunteers from the US are not needed. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To make a donation, call 1-800-77-OXFAM (6-9326). Or you can mail 

	  a check made out to Oxfam America to: </font></li>
