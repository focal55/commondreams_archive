- June 5 - The Labor Party challenged



today each of the major Presidential candidates to take an important



step toward solving the nation's health care crisis by adopting, as

a



key component of their campaigns, the Labor Party's Just Health Care



plan.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter to Pat Buchanan, George W. Bush, Al Gore and Ralph



Nader, the Labor Party outlined its call for national health



insurance, demonstrated its innovative and equitable funding



mechanism and challenged each candidate to endorse the program.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There is absolutely no excuse for any candidate to oppose Just



Health Care. By eliminating administrative waste and profit, this



country can afford to cover all its residents with quality health



care from birth to death. We challenge the candidates to solve the



health care crisis by pledging to implement Just Health Care," said



Tony Mazzocchi, National Organizer of the Labor Party and former



national officer of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers



International Union.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Labor Party is the nation's only political party with a



comprehensive solution to the health care crisis that ensures



coverage for all residents, raises revenues in an equitable fashion



and provides a Just Transition for displaced health industry workers.



By eliminating administrative waste and profit in the health care



system, the United States can provide comprehensive health care



coverage to every resident of the United States for the same total



amount of money (an estimated $1.213 trillion for 1999) that we now



spend.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Labor Party proposes to keep most existing government revenues



in place (nearly half the current U.S. health care budget); implement



a variety of mechanisms to make the wealthy pay their fair share; and



impose a modest tax on all employers (a dramatic windfall for



employers now purchasing health care). A briefing paper detailing the



Just Health Care financing plan is available by calling 202 234-5190.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Key Features of the Just Health Care Revenue Stream

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Employer contribution of 3.303 percent of payroll: $155.1



billion



<br>

-- Income tax on the wealthiest 5 percent of taxpayers: $161.9



billion<br>

-- Tax on stock and bond transactions: $128.4 billion<br>

-- Projected budget surplus: $100 billion<br>

-- Corporate tax shelter loopholes: $60 billion<br>

-- Existing federal and state tax revenues: $533.3 billion<br>

-- Household out of pocket costs and existing non-patient



revenues: $74.8 billion<br>

-- Total Revenue: $1.213 trillion

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The savings from the elimination of private insurance will come at



the expense of jobs in the health care industry. The Labor Party



proposes to fund a Just Transition for the nearly 1.25 million



workers industry workers by capturing a share of the employer



windfall over the first three years of the new system. In other



words, employers that currently pay for health insurance will



continue to pay all or part of the higher rate for the first three



years. Just Transition includes:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Full take-home pay and benefits for up to four years, or<br>

-- A wage subsidy for any worker who takes a job that pays less



than the old job; and<br>

-- Full tuition for up to four years if the worker chooses to



attend school.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With more than 44 million Americans without health insurance and



many millions more under-insured, forgoing needed care and medication



because of high co-payments and deductibles, the time to act is now.



We don't need so- called reforms that amount to no more than



band-aids on a gaping wound. We challenge the candidates to adopt our



program or explain to the American people why it should not be



adopted," said Robert E. Wages, Executive Vice President of the



Paper, Allied- Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International



Union (PACE).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Labor Party is a new political party comprised of unions



representing two million workers including seven international unions



-- including the United Mine Workers of America, the American



Federation of Government Employees and the Paper, Allied-Industrial,



Chemical and Energy Workers International Union -- thousands of local



unions and individual members. Labor Party members across the



country will take this challenge to their congressional candidates



and to the Presidential nominating conventions this Summer.
