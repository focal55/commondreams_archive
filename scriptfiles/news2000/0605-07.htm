- June 5 - Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union

(CU)'s Washington DC office, today said the Federal Communications

Commission's approval of the merger of AT&amp;T and MediaOne "defies

logic" and "smacks of political favoritism for one company," citing

the fact that the merger would violate the FCC's cable ownership

limits.

</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kimmelman said CU would seek to have the decision overturned in

court.  He said the organization would also ask Congress to

restructure the FCC's merger authority in light of the Commission

"blatantly undermin&#91;ing&#93; its legal mandate to protect the

public from monopolistic abuses."

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In clearing the AT&amp;T/MediaOne merger, the FCC has disregarded

critical facts, its own rules and legal standards to help one giant

cable monopoly expand its dominance over the cable television and

broadband Internet markets," Kimmelman said.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Rather than use its merger authority to protect the public

against an expanding monopoly, the Commission has allowed AT&amp;T to

extend the reach of its cable and broadband Internet service

monopolies and extended the time during which it can abuse consumers

and harm potential competitors.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Rather than apply clear rules prohibiting one cable company from

controlling more than 30 percent of the cable market, the Commission

has created an enormous loophole which grants AT&amp;T substantial

control over more than 40 percent of the market if it sells its

interests in programming.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"And rather than address the Justice Department's antitrust

finding that narrowband Internet services do not compete with

broadband Internet services, the Commission has done nothing to

prevent AT&amp;T from discriminating against independent Internet

service providers for the more than 40 percent of the U.S. cable

households that AT&amp;T will have substantial control over.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This decision is so inconsistent with the Commission's own

factual depiction of AT&amp;T's market dominance that it defies

logic.  It is so inconsistent with the standards of proving that a

merger is in the public interest, as articulated by the FCC in its

Bell Atlantic/Nynex decision and all relevant mergers since then,

that it is legally suspect.  And this decision has so clearly

undermined the barrier to expanding cable monopolies Congress called

for through establishment of a cable ownership cap, that it smacks of

political favoritism for one company.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Because the FCC clearly failed to meet its own public interest

standard or abide by its cable ownership and procedural rules in

approving this merger, Consumers Union will seek to have the decision

overturned in court as arbitrary and capricious.  But more

importantly, because the FCC has blatantly undermined its legal

mandate to protect the public from monopolistic abuses, we will ask

Congress to restructure the FCC's authority to prevent this from

happening again in the future."
