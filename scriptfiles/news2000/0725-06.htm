- July 25 - The Human Rights Campaign today issued a report on the

record on gay and AIDS issues of Richard B. Cheney to whom Texas Gov. George

W. Bush formally offered the Republican vice presidential nomination.

Cheney, a former defense secretary in the administration of Bush's father,

and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1978-1989, has an

extremely conservative record, HRC noted. Like Gov. Bush, however, Cheney

seeks to package a conservative record with a moderate image, the

organization said.

<p>"The choice of Secretary Cheney is in keeping with Governor Bush's strategy

of staking out conservative positions and wrapping them in a moderate

package," said Winnie Stachelberg, HRC's political director.

<p>As a Wyoming congressman, Cheney opposed early efforts to address the

HIV/AIDS crisis. Most notably, he was one of 13 House members who voted

against the AIDS Federal Policy Act of 1988, the first major bill to provide

funding for HIV/AIDS counseling and testing. Cheney also supported an effort

to reduce funding for HIV/AIDS research.

<p>In addition, Cheney voted against the Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 1988 and

supported an amendment that added anti-gay language to the bill.

<p>As defense secretary, Cheney supported Pete Williams, the department's chief

spokesman, when The Advocate magazine revealed his homosexuality. "I have

operated on the basis over the years with respect to my personal staff that

I don't ask them about their private lives," said Cheney. "As long as they

perform their professional responsibilities in a responsible manner, their

private lives are their business."

<p>Cheney opposed President Clinton's effort to lift the ban on gays serving

openly in the military. Cheney told CNN in 1993, "I am one of those people

who believes that people's sexual preference and orientation are a private

matter. It's something that is a personal matter for them, and no one else's

business. And that's the way I ran the civilian side of the Pentagon...On

the military side, though, you can't pursue that policy."

<p>Later in the interview, Cheney said: "I basically don't believe in

discrimination, but I did conclude, as secretary of defense, that the ban on

gays in uniform was appropriate."

<p>HRC has endorsed Vice President Al Gore for president. He has yet to name a

running mate.

<p>Cheney is currently the chief executive officer of the Halliburton Co., a

publicly traded company that supplies equipment to the oil industry.

Halliburton does not have a non-discrimination policy that includes sexual

orientation nor a domestic partner program for gay employees.

<p><i>HRC is the largest national lesbian and gay political organization,

with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress,

provides campaign support, and educates the public to ensure that lesbian

and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at work, and in the

community.</i>
