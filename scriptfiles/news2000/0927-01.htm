WASHINGTON 

- September 27 - With debt relief and other issues such as the environment and

transparency

dominating the IMF and World Bank meetings in Prague, relatively

little

attention has been paid to the question of economic growth.  It is

commonly

believed that the economic globalization of the last two decades has

fostered economic growth. However, the official data tell a very

different story, according to a report released today by the Center

for Economic and Policy Research, in Washington, DC.



<p>"A whole generation has been lost to most of the developing world,"

said economist Mark Weisbrot, co-director of CEPR and co-author of the

report. "Twenty-years is a long time, and the policies of the IMF and

the World Bank, and other globalizing, unaccountable institutions have

clearly failed to promote economic growth."



<p>Economic growth over the last 20 years has slowed dramatically,

especially in the less developed countries, as compared with the

previous two decades (1960-1980):



<p>* From 1960-1980, output per person grew by an average, among

countries, of 83%. For 1980-2000, the average growth of output per

person was 33%.



<p>* Mexico would have nearly twice as much income per person today if

not for the growth slowdown of the last two decades; Brazil would have

even more than twice its current income per person.</p>

<p>* In Latin America, GDP per capita grew by 75% from 1960-1980, whereas

from 1980-1998 it has risen only 6%. For sub-Saharan Africa, GDP per

capita grew by 36% in the first period, while it has since fallen by

15%.



<p>"There is no region in the world that the IMF and the Bank can point

to as a success story for their policies," said Weisbrot. "And in some

places-- such as Russia, which lost half of its income in the 1990's--

they have presided over economic collapses that have never been seen

in the absence of war or a major natural disaster."



<p>The report, including tables and graphs, also discusses the impact of

globalization on American workers. The real median wage today is about

the same as it was 27 years ago, meaning that the majority of the US

labor force has failed to share in the gains from economic growth over

the last 27 years.
