<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 2 - In a letter, Elizabeth Birch, executive director for the Human

Rights Campaign, urges fair-minded California candidates seeking U.S. House

of Rep. And Senate seats to show their leadership by publicly opposing the

ill-conceived Knight Initiative/Proposition 22. Already, hundreds of public

officials and leaders from many religious and civil rights groups have

publicly voiced their opposition. Each California candidate's public stands

on the Knight Initiative will be a key factor in HRC's endorsements for the

2000 election, says the HRC.

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Legally, this measure seeks to ban marriage from a group that is already

excluded, as lesbians and gays are not allowed to wed in California or any

other state," said HRC's Political Director Winnie Stachelberg. "This

measure is nothing more than the politics of division and exclusion and we

must work with Californians to defeat it."

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Already, the HRC has donated $87,000 to the No on Knight/No on Proposition

22 campaign. Funding for the No on Knight campaign's political director as

polling, hosting house parties, and participating in GOTV efforts have been

made possible in tandem with the HRC's Western Field Organizer and its

California State Coordinators.

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Public officials who have voiced their opposition include democratic

presidential candidates Bill Bradley and Al Gore, Gov. Gray Davis, Sens.

Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, Rep. Tom Campbell, California Mayor

Susan Golding and many members of the California legislature and U.S. House

delegation.

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HRC's political action committee is one of the nation's largest and has

donated more than $1 million to fair-minded, pro-gay federal candidates in

the 1998 elections, of which $140,000 went to candidates in California. As a

member of the National Freedom to Marry Coalition, HRC works with statewide

groups to defeat anti-gay and anti-marriage proposals.

For more information on the campaign to defeat the Knight Initiative

including endorsees visit the No On Knight website at <a href="http://www.noonknight.org/">www.NoOnKnight.org</a>.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay

political organization with members throughout the country.  It effectively

lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to

ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and safe at home,

at work and in the community.
