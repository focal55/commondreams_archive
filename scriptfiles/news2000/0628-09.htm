- June 28 - The House&#146;s approval of a bill to force the disclosure

of contributions and expenditures for federal elections by so-called &quot;Section 527

Stealth PACs&quot; represents an important breakthrough on campaign finance reform, Public Citizen

representatives said today.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill, which was pushed by House reformers, was approved last night by 385-39. It is

anticipated that the bill soon will be reconciled with a similar measure that passed the

Senate earlier this month.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These new vehicles for secret, unlimited election money formed under Section 527 of the

federal tax code have the declared primary purpose of influencing elections. They have

become the latest loophole in federal campaign finance law. Scores of these tax-exempt

private groups, which come from all sides of the political spectrum, are raising and

spending tens of millions of dollars to influence the 2000 federal elections without

publicly reporting their existence, sponsorship, receipts, contributions and expenditures.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Clever tax lawyers created this loophole to enable wealthy donors to secretly

influence elections,&quot; said Frank Clemente, director of Public

Citizen&#146;s Congress Watch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unlike &quot;old&quot; Section 527 groups such as candidate and party committees and

PACs, which were specifically required by federal campaign finance law to report to the

Federal Election Commission, the &quot;new&quot; types of Section 527 groups are free to

run secret, partisan advertising, voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns. Not

only private groups (from the prescription drug industry&#146;s Citizens for Better

Medicare to the Sierra Club), but even the candidates themselves are getting into the act.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, in this election cycle, dozens of congressional and presidential

candidates have formed section 527 &quot;State Leadership PACs&quot; to collect unlimited

&quot;soft money&quot; checks that candidates are prohibited from receiving via their

campaign committees and federal Leadership PACs. Much of this money is being used to

influence federal elections through phony issue ads that really favor or oppose

candidates, partisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, political polling and

travel, and transfers of funds to national party soft money accounts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In passing this important bill (H.R. 4762), which strikes at both the private and

candidate-sponsored groups, the House rejected an alternative bill proposed by Republican

members of the House Ways and Means Committee. That bill would have coupled needed Section

527 disclosure with provisions that threatened to interfere with other, tax-exempt

associations that do not primarily engage in political campaign activities. Americans have

First Amendment rights to contribute to groups lobbying on public issues and conducting

non-partisan voter registration and educational activities without fear that publicity

about their support for certain policies will lead to negative social sanctions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The committee bill would have severely trespassed on basic citizen rights of free

speech and association by mandating broad disclosure of non-political campaign

contributions,&quot; said Steve Weissman, legislative representative of Congress Watch.

&quot;In contrast, the reform alternative is narrowly tailored to get at the most

egregious and unambiguous affronts to the integrity of our campaign finance laws.&quot;</font>
