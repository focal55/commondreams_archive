- April 10 - These analysts are available for interviews on context in the Elian

Gonzalez case:

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ELENA FREYRE, <a href="mailto:cubaid7@aol.com">cubaid7@aol.com</a>

<br>

Executive director of the Miami office of the Cuban Committee for

Democracy, Freyre said today: "The Cuban American community is not

monolithic. Returning Elian is part of broader reconciliation that needs to

take place between Cubans. Part of the message that's being sent is that if

you live in Cuba, you can't raise healthy, productive children -- that's not

true."

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MICHAEL RATNER, <a href="mailto:mratner@igc.org">mratner@igc.org</a>, <a href="http://www.mratner.com">http://www.mratner.com</a><br>

Attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights and a fellow at Yale Law

School, Ratner said today: "That this sad soap opera is still continuing

after Elian's father has arrived from Cuba is abominable. Clinton and Reno

should have acted long ago to return Elian to his father. Their inaction

continues to harm Elian, cause anguish to his father and damage the U.S.

claim that we live in a country governed by law. Nor is there any merit to

the suggestion that Elian be required to remain in the U.S. until court

appeals are exhausted."

Author of "Cuba and the United States: A Chronological History," Franklin

said today: "Some of the Cubans involved with Elian have been carrying out

attacks against Cuba, including the Bay of Pigs, ever since that time. The

organization that provides most of the financing for the Miami relatives,

the Cuban American National Foundation, was founded in 1981 not by a

grass-roots movement but by President Reagan and his first national security

adviser, Richard Allen, as an arm of U.S. policy toward Cuba."</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JULIA SWEIG, <a href="mailto:jsweig@cfr.org">jsweig@cfr.org</a><br>

Deputy director of Latin American Studies at the Council on Foreign

Relations, Sweig is currently writing a book on Cuba. She said: "President

Clinton should immediately adopt a comprehensive policy of family

reunification for divided Cuban families. By lifting all restrictions on

travel to Cuba by Cubans living here and increasing the level of remittances

they can send to their family to $10,000 per year, the United States can

make family reunification the center of U.S. policy toward Cuba."</font></p>

Executive director for the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, Little said

today: "Last year alone, over 5,600 unaccompanied minors were in INS

custody; most didn't even have lawyers and were in desperate need of help. A

1998 Human Rights Watch report condemned conditions for children detained

by the INS, saying they were frequently and systematically denied human

rights.... Haitians in particular have been routinely denied political

asylum no matter how strong their case."
