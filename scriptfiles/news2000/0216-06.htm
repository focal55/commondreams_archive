          - February 16 - Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) and the National Coalition 

          Against Domestic Violence (NCADV) today urged Texas Gov. George W. Bush 

          to commute the sentence of Betty Lou Beets, 62, a great grandmother 

          scheduled for execution Feb. 24. Beets would be the fourth woman executed 

          in the United States since reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976, 

          and the first in Texas since the 1998 execution of Karla Faye Tucker. 

          Beets was convicted of killing her husband after enduring his severe 

          and repeated beatings. </font> 

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an open letter 

            to be published Thursday in the Houston Chronicle, the two groups 

            drew attention to the repeated sexual, physical and emotional abuse 

            Beets endured throughout her life. Neither this history nor the abuse 

            by her husband were presented at her trial. "(T)he execution of Betty 

            Lou Beets will only complete a cycle of appalling abuse and violence," 

            the letter states. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1994, Bush 

            stated, "Texas must act to send the message to people who feel like 

            abusing their spouse is their right, that we won't accept it in our 

            society. It just reinforces that criminal behavior is OK, that beating 

            up your wife is OK, that violence is an acceptable way of life." </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sheila Dauer, 

            director of AIUSA's Women's Human Rights Program, said, "Gov. Bush 

            must ensure that Texas does not commit the final act of violence against 

            this woman. We ask the governor to act on his stated concern for the 

            victims of domestic violence and demonstrate his compassion by commuting 

            the sentence of Betty Lou Beets." </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The system failed 

            to protect Betty Lou Beets when she was being beaten by an abusive 

            spouse," said Juley Fulcher, NCADV public policy director. "It will 

            be a terrible miscarriage of justice if Texas executes this battered 

            woman without hearing her story." </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following 

            open letter was also signed by anti-domestic violence groups in 12 

            states, including Texas: </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Gov. Bush: 

            </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are urgently 

            concerned about the imminent execution of Betty Lou Beets, a 62-year-old 

            great-grandmother who was convicted of killing her physically abusive 

            husband. Ms. Beets is scheduled for execution in Texas on Feb. 24, 

            2000. We do not seek to excuse any crime or belittle the suffering 

            it has caused. We extend our deepest sympathy to the relatives and 

            friends of the victim of the crime for which Ms. Beets was convicted. 

            However, the execution of Betty Lou Beets will only complete a cycle 

            of appalling abuse and violence. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. Beets, who 

            is both hearing impaired and learning disabled, was raised in extreme 

            poverty by a violent and alcoholic father and a mentally ill mother. 

            The record of her life is a chronicle of sexual, physical and emotional 

            abuse. Married at 15, Ms. Beets had a succession of husbands who brutally 

            beat and sexually abused her. This abuse led to drug and alcohol dependency, 

            which became a way of escaping the torment of a lifetime of sexual 

            violence and domestic violence. However, neither this history nor 

            the extensive physical and sexual abuse Ms. Beets was suffering at 

            the hands of her husband were presented as mitigating circumstances 

            in her trial. Her original attorney has since admitted that he failed 

            to investigate her background and made no effort to present expert 

            testimony on her behalf. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Legislatures around 

            the country have recognized the role of domestic and sexual violence 

            as mitigating factors in capital cases. Governors in states such as 

            Maryland, Ohio, Illinois, California and Florida have commuted the 

            sentences of battered women. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Betty Lou Beets 

            would be the fourth woman in the USA to be executed since reinstatement 

            of the death penalty in 1976. She would be the first in Texas to face 

            execution without any recognition in court of the battery she faced 

            all her life and at the hands of her husband. Her tragic life deserves 

            a compassionate response. The State of Texas has an obligation to 

            ensure that justice is done in each and every case that comes before 

            it. The clemency procedure offers you, Governor Bush, an opportunity 

            to prevent a fatal miscarriage of justice. </font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge you to 

            commute the sentence of Betty Lou Beets. </font>
