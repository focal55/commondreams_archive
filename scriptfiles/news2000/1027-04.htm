- October 27 - Ralph Nader today called for legislation to

require labels on all genetically altered products, and a reevaluation

of public policy towards genetically altered life forms.  Polling has

shown that about 90 percent of the public supports labeling on

genetically-engineered foods.



<p>“Consumers have a right to know what they are buying when they go to the

supermarket, and farmers have a right to know what they are planting in

their fields,” Nader told reporters.  “Farmers were not even informed

that StarLink had not been approved for human consumption until Aventis

began contacting them in an attempt to insure that the corn was not

mixed with shipments bound for use in food produced for humans. We need

to devolve power from corporate agribusiness to the farmers and

consumers who should rightfully control food production in this

country.”



<p>Nader said that the recent taco shell recall provides an example of the

potential dangers of genetically altered crops to consumers, some of

whom could expect to suffer allergic reactions to the modified corn, and

demanded that President Clinton not give into calls from Aventis and

other food industry companies to have StarLink exempted from the current

regulatory guidelines.  “Such a move would only reward the biotech

industry for its malfeasance,” Nader said.



<p>“Genetic engineering of food has far outrun the science that must be its

first governing discipline. Many unknowns attend the insertion of genes

across species, from ecological risks to food allergies,” Nader said.

“We need a dramatic shift away from the industry-dominated laissez-faire

non-regulation of GMOs.”  Nader has specifically proposed:

<ul>

<li>Halting release of genetically altered plants into the environment

until comprehensive, independent studies are performed as to

environmental and food safety risks under a regulatory framework</li>

<li>Exempting life forms from the purview of patent laws in order to allow

broader research and safety testing opportunities by academia and

government</li>

<li>Placing liability for harm on the owners or licensees of biotechnology

patent rights in the event of damages caused by environmental release</li>

<li>Labeling food containing any genetically altered ingredients



</li>

</ul>



<p>Nader also questioned why Iowa State University would enter into the

Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), a consortium of universities,

research centers, and biotechnology corporations, when their own

scientists have raised troubling questions about the safety of

genetically modified foods.  “BIO is essentially a front for the

agribusiness industry, opposing any additional labeling, regulation, or

oversight while supporting the failed pro-globalization trade policies

that have brought crisis to American family farmers,” Nader said.  “This

sort of alliance will serve to crowd out the possibility of research

emphasis on organic, sustainable, environmentally-friendly farming

methods.”
