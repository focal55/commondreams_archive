- March 14 - Florida's

          private school voucher program, the first statewide voucher plan

          passed in the United States, has been ruled unconstitutional by a

          state court.</font>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">State

          Judge L. Ralph Smith Jr. issued his ruling today, concluding that the

          voucher plan violates Article IX, Sec.1 of the Florida Constitution.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Yet

          another court has struck a blow against a useless and unconstitutional

          voucher experiment,&quot; said Barry W. Lynn, executive director of

          Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which helped

          sponsor the lawsuit. &quot;Sooner or later, voucher advocates will

          just have to give up.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In

          November 1998, 71 percent of Florida's voters approved a

          constitutional amendment declaring that the maintenance of an

          &quot;efficient, safe, secure and high quality system of free public

          schools&quot; is &quot;a paramount duty of the state.&quot; Today's

          ruling in <i>Holmes v. Bush </i>was based on this constitutional

          provision.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Florida's

          residents have made it clear that they want an efficient, well-funded

          public school system,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;This voucher scheme

          undermined that goal, and Judge Smith was right to strike it down. I

          challenge the Florida Legislature to stop wasting its time on this

          unconstitutional boondoggle and concentrate on supporting the public

          schools.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judge

          Smith ruled, &quot;By providing state funds for some students to

          obtain a K-12 education through private schools, as an alternative to

          the high quality education available through the system of free public

          schools, the legislature has violated the mandate of the Florida

          Constitution, adopted by the electorate of this state.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn

          added, &quot;The language in the state constitution is clear and

          unambiguous. I don't understand how voucher supporters in Florida ever

          thought they would get away with this stunt in the first place.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under

          the Florida plan, public schools received a grade, from A to F, based

          on standardized test scores. Schools that scored well got extra money

          from the state, but in schools that received an F, students were

          eligible for a $4,000 voucher at any private school that accepted

          them, including religious schools. Public schools lost the funds that

          students took to private schools.</font></p>
