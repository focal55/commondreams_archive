- February 25 - 

</div>

<p align="left"> Pacifica Radio will consider offering

controversial DC businessman Bertram Lee a seat on its board of directors at

a meeting this weekend in Arlington, VA. Critics of the progressive radio

network, which has censored its journalists and locked out programmers in

recent months, have raised alarms about Lee's suitability for the board.

<p align="left">

"Lee is a wealthy sports magnate with a history of buying

and selling radio and TV stations. He could put together a

deal to sell one of the Pacifica stations overnight," said

Andrea Buffa, executive director of the media advocacy

organization Media Alliance. "Pacifica is the only progressive radio network

in the U.S. Its board members should be progressive community leaders--not

wheeler dealers with connections to media moguls like Mort Zuckerman."

<p align="left">

Lee is a Washington, DC businessman who was nominated for

board membership at a Pacifica governance committee meeting this month. He

was a co-owner of the Denver Nuggets, a CBS TV affiliate  in Boston, WKYS FM

in Washington, and served on the board of directors of Reebok. Staff at

Lee's business phone in Washington refused to say what services his company,

BML Associates, provides. Other individuals who were nominated for board

membership include John Murdock, an HMO attorney whose law firm Epstein

Becker & Green specializes in such services as "maintaining a union-free

workplace."

<p align="left">

The Pacifica Foundation is a nonprofit organization that

controls the licenses of five radio stations: WPFW in DC,

WBAI in NY, KPFA in Berkeley, KPFT in Houston, and KPFK

in Los Angeles. Over 85% of its revenues come from listeners.

<p align="left">

Pacifica's leaders have come under fire during the last year for using armed

guards to close down Berkeley's KPFA and for censoring  programmers

throughout the network who report on its woes. Its freelance reporters are

now on strike, demanding an end to censorship and a return to the network's

progressive values. The chair of the Pacifica national board is Dr. Mary

Frances Berry, who also chairs the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.

<p align="left">

The Pacifica Foundation board will meet Friday, February 25 through Sunday,

February 27 at the Double Tree Hotel, 300 Army-Navy Drive, Arlington, VA.

Although some committee meetings are open to the public on Saturday, the

primary open segment of the board meeting is Sunday from 9:30 AM to noon.

<p align="left">

A teach-in on the Pacifica scandals is planned for Saturday, February 26, at

7 PM, at the Universalist Memorial Church, 1810 16th Street, NW (at S

Street). Speakers will include Verna Avery-Brown, former Pacifica Network

News anchor, and Tomas Moran, Pacifica national board member.
