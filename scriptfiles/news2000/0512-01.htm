- May 12 - Cumberland County Sheriff Mark Dion, who was a leader in Maine’s 1999 successful Ballot Initiative to allow the medical use of marijuana, will be debating the state’s top drug enforcement officer tonight at 10 PM EST on “CNN NewsStand”. 



 



<p>Sheriff Dion has gained national attention for his position as one of a few “lone rangers” nationwide, and the only law enforcement officer in Maine, to openly support medical marijuana use for qualifying patients.  Dion believes that since voters in Maine approved medical marijuana use at the polls last November, that the state should help distribute the drug to authorized patients.  Dion told CNN that the question “was an ethical decision about the nature of dignity and compassion – and not simply a legal one.  The law is about making sure we follow the rules. Justice seeks the exceptions.   And for me, supporting medicinal marijuana was a journey to that exception.”



 



<p>The head of Maine’s Drug Enforcement Agency, Roy McKinney, disagrees.  “Law enforcement shouldn’t be involved in the process of handing out any drug,” he told CNN.  “That’s not our business.  Our business is to identify and arrest drug dealers.”  A bill introduced in the Maine Legislature in March by Mainers for Medical Rights would have provided for confiscated marijuana to be distributed by the Drug Enforcement Agency to registered patients.



 



<p>The segment with Dion and McKinney will be followed by a live debate between Sue Rusche, of Families in Action and John Morgan, a physician and pharmacologist who supports the use of marijuana as medicine. 



 



<p>Medical Marijuana laws have been passed in eight states and the District of Columbia in the last four years.  It remains illegal under federal law.
