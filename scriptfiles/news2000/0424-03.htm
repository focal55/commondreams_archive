- April 24 - News Advisory: 



<p><b>Tuesday, April 25, 9-10 a.m. 



</b>

<p><b>Dag Hammerskjold Plaza (47th Street and 1st Avenue), New York City



</b>

<p> A 50-foot tall inflated mock nuclear missile will 

stand in front of the UN building at Dag Hammerskjold Plaza as 

delegates gather for the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) 

Review Conference on Tuesday. Peace Action, the nation's largest 

grassroots peace and disarmament organization, is calling attention 

to the need for the U.S. government to take a leadership role in 

nuclear disarmament. 



<p>Over 500 people from around the world are expected to participate 

in the event, including hibakusha (nuclear survivors from Japan), 

downwinders and indigenous people impacted by nuclear testing, and 

students. The NPT is a cornerstone of international agreements to 

stop the spread of nuclear weapons. 



<p>"The United States is undermining arms control by moving forward 

with Star Wars and new nuclear weapons production while failing to 

ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty," said Gordon Clark, the 

executive director of Peace Action. "These actions are provoking deep 

suspicions and strong objections from our allies and adversaries 

alike." 



<p>"Thirty years ago the United States along with other nuclear 

powers agreed to complete nuclear disarmament by ratifying the 

Non-Proliferation Treaty. The NPT is moving into a crucial phase 

where it can either become the foundation for disarmament that it was 

meant to be or a glaring symbol of dangerous inaction and hypocrisy." 

said Clark. "As the world's sole military superpower, the United 

States must assume leadership on the nuclear disarmament measures 

that will address the concerns of nations that might otherwise 

consider developing nuclear weapons." 



<p>The 50-foot tall mock nuclear missiles are touring the country 

throughout the year as part of Peace Action's campaign to highlight 

the need for nuclear disarmament. For a complete schedule of the 

Missile Stop Tour, call Jim Bridgman at Peace Action at 

202-862-9740 ext. 3041. 



<p>Peace Action is the largest grassroots peace and disarmament 

organization in the United States. <p>
