- May 8 - Corporate executives from Wal-Mart, the world&#146;s largest retailer, have refused to meet

with a representative from Public Citizen, a consumer group founded by Ralph Nader, to

discuss the company&#146;s

decision to sell irradiated meat in its stores.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy Project, was in Arkansas from April 30 through May 2

and made herself available to meet with Wal-Mart officials. Hauter visited the state to

discuss the hazards of food irradiation at various meetings of consumer groups.</font></p>

<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen first contacted Wal-Mart on April 6 to ask

for an appointment on May 2 with H. Lee Scott, Jr., the newly appointed CEO of Wal-Mart.

When Public Citizen did not hear back from the company, the organization contacted the

company again on April 18. A company representative said that Scott would not be available

on May 2 because he was touring stores, but another company executive might be available

to meet with Hauter. On April 25, Public Citizen was told that perhaps a &quot;telephone

interview&quot; with Wal-Mart&#146;s vice president for corporate affairs would be more appropriate during the

week of May 1. A Public Citizen staffer told Wal-Mart that Hauter would still be

interested in having the discussion even if it were on the phone. Then, on May 3, Public

Citizen received a phone call indicating that the company would &quot;take a pass on this

at this time.&quot;</font></p>

<p>



<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Wal-Mart is taking a big risk by being the first major

retailer in the country to sell irradiated meat to consumers,&quot; Hauter said.

&quot;Other supermarket chains have held back on making a decision to sell this product

pending Wal-Mart&#146;s

experience with it. It would seem that company officials would be interested in listening

to people who shop at their stores to discuss this issue. We are still willing to sit down

and talk with the company&#146;s

executives on this matter.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen will continue to educate the public about the hazards of irradiated meat

by doing such things as handing fliers and post cards to Wal-Mart customers at stores

throughout the country, Hauter said. </font>
