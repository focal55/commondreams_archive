- February 8 - The Senate voted today on whether to take up the Nuclear Waste

Policy Amendments Act (s.1287), which was forced to the Senate floor by Senator Frank

Murkowski (R-Alaska), Chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Majority

Leader Trent Lott (R-Mississippi). Lott and Murkowski together received over $75,000 from

the nuclear industry in PAC contributions in 1999 alone.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This bill is yet another bailout of the nuclear industry. It opens a path to lower

health and environmental standards for a nuclear waste repository and relieves the

industry of its responsibility to pay for its own waste. &quot;This vote makes it clear

that the majority of our congressional delegates just do not care about the health and

safety of United States citizens. Instead, they are focused on appeasing an industry that

contributes heavily to their campaign accounts,&quot; Wenonah Hauter, director of Public

Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy Project explained.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The President vowed to veto this legislation on October 1, 1999, because it weakens

critical environmental and public health standards. He reiterated his veto promise last

week and again today, noting in a Statement of Administration Policy that the bill

&quot;will allow another entity to block the EPA&#146;s authority until June 1, 2001&quot;

to set radiation release standards for a repository at Yucca Mountain. The Statement goes

on to say that &quot;The bill also contains unrealistic and unworkable milestones;

insufficient funding mechanisms to pay for both the Yucca Mountain scientific program and

the &quot;take title&quot; provisions; and burdensome and unworkable transportation

provisions that do not provide a commensurate improvement in safety.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yucca Mountain is the only site being considered by the Department of Energy (DOE) as a

&quot;permanent disposal&quot; site for the United States&#146; highly radioactive nuclear

waste. This spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste is currently located at 77 sites

across the country and would have to be transported by truck or rail to Yucca Mountain if

that site is approved as a geologic repository. During the floor debate today, Senator

Murkowski used an inaccurate map showing sites that are not even on the docket for moving

their waste to Yucca Mountain in order to scare Senators into voting for this

irresponsible legislation. </font></p>
