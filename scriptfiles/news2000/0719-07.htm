- JULY 19 - Urging Congress to pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, H.R. 1082, the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of The Interfaith Alliance, issued the following statement:</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In a contentious environment where hate crimes are way too prevalent, much of the religious community is beginning to ask how long we must wait for the adoption of hate crimes legislation here on Capitol Hill?  And, why?  Neither hate nor violence is a traditional American value.  Both hate and violence are abominations to democracy and spirituality.  On June 20, the US Senate's took a firm stand against hate violence by passing a hate crimes prevention amendment.  Congress must now follow the Senate's lead and pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, H.R. 1082.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Over the past year and a half, as The Interfaith Alliance has worked on a campaign called <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/Initiatives/sth/index.htm"> Stop the Hate</a>, we have been overwhelmed by the depth and breadth of people's hunger for a means to voice their disdain for hate and for an opportunity to express their support for legislation aimed at checking the rampage of hate. 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Amid a lot of election year talk about forging partnerships between religion and government, here is the place for a true, dynamic partnership that does not involve dangerous institutional entanglements of religion and government but reflects the highest integrity of both religion and government.  We in the inter-religious community will continue to promote the primal moral values that nurture respect for the dignity and worth of every person and thus expose and seek to eradicate hatred as a malignancy of the mind and spirit. While it is true that legislation cannot remove hate from the hearts and minds of individuals, we learned a long time ago that legislation, like hate crimes legislation, can help to create a society in which people are influenced by their government's unbending intolerance of prejudice-based, hate-motivated violence.  

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The sacred scriptures of many different religious traditions speak with dramatic unanimity on this matter of hate. When true to the prophetic core of our various religions, we cannot condemn hate and then refuse to act to stop hate and the violence that hate foments upon us.  I pray that the lawmakers of our land will refrain from using the traditional values of state and local rights and freedom as excuses for enabling behavior that destroys the very communities that so prize freedom.  Religion and government can work together to create a society in which diverse people are safe as well as free."
