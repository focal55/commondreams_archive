- October 26 - Greg MacArthur, the



funder behind Citizens for Strategic Voting, clarified today



that he pulled ads from the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco



Chronicle, and the San Francisco Examiner because he thought New



York voters were a better target for his limited budget than



California voters. MacArthur said he still hopes California



voters will cast their ballots for Nader.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Citizens for Strategic Voting is still encouraging



Californians to vote for Nader," Greg MacArthur, the businessman



paying for the ads said. "We just think we will get more bang



for the buck in New York, where many more people can vote for



Ralph Nader without fearing that Bush will win."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ads are being run in an effort to encourage independents,



disgruntled Democrats and McCain supporters to vote for



presidential candidate Ralph Nader in states where Vice



President Al Gore or Gov. George W. Bush is strongly in the



lead. Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon and Greg MacArthur will



discuss the advertising campaign on Wednesday, Oct. 25. (Call



Underground Advertising for the dial-in number.)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is the first ever national political advertising campaign



to target voters in non-swing states. Political analysts believe



that Nader could receive the necessary five percent or more of



the national popular vote to win at least $7 million in matching



federal funds in 2004 if people understand that casting ballots



for Nader won't help Bush be elected.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Why Voting for a Candidate Who Can't Win Is the Smartest



Thing You'll Ever Do," the full-page newspaper ad headline



reads. "And Don't Worry, a Vote for Nader is Not a Vote for



Bush."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The independent expenditure ad campaign was paid by Citizens



for Strategic Voting -- a group started by businessman



MacArthur, grandson of billionaire insurance executive John D.



MacArthur (founder of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur



Foundation) and son to J. Roderick MacArthur, who created the



MacArthur "genius awards". Greg MacArthur is a businessman,



documentary film producer and former foreign correspondent for



the Associated Press.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"People must understand that the President is chosen by the



electoral college and not by the popular vote," said MacArthur.



"This means that in all but the swing states, people can follow



their hearts and vote for Nader without fearing that they will



help elect Bush."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Gore and Nader can both win," MacArthur said. "Gore needs



the majority of electoral college votes to become President.



Nader needs at least five percent of the popular national vote



to win matching funds for a potential presidential run in 2004.



Both are easily achievable if people in states where either Gore



or Bush is strongly ahead vote for Nader."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citizens for Strategic Voting is running ads in newspapers



read by a large percentages of Democratic and Independent



voters. The papers include The New York Times (national



edition), the Village Voice, the Boston Globe, the Boston



Phoenix, the Los Angeles Times, the Los Angeles Weekly, the



Austin American Statesman, the Austin Chronicle, the San



Francisco Bay Guardian and the Boulder Camera

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It does not matter if Gore or Bush win a state by one vote



or by one million votes," said MacArthur. "But a vote for Nader



can invigorate democracy by creating an equal playing field for



fresh new ideas."

Citizens for Strategic Voting



urges voters to check the state polls right before election day



before making a final judgment.</font>
