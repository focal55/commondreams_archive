<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 24 - GOP presidential candidate John McCain moved further to the right today by announcing his support of Proposition 22, an anti-gay California ballot measure that seeks to limit marriage.  McCain's support

for Proposition 22 - known as the Knight Initiative -- comes as a surprise because earlier in a town meeting he had said that he opposed the measure - which is also opposed by many of California's leading Republicans. While McCain's support for this divisive initiative might help him lure right

wing voters away from George W. Bush, it may be at the expense of support from moderates who have helped carry him thus far in the primaries, according to the Human Rights Campaign.

      </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We are disappointed that McCain's Straight Talk Express has done a U-turn on this divisive issue and has chosen to pander to the right wing," said HRC Political Director Winnie Stachelberg.  "But brazen appeals to the more extreme elements in his party could lead to the alienation of moderate voters."

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During a town meeting McCain said he would not vote for Proposition 22. According to the Associated Press, minutes after the town hall, when reporters asked him about his response, McCain said he had misunderstood

the question and he noted he had voted for a similar measure in the Senate that would essentially outlaw gay marriage. "I would vote for Proposition 22," McCain said.

      </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many prominent California Republicans have opposed the Knight Initiative.  Some leading Republican opponents include: Rep. Tom Campbell,

R-Calif; Ward Connerly, Regent, University of California; All Republican

candidates for mayor of San Diego; San Diego Mayor Susan Golding; and

Assemblyman Jim Cunneen.

It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community.
