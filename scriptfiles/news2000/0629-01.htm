- June 29 - At the OSPAR meeting in  Copenhagen, government representative’s from 15  countries and the EU will today decide whether or not they suspend radioactive discharges from the nuclear  reprocessing plants at Sellafield (UK) and La Hague (France). Throughout the night and this morning  Greenpeace has been building a large wall of 500 barrels in  front of the venue where the OSPAR conference takes place, sending this clear message to the delegates: "Ban nuclear reprocessing – Stop radioactive discharges!" 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace activists this morning began the closure of the radioactive waste discharge pipe of France's reprocessing facility at La Hague, from which over one million litres of liquid radioactive waste a day is spilled into the sea. On one of the two outlets of the pipe, Greenpeace divers have shut the valves of the special OSPAR (Object to Stop Pollution from Accumulation of Radioactivity) attached to the pipe the previous night. The OSPAR device divides the radioactive discharge into 6 separate streams, one for each of La Hague's client countries <a href="#one">(1)</a>. Each stream has a separate valve, symbolising the  ease of turning off the radioactive tap and ending the discharges. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Greenpeace urges delegates to seize this historic opportunity to stop further radioactive pollution of the marine environment in the Northeast Atlantic," said Remi  Parmentier, Greenpeace International’ s representative to the OSPAR commission. Greenpeace believes that the adoption of the proposal from the Danish government to ban nuclear reprocessing will put  maximum pressure on France and the UK to stop their radioactive discharges.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1993, the dumping of nuclear waste from ships, aircraft  and platforms was banned, but this agreement did not cover  radioactive discharges into the sea from land-based nuclear reprocessing facilities. The Danish proposal that will be considered today is "a common sense step to harmonise international law," says Remi Parmentier.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace recently documented the radioactive legacy of  dumping nuclear waste in 200 litre barrels at the Hurd Deep dump site, just 15 km from Cap La Hague. But the amount of radioactivity being discharged from Sellafield and La Hague in one day is the equivalent of some 100 of the  barrels dumped at Hurd Deep. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"During this five-day OSPAR meeting, the equivalent of 500  barrels of radioactive waste from the Hurd Deep dump site  will have been poured into the marine environment," says Parmentier. "The time is ripe to finally to stop this deliberate radioactive pollution. If the vote takes place today, France and the UK will have to take seriously the concerns of the countries whose shores are being polluted by radioactive wastes." 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace has been campaigning for decades to stop  dumping and discharges of radioactive waste. Nuclear reprocessing is by far the largest source of deliberate  radioactive marine pollution, and dry storage of spent nuclear fuel is both a cheaper and a safer alternative to reprocessing. By applying the dry storage option, the threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons will also diminish as it  would stop the production of plutonium.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the OSPAR meeting Greenpeace has been  broadcasting live images of the La Hague underwater  discharge pipe, on the Internet as well as directly onto a large TV screen at the OSPAR meeting conference. "We  have shown that radioactive discharges have been increasing, and have not been ‘substantially reduced’ as the  UK and France both promised two years ago," says Parmentier. "The operators of the nuclear reprocessing facilities, with the support of the French and UK  governments, have been cheating and they must face the consequences." 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Wednesday night COGEMA – the company that owns  and operates  La Hague – admitted to  having cut "by accident" the transmitting cable of the Greenpeace webcam. But by Thursday afternoon Greenpeace divers  had managed to repair the connection. The live  transmission now shows the discharge pipeline  equipped with a Greenpeace 'OSPAR device' – Object to Stop  Pollution from Accumulation of Radioactivity – that divides the radioactive discharges into six separate streams,  representing each of La Hague’ s client state. The six countries which contribute to the La Hague radioactive discharge operation are France, Japan, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. </font>
