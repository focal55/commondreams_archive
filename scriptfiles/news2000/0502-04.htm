- May 2 - Civic leaders, concerned citizens and Wal-Mart customers today

joined Public Citizen in a news conference urging Wal-Mart not to test-market irradiated

meat in its Supercenters. The event took place at the Fayetteville Hilton.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Food irradiation is a process where food is exposed to high levels of radiation in

order to kill bacteria and extend shelf life for up to 35 days. While proponents of the

process state that irradiation will make food safer, no one really knows the health

impacts of eating irradiated food. New chemicals called unique radiolytic products are

created in the irradiation process and no testing has been done to identify these

chemicals, much less to determine if they are safe. The evidence indicates that

chromosomal damage and reproductive dysfunction (among other problems) could occur as the

result of consuming irradiated food. Known carcinogens such as Benzene and Toluene are

also produced by irradiation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We oppose food irradiation because it merely masks the problem of poor meat

processing practices that leave meat contaminated with feces, urine and pus,&quot; said

Marquette MyCue, a local community leader in health related issues. &quot;At a minimum,

Wal-Mart should warn consumers of the dangers of irradiated meat with labels that state

irradiation does not kill all bacteria, that it destroys important vitamins and enzymes,

and that it leads to the formation of potentially carcinogenic chemicals in food.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Irradiation translates into big profits for Wal-Mart, but something entirely

different for consumers,&quot; said Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen&#146;s

Critical Mass Energy Project. &quot;Corporate agribusiness has convinced the government to

abandon its protective role, allowing companies like Wal-Mart to use food irradiation to

extend the shelf life of meat beyond what is appropriate and mask the unhygienic

conditions in which animals are raised, slaughtered and processed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most American consumers share the views expressed at the news conference. A 1999 poll

commissioned by the American Association of Retired Persons and Center for Science in the

Public Interest found that 88.6 percent of Americans want labels to indicated food has

been irradiated. A 1997 CBS News poll found that 77 percent of Americans would not buy

irradiated food.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another problem with irradiated meat is the threat to small farmers in the United

States as well as around the globe. Family farmers and small food producers are finding it

impossible to compete economically with corporate factory farms. The extended shelf life

resulting from irradiation will enable foreign meat producers to drive the small American

farmer out of business.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The body of research on irradiated food is sketchy at best and has yielded conflicting

results. There are no studies on the long-term health effects of irradiated food on

humans. Among the unknowns: whether irradiation has different effects on frozen food as

compared to fresh food; how irradiation affects irregularly shaped foods; its effects on

helpful bacteria; and the effects of irradiation on plant workers who oversee the

treatment of food.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents, a 1982 FDA review of 413

studies found 344 to be inconclusive or inadequate to demonstrate either the safety or

toxicity of irradiated foods, while 32 indicated adverse effects and 37 showed the

procedure to be safe.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In February, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) legalized the

irradiation of raw meat and meat products such as ground beef, steaks and pork chops. The

government declared food irradiation safe by using mathematical calculations supported by

just five animal studies conducted primarily in the 1960s and 1970s that were of

questionable quality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the USDA&#146;s labeling requirements, meat served in such places as restaurants

and cafeterias will not have to be labeled, so consumers will have no idea when they are

eating irradiated meat. However, irradiated meat sold in stores must be labeled as such.</font>
