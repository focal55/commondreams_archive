- January 27 - Commenting on President

Clinton's call during his State of the Union address for millions



of dollars in grants toward development of so-called "smart"



guns, the Violence Policy Center tonight issued the following



statement:

<p>What President Clinton called for tonight was nothing less than a

subsidy for the gun industry, whose products claim more than 30,000



lives every year in this country. "Smart" gun technology cannot



decrease gun homicides or suicides, but will increase them as the



total number of gun owners increases. (One gun maker has predicted

60 million new gun owners.) Whatever positive effect these proposed



"smart" guns could have on unintentional firearm deaths and injuries



could be better achieved with existing low-tech devices such as child



safety locks, load indicators, and magazine disconnect devices.



Above all, the Violence Policy Center asserts that the gun industry



needs to be federally regulated for health and safety standards-and



definitely not subsidized.

<p>------

<br>

A more detailed look at this issue may be found in The False Hope

of the 'Smart' Gun which is available on the VPC's web site located



at <a href="http://www.vpc.org/fact_sht/smartgun.htm">www.vpc.org/fact_sht/smartgun.htm.</a>

<p>---

<br>

The Violence Policy Center is a national non-profit educational

organization that examines the role of firearms in America, conducts



research on firearms violence, and works to reduce firearm-related



death and injury.
