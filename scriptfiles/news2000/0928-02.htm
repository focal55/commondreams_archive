- September 28 - On Monday, October 2, the Sierra Club will launch a

     month-long drive to inform Americans where their Presidential and

     Congressional candidates stand on the environment.  With all three

     branches of government up for grabs and polls showing that Americans

     want public officials who will protect the environment, the campaign

     takes to the airwaves, the internet, mailboxes and the door-to-door

     canvassing to provide people with printed and broadcast voter guides

     about their candidates' environmental positions.

<p>

     "Using new technology and old-fashioned shoe leather, the Sierra Club

     will help millions of Americans learn where their candidates stand on

     the environment," said Sierra Club Political Director Daniel J. Weiss.

      "With the Sierra Club's all-out effort, Americans won't have to look

     far for environmental information about their candidates."

<p>

     Totaling $3 million, the October push includes $2 million for

     broadcast voter-guide ads and an additional $1 million for printed

     voter guides with side-by-side comparisons.  The Sierra Club will

     spread the word in 12 Congressional contests and the Presidential

     race, with volunteers distributing voter guides door-to-door; internet

     banner ads and websites; TV, radio and newspaper ads; and U.S. mail.

     The Sierra Club's October drive caps its $8 million, year-long

     Environmental Voter Education Campaign.

<p>

     "People are hungry for the facts about their candidates, and the

     environment provides a clean, bright, defining line between many

     candidates," Weiss said.  "By turning on their TVs, logging onto the

     internet, or simply opening their front doors, people can learn where

     these candidates stand on protecting our clean air, clean water and

     favorite parks.  Before they head to the polls, voters want to know

     the differences between Vice President Gore and Gov. Bush on clean

     water, clean air and controlling suburban sprawl."

<p>

     The voter guides provide information about the issues that matter most

     to local residents.  In Washington State, voters learn about efforts

     to protect salmon and wild forests.  In Michigan, voter guides feature

     the Great Lakes and clean water safeguards.  In northwestern Illinois'

     17th Congressional District, spotlighted issues include factory farms

     and protecting the Mississippi River.

<p>

     The TV ads comparing Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush

     are tailored to the local issues that matter in Philadelphia, Detroit,

     St. Louis and Madison, WI, where those ads will air.  Localized

     Congressional voter guide ads will air for the Senate races in

     Michigan, Montana, Washington and Virginia, and for the House races

     in:

     Colorado 06 (Rep. Tom Tancredo vs. Ken Toltz), Connecticut 05 (Rep.

     Jim Maloney vs. Mark Nielsen), Illinois 17 (Rep. Lane Evans vs. Mark

     Baker), Kansas 03 (Rep. Dennis Moore vs. Phill Kline), Nevada 01 (Rep.

     Shelley Berkley vs. Jon Porter), North Carolina 11 (Rep. Charles

     Taylor vs. Sam Neill), Pennsylvania 10 (Rep. Don Sherwood vs. Pat

     Casey), and Washington 01 (Rep. Jay Inslee vs. Dan McDonald).

<p>

     More than 2 million households will receive printed voter guides

     either in their mailboxes or under their front doors, the latter

     distributed by an army of Sierra Club volunteers.  Banner ads on

     internet sites Lycos.com and Voter.com will direct surfers to the

     voter guides at: <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/voter_education/">http://www.sierraclub.org/voter_education/</a>

<p>

     Ads in Montana began airing last week to take advantage of high

     viewership during the Olympics.
