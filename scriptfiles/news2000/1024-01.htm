- October 24 - According to a survey 

        released today by the national consumer groups Public Citizen, U.S. PIRG 

        and the Gray Panthers, consumers without prescription drug coverage are 

        charged <i><b>twice as much</b></i> as the drug industry's most favored 

        customers. The organizations were joined by residents of the Senior Citizens 

        Counseling and Delivery Center. </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The D.C. Metro survey of 33 randomly selected 

        pharmacies compared the prices of the nine most commonly prescribed medications 

        used by senior citizens, three of which are the most widely prescribed 

        to all consumers. Overall, the average retail price charged to Medicare 

        beneficiaries without drug coverage was $201 versus $102 for most favored 

        customers like the Department of Veterans Affairs. Overcharges ranged 

        from 74% for the cholesterol medication Lipitor to 221% for the ulcer 

        medication Pepcid. The D.C. Metro results are similar to those of 12 other 

        surveys that Public Citizen and local groups have conducted in ten other 

        states.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The study shows that if the Medicare program 

        received the same price discount as the Veterans Department, the price 

        of drugs to uninsured Medicare beneficiaries could be cut in half," said 

        Frank Clemente, Director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch. "Such a price 

        cut would make Medicare drug coverage much more affordable for taxpayers 

        and substantially reduce out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"D.C. Metro seniors are at a dual disadvantage 

        -- because they are uninsured they have to pay out of pocket and they 

        are charged more than double what the insured pay," said Rachel Weintraub, 

        Staff Attorney at U.S. PIRG. "Congress should act to make prescription 

        drugs more affordable, and states should pass legislation allowing them 

        to negotiate lower drug prices for all consumers," she said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As many as 127,000 seniors in the D.C. metro 

        area have no prescription drug coverage and thousands of others including 

        the uninsured and people with disabilities have little or no coverage. 

        </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"D.C. metro area senior citizens demand a 

        prescription drug plan that allows Medicare to negotiate the same price 

        discounts with the drug industry that other federal agencies receive," 

        said Tim Fuller, Executive Director of the Gray Panthers. "If Congress 

        refuses to give Medicare such authority it should pass the Allen-Johnson 

        bill, which would require drug makers to sell drugs to local pharmacies 

        at the same price given to most favored customers - 40-50% off retail."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I know that if I don't take my medicine- 

        I will die. I have had to cut back on my medication to make them last 

        longer," said D.C. resident Eleanor Freeman who lives on a $831 Social 

        Security check each month. "My medicines cost at least $150 each month. 

        I should have the security of knowing that I will be able to afford the 

        medication I need as well as the food I must eat. I do not have that security 

        now," she said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are steps that Congress can take to 

        end the prescription drug debate. Passing a comprehensive Medicare drug 

        benefit and granting the Medicare program the authority to negotiate substantial 

        price reductions with the industry will not only help put an end to out 

        of control drug prices, it also will help seniors and other consumers 

        to make ends meet.</font></p>
