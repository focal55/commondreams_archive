- October 1 - Despite consistent criticism



from the International Whaling Commission, Japan continues to kill



more than 20,000 small whales, dolphins and porpoises each year.



Japan's annual slaughter of thousands of these "forgotten whales"



begins this week in Japan, even as the US government threatens Japan



with sanctions for hunting sperm and Bryde's whales under the guise



of scientific research.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The dolphin hunting season starts on October 1st , with fishermen



in two regions of southern Japan -- Wakayama and Shizuoka -- legally



permitted to kill dolphins and small whales in shockingly brutal



hunts.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The species targeted include the world's best known dolphin -- the



bottlenose dolphin -- along with striped dolphins, spotted dolphins,



Risso's dolphins, false killer whales and short-finned pilot whales.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Footage from a dolphin hunt last year was widely circulated at a



recent meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Adelaide,



Australia. The Japanese delegation strongly opposed any discussion

of



the methods used to kill small whales, dolphins and porpoises, but



was unable to prevent the showing of the video in a separate room



during the meeting. The video shocked both pro- and anti-whaling



delegates and the Japanese delegation left the meeting in protest,



although later admitted on camera that killing methods had to be



improved.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the hunt season opening today it remains to be seen whether



any action to reduce the suffering of these "forgotten whales" will



be taken, however EIA believes only a complete suspension of the hunt



will suffice. Detailed research has shown none of the six species



targeted in these hunts are known to have healthy populations that



can withstand continued hunting.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EIA Director Allan Thornton said "According to Japanese



scientists, striped dolphins in Japan's coastal waters are highly



endangered, bottlenose dolphins are threatened, and short-finned



pilot whales are rare. There is insufficient data for the other



species to even hazard a guess as to their status. The US government



has recently done an excellent job at calling attention to the



fraudulence of Japan's so called "scientific whaling" for sperm and



Bryde's whales. But attention must also be given to these "forgotten



whales" before Japan's hunting drives them to extinction."

EDITOR'S NOTES:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) is a non-profit



environmental organization with offices in Washington DC and London,



England. Set up in 1984, EIA works to expose environmental crimes



including illegal trade in endangered or threatened species, illegal



logging and timber trade and the illegal trade in ozone-depleting



substances.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The Government of Japan allows up to 22,000 dolphins, porpoises



and small whales to be killed by hunters each year. The status of



each population is either threatened, endangered, or unknown.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. There are no national or regional government enforcement



inspectors to ensure compliance with the catch limits set by the



Government of Japan's Fisheries Agency. Fisheries co-operatives



merely report the number of dolphins and porpoises that have been



killed to the regional prefecture governments in Japan, which in turn



pass them on to the Fisheries Department. There is no physical



inspection of the catches by the Government.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. There is a flourishing large-scale fraudulent trade in small



cetacean products, which are often sold as whale meat thereby vastly



inflating their value. The Government of Japan has never acted to



counter this widespread fraudulent trade nor has it enacted



meaningful enforcement of catch limits or other supposed controls on



the commercial hunting of dolphins, porpoises and small whales around



its coasts.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. The United States Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits the



hunting, capturing or killing of dolphins, porpoises and small



whales. Thirty four nations are signatories to the Council of



Europe's Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife



which both outlaws "the indiscriminate killing" of cetaceans and "



the use of means capable of causing local disappearance of, or



serious disturbance to populations of a species." New Zealand and



Australia have similar legislation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. The continued unsustainable exploitation of small cetacean



populations in coastal waters of Japan contradicts the Government of



Japan's frequently stated claim that it pursues a policy of



'sustainable utilization of marine resources'.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. Dolphins, porpoises and small whales have no legal protection



under Japanese law to prevent them being hunted to extinction or



killed in the most indiscriminate and brutal manner.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. Members of the Japanese public and press are generally unaware



that such hunts occur in Japan and are often shocked to discover that



such large numbers of dolphins, porpoises and small whales are still



killed.</font>
