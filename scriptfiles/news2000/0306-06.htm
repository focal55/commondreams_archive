<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- March 6 - On the eve of Super Tuesday primaries, including California,

which faces the anti-gay Proposition 22, the Human Rights Campaign, released

its voting scorecard for the first session of the 106th Congress. The

analysis will help voters evaluate which candidates support legislation that

will increase the quality of life for lesbian and gay Americans, says HRC.

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Electing candidates who have demonstrated leadership on gay and

lesbian issues and are supporters of key legislation will have an enormous

impact in the advancement and efforts to achieve equality," says HRC

Political Director Winnie Stachelberg.

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The scorecard reveals percentages on how the House and Senate

members have voted on legislation that affects the lesbian and gay movement

including the Hate Crimes Prevention Act (HCPA) and the Employment Non

Discrimination Act (ENDA).

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the House, the Democratic leadership earned a 96.0 percent and

the Republican with an 8.2 percent. In the Senate, the Republican leadership

rated a 2.8 percent and Democrats with a 94.3 percent. By party, Democrats

rated with an all time high in both the House and the Senate with an 82.0

and an 88.4 while Republicans rated with an 18.2 percent and a 13.0 percent

accordingly. In spite of theses differences there are staunch supporters in

both parties.

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Knight Initiative/Proposition 22, brainchild of conservative

California State Senator Pete Knight, will also appear on the March 7

ballot. It would codify anti-gay discrimination by prohibiting recognition

of marriage for same-sex couples. The HRC has helped in the effort to stop

the initiative by contributing to the No on Knight/ No on Proposition 22

campaign.

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"On March 7, 39 percent of American voters will be at the voting

polls. A large turn out of gay and lesbian voters can provide the margin of

victory that will help determine the direction of our movement not only in

California but also nationwide," says Stachelberg. "Lesbian and gay

Americans have the power to decide whether we continue to move forward or

lose hard-won ground."

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to exit polls in 1996, five percent of all voters

identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual, nearly equaling the number of Latino

voters and exceeding the number of Jewish and Asian voters.

        </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay

political organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively

lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to

ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and safe at home,

at work and in the community.
