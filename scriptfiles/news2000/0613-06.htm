- June 13 - On Thursday, the House



is expected to vote on an effort to deny the Department of Justice



the funding it needs to complete a lawsuit that has already

been started against the major tobacco companies. A vote is



expected as part of the HUD/VA Appropriations bill this Thursday



in the House.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As one of the first Attorneys General to bring Big Tobacco to



court, I find it appalling that Congress won't let the United States



Department of Justice have its day in court against the largest



tobacco companies," Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger said.



Between 1989 and 1999, the tobacco industry contributed a total of



$33 million to the parties and to the candidates. Of that



$33 million, $24 million was distributed to the Republicans,



and $8.5 million went to the Democrats. In 1999 alone, the



industry contributed roughly $2 million to parties. "Unfortunately,



this seems to be a situation where campaign cash may drown out



common sense," Harshbarger said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Time and time again, Big Tobacco gets its way with Congress. The



huge infusion of soft money to the parties, and the constant influx



of PAC dollars have members of Congress hooked on Big Tobacco cash.



The fundamental issue here is that if Big Tobacco prevails, it's the



American people who will lose their right to have their day in

Court," Harshbarger said.</font>
