- June 25 - Chanting "Predatory



Lender - Criminal Offender," over 2,000 members of the community



group ACORN will march through Center City, Philadelphia ending



with a rally demanding that the Federal Reserve Bank use its



authority to stop unscrupulous and abusive mortgage companies. The



group will stop along the route to demonstrate at the offices of



financial institutions which engage in or fund predatory mortgage



lending - the targeting of poor, minority, and elderly homeowners



for high cost loans, which are often more than the borrower



can afford and lead to the loss of their homes.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACORN members will depart on buses for the march at 11 a.m. on



Monday, June 26 from Temple University's Liacouras Center at Broad



and Montgomery in Philadelphia and will assemble at a location to



be announced. The March will end with the rally at the Federal



Reserve Bank on 7th Street at 12 noon.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Six years ago, Congress gave the Federal Reserve the power to



prohibit unfair and deceptive lending practices on home loans, but



they haven't done anything about it," said Maude Hurd, ACORN



National President. "For six long years the Fed has just been



sitting by, letting these con-artists and loan sharks rip off our



neighborhoods."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rally and protest are part of the organization's "Fighting



for Our Future" 30th Anniverary National Convention and culminates



a week of actions against discriminatory and



predatory lending. In the past week, ACORN filed a landmark



lawsuit against Wells Fargo/Norwest Bank charging them with racial



steering via the internet. On Sunday, 300 ACORN members marched on



the suburban home of Advanta Corp. President William Rosoff and



staged a symbolic foreclosure in protest of Advanta's predatory



lending. Also on Sunday, over 1,000 ACORN members canvassed North



Philadelphia neighborhoods in a grassroots effort to make the



community a "predator-free zone."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From an organization founded by welfare mothers in Little Rock,



Arkansas, ACORN has grown to become the nation's largest



organization of low and moderate income people with over 150,000



members in 34 cities. Organizational accomplishments include:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Leading campaigns throughout the country to pass living wage



ordinances which require companies that receive public assistance



to pay their employees a living wage. ACORN has passed seven such



ordinances and has assisted other communities in



passing over more than 40 other living wage ordinances.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Ground-breaking community reinvestment agreements with some



of the nation's largest banks and helping over 30,000 families to



realize their dream of becoming a homeowner.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The establishment of alternative public schools in lower



income areas of Brooklyn, Queens, Jersey City, Chicago, and St.



Paul. Improved school facilities and governance



in Chicago, New York, San Jose, Little Rock, and Bridgeport.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Increased voter registration in lower-income communities by



striking down barriers to voter registration in Atlanta, Little



Rock, Bridgeport and Pine Bluff, Ark. and the registration of over



500,000 new voters since 1980.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACORN kicked off its recent campaign against predatory lending



last summer and has been fighting on several fronts to stop this



problem: holding community meetings and workshops to educate the



public; researching and documenting the problem and its impact on



communities; exposing the abuses of specific mortgage companies;



pressing state and federal regulators to investigate lenders and



take appropriate action; counseling individuals who had received



predatory loans; and advocating for legislative change at the city,



county, state, and federal level.
