- February 2 - Greenpeace welcomes the 

Federal Trade Commission’s decision to oppose BP Amoco’s 

merger with Atlantic Richfield Corp (ARCO). But the 

international environmental organization stresses that as the 

merger now heads to federal court, the FTC must broaden its 

review to include consideration of environmental impacts the 

merger may bring, particularly in Alaska.  

<p>

The BP Amoco–ARCO merger threatens yet greater oil 

expansion into the Arctic, which will result in more global 

warming and a greater danger of oil spills. Already Arctic 

regions are under duress from global warming, as sea ice has 

thinned by some forty percent over the last forty years, 

threatening the habitat of Arctic wildlife, including polar bears.

<p>

&quot;The FTC has the obligation and the authority to examine 

environmental threats presented by mergers,&quot; said Dr. Iain 

MacGill, senior analyst for Greenpeace.  &quot;As for BP Amoco, 

we ask why a company whose stated goal is to provide energy 

without damaging the environment is pursuing more Arctic oil 

and fueling global warming.&quot;

<p>

Earlier in the day, ten Greenpeace activists dressed in polar bear 

costumes demonstrated outside the FTC building in Washington. 

The &quot;polar bears&quot; carried placards reading &quot;Paws off the 

Arctic&quot;, &quot;Stop the Polar Meltdown&quot; and &quot;Go Solar.&quot;  Photos 

have been offered to Reuters, AFP and Associated Press.

<p>

Greenpeace also noted that today it received a letter from BP 

Amoco’s vice-president of corporate governance stating that a 

shareholder resolution filed by Greenpeace, the US Public 

Interest Group (U.S. PIRG) and socially responsible investors 

fulfils the legal requirements to be included with the notice of the 

company’s AGM in April. The resolution forces BP Amoco to 

allow its shareholders to choose between more Arctic oil 

expansion or a revolutionary investment in solar power. This 

letter is available upon request.
