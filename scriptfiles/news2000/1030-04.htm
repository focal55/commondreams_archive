- October 30 - In a letter to World Bank President James Wolfensohn, Friends of



the Earth International Chairman Ricardo Navarro today called on



Wolfensohn to declare a moratorium on World Bank support of fossil



fuel and mining projects. Navarro's letter follows up on President



Wolfensohn's September pledge at the World Bank Annual Meetings in



Prague to work with Friends of the Earth (FoE) to take a hard look



at the negative impacts of Bank investments in fossil fuel and



mining. A FoE position paper, handed to Wolfensohn by Chairman



Navarro argues that the World Bank should phase out fossil fuel and



mining projects that are destructive to the environment and local



communities because they do not meet the World Bank's stated



mission of poverty alleviation.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Mr. Wolfensohn has promised that the World Bank will take a



hard look at the impacts of fossil fuel and mining investments and



their negative impacts. Friends of the Earth believes that a good



faith demonstration of Mr. Wolfensohn's intent to follow through on



the rhetoric is an immediate moratorium on fossil fuel and mining



investments," said Friends of the Earth International Chairman



Ricardo Navarro.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This letter follows up on a declaration signed by more than 200



organizations representing environmental, human rights, religious,



and economic justice organizations from 55 countries called on the



Bank to stop financing oil, gas, and mining projects. FoE provides



numerous suggestions for the completion of this phase-out and



shifting priorities towards investments that directly meet the



needs of the poor such as renewable energy. Wolfensohn responded



favorably to the paper pledging to look at the possibilities of



exclusions from World Bank support within these sectors.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The World Bank's fossil fuel and mining projects have left a



trail of environmental devastation, poverty, and severe social



disruption in poor countries," said Andrea Durbin, director of



Friends of the Earth's (US) International Program. "President



Wolfensohn needs to initiate a process of identifying how the phase



out will work including no-go zones that protect local communities



and the environment and targeted investments in renewable energy."
