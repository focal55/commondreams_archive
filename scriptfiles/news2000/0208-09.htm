-  

February 8 - Amnesty International today welcomed the decision by the UK Divisional Court to consider leave to see judicial review as having been granted, and that the hearing should now continue on the merits of the case.

<P>

	 "A court will now be able to examine questions regarding fairness and transparency raised in connection with the procedure used by Jack Straw in this case," the organization said.

<P>

	"Amnesty International and the other human rights organizations came to the High Court in the hope of being heard, and we have now won that chance.  We will now be requesting the court to quash Mr Straw’s preliminary decision, which we believe was made in an unfair manner." 

<P>

	"This case has far-reaching implications both for the victims of the Chilean military government and for the fight for justice throughout the world," Amnesty International said.  "In the interests of justice, all decisions in the extradition proceedings must be reached in a fair and transparent manner to avoid any doubt of political interference."

<P>

<B>Background</B><BR>

An application for permission to seek judicial review of Jack Straw’s latest actions in the Pinochet case was submitted on 25 January 2000 by solicitors representing Amnesty International, the Association of the Relatives of Detained and Disappeared Persons, Human Rights Watch, Justicia, The Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture and Redress.
