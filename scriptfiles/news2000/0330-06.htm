- March 30 - Environmental Defense today initiated the formal process necessary 

          to sue the US Army Corps of Engineers for operating the Missouri River 

          in such a way as to jeopardize three federally protected endangered 

          species, the piping plover, least tern and pallid sturgeon. Environmental 

          Defense today filed an 18-page notice of intent to sue the Corps of 

          Engineers. 

        </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"For a decade, the US Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) has told the Corps 

          that the way it operates Missouri River dams is causing three magnificent 

          species to go extinct and that its actions are harming several dozen 

          others," said Tim Searchinger, Environmental Defense senior attorney. 

          "Throughout the decade, the FWS and Environmental Defense have suggested 

          countless practical ways of saving these species while boosting the 

          economy. But the time for waiting is now up." 

        </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Some will sing the tired old song that saving these three species 

          will hurt the economy, but the opposite is true. The changes needed 

          to protect them would also boost hydropower and could dramatically spur 

          new recreation companies. The Corps refuses to make these changes only 

          because it wants to protect a miniscule barging industry that it estimates 

          at only $7 million per year on a river that produces $1.8 billion in 

          total benefits," said Searchinger. 

        </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Over the last several years, every leading agricultural transportation 

          economist in the region has found that the Missouri River provides minimal 

          benefits to agriculture," said Searchinger. "But needed changes would 

          keep reservoir levels higher for the people of Montana, and North and 

          South Dakota to use for recreation. And just think of the benefits to 

          the region if a restored river became truly usable for boating, fishing 

          and wildlife viewing by the people of Sioux City, Omaha, Council Bluffs, 

          Kansas City and St. Louis."

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Rivers, another conservation group, is filing a similar notice 

          today.
