- June 20 - The following was



released today by Gore 2000:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statement By Al Gore Regarding Gas Prices

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am extremely concerned about the conduct of the oil companies



that may have led to these unreasonable price increases.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three weeks ago I called upon the government to investigate the



oil companies for price gouging. That investigation of big oil is



now underway, and I would like to see the investigation broadened



to look at allegations of price fixing and collusion among the oil

companies.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We now know that -- according to the latest available statistics



-- oil company profits have increased by as much as nearly five



hundred percent in the first part of this year. These enormous and



unreasonable profits suggest that big oil is gouging American



consumers.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We need to get to the bottom of this -- and we must do so in a



bipartisan way. This issue cuts across party lines. Republicans



and Democrats alike have spoken out against the oil companies and



appealed for relief from the problem of skyrocketing gasoline



prices.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That is why today I asked Secretary Richardson of the Department



of Energy and EPA Administrator Browner to contact the governors of



the states most affected by these high gas prices and convene a



meeting immediately. We want to find out what these governors have



learned about this issue and how the federal government can work



with them to help solve this problem.</font>
