- January 26 - The Senate is set to

consider an amendment by Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) to ensure



that gun manufacturers cannot escape responsibility for debts



incurred as a result of lawsuits filed by consumers or



municipalities.

<p>Sen. Levin's amendment will be considered during debate on

S. 625, a bill to overhaul the nation's bankruptcy laws. This



will be the first major debate in the Senate over gun control



since Vice President Gore cast the tie-breaking vote to require

background checks at gun shows following the massacre at Columbine



High School in April 1999. The Senate is scheduled to begin debate



on a series of amendments to S. 625 on Wednesday, Jan. 26.

<p>"Senator Levin's amendment would ensure that gun manufacturers

cannot evade accountability for firearm-related death and injury,"



said Kristen Rand, director of federal policy for the Violence



Policy Center. At least three major gun manufacturers have sought



bankruptcy protection to avoid liability claims.

<p>For example, Lorcin Engineering arrogantly stated in 1996 that

it was filing for bankruptcy to protect the company from at least



18 pending liability suits. Lorcin officials stated to Firearms



Business gun industry trade publications that the company chose to



"take advantage of the system" when it filed for bankruptcy.

<p>Davis Industries, also motivated by pending product liability

claims as well as lawsuits filed by U.S. cities including Chicago,



New Orleans, Miami, Atlanta, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Detroit



filed for bankruptcy protection in May 1999. Sundance Industries



sought bankruptcy protection in August 1999. As a result, the



Superior Court of California enjoined the City of Los Angeles from



pursuing Sundance in the city's lawsuit against gun manufacturers.

<p>"The gun industry is already exempt from health and safety

regulation. A gun maker should be held fully accountable when a



jury determines that it acted negligently or recklessly," added



Rand.
