<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 24 - Hillary Clinton's campaign for 

the U.S. Senate is getting a big boost from the entertainment 

industry, according to an analysis of her first campaign finance 

report by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clinton raised at least $437,000 from individuals working in 

movies, television and music - second only to the $667,000 she 

got from lawyers, a traditional Democratic constituency. Her 

biggest single contributor was the Walt Disney Co., whose executives, 

employees and families gave $56,550 to her campaign effort. Most 

of those dollars came from donors in Disney's Miramax Films division.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She also drew nearly $364,000 from the securities & investment 

industry. Her number two donor was the Wall Street investment 

firm of Goldman, Sachs & Co., whose executives and families gave 

$39,120.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Center's analysis covers money raised by the Clinton Senate 

campaign during 1999, both directly and through proceeds from 

a joint Senate fundraiser. The First Lady raised nearly $8.1 

million during that period - more than 61% of it coming from 

individual donors giving $1,000 or more. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reflecting the nationwide interest in this year's New York Senate 

race, the First Lady's contributions flowed in from every corner 

of the nation. Just over 44% of the money she collected - some 

$2.7 million - came from New York state. The rest came from 45 

other states and the District of Columbia.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The New York City metro area was by far her richest mother lode 

of contributions, providing over $2.2 million in donations of 

$200 or more. Her other leading metro areas were Washington, 

DC ($515,000); Los Angeles ($408,000); Boston ($236,000); and 

Chicago ($226,000).



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within the entertainment industry, Clinton's money came from 

both coasts. She drew $201,740 in entertainment/media money from 

New York, and just under $170,000 from California. The list of 

donors is studded with Hollywood stars - from Tom Cruise and 

Tom Hanks to Barbra Streisand, Cicely Tyson, and filmmakers Steven 

Spielberg and Martin Scorcese.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Big name designers - many of whom have also enlivened the First 

Lady's wardrobe over the years - also popped up on the donor 

list. Among them were Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Oscar de 

la Renta. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The top donors and industries to the Clinton Senate campaign 

are as follows:

1999 can be found on the Center's website at 



http://www.opensecrets.org/2000elect/dist_total/NYS0.htm



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Contributions by Clinton's Republican rival, New York Mayor Rudy 

Giuliani, were still not available in electronic format from 

the Federal Election Commission as of this morning, making analysis 

of his money all but impossible. 



Despite the fact that both the Clinton and Giuliani campaigns 

are using high-tech software to keep track of their contributions, 

both filed their reports only on paper. The FEC must then re-enter 

all contributions by hand at taxpayer expense, causing a substantial 

delay in the computerized availability of the data. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A complete analysis of the Giuliani contributions will be released 

by the Center next week, presuming the data is computerized by 

the FEC in time.
