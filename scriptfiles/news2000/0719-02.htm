- July 19 - In mid-July, police discovered the tortured body of Arthur Warren Jr., a 26-year-old African-American who was an openly gay man, near a rural road in Fairmont, West Virginia. Warren had been savagely beaten and his beaten body driven over numerous times by his killers’ car. Despite mounting evidence that Warren’s killers were motivated by hatred of the young man’s sexual orientation, a West Virginia sheriff has steadfastly maintained that neither homophobia nor racism was the killers’ motive.

      When it comes to hate crimes, America still has two standards of justice. Fewer than half the states have hate crime laws and 22 of them cover sexual orientation. The federal government’s hate crime statute, like West Virginia’s, covers crimes that are motivated by the victims’ race, religion, color or national origin, but does not include crimes whose victims are targeted because of their sexual orientation, gender or disability

    </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

      On Wednesday, July 19 at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., a Website, called United Against Hate, <a href="http://www.unitedagainsthate.org/">www.unitedagainsthate.org</a>, was unveiled. United Against Hate, a project of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, is intended to mobilize grassroots efforts to persuade Congress to reconfigure and bolster the hate crime law.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

      Under current law, the government must prove that the crime occurred because of a person’s membership in a designated group and because the victim was engaged in a federally protected activity. Legislation pending in the House (H.R. 1082) and already approved by the Senate (Sec. 1507 of the National Defense Authorization Act) would change current law to enable federal prosecutors to act against hate crimes when state authorities fail to do so. Both the House and Senate bills would also expand coverage to hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation, gender and disability.

<p>

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We appreciate the Senate’s approval of a strengthened law on hate crimes," said Ralph Neas, People For the American Way’s president. "Now it’s time for the House to follow the Senate’s lead and take a firm stand against hate crimes."

      Speaking at today’s press conference were victims of recent hate crimes. Sangita Patel, critically wounded by Richard Scott Baumhammers, who went on a rampage against non-Europeans in Pittsburgh last April, and Michael Messing, shot at during the July 4<sup>th</sup> weekend in 1999 by Benjamin Smith, a racist associated with an anti-Semitic group, both called on Congress to take action now against crimes spurred on by hate for different cultures.

      In People For the American Way Foundation’s forthcoming annual report on anti-gay harassment, called <i>Hostile Climate 2000</i>, the parents of soldier Barry Winchell relate the pain of losing a son to a violent, brutal killing that was spurred on in part because of his sexual orientation. Winchell’s parents said their deep love for their son and the shock of losing him to a violent hate crime have forced them to be activists against hate.

<p>

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our children’s happiness, not their sexual orientation, is all that matters to us," write Pat and Wally Kutteles, Winchell’s parents in a <i>Hostile Climate</i> essay. "We wanted our sons to know that our love for them is unconditional. If you love your child, whether gay or not, you’re going to fight for him. We loved our son very, very much. And we want the world to know how much we loved him and were proud of him."
