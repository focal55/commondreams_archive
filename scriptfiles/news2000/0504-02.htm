- May 4 - The nation's leading



conservation groups warned today that damaging congressional attacks



on the environment are expected to proliferate this summer as



Congress rushes to adjourn before the November elections.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups expect that most anti-environmental riders will be



added to "must pass" appropriations bills that Congress has to



enact in order to avoid a government shutdown.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Polluters and their allies in Congress are trying to hide their



attacks on our environmental and public health protections in



massive federal spending bills," said Gene Karpinski, executive



director of U.S. PIRG and chairman of a task force comprising many



the nation's largest environmental organizations. The groups



identified in this release have agreed to jointly oppose all



anti-environment riders.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, more than 70 riders were proposed for 11 appropriations



bills. Some of the most egregious riders were withdrawn or defeated



after being exposed to public scrutiny. Nevertheless, appropriations



riders remain the favorite tactic for sneaking through anti-environme



ntal provisions that would not survive as stand alone legislation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We successfully held off many of these environmental sneak



attacks last year and we are prepared to fight to the end again



this year if necessary," said Karpinski. "But we hope that won't



be necessary and that congressional leaders will respect the



public's overwhelming desire to keep environmental protection laws



intact."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the first appropriations bills of this year -- funding



the Department of Agriculture -- will be considered by House and



Senate subcommittees today. Environmental groups expect Rep.



Joseph Knollenberg (R-MI) to repeat his efforts to use the House



bill to block federal efforts to address global climate change and



reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other anti-environmental proposals that conservation groups



expect to be proposed this year include:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Accelerated destruction of wetlands -- The National Association



of Home Builders has vowed to block new Army Corps of Engineers



regulations that would reduce wetlands destruction caused by



nationwide development permits. Rep. Ron Packard (R-CA) may



attempt to attach this rider to the Agriculture or Energy and Water



spending bill.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Exploitation of national forests -- Sen. Larry Craig (R-ID) is



expected to try to fatally delay a Forest Service proposal to



protect 40-60 million acres of national forests as roadless areas.



Sen. Slade Gorton (R-WA) has also promised to undermine this



protection for old-growth forests and open up these ancient



woodlands to more clearcutting. This rider is expected to be



included in the Interior spending bill.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blocking action on global climate change -- Rep. Knollenberg may



try to limit the government's ability to address climate change



issues and help other countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions



by attaching riders to several spending bills. A similar



Knollenberg rider became law as part of the Omnibus Appropriations



Bill last year. A rider attached to the Transportation spending



bill will likely try block new miles-per-gallon standards that



would help curb global warming and save consumers money at the gas



pump.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Expand toxic mine wastes -- Sen. Craig also is expected to



continue his efforts to weaken the 1872 Mining Law by legalizing



unlimited toxic mine waste dumping on public lands for the hardrock



mining industry -- our nation's largest toxic polluter. He may



attach such a rider to the Interior spending bill.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These are only a few of the dozens of anti-environmental



riders that conservation groups fear could be offered this year,



which means a particularly bad summer for the environment in



Congress. "In this election year, protection for the environment



is going to be a measuring stick for many members of Congress,"



said Karpinski. "We urge members of Congress to oppose all attacks



on environmental and public health protections," he added.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Riders that were proposed last year would have jeopardized



wildlife and wetlands, national parks, forests and public lands,



and would have put Americans at risk from dirty water, polluted



air, and global warming. Among the most damaging anti-environmental



riders last year were:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A global warming rider that prohibited the Department of



Transportation from increasing miles per gallon standards. This



rider, passed on the Department of Transportation bill, cost



consumers more money at the pump and contributed to global warming



pollution.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An anti-wildlife rider, attached by Sen. Craig to the Interior



spending bill but ultimately defeated, would have allowed federal



agencies to ignore the devastating effects of logging and mining on



wildlife in our National Forests.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A dirty air rider, pushed by Representatives Ted Strickland



(D-OH), Michael Oxley (R-OH), Todd Tiahrt (R-KS) and Richard Burr



(R-NC) but ultimately blocked, would have allowed electric power



plants to pollute without fear of enforcement action by the federal



government.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A grazing rider, enacted as part of the Omnibus Appropriations



bill after being attached by Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM),



automatically allowed destructive grazing on ecologically sensitive



land to continue regardless of damage to public resources.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A noise pollution rider, tried to delay National Park Service



efforts to reduce noise pollution in the Grand Canyon. This rider



was proposed by Senators Richard Bryan (D-NV) and Harry Reid (D-NV)



on behalf of the air tour industry that wanted to delay



restrictions on sightseeing overflights at the park.
