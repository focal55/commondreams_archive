- October 30 - Americans

          United for Separation of Church and State today asked the Internal

          Revenue Service to investigate two churches for possible violations of

          the federal tax law's ban on church politicking.</font>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Americans

          United asserted that the Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria,

          Va., and the Greater Grace Temple of the Apostolic Faith in Detroit,

          Mich., engaged in partisan politicking during yesterday's church

          services by encouraging support for Democratic candidates.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Federal

          tax law clearly prohibits church intervention in a political campaign,

          but that appears to be exactly what these churches did,&quot; said the

          Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &quot;The

          election may be just days away, but houses of worship have no business

          trying to help rally support for specific candidates.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

          Alfred Street Baptist Church appeared to cross the line by hosting a

          partisan speech delivered by President Bill Clinton on behalf of Vice

          President Al Gore and Virginia Sen. Chuck Robb.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When

          I'm gone, I hope that Chuck Robb will be left behind,&quot; Clinton

          said from the church's pulpit. He added, &quot;I never saw anybody

          take more chances to stick up for little people and lost causes.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While

          at the church's pulpit, Clinton also voiced his support for Gore.

          &quot;I shouldn't have to tell you who to vote for -- you already know

          who I'm for,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;This is not rocket

          science.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As

          AU's Lynn said in his complaint to the IRS, &quot;While efforts aimed

          at increasing voter turnout would not present a problem, this event

          appears to have been a campaign rally held during a church worship

          service that was designed to benefit certain candidates. It also seems

          likely that a significant degree of coordination between the church,

          the Robb campaign, the Gore campaign and the White House would have

          been necessary to plan the event. I believe this amounts to a church

          endorsement of the Robb and Gore campaigns.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Americans

          United also reported today the political activities of the Greater

          Grace Temple of the Apostolic Faith in Detroit. Immediately before

          Gore was given an opportunity to deliver a campaign speech from the

          church's pulpit, Bishop Charles H. Ellis III, pastor of the

          congregation, offered a partisan introduction of the Democratic

          presidential candidate.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We

          have seen in this state what Republican dominance and control will

          do,&quot; Ellis said. The election, he added, was therefore a

          &quot;no-brainer. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ellis

          also chastised former President George Bush for naming Clarence Thomas

          to the Supreme Court. Thomas, Ellis said, has &quot;done more damage

          to the cause of African Americans than all the justices that have come

          before him.&quot; Noting it was Gov. George W. Bush's father who

          nominated Thomas, Ellis concluded, &quot;The branch does not fall far

          from the tree.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following

          Gore's remarks, Ellis presented the Democratic nominee with a jacket

          embroidered with the phrase, &quot;President Al Gore.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Section

          501(c)(3) of federal tax law prohibits tax-exempt organizations,

          including churches, from intervening in political campaigns on behalf

          of or in opposition to candidates for public office.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

          IRS has a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy for violations. In 1995

          the federal agency revoked the tax exemption of the Church at Pierce

          Creek in upstate New York after the church paid for newspaper

          advertisements against presidential candidate Bill Clinton in 1992.

          The IRS investigation was sparked by a formal complaint filed by

          Americans United.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Churches

          should never be turned into cogs in a partisan political

          machine,&quot; said AU's Lynn. &quot;Whether it's Democratic

          candidates in inner-city churches or Christian Coalition voter guides

          in fundamentalist churches, federal tax law prohibits this kind of

          politicking to protect churches' integrity and the democratic process.

          The law, therefore, must be followed.&quot;</font></p>
