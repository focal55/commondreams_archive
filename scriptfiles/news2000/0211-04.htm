- February 11 - February 11, 2000 - Hoping to redefine "politics as usual" in the California Senatorial race, both Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Congressman Tom Campbell (R-CA), GOP front-runner for the Republican nomination to challenge Feinstein, have signed The Interfaith Alliance's Framework of Civility for Political Candidates.  The Framework offers ethical and civil guidelines which strongly discourage the use of negative campaign tactics.  If Feinstein and Campbell hold to their civility commitments, they may begin to recover Californians' trust in the electoral process, damaged by a particularly nasty 1998 senatorial race.



<p>Congressman Campbell, in his statement of endorsement, writes, "The values set forth in the Framework are those which I have tried to demonstrate in the conduct of each of my campaigns.  It is gratifying to see this issue joined at a national level.  Treating one's opponents with dignity is a demonstration of the strength of one's own beliefs and promotes a higher level of participation in the political process."</p>



<p>In endorsing the Framework, Senator Feinstein's campaign manager Kam Kuwata states, "Senator Dianne Feinstein and her campaign proudly support and will sign 'The Call for Civility in American Politics.'  In this critical election year, we truly believe that a campaign based on the issues that mean so much to the people of California is a must."</p>



<p>The<A HREF="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/tia/press/wcg-bio.html" NAME="Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy">Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy</a>, comments, "As voters' interest in the 2000 elections broadens from a focus on the presidential campaign to senatorial and congressional races, I applaud the eagerness of both Congressman Campbell and Senator Feinstein to endorse the Framework.  Their leadership in establishing the tenor and direction of the California Senate race offers voters the opportunity to regain faith in our democratic process. Voters deserve campaigns of integrity, civility and respect for opponents." </p>



<p>The California candidates are the second senatorial pair to sign the Framework.  Last week, in a close and already contentious race for U.S. Senate in Missouri, Sen. John Ashcroft (R-MO) and Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan became the first senatorial candidates to endorse the Framework.  These senatorial candidates join presidential candidates Bill Bradley, George W. Bush, Al Gore, Orrin Hatch and John McCain who signed in December.</p>
