- October 3 - The following was released



today by Handgun Control and the Center to Prevent Handgun



Violence:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the first pieces of legislation signed by George W. Bush



as Governor, which allows the carrying of concealed handguns in



public, came under fire today from the Los Angeles Times. Today's



Times story, "Felons Get Concealed Gun Licenses under Bush's



'Tough' Law," again demonstrates the serious problems created by



the carrying concealed handgun legislation in Texas. According to



the Times' in-depth research, Texas has licensed more than 400



criminals with prior convictions since the inception of the



concealed-handgun program, and more than 3,000 other licensees have



since been arrested. Governor Bush signed the law permitting



concealed-carry in 1995, and in 1997 signed another law removing



churches, hospitals, nursing homes and amusement parks from the



list of places where carrying concealed handguns was prohibited.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter to Jim Brady in 1995, the Governor wrote that "(he)



does not believe allowing responsible, law abiding citizens who are



trained and licensed to carry weapons for their personal protection



will lead to an increase in crime." Despite the Governor's hopes,



a recently released report from the Violence Policy Center



demonstrated that Texans with concealed-carry licenses were 66



percent more likely to be arrested for firearms violations than



Texans who did not have licenses.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The LA Times has now demonstrated conclusively what other



research has suggested," said Sarah Brady, Chair of Handgun



Control. "Lax laws that do not permit the police to exercise



discretion about who can carry hidden handguns let criminals



through the cracks. And even citizens without prior convictions



carrying handguns in their waistbands and purses are tempted to



misuse them in the heat of the moment."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Governor Bush has allowed dangerous criminals to carry



concealed handguns, and put his own state's citizens at risk,"



Mrs. Brady said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a 1999 form letter sent out by the Bush campaign in response



to inquiries on the gun issue, the Governor echoes the gun lobby's



mantra of 'tough laws and long sentences' for those who use guns to



commit crimes. In the letter from the campaign, Bush also wrote



about the carrying concealed handgun law, "I believe this



legislation is helping make Texas a safer place to live."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, as pointed out by both the Houston Chronicle



(12/8/99) and The Wall Street Journal (3/29/00), more than



700 criminals who were known to possess guns -- because they



used them to pass the training standards for concealed handgun



licenses -- were not prosecuted by state authorities, despite



the applicants' failure of the background check process and



prohibition from gun ownership.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Concealed Truth," a report released by the Center to Prevent



Handgun Violence this year, demonstrated that since peaking in



1992, the violent crime rate dropped 30 percent (through 1998) in



states that restrict or prohibit carrying concealed handguns



compared to a decline of less than 20 percent in states that eased



restrictions on carrying hidden guns in public as a way to attack



crime in their communities. The disparity in crime reduction is



even greater for robbery -- the crime theoretically most affected



by changes in carry laws similar to those implemented in Texas. In



states that only issue concealed carry permits to individuals who



can demonstrate the need to carry a concealed handgun or prohibit



the practice altogether, the robbery rate declined 44 percent --



nearly twice as much as the decline in states with Texas-style



laws.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's no wonder that the NRA's chief lobbyist has said publicly



that Governor Bush has never denied them any part of their



legislative agenda," Mrs. Brady said. "Concealed-carry of hidden



handguns was at the top of the NRA's wish list throughout the '90s.



The danger it presented was always clear. Now that the danger is



objectively verified, we urge Governor Bush to reconsider his



support for the dangerously permissive carrying of concealed



handguns."

Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974 by



Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. "Pete" Shields, two victims of gun



violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law



enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups across



the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and local gun



control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI has more than



500,000 members and supporters nationwide, making it the nation's



largest citizens' gun control lobbying organization. More



information about HCI and its sister organization, the Center to



Prevent Handgun Violence, can be found on our website at
