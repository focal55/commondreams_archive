- October 9 - On the last night to register new voters in the state of

New York, Green Party Presidential candidate Ralph Nader will rally with

thousands of supporters and celebrity backers at Madison Square Garden on

October 13th at 8 p.m.



<p>The campaign intends to channel the increasing demands to include Nader in

the presidential debates into a massive get-out-the-vote effort that will

register thousands of New York voters.  The event will include performances

by Eddie Vedder, Ben Harper, Patti Smith and Ani DiFranco and inspirational

speeches by Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, Bill Murray, Michael Moore and Phil

Donahue.



<p>"This Friday the 13th, we're going to pack Madison Square Garden with

thousands of supporters who will vote their conscience and not their fears

in November," said Nader 2000 campaign manager Theresa Amato.  "This

campaign has struck a chord with Americans who have been left out of the

political process-we're generating tremendous enthusiasm with young people,

independent voters and the non-voters who would otherwise sit out the

elections than cast their ballot for the corporately-financed, look-a-like

parties.  Madison Square Garden will be a watershed event to galvanize

supporters in New York and across the country."



<p>The Madison Square Garden rally is the sixth in a series of

volunteer-coordinated rallies that have drawn the largest crowds for any

presidential candidate, demonstrating a groundswell of grassroots support

for Nader/LaDuke. Crowds of 10-12,000 have turned out to the paid rallies in

Portland, Minneapolis, Seattle and Boston demanding Nader's participation in

the presidential debates.  There is also a rally in Chicago, Illinois on

October 10th.





<p>The Nader campaign has raised nearly $5 million with an average donation of

less than $100, and is not accepting PAC money or raising soft money. The

Nader/LaDuke ticket is on the ballot in 44 states.





<p>"It mystifies me that this country will send troops to other countries in

the name of preserving or achieving democracy, and yet we can't seem to find

a way to give candidates like Ralph Nader a voice in our own Presidential

debates," says Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. "In fact, he isn't even allowed to

attend the debates," says Vedder referring to Nader being denied access to

the Boston debate-viewing auditorium, for which he had a ticket to attend.



<p>Vedder adds, "It would seem that a true democracy would pride itself in

coming up with valid forums where a third-party Presidential candidate like

Nader could be heard. Instead, we find out that the debates are

corporate-funded exercises where two like-minded candidates deliver

practiced answers that leave the voter once again feeling that the real

issues are not being addressed."



<p>Tickets to the Nader rally at Madison Square Garden are available for a

suggested donation of $20 at the Madison Square Garden box office

(212-465-6000), through Nader's website at <a href="http://www.votenader.com">www.votenader.com</a> or

<a href="http://www.votenader.org">www.votenader.org</a>, (click on Super Rally) or by calling the Nader 2000 New

York office at 212-353-3111 or 212-254-4194.
