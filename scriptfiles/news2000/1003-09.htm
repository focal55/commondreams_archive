- October 3 - Linda Tarr-Whelan,



president of the Center for Policy Alternatives, is an active



media source and has appeared and debated on numerous news programs,



including ABC World News Tonight, CNN Financial News, and Fox



News. She has been quoted in the New York Times, the Washington



Post, the Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, and media outlets across



the country as a leading source on women, politics and the economy.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the most in-depth and thorough analysis of all women and



women voters in the 2000 presidential election season, the Center



for Policy Alternatives and Lifetime Television released results



last week from a national poll that describe a complex picture of



American women's priorities and values, where feelings of economic



optimism are tempered by unmet expectations of the possibilities of



a good economy. A full copy of the report can be downloaded at



www.stateaction.org. The Women's Voices report also includes 10 Key



Points to Understand about Women in the 2000 Elections.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Highlights show:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Women see opportunity rather than instability in a time of



economic change, but many women say the economic boom has not



reached them.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Women urgently and consistently placed juggling time and



family and equal pay and benefits as the most dominant economic



concerns in their lives.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- There has been a shift in women's support for the role



government can play in partnering with them to find solutions for



their concerns, with nearly 60 percent of women saying government



can and should help.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Concern about moral values continues to top the list and



women and men continue to believe by large margins that parents



having more time with their children is the preferred solution.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Control" and "flexibility" are women's watchwords for dealing



with economic change regardless of their income, marital status,



race, party or generation," said Linda Tarr-Whelan, president of



the Center for Policy Alternatives. "Equal pay with benefits and



flexibility to juggle family and work have been remarkably constant



as women's top concerns over the last three election cycles even



though the country has moved from a bad economy to a good economy.



Women will determine the outcome of the election. How the



candidates choose to listen and respond to women's voices with



meaningful solutions will have important consequences."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Women's Voices 2000 found that class differences, now



particularly driven by education and marital status, are emerging



as a key determinant of a woman's economic outlook. This national



research project, which began with a series of racially and



economically diverse focus groups to listen to the voices of women



and the national poll released last week was conducted by the



bi-partisan and multi-cultural team of Celinda Lake, Linda DiVall,



Linda Williams, and Anna Rivera. The poll consisted of a sample of



800 women of all races and ages and 400 men; with over-sampling of



Latinas, African-American and Asian-American women. Women's Voices



was first conducted in 1992 and is the only comprehensive



initiative of women's views that has been done in subsequent



presidential elections, this being the third.</font>
