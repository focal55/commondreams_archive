<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK  

-  

February 24 - The East Timor Action Network condemned continued training by the U.S. of 

Indonesian military officers as a violation of a Congressional ban on 

military ties with Indonesia.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Washington Post recently reported that seven officers participating in 

the E-IMET (the "expanded" International Military Education and Training) 

program remained in the U.S. after President Clinton cut all U.S.training, 

weapons transfers and other military ties with Indonesia in the wake of 

brutal military and militia violence in East Timor following its 

pro-independence vote. The officers have recently resumed their classes.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The training of the Indonesian officers must cease. It violates the law 

and demonstrates the Pentagon's continued disregard of congressional intent 

and human rights," said Lynn Fredriksson, Washington Representative of the 

East Timor Action Network.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In November, Congress set six specific conditions Indonesia must meet 

before receiving almost any U.S. military assistance. These include 

ensuring the safe return of over 100,000 East Timorese refugees trapped in 

militia-controlled camps in West Timor and prosecuting those responsible 

for atrocities committed against the people of East Timor. The conditions 

also require Indonesia to actively prevent militia incursions into East 

Timor. The restrictions are part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act 

which specifically bans E-IMET and IMET training.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Rather than sending false signals to an Indonesian military still far from

civilian control, the Pentagon should follow the law and end the training," 

said Fredriksson. "Decades of U.S. military training of the Indonesian 

military did nothing to temper their abusive behavior. There is no reason 

to believe that training now will lead to improvements. The best way to 

support Indonesian democracy is to follow a policy that makes clear to the 

Indonesian military that normal military relations are impossible until 

rights abuses end and the military fully withdraws from politics," she added.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some U.S. officials have argued that the Indonesian military is being 

reformed and relations should be restored. (They point to the potential 

prosecution of General Wiranto, but Indonesia's President Wahid has said he 

will pardon him if convicted.) But the U.S. suspension remains in place, as 

it should, while human rights abuses by the Indonesian military continue in 

Aceh and West Papua as well as West Timor.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shortly after President Clinton announced the cutting of military ties, 

Indonesia agreed to withdraw from East Timor and allow in an Australian-led 

multi-national peacekeeping force, measures it had previously resisted.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The East Timor Action Network/US was founded in November 1991, following 

the massacre of more than 271 peaceful demonstrators in Dili, East Timor. 

ETAN/US supports independence and human rights for the people of East Timor 

and democracy and human rights in Indonesia. ETAN has 28 local chapters.
