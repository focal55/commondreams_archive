- April 26 - Authorities continue blocking shipment of essential medical supplies of Doctors

Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) into the war-torn north of Sri

Lanka. Because of a sudden change in the procedure for approval and

transportation of medicines, it will take another month before the supplies can

go through. Doctors Without Borders warns of a medical emergency in the northern

districts. The emergency medical relief organization once again calls on the

government of Sri Lanka to expedite the transport of medical supplies into the

north without further delay.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color:black">“Despite urgent

appeals to government officials last week and despite the oral assurances of

military officials, our medical supplies remain blocked,”says Isabel Simpson,

Doctors Without Borders’ Head of Mission in Sri Lanka. “Our supplies of

antibiotics, pain relief drugs, oxygen and anaesthetics in the projects in

Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu are becoming dangerously low.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>In addition, the list of approved drugs has been reduced from 186 items

to only 81. Surgical supplies have also been restricted.”<o:p>

</span>Typically Doctors Without Borders carries out 25 major surgical

procedures per week. In the last few days, 8 surgical patients, including two

men over 60 years of age and two children under 14 years, have been sent home

without analgesic treatment. Three pregnant mothers have been admitted to the

maternity ward with serious complications awaiting further treatment, one due to

lack of chloroquine medication for malaria. There has also been an increase in

chronic disease admissions for people suffering from complications due to lack

of regular medication. These patients include 3 diabetics, 5 asthmatics, an

epileptic and a vascular disease patient who suffered a stroke. More than 25

patients have been admitted suffering from malaria or fever and have also been

unable to receive treatment.<o:p>
