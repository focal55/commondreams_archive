<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- May 4 - </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">STATEMENT BY MARK SOLER<br>

PRESIDENT, YOUTH LAW CENTER<br>

DIRECTOR, BUILDING BLOCKS FOR YOUTH</font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The Building Blocks for Youth initiative, a new national initiative to

promote a justice system that is both fair and effective, commends the

Leadership Conference on Civil Rights for the release of their report,

"Justice on Trial."  As the report makes abundantly clear, despite the

fact that minority communities in America are making progress in

accessing educational and economic opportunities, in the criminal

justice arena racial inequality is growing.  Unless addressed these

injustices will continue to threaten the hard-fought civil rights

victories of the last fifty years.



	</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As "Justice on Trial" indicates, African-Americans and Latinos are

disproportionately targeted by police, unfairly victimized by skewed

charging and plea bargaining decisions by prosecutors, given harsher

sentences and disproportionately impacted by "get tough" policies

enacted by lawmakers.  The findings in "Justice on Trial" are consistent

with the report released last week by the Building Blocks for Youth

initiative examining racial disparities in the juvenile justice system. 

That report, titled "And Justice for Some," looked at decisions to

charge youth in juvenile court, to detain them before trial, to transfer

them to adult criminal court, to incarcerate them in juvenile

facilities, and to incarcerate them in adult prisons, in each case

comparing minority youth and white youth charged with similar offenses. 

The results are consistent.  As a consequence, minorities suffer a

"cumulative disadvantage" when it comes to justice in this country. 

Moreover, recent legislative and policy trends throughout the country

make it clear that these disparities will continue for the foreseeable

future unless political leaders and public officials take significant

action at the federal, state, and local levels.



	</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As these two reports indicate, there is something terribly wrong with

our justice system.  Justice by race is no justice at all.  The reports

paint a devastating picture of a system that has totally failed to

uphold the American promise of "equal justice for all." 



	</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Building Blocks for Youth initiative proudly joins with the

Leadership Conference on Civil Rights in the call for federal, state,

and local officials to take significant action now to address this

problem.  Federal, state and local officials should immediately

investigate the disparate racial impact of their laws and policies,

particularly those providing for prosecution of juveniles in adult

criminal court, and should immediately stop incarcerating young people

with adult inmates in jails and prisons.
