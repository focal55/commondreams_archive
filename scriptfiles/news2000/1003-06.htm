- October 3 - FLINT The League of Conservation Voters today launched a television 

                ad campaign aimed at exposing Senator Spencer Abraham’s record 

                of voting against environmental and public health protections.  

                The ads will begin running tomorrow on all major broadcast networks 

                in the Flint and Lansing areas.  LCV is planning to spend more 

                than $500,000 on its Dirty Dozen campaign to defeat Abraham.

<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When it comes to protecting the Great 

                Lakes, drinking water and Michigan’s quality of life, Senator 

                Abraham is not on our side, said LCV President Deb Callahan.  

                Michigan’s environment is too important to be sacrificed by someone 

                who is more concerned about the interests of polluters than the 

                interests of people.  That’s why the League of Conservation Voters 

                named Spencer Abraham to the Dirty Dozen, and that’s why we have 

                hit the airwaves to highlight his anti-environment record.  Voters 

                should make sure his efforts to weaken clean air and water protections 

                are not allowed to continue.  </font></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Abraham has compiled a lifetime environmental 

                voting score of 6 percent the worst in Michigan and the worst 

                in the Great Lakes region.  In addition, he has taken more campaign 

                contributions from polluting industries and interests than any 

                other Senate candidate more than $600,000 as of July 31, 2000.  

                Abraham has voted against important clean water programs that 

                would help make waters across the nation safer for fishing and 

                swimming.<sup>1</sup> He has also voted against increased funding 

                for the clean up of toxic waste sites.<sup>2</sup>    </font></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Michigan residents deserve a senator who will 

                invest time and effort into protecting their environment and public 

                health, Callahan said.  That is why LCV is making a major investment 

                to bring Abraham’s anti-environmental record to the attention 

                of voters.  Clean air and water will make a difference in the 

                outcome of this race.</font></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The League of Conservation Voters is the political voice for the 

              national environmental community.    LCV plans to spend $6 million 

              this election cycle to hold federal officials and candidates accountable 

              on the environment.  Abraham was named to LCV’s Dirty Dozen list 

              on June 21, 2000.  For more information about LCV’s political campaigns,
