- April 25 - The "limited" national



missile defense system proposed by President Clinton fails to meet



the four criteria that the President has outlined as the basis for



the deployment decision later this year, concludes a new study



released today in Washington.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The broadest and most in-depth study on the subject to date,



"Pushing the Limits: The Decision on National Missile Defense," was



produced by the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers and the Council



for a Livable World Education Fund. The 57-page report presents a



comprehensive analysis of each of the criteria, examines the history



of national missile defense in U.S. politics, and warns of the impact



employing such a faulty system would have on the future of U.S.



security.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report finds that a precipitous decision to deploy unproven



and very costly missile defenses later this year "will diminish



overall U.S. and international security, increasing rather than



reducing nuclear dangers."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Clinton has said he will decide later this year whether



to endorse deployment of a national missile defense that is designed



to detect, intercept, and destroy a small number of long-range



missiles that might be fired at the U.S. He has said his decision



will be based on four criteria: the readiness of the technology, the



impact on arms control and international relations, the cost, and the



nature of the missile threat.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Estimates of the cost of the proposed, ground-based national



anti-missile system have increased dramatically beyond early



estimates, according to "Pushing the Limits."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The public and the policy makers may soon feel NMD 'sticker



shock,'" warns report author and deputy director of the Coalition,



Stephen Young. "It is unwise to commit to deploy and invest tens of



billions of dollars on national missile defense when the technology



remains unproven and appears unlikely to work against even a minimal



threat."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A new cost estimate released today by the non-partisan



Congressional Budget Office (CBO) puts the total cost of building and



deploying the three phases of Clinton's proposed "limited" national



missile defense system at $59.4 billion from 1996 through 2015. The



new CBO estimate raises the cost projection for the first phase of



the system by over 15%, to $29.5 billion. Until now the Pentagon had



projected the cost of building and running a single site of 100



interceptors at $25.6 billion through from 1996 through 2015.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also points out that the proposed system does not meet



the "technical readiness" criteria. With only three of 19 scheduled



tests performed, it has not been shown to work under real-world



conditions. A sound decision on technical readiness for deployment



cannot be made this year, according to the report. Other anti-



missile systems have been put through far more rigorous testing. The



"Safeguard" missile defense system, deployed in 1975 and canceled



after one day of operation, was put through 165 missile flight tests.



The "Patriot" theater missile defense system was tested 114 times.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The operational effectiveness of the system cannot be



demonstrated by the end of this year, even if the third test is



successful because the system will not have been tested against



realistic countermeasures," says Young.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some officials maintain that a new missile threat to the U.S.



might potentially emerge by 2005, but the joint Coalition/Council



study points out that the maturation of the threat is not certain.



North Korea has agreed to freeze its missile flight test program and



may improve relations with the U.S., Japan, and South Korea. Rather



than deploying an unproven missile defense, the United States can and



should pursue diplomatic, political, and economic tools to prevent

or



delay the maturation of any new missile threats, according to the



report.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new "Pushing the Limits" report points out that it would be



far cheaper, even for countries like North Korea, to develop



countermeasures that could overwhelm or confuse the proposed system



than it would be for the U.S. to increase the capabilities of its



missile defense.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Clinton administration insists the proposed system should not



affect arms control goals. It seeks modifications to the 1972



Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow for the system. Russia has



rejected proposals to modify the ABM Treaty. On April 14, President



Putin warned that if the U.S. withdraws from the ABM Treaty, "...we



will have the chance and we will withdraw not only from the START II



treaty, but from the whole system of treaties on limitation and



control of strategic and conventional weapons."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Authorizing deployment could put at serious risk the nuclear



non-proliferation regime and efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons,"



said Young. This week, many of the 180+ nations at the



Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference will express concern



about the negative impact of national missile defense.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "Pushing the Limits" report notes that in response to



deployment, China is likely to expand its relatively small strategic



nuclear arsenal, increasing tensions across Asia. In addition, the



report also emphasizes that America's NATO allies have all expressed



concerns about U.S. plans for missile defense.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A precipitous decision to deploy would strain relations with our



allies, ignite a new nuclear arms race, encourage a stronger



Russian-Chinese strategic partnership, hurt international efforts to



address ballistic missile threats, and severely weaken the global



nuclear non-proliferation regime," warns Young.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "Pushing the Limits" report recommends that the president



should allow the time necessary to reach an understanding with Russia



on how best to reduce potential new missile threats while



simultaneously achieving verifiable reductions in existing nuclear



arsenals and reducing the risk of accidental nuclear war.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On April 17, a group of 25 senators, including Senate Majority



Leader Lott (R-MS), wrote President Clinton that they will reject a



U.S.-Russian agreement to further reduce nuclear arsenals and



modification of the ABM Treaty if it does not allow the U.S. to



develop even more expensive -- and as yet unproven and unworkable --



sea- and space-based national missile defenses. In 1996, the Senate



Budget Committee conservatively estimated that such a layered system



would cost $124 billion to build and maintain through 2015.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If the most extreme supporters of missile defense are allowed to



have their way, the United States would throw away the historic



opportunity to reduce verifiably the real threat of thousands of



Russian nuclear-armed missiles for the sake of trying to build a



fantastical 'Star Wars' defense system that will cost taxpayers over



$100 billion and take many more years to develop," notes John Isaacs



of the Council for a Livable World.

nuclear non-proliferation and arms control organizations committed

to



a practical, step-by-step program of action to reduce nuclear



dangers. The report, "Pushing the Limits," is available on the Web
