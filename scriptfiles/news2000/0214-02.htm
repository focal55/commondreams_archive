- February 14 - In a case being closely watched around the nation, a federal

appeals court will today consider whether the government can

indefinitely detain thousands of immigrants -- many for as long as the

rest of their lives.



<p> "This case raises important questions about fundamental fairness in

America," said Judy Rabinovitz, Senior Staff Counsel of  the American

Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants Rights Project, which has coordinated

efforts around the country to overturn indefinite detention. "Even the

government concedes that if these individuals were citizens they could

not be detained."</p>



<p> Today's oral arguments before a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit

Court of Appeals arises from an important lower court decision that

found that the Immigration and Naturalization Service is violating the

constitutional rights of five immigrants by imprisoning them

indefinitely while it seeks to have them deported.</p>



<p> Each of the five immigrants in the case here are longtime permanent

residents with family and other close ties in the United States. Each of

them has run afoul of the criminal justice system and have therefore

been ordered deported by the INS -- even though they have served their

(often minimal) criminal sentences.</p>



<p> The twist for the five immigrants in today's case -- and thousands of

others like them around the United States -- is that their native

countries have refused to allow them back. Countries like Laos,

Cambodia, Vietnam and Cuba either do not have diplomatic relations with

the United States or for other reasons refuse to accept their

repatriated citizens.</p>



<p> Under harsh anti-immigrant legislation adopted by Congress and signed

into law by President Clinton in 1996, the INS has argued that it is

permitted to detain -- often for far longer than their original criminal

sentence -- such immigrants.</p>



<p> The ACLU and other immigrants' rights advocates strongly disagree,

arguing that the 1996 law does not, in fact, give the INS such powers.

"Even if Congress had permitted the INS to indefinitely detain

deportable immigrants," said Jayashri Srikantiah, an attorney with the

ACLU's Immigrants Rights Project, "the practice must be overturned as an

unconstitutional denial of due process under the law."</p>



<p> The five immigrants challenging the INS policies in Seattle are

represented by Jay Stansell and Jennifer Wellman of the Federal Public

Defenders Office. Dozens of organizations filed friend-of-the-court

briefs in the case, arguing that the five should be released from their

indefinite detention and that the law should be overturned as

unconstitutional.</p>
