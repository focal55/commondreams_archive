- June 30 - Today, Hollywood brings to the silver screen the tragic, true story of a courageous band of New England fishermen who found themselves in the clutches of the worst storm ever to hit the East Coast as they plied the high seas for valuable yet increasingly scarce Atlantic swordfish.  The blockbuster film "The Perfect Storm," like the book upon which it is based, offers movie goers a vivid, heart-stopping look at our most perilous profession–commercial fishing.  Few will leave the theater without a deeper understanding of the many dangers fishermen face at sea.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But as a commercial fisherman who fished the Pacific Ocean for 26 years, I know from personal experience that raging storms are not the only threat to our nation's fishermen and their way of life.  Decades of fisheries mismanagement and the capture of too many fish, wanted and unwanted, by too many boats have left our oceans depleted of swordfish and other commercially valuable species.  Habitat-destroying fishing practices such as scallop dredging and bottom trawling have also resulted in fewer fish for fishermen to catch.  And as "The Perfect Storm" illustrates, fewer fish can mean more time and travel at sea for fishermen and no guarantee of success or survival.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Oceans Campaign (AOC) is proud to be a leader in the effort to ensure the long-term productivity of our fishermen and our fish stocks.  AOC is working with Congress to pass the Fisheries Recovery Act (H.R. 4046), federal legislation that would help rebuild our depleted fish stocks by addressing such pressing problems as overfishing, bycatch (the capture of unwanted fish and other sea life that is often thrown back, dead or alive) and ocean habitat destruction.  AOC is also a leading supporter of the Seabed Protection Act (H.R.3059), which would address the threat to ocean habitat posed by bottom trawling and dredging.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are steps the public can take to help our fishermen and ocean fish thrive again.  They include:</font>

<p>



<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Supporting the future of fishing families by asking your seafood retailer or restauranteur to supply you with seafood caught from healthy fish stocks by ocean-friendly fishing methods.

</font>

<p> 



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Checking out "Seafood Watch" on the Monterey Bay Aquarium website, www.mbayaq.org, to learn which seafood choices are best for the oceans or visit www.americanoceans.org to buy sustainable seafood online.

</font>

<p>



<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Voicing concern for viable fishing communities, healthy fish populations and ocean habitat to congressional representatives, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and federal and regional fisheries managers.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Phil Kline is American Oceans Campaign's Fisheries Program Director. Mr. Kline  joined AOC in 1999 after witnessing the precipitous decline of the resources on which his livelihood depended for many years, driving him to become a tireless advocate for sustainable fisheries management and ocean habitat protection.  A founder of the Pacific Marine Conservation Council, he now works full time to improve the management of the nation's fisheries.
