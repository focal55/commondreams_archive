<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> PUEBLO, CO - May 19 - Workers at the Rocky Mountain Steel Mills subsidiary of Oregon Steel Mills, Inc. (NYSE:OS) were more than twice as likely to suffer a serious injury on the job last year as their counterparts in the steel industry, according to an analysis by the United Steelworkers of America.



<p>The study found that, for every 100 workers, Rocky Mountain Steel reported 10.63 accidents which resulted in lost work time or restricted duty in 1999 - more than double the steel industry average of 4.7 as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.



<p>Rocky Mountain Steel also compared unfavorably with its closest competitor, the Pennsylvania Steel Technologies unit of Bethlehem Steel Corp. (NYSE:BS), which had a "lost workday cases rate" of 4.00 in 1999.



<p>"When you look at the numbers the company reports to OSHA instead of the public-relations 'spin' pumped out of Oregon Steel's corporate offices, it's obvious that Rocky Mountain Steel has a problem with safety," said John Perquin, the USWA's assistant director of Health, Safety and Environment.



<p>"Pretending that the deaths, maimings and other serious accidents occurring in the Pueblo mill are typical of the industry won't solve that problem, and neither will platitudes about the company's commitment to safety," he said.



<p>"Right now, Rocky Mountain Steel is a dangerous place to work. If the company really wants to change that, the first step is to stop denying that a problem exists," he said.



Sources for the union analysis include figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the company's own reports on lost-time accidents to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
