- October 30 - The League of Conservation Voters today 

          launched a radio ad campaign speaking directly to the real differences 

          between presidential candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore on the environment.  

          The ads are running in the key battleground states of New Mexico, Florida, 

          Wisconsin, Oregon, Maine and Washington.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Tuesday, November 7 will determine our nation’s next leader and 

          set the course for environmental policy well into the future,&quot; 

          said LCV President Deb Callahan.  &quot;With so much at stake for the 

          environment, LCV is hitting the air waves to inform voters of the stark 

          differences between Al Gore and George Bush when it comes to protecting 

          our air, water and land.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ads focus on Gore’s lifelong commitment to fighting for stronger 

          environmental and public health protections.  They highlight his efforts 

          to strengthen both the Clean Air and Clean Water acts and to speed the 

          clean up of toxic waste sites across the country.  In contrast, the 

          ads criticize Bush for exempting hundreds of old, polluting power plants 

          from clean air laws in Texas and for appointing industry representatives 

          to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, Texas’ environmental 

          agency.  They also address Bush’s legacy of pollution in Texas.    </font></p>

<p style='punctuation-wrap:hanging;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the League, the ads 

          aim to reach Independent and undecided voters who rank clean air and 

          water among their top concerns.  A poll conducted for LCV in September 

          by Peter D. Hart Research found that 51 percent of Independent voters 

          to whom clean air and water are very important find little difference 

          between the environmental records of Bush and Gore, preferring Bush 

          34 percent to 30 percent.  After learning about the records of the two 

          candidates, these voters swing significantly away from George W. Bush 

          and towards Al Gore, choosing the vice president 36 percent to 25 percent.</font></p>

<p style='punctuation-wrap:hanging;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;On Election Day, only Al Gore 

          or George Bush will be elected president,&quot; Callahan said.  &quot;Voters 

          of all political beliefs and demographics have to decide if Bush’s toxic 

          record in Texas is something they want for the entire nation.  Only 

          Gore and Joe Lieberman can legitimately carry the environmental banner 

          all the way to the White House.&quot;</font></p>
