- June 29 - U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone praised President Clinton’s threat

to veto the so-called ‘Bankruptcy Reform Bill,’ issued today from the White

House.  In his letter to Congress, the President sent a clear message that the

bankruptcy legislation which has emerged from the shadow conference fails the

test of balance, and will result in undue hardship to middle income working

families who find themselves in desperate fiscal circumstances.  Wellstone

expressed optimism that the President’s threat would greatly strengthen the

bill’s opponents in Congress.



<p>“I am delighted that the President has issued a strong veto threat of this

terrible legislation today.  This is an enormous step forward in our efforts to

defeat this bill, and  I look forward to working with the President to defeat

it.  It has taken a long time to get people to focus on the brutal effects this

bill will carry in its wake, and it has been a long, hard fight.  To have the

President’s strong veto threat advances our cause immeasurably,” Wellstone said.



<p>In February, the bill was passed in the Senate by a large bipartisan margin of

83-14, after having passed late in 1999 in the House by a margin of 313-108.  In

March, Wellstone blocked the House and Senate from going to conference on the

bill by use of a procedural prerogative.  Since then he has refused to remove

his objection to the measure, and led the effort to educate  Congress and the

public about the harsh impact of the legislation on families and seniors. 



<p>“In the time since the Senate passed a flawed, harsh bankruptcy measure, the

real story about bankruptcy in America  -- as opposed to the skewed version

propounded by the big banks and credit card companies -- has slowly come to

light.  We now know that bankruptcy is nearly always a last resort undertaken

primarily by low and middle income families who file in reaction to a financial

catastrophe like a job loss or insurmountable medical bills.  We now know that

the vast majority of these families – over 96% – do not have sufficient income

to pay back any of their debts.  We now know that bankruptcy is a critical

safety net for these families that allows them to turn their lives around, have

a fresh start, Wellstone said.
