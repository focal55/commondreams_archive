White House Decision to Delay Dam Removal Could Drive Salmon to Extinction and Cost Taxpayers Billions </div>

- July 20 - The Administration's decision to delay removing four dams on the Lower Snake River is unacceptable because it could drive salmon to extinction and cost taxpayers billions, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent budget watchdog which supports removal of these dams.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday, Administration officials were scheduled to convey to Congress their salmon recovery plan for the Pacific Northwest. The hearing was delayed, but officials went public with their proposal to take measures other than dam removal to try to save the salmon. For example, they propose placing logs in the river to attempt to produce a more natural habitat. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Delay is the deadliest form of denial. The Administration's plan to study the fish to death for five or ten more years is unacceptable. Postponing the inevitable makes it more likely taxpayers will have to shoulder the massive bill for extinction," said Ralph DeGennaro, President of Taxpayers for Common Sense. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In the last five years, the Administration has already spent $20 million of taxpayers' money on endless studies. Saving a national treasure should be a no-brainer, especially when it also saves big bucks," said DeGennaro. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration's decision to delay dam removal continues its path of wasteful spending. Over $3 billion has already been spent by Northwest ratepayers and federal taxpayers on salmon recovery efforts, and the salmon will be extinct by 2017 if the status quo is continued. Taxpayers could be liable for billions to tens of billions of dollars in compensation payments to Columbia River Basin tribes if the fish go extinct. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The decision to delay breaching culminates the history of inaction by the Administration. The measures outlined in their proposed recovery plan are short-term solutions, and will not save salmon from extinction," said DeGennaro. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several stocks of Lower Snake River salmon and steelhead are already extinct or headed towards extinction. According to independent scientists, removing the four hydroelectric dams on the Lower Snake is the best way to save the fish. Even such removal is not a silver bullet that will fully solve the problem, but rather the cornerstone of a multi-faceted, long-term effort that will have the best chance of success. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is vast public support for removing the dams, illustrated in over 20 editorials and a national list of over 1,700 endorsers. The endorsement drive, led by Taxpayers for Common Sense and several conservation organizations illustrates support from hundreds of national and regional organizations, over 950 Alaska commercial fishermen, businesses, Native American Tribes, scientists, and others from all 50 states, Australia and Japan. The list also includes prominent individuals such as singer-songwriter Carole King, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and actor Adam West. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The complete list of almost 1,700 endorsers is available on the TCS web site at <a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/snake/index.htm">www.taxpayer.net/snake</a> in both HTML and PDF formats. Or call TCS at 202-546-8500 x112 to have the list faxed.
