- July 6 - The Federation of American



Scientists (FAS) today released a letter to the President signed by



50 American Nobel laureates in the sciences stating that under



current circumstances, "any movement toward deployment" of a



ballistic missile defense system would be "premature, wasteful, and



dangerous."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter was drafted by Dr. Hans Bethe. Bethe headed the group



that designed the world's first nuclear bombs and was a senior



advisor to a number of Presidents on nuclear weapons issues,



including the design of ballistic missile defense systems facing



countermeasures. He is one of the founders of FAS.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The essential point of the letter is that security benefits of



the proposed system are at best uncertain while the dangers



incurred by a hasty move toward deployment are large and real. It



could undermine hard-won arms control agreements with Russia and



frustrate efforts to place further limits on offensive missiles.



It could stimulate a Chinese missile buildup and encourage



dangerous "launch on warning" strategies. And, by appearing to



separate the defense of the US from the defense of Europe,



deployment could strain our most valuable security alliance.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter underscores the scientific community's skepticism



about the technical feasibility of defense systems designed to



attack weapons in outer space. A system with a high probability of



destroying a weapon in space protected by decoys and other



countermeasures faces enormous technical challenges. The test



record would not be adequate to justify a decision to deploy the



proposed system even if the test planned for July 7 achieves its



objectives.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A rush to deploy this system risks rekindling the Cold War arms



race," said Henry Kelly, president of FAS. "While preferable to



the massive national system proposed by many of the



administration's opponents, this system could dangerously



compromise US security interests. No emergency forces a hasty



decision," said Kelly, "We urge the President not to make any move



toward deployment before carefully considering technical and



diplomatic alternatives."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Federation of American Scientists was founded in 1945 by



scientists who built the first atomic bomb. FAS addresses public



policy issues created by advances in science and technology.
