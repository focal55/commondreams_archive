- April 21 - The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) has nominated Denis

Halliday and Kathy Kelly for a joint 2000 Nobel Peace Prize. The

commitment and courage of these nominees illustrate the far-reaching

impact of the actions of individuals in the cause of peace.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

In the nomination letter to the Nobel Committee Don Reeves, AFSC

General Secretary (Interim)<font color=#0000FF>,</font> stated:

&quot;Taken together, the work of Kathleen Kelly and Denis Halliday

represents a comprehensive approach to the problem of economic

sanctions against Iraq and the devastation wrought on the population

of that country, particularly the children.&quot;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

On the cusp of ten years of the most comprehensive sanctions in

modern time, the humanitarian crisis in Iraq, sadly neglected

for many years has already taken the lives of more than one million

Iraqis. During those ten years the AFSC has expressed repeatedly

its deep concerns over the increase in infant and child mortality,

decline in health and education standards, and overall rise in

death rates from preventable and treatable illnesses-all resulting

from the effects of the economic sanctions on the people of Iraq.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Kathy Kelly is a cofounder of Voices in the Wilderness, the first

U.S. grassroots organization to bring activists into Iraq to witness

the effect of sanctions, to bring food and medicine to the people

of Iraq, and to educate the public upon their return.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Denis Halliday, an Irish Quaker, is a former UN Assistant Secretary-General

and Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq, who resigned his position

in 1998 after some 34 years of UN service to protest the humanitarian

impact of the economic sanctions on the civilian population of

Iraq. He continues to call for reform within the UN Security Council,

and questions the legality of imposing economic sanctions over

long periods of time. He has spoken widely since his resignation,

and has been a powerful advocate for lifting the economic sanctions

against Iraq.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The unique combination of grassroots activism in the work of Kathy

Kelly, and the authority of the former UN Humanitarian Coordinator

in Iraq, Denis Halliday, has helped to push the crisis in Iraq

to the forefront of concerns in the world . We are now engaged

in a new dialogue, with growing international support for the

concept of de-linking economic and military sanctions.

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We nominate them as an expression of the importance of the

individuals who transform a personal commitment to peace into

visible and effective action,&quot; stated Reeves in the nomination

letter. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The resignations in February 2000 of Hans von Sponeck, the United

Nations Humanitarian Coordinator who replaced Denis Halliday,

and Jutta Burghardt, head of the World Food Program in Iraq served

to further highlight the humanitarian crisis.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

AFSC is proud to nominate these two extremely capable and dedicated

people, and feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to be challenged

by their commitments. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The American Friends Service Committee and Quaker Peace and Service

in England were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1947 on behalf

of the work of Friends (Quakers) worldwide.</font>
