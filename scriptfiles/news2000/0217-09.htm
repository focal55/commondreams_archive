- February 17 - U.S. Rep. Tony P. Hall,



D-Ohio, today questioned the comments of the U.S. Department of



State's spokesman on the resignation of top U.N. officials in Iraq



over the humanitarian situation there. Text of his letter to



Secretary of State Madeleine Albright follows:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Madame Secretary:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I read with concern the comments of your spokesman in response



to the resignations of two leaders of humanitarian work in Iraq.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have visited scores of nations where people suffer from



hunger, malnutrition, disease, and other problems that often are



rooted in poor decisions by their political leaders. I have met



thousands of courageous people, like Hans von Sponeck and Jutta



Purghart, working against almost impossible odds to help those in



need overcome the challenges they face. And during my time in



Congress I have worked extensively with United Nations



organizations and generally found them to be conscientious and



careful in their evaluation of situations such as those the people



of Iraq now endure.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It appears to me that nothing Mr. Von Sponeck or Ms. Purghart



has noted differs from the reports of UNICEF, the International Red



Cross, and other respected organizations that have examined what is



happening in Iraq today. Your spokesman's vilification of these



individuals is unfair and appears to be an effort to stifle the



expression of legitimate concerns about our country's policies



toward Iraq. If they accurately reflect your position, Madame



Secretary, I hope you will reconsider it.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States generally manages to work its will through the



United Nations without resorting to the sort of vitriol against



U.N. employees that Mr. Rubin directed against these respected



humanitarians. Even in Congress, reasonable men and women are able



to disagree; I urge you to protect the United Nations' reputation



as a forum for discussion and consensus-building that is at least



as free of personal attacks.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you for your attention to my concerns, Madame Secretary,



and for your continued leadership.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,

</font>
