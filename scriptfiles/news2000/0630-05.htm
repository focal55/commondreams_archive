U.S. Thwarted in Effort to Weaken War Crimes Court</div>

- June 30 - The latest effort to win exemption for U.S.

nationals from the international criminal court has not succeeded, Human

Rights Watch said today.



<p>In three weeks of negotiations concluding today at the United Nations,

the U.S. delegation tried to restrict the power of the court to request

the surrender of suspects. In a June 23 debate on the U.S. proposal, 39

delegations opposed it, out of 45 who took the floor. Only Israel and

Turkey fully supported the U.S. text.



<p>The delegates did agree to include a new provision aimed at keeping

Washington engaged in talks on the court. Human Rights Watch warned that

this new provision may encourage Washington to press even more intensely

for special exemptions at the next round of talks on the war crimes

court, set for November 2000.



<p>"Completing this round of talks is a big step toward making the court a

reality," said Richard Dicker, counsel to Human Rights Watch and the

director of its campaign for the international criminal court. "I'm

happy to say that the U.S. effort to undermine the court has failed, at

least for now. But governments will have to prepare for another assault

in November."



<p>The U.S. efforts were focused on Article 98(2) of the treaty, which

already (due to U.S. insistence in Rome) will prevent the court from

prosecuting troops stationed abroad when they are accused of serious

human rights crimes.  The U.S. sought to enlarge that exception, to

allow all kinds of agreements - between the court and individual states,

between the court and military alliances like NATO, between the court

and regional organizations, and most importantly, between the court and

the United Nations - to confer special exemptions.



<p>"The U.S. proposal would have made the court vulnerable to pressure from

all sides, which would undoubtedly weaken its authority," said Dicker.

"It's important that Washington's demands for special treatment must not

undermine the impartiality and effectiveness of this court."



<p>Dicker said that Washington's lobbying was unnecessary because the

treaty already provided numerous safeguards against

politically-motivated prosecutions.



<p>The talks this month achieved a major milestone: completing both the

court's "rules of procedure and evidence" and the "elements of crimes."

Completing these subsidiary agreements is expected to accelerate

ratification of the treaty establishing the court. Thirteen states have

ratified so far; Germany and Canada are expected ratify soon. The court

will be established once 60 states have ratified.



<p>The treaty for the international criminal court was finalized in Rome in

July 1998. Only seven countries, including the United States, Iraq, and

China, voted against the treaty at that time, while 120 countries voted

in favor.  The international criminal court will prosecute genocide,

crimes against humanity, and war crimes. It is considered one of the

most important advances in human rights protection in decades.



<p>In the negotiations on "elements of crimes," Egypt and China also

mounted full-scale efforts to roll back parts of the treaty. They

insisted that a state must have "actively encouraged" a crime in order

for the court to prosecute a suspect. For crimes where the state turns a

blind eye to abuse rather than encouraging it actively, the court will

now have less room to maneuver. But a footnote to the new provision

would allow the court to intervene in "exceptional circumstances."
