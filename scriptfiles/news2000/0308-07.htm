- March 8 - </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LEONARD WILLIAMS, <a href="mailto:lawilliams@manchester.edu">lawilliams@manchester.edu</a><br>

Professor of political science at Manchester College and co-author of the

recent Campaigns and Elections article "'Moderates Win' and Other Political

Myths," Williams said today: "In part the election fits the standard

scenario of the more established candidates winning after a bit of trouble.

But up to this point in the campaign there's been more of a progressive

ideological center of gravity than in years. There's an emphasis on

promoting education, protecting Social Security, having a Patients Bill of

Rights and campaign finance reform. If you'd said all these things 10 years

ago, you'd be laughed off the face of the earth. The Democratic Party had

been running from organized labor and abortion rights, but not now. On the

Republican side, you see attacks on conservative icons like Pat Robertson

and Jerry Falwell. You have McCain criticizing Bush for presenting a tax

plan that favors the rich. And you see Bush attacking McCain on being weak

on the environment and not funding breast cancer research." On the other

hand, Williams noted that last night Gore praised initiatives like "welfare

reform," which he had been avoiding.

Woolhandler is director of the Center for National Health Program Studies

at Harvard. She said today: "When Bill Bradley first announced his [health]

plan he got a bounce -- almost everyone liked the idea of universal health

coverage. But the more people looked at the plan, the more it became clear

that he really wasn't offering anything, even if the rhetoric sounded good.

Virtually the only people who had anything nice to say about it don't know

about health policy. While Gore and Bradley have poor health plans, the

Republicans really haven't addressed the issue, which is just their way of

saying that Wall Street should run the health care system. People's real

problems with health care are not being addressed."

<br>

Professor in the Department of Government at Cornell University, Lowi wrote

"The End of Liberalism" in 1969. In 1995, he published "The End of the

Republican Era." Today he said: "Such is the construction of the national

Republican coalition that it cannot last. The New Deal coalition was

predicated on government growth and that's why it lasted so long, expanding

and burning out during the Republican Nixon administration. Similarly, the

conservatism that has since risen achieved its greatest power during the

'80s, culminating in the nominally Democratic Clinton administration. The

three factions of the Republican Party cannot be held together -- the

liberal/libertarian country club faction; the traditional, secular

conservative small town faction; and the Southern, sacred conservative

faction. The fault lines are getting deeper..."</font></p>
