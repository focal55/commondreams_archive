- March 3 - The nonprofit Clean Air



Trust today awarded its clean air "Villain of the Month" award for



March to a secretive and deceptive group that calls itself



"Republicans for Clean Air."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Trust also challenged the group to reveal its sources of



funding, and to debate the Sierra Club on the clean-air credentials



of the various candidates for President.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's time to clear the air -- time for `Republicans for Clean



Air' to come out of the shadows and debate the facts," said Frank



O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The challenge was issued after "Republicans for Clean Air" began



a multi-million dollar television advertising campaign attacking



the environmental record of presidential candidate John McCain,



while praising the clean-air record of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.



The ads have begun running in at least three states: New York,



California and Ohio, which all have "Super Tuesday" primary



elections March 7.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Washington Post linked "Republicans for Clean Air" to a



Republican consultant who serves as treasurer for a political



action committee "heavily promoted by the GOP congressional



leadership and financed by Republican-leaning business owners,



particularly in Texas."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The commercial's accuracy -- and Gov. Bush's environmental



record -- has been assailed by both the Sierra Club and by the



League of Conservation Voter (LCV). See Sierra Club critique below.



The LCV release can be found at www.lcv.org.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, O'Donnell noted that representatives of Gov. Bush



have been lobbying Congress to weaken the Clean Air Act to permit



more highway construction without regard to the consequences for



air pollution. (For details, see the most recent "bulletin" on the



Clean Air Trust Web site, www.cleanairtrust.org).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LCV has noted that Sen. McCain's environmental record has been



less than stellar. He has earned a 20 percent lifetime



environmental voting record. However, O'Donnell did note that in



two critical Senate floor votes on the 1990 Clean Air Act



Amendments, McCain voted -- along with then-Senators Al Gore and



Bill Bradley -- for the pro-clean air position.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here is a Sierra Club critique of the commercial:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ad is littered with half-truths:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HALF-TRUTH: " 1/8Bush 3/8 led one of the first states to clamp down

on



old coal-burning electric plants."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TRUTH: That half-truth is referring to "grandfathered" plants



built before 1972, which are not subject to the Texas' clean air



laws. Bush "clamped down" on those grandfathered plants with a



voluntary plan that was written by industry. According to Time, the



result of Bush's voluntary policy is "only 33 of the 160 biggest



industrial plants have volunteered. Of those 33, only three have



taken steps to cut their emissions. Questioned about this during



his interview with Time, Bush became irritated." (2-21-00)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Dallas Morning News concluded that "(Bush's) voluntary



anti-pollution initiatives have produced only marginal



improvements." (11-14-99) Furthermore, the bill that deals with



these plants, Senate Bill 7, only affects 2 of Texas' 18



grandfathered plants.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HALF-TRUTH: "New York Republicans care about clear air. So does



Governor Bush."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TRUTH: One of New York's biggest environmental victories this



year has been the state's lawsuit against Midwestern coal-burning



plants, which was eventually joined by the EPA. However, lawsuits



which protect New Yorkers are likely to be opposed by a Bush



Administration. In a November interview, he told The New York



Times, "the best way to achieve clean air and water was `to not try



to sue our way or regulate our way to clean air and clean water.'"



(11-9-99)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The truth is that there is no way to spin the Bush record on



air pollution in Texas," said Holmes. "Texas is No 1 in toxic



releases, No. 1 in total toxic air emissions from industrial



facilities, No. 1 in toxic chemical accidents, No. 1 in



cancer-causing pollution. And in 1999, Houston became the Smog



Capital of the United States, grabbing the No. 1 spot from Los



Angeles."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each month the Trust identifies a company, association, or



individual that it believes should be singled out for opprobrium



for its anti-clean air activities.
