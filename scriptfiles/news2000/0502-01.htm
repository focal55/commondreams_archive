- May 2 - Proposed federal regulations could prevent the public

     from learning about dangerous chemicals potentially being spilled or

     released in their own communities.  Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ),

     however, is working to support the public's right-to-know about

     chemical accidents, earning the Sierra Club's praise and thanks.  The

     environmental organization is joining Lautenberg in calling on

     Congressional leaders for hearings and the release of chemical

     disaster information.

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The old adage `what you don't know can't hurt you' falls flat when it

     comes to chemical disasters," said Debbie Sease.  "What you don't know

     can kill you.  But if communities are well informed, they can ask

     local chemical facilities to clean up their acts and reduce their risk

     of a chemical disaster.  To save lives, prevent pollution and protect

     property, Sierra Club insists that leaders in Congress defend the

     public's right to know about the potential chemical disasters

     threatening their neighborhoods."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     In the 1990 Clean Air Act, Congress gave citizens the power to learn

     about potential chemical accidents in an effort to improve public

     safety and to encourage companies to reduce their hazards.  The law

     requires facilities that handle extremely hazardous substances to

     report what could happen under scenarios for different chemical

     accidents.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     The chemical industry and its Congressional supporters worked to

     rescind the public's right to know, arguing that terrorists attacks

     might be prevented by keeping the information secret.

     Anti-environmental members of Congress claimed that criminals might

     target their attacks by using the Internet to learn about chemical

     accident information.  Now, the Administration has proposed

     regulations to narrow people's access to the information.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The real problem isn't Internet access," said Sease.  "The real

     problem isn't releasing the information, either, since terrorists

     don't need this information to find chemical plants.  The real problem

     is that dangerous facilities threaten families with toxic disasters.

     If these facilities are a terrorist threat, the answer isn't to keep

     the public in the dark -- the answer is to reduce the amount of

     hazardous chemicals and improve site security."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Fortunately, some in Congress -- led by Senator Lautenberg -- are

     fighting to protect the public's right to know.  "Sierra Club applauds

     Senator Frank Lautenberg's efforts to improve the public's health and

     safety protections. We join Senator Lautenberg in calling for hearings

     on site security and hazards," Sease said.  "We're very anxious to see

     whether Congressional leaders will hear his message: that the public's

     right to know is best protected by improving facility security and

     reducing the risks of chemical accidents."

     Facts about chemical accidents: Nearly 60,000 chemical accidents occur

     each year; more than 400 per year cause immediate death, injury,

     and/or evacuation.  Toxic chemical accidents kill more than 250 people

     annually and release over 135 million pounds of toxic chemicals into

     the environment.</font>
