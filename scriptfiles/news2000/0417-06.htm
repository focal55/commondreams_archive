- April 17 - Despite Governor George W. Bush's green claims, Texas' air

     is worse than ever before.  On Friday, April 14, Houston suffered its

     first one-hour ozone exceedance of 2000.  And with inaction from the

     Bush administration and a long, hot summer ahead, the mess in Texas

     may get a whole lot worse.



     <P>Houston broke the national ozone health standard of 125 parts per

     billion with a reading of 142 ppb on Friday.  This is the earliest

     Houston has ever had such a high rating.  Last year, Houston passed

     Los Angeles as the nation's smog capital, with the Texas city racking

     up 52 days of violations.



     <P>"Texas' air has never been this dirty, this early.  Governor Bush's

     failure to curb air pollution forces Texas families to breathe dirty,

     unhealthy air that burns their lungs," said Dr. Neil Carman, air

     scientist, Lone Star Sierra Club.  "Our children should be able to

     play outside, but dirty air can worsen their asthma.  Instead of

     leadership, all the Bush administration does is further pollute the

     air with false claims."



     <P>Today, Bush's Lieutenant Governor Rick Perry and environmental

     appointees held a press conference to tout so-called cleaner air in

     Texas.  This is similar to a report issued last year by the right-wing

     Foundation for Clean Air Progress, who cited reduced emissions of

     pollutants from 1970 to 1996.  That report drew the following response

     from Gregg A. Cooke, Regional administrator, U.S. Environmental

     Protection Agency, Dallas:



     <P>"Certainly, there has been progress toward better air quality since

     1970. Cleaner burning cars were identified as one factor... However, a

     more direct and meaningful way to assess air quality improvement is to

     measure the quality of the air we breathe. By looking at data from air

     monitors, we can see that some air quality problems are persistent in

     Texas. The trends are not encouraging...Ozone is a particularly vexing

     air quality problem in Texas. Knowing the health impact that ozone has

     on people with asthma and other respiratory problems, we cannot give

     up," Cooke wrote in March, 1999.



     <P>Cooke's words, written before Houston became the nation's smog

     capital, proved to be prescient.  Problems have only gotten worse for

     the over 400,000 kids in Texas who suffer from asthma.  Additionally,

     Texas ranks first in a number of troubling environmental categories:



     <P>Toxic releases to the environment;<br>

     Total toxic air emissions from industrial facilities;<br>

     Toxic chemical accidents;<br>

     Cancer-causing pollution; and<br>

     Number of factories violating clean water standards.
