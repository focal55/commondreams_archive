- June 14 - Patients with serious mental illnesses, as well as their friends

and families, now have a new, comprehensive source of information just a mouse-click away

about the drugs used to treat those illnesses.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The<a href="http://www.citizen.org/eletter/"> &quot;eLetter on Drugs for Severe Psychiatric

Illnesses,&quot;</a>&nbsp; is a new Web site designed to inform mental health patients

about the risks and benefits of the drugs used to treat people with serious mental

illnesses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The site offers the latest, most up-to-date news about these drugs. For instance, it

features an article about clozapine (Clozaril), a drug available in the U.S. since 1989

that is used to treat schizophrenia and that Australian doctors recently linked to heart

inflammation and other heart disease. These adverse reactions are not listed in the drug's

package insert and did not make news in the U.S. The site details the symptoms associated

with heart inflammation and the findings of the Australian doctors. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another feature, just posted on the site, concerns the increased risk of pregnancy for

women switching from older antipsychotic drugs to clozapine (Clozaril), olanzapine

(Zyprexa) or quetiapine (Seroquel). Whereas the older drugs suppressed fertility and made

it unlikely that women could become pregnant, that is not the case for these three newer

drugs. Yet the FDA-approved labeling for the drugs fails to mention the need for women of

child-bearing age to start using contraceptives if they do not wish to become pregnant. It

is therefore likely that tens of thousands or more women and their families and friends

are unaware of their increased risk of pregnancy when they switched to these drugs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Usually, information about these kinds of drugs is filtered through the drug

industry before it gets to consumers,&quot; said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of <a href="http://www.citizen.org/hrg/">Public Citizen's Health Research Group</a>. &quot;We aim to provide an

objective source of information about the risks and benefits of these drugs.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The site is a joint project of Public Citizen's Health Research Group and the <a href="http://www.psychlaws.org/">Treatment Advocacy Center</a>, a nonprofit organization

dedicated to eliminating the legal and practical barriers to the treatment of seriously

mentally ill Americans who are not receiving appropriate medical care. Unlike many

organizations that create informational Web sites about drugs and health, neither Public

Citizen nor the Treatment Advocacy Center accepts money from the pharmaceutical industry. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The total number of individuals in the U.S. with severe depression is generally thought

to be about five million, with an additional 3.5 million people who have either

schizophrenia or manic-depressive (bipolar) illness. Thus, the total number of people who

may use and possibly benefit from drugs for severe psychiatric illnesses is eight to nine

million at any given time. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It has become increasingly difficult for patients, their families and psychiatric

practitioners to get accurate information on these medications,&quot; said E. Fuller

Torrey, president of the board of the Treatment Advocacy Center.&nbsp;&quot;Many important

adverse effects are not being reported.&nbsp;This Web site will provide such information

without drug company influence.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The eLetter covers antipsychotic, antidepressant and mood stabilizer medications used

to treat schizophrenia, manic-depressive illness, severe depression and other disorders.

Although basic information on serious mental illness is included, the principal focus is

to provide new information about the risks of older drugs and to inform readers about new

drugs as they come onto the market. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The eLetter also contains:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Detailed information about depression, including its definition,

symptoms, the risks of antidepressant drugs and a list of drugs that can cause depression;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * An index of more than 50 drugs used to treat mental disorders,

with information about what conditions they are designed to treat, their adverse effects,

how to use the drugs and a list of other drugs that may create dangerous interactions;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Information about how to report adverse drug reactions;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Ten rules for safer drug use -- for example, when seeing a new

doctor, bring a bag filled with all the prescription drugs you are taking, and start with

a lower dose of a new drug, particularly if you are elderly;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * An A-to-Z glossary of terms, ranging from bipolar disorder and

mania to me-too drugs (those that offer no significant benefit over drugs already on the

market). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the site's main page features the latest information about safety warnings

and newly discovered interactions and adverse reactions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen's Health Research Group is the health arm of Public Citizen that

promotes research-based, system-wide changes in health care policy and provides advice and

oversight concerning drugs, medical devices, doctors, hospitals and occupational health.

The Health Research Group petitions and testifies before Congress and federal agencies on

such issues as the banning or relabeling of drugs, improved safety standards at work sites

and safer medical devices.</font>
