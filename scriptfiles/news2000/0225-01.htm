- February 25 - Early this morning, 

Greenpeace successfully intercepted the bulk carrier Iolcos 

Grace  carrying up to 60,000 tons of genetically modified 

soya into Britain. The vessel was boarded by Greenpeace 

volunteers off the coast of Anglesey in North Wales. The 

soy is being shipped by Cargill, one of the world's largest 

graintraders and purchasers of genetically modified (GMO) 

soybeans. Cargill's Liverpool mill is the only GMO soya mill 

in the UK.

<p>

&quot;Europe has rejected GMO food, but the biotech industry is 

still trying to dump its unwanted cargo any way it can,&quot; said 

Charles Margulis, Greenpeace U.S genetic engineering 

specialist. &quot;American farmers should know that GMO 

animal feed is considered ‘tainted goods’ on the world 

market.&quot;

<p>

Earlier this week, the UK supermarket chain &quot;Iceland&quot; 

announced that it would be selling only GMO-free animal 

products starting September 1. Recently, the UK’s largest 

supermarket chain, Tesco, stated that it would phase out its 

use of GMO animal feed. A December 10, 1999, letter from 

Tesco to Cargill and other grain dealers states, &quot;It is clear to 

us that our customers are concerned about the use of GM 

crops for animal feed and they would like us to take steps to 

remove them.… Our target is the eventual elimination of GM 

ingredients from animal feed.&quot; The letter also notes that 

Tesco expects to secure a source of non-GMO soy  &quot;as the 

next Brazilian soya crop becomes available in Spring 2000.&quot;

<p>

Several of the UK's other top chains also have stated that 

they are moving to non-GMO animal feed. Europe's largest 

poultry producer, Bourgouin, teamed with the largest animal 

feed supplier, Glon-Sanders, last year to launch a line of 

non-GMO fed poultry.

<p>

&quot;This ship is carrying a cargo that nobody wants,&quot; said Jim 

Thomas, GE campaigner with Greenpeace, &quot;and most 

people would like to see it sent home. There is no demand 

for GMO crops and we resent this contamination of the food 

chain. On the other hand, we would welcome non-GMO soy 

from American farms.&quot;



<p>

<i>Notes to Editors:

</i>

<p>

Greenpeace volunteers at the action can be contacted via the 

press office. The Iolcos Grace departed New Orleans, La., earlier 

this month and was heading for the Cargill GMO soya mill in 

Liverpool docks.

<p>

On February 11, 2000, a shipment of 30,000 tons of corn being 

shipped to Brazil was turned away as a result of a warning from 

Greenpeace that some of the grain onboard might include GMOs. 

The Brazilian authorities then announced that it would demand 

certification of all U.S. corn to stop illegal imports of GMO corn.
