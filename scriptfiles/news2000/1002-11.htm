- October 2 - Following the announcement today that IBP, the nation’s

largest beef packer and second largest pork packer, has agreed to a $2.4 billion

buy-out by the investment fund Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ), one of whose

principal investors is the agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM),

U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN) expressed deep concern for family farmers and

 promised to press federal anti-trust officials to scrutinize the deal closely. 

Early indications suggest that ADM may double its ownership in IBP to 25% if the

deal goes through.  ADM presently owns approximately 12% of IBP stock. 



<p>“They may be cheering this deal on Wall Street today, but hard-pressed family

farmers are not cheering one bit.  How much more concentration has to occur in

agriculture before we demand a moratorium?  An ADM - IBP merger would signal an

unprecedented case of vertical integration, and I will call for close anti-trust

scrutiny,” Wellstone said. 



<p>Wellstone pointed to the surge of concentration in agriculture, and said that

agribusiness conglomerates have increased their bargaining power over family

farmers dramatically. When farmers have fewer buyers to choose from,

agribusinesses can more easily dictate conditions and prices that farmers have

to meet. 



<p>“Consider what this deal would mean for family-owned, independent pork

producers:  ADM is one of the biggest feed producers in the world – they make

the inputs.  IBP is one of the largest packers - they take the outputs.  So

family farmers will be squeezed in the middle – essentially the same company

selling them inputs will be buying their production.  It all comes down to

market power. Corporate agribusinesses are using their market power to lower

prices, without passing those price savings on to consumers,” Wellstone said.



<p>Vertical concentration destroys competitive markets.  Potential competitors

often never know the sale price for goods at any point in the process; there

never is a sale price until the consumer makes the final purchase, since nothing

is being sold outside the integrated firm. Wellstone said that it's hard to have

effective competition if prices are not publicly available. 



<p>Wellstone has pushed for stronger federal anti-trust action to level the playing

field for America's family farmers, introducing the Agribusiness Merger

Moratorium Act last year. The Wellstone legislation sought to impose a

moratorium on mergers and acquisitions among agribusinesses with annual net

revenue or assets of more than $100 million for one party, and $10 million for

the other. The moratorium would have remained in effect for 18 months, or until

Congress enacted legislation to address the problem of concentration in

agriculture.
