<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- February 15 - Leading consumer organisations from

both sides of the Atlantic have called for government agencies to halt

the Time Warner-AOL merger until grave concerns about consumer privacy

are addressed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That warning came at a meeting of the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue

(TACD), held 10-12 February in Washington, DC. The dialogue brought

together more than 60 consumer leaders from 16 countries and government

officials from both the European Union and the United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumer advocates fear that the merger gives the company more

far-reaching&nbsp; and frighteningly more sophisticated&nbsp; ability to

collect information about consumer shopping and browsing habits that will

be used in new ways to sell them products.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The new world of the Internet has great potential for benefits for both

consumers and businesses, but governments must think very carefully

before allowing mega mergers that pose very real threats to consumer

privacy,” said Ed Mierzwinski of US Public Interest Research Group

(USPIRG), and a member of the TACD steering committee.&nbsp; “If this

cross-industry merger doesn’t terrify people concerned about privacy, it

should.”</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That was one of numerous recommendations&nbsp; covering electronic

commerce, food safety and standards and trade - to emerge from the

meeting, the third one to be held since the TACD was formed in September

1998. The TACD was created to have input into the EU and US trade

dialogue and counterbalance the Transatlantic Business Dialogue.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumer organisations were pleased the dialogue resulted in

a better understanding with governments and applauded government progress

in areas such as access to essential medicines in developing countries,

eco-labelling, fair trade labelling, and regulatory cooperation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“We had very productive and meaningful discussions,” said Rhoda

Karpatkin, member of the TACD steering committee and president of the US

Consumers’ Union. “Although we still have a long way to go to reach

agreement in many areas, there appears now to be a clear willingness on

the part of government to listen to consumer concerns.”</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nonetheless, the TACD reiterated its strong opposition to US-backed

so-called “Safe Harbour” Provision that would let US firms evade strong

privacy laws granting European citizens control over the use of their

personal information by businesses. In December, TACD member groups

issued a statement to the governments detailing the numerous ways that

the safe harbour’s provisions allowing firms to self-certify their

privacy practices fail to meet European standards protecting consumers.

US officials recently announced their intent to complete approval of the

Safe Harbour by the end of March. Negotiations have been continuing for

nearly two years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“We want an agreement that will respect the privacy rights of European

consumers when their personal data is transferred to the US,” said Jim

Murray, the TACD EU chair and director of BEUC, the European consumers

union. “Not a pirate’s cove disguised as a safe harbour.”</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The TACD also recommended that:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">¦ The EU and US governments must improve regulation of food labelling to

ensure misleading claims stopped in one region of the world cannot be

made by the same company, or a subsidiary, in another region of the

world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">¦ Both governments should require that all genetically modified foods be

carefully assessed before their commercial introduction and release into

the environment and monitored and assessed after their release. Long-term

monitoring of the use of GM foods should be a legal requirement. All

genetically modified food also <i>must</i> be

labelled.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">¦ The EU and US governments must adopt the precautionary principle - the

commonsense view that it is better to be safe than sorry - in the area of

food and trade. The TACD applauded the adoption of such a principle at

the Montreal Biosafety Protocol in the area of genetically modified

foods, but says it must be incorporated more broadly in the international

standards setting process.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The TACD noted that if the precautionary principle had been

systematically applied, it might have prevented some of the recent and

deadly food safety crises in Europe.
