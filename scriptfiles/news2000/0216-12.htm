          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - February 

            16 - In campaigning for the Republican primary in South Carolina, 

            George W. Bush has recognized the public&#146;s intense desire for 

            reform of the system of legalized bribery through which politicians 

            extract large sums of money from wealthy individuals, corporations 

            and unions.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, 

            Bush&#146;s proposals would do little or nothing to break the iron 

            grip that big money donors have on our political system. His plan 

            would even make matters worse by tripling the amount of cash that 

            individuals can give to candidates for federal office.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our campaign system 

            is rife with corruption, and Bush&#146;s plan does nothing to stop 

            it. His ban of soft money giving by corporations and unions to national 

            political parties would simply mean that these huge unlimited, unregulated 

            donations would be redirected to state parties. And it means that 

            corporations could continue giving the same money to national parties 

            by laundering it through their top executives. Bush also would do 

            nothing to stop sham &quot;issue&quot; ads, through which political 

            parties and interest groups circumvent campaign laws.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It&#146;s time 

            for real reform, not another cynical effort to mislead the public.</font></p>

          <blockquote> 

            <ul>

              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The soft 

                money ban on corporations and unions exempts wealthy individuals 

                (who gave $70 million out of $262 million to national parties 

                in 1996). It provides an incentive, particularly to corporations, 

                to launder their contributions through well-paid executives.</font></li>

            </ul>

            <ul>

              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is 

                no effective soft money ban, because state parties are not covered. 

                Thus, current corporate and union donors can be encouraged by 

                national parties to give soft money to state parties, and the 

                state parties can spend it on sham &quot;issue&quot; ads and other 

                activities to influence federal elections. Such &quot;directed 

                donor&quot; programs were already widespread in the 1996 election. 

                Moreover, unlike federal soft money, state soft money is not publicly 

                disclosed. </font></li>

            </ul>

            <ul>

              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A &quot;paycheck 

                protection&quot; provision would require union members to give 

                advance approval for unions to spend dues on &quot;political activities.&quot; 

                This is unnecessary and is guaranteed to be a &quot;poison pill&quot; 

                to Democrats, whose support is necessary for bipartisan reform. 

                First, an effective ban on soft money and the regulation of phony 

                issue ads -- as contained in the legislation Sens. McCain and 

                Feingold and Reps. Shays and Meehan have sponsored -- would prevent 

                unions from using dues for these purposes. Second, in the 21 right-to-work 

                states, workers are as free to join or not to join unions as they 

                are to join such groups as the Christian Coalition, National Rifle 

                Association or Americans for Tax Reform. None of these group members 

                -- or corporate shareholders, for that matter -- need big brother 

                to protect their dues or investments. Third, in the 29 states 

                where workers are required to pay dues to unions representing 

                them, workers who do not wish to pay political portions are free 

                to object in writing and have their dues proportionally reduced. 

                This right, declared by the Supreme Court in the 1988 Beck case, 

                is further codified in the McCain-Feingold/Shays-Meehan legislation.</font></li>

              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush opposes 

                reformers' efforts to put sham TV and radio issue ads mentioning 

                candidates within 60 days of an election under the same regulatory 

                scheme as other campaign ads: public disclosure of contributors 

                and limits on contributions (none from corporations and unions 

                and no more than $5,000 from contributors to PACs that run these 

                ads). His claim that such restrictions are unconstitutional is 

                not supported by many legal scholars.</font></li>

              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush indicates 

                he wants to raise the limit on individual contributions to candidates 

                from $1,000 to $3,400 per election, to account for inflation since 

                1974. This would drastically increase the role of wealthy individuals 

                in funding and thus influencing Congress and the administration.</font></li>

                of contributions are positive, though marginal reforms.</font></li>
