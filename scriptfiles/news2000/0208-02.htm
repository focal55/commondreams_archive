<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 8 -  The Sierra Club today welcomed President Clinton's FY

     2001 budget proposal as "the most aggressive environmental budget in

     years," but warned that it faces a rocky future as the

     anti-environmental leadership in Congress tries to sink the plan.

     Overall, the budget supports Americans' desires to protect our

     remaining open spaces, safeguard our National Forests and combat

     suburban sprawl.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"President Clinton today laid out the most aggressive environmental

     budget I've ever seen," said Sierra Club Legislative Director Debbie

     Sease.  "As Americans see wild lands and open spaces disappearing, we

     want to protect the special places we have left -- from our grand

     national landscapes to the neighborhood jewels closer to home.  The

     President's budget will enable Americans to protect those beautiful

     lands we all treasure.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"However, we warn the public that passing the environmental proposals

     in this budget is no sure thing," Sease continued.

     "Anti-environmental leaders in Congress have their switchblades and

     stones ready, eager cut important funding and sink these proposals

     with harmful riders.  We urge Americans to hold their legislators

     accountable for any efforts to weaken the bold environmental

     initiatives in this budget."



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club praised Clinton's Lands Legacy initiative to invest

     $1.4 billion to acquire lands threatened by development, oil and gas

     drilling, mining and logging.  In addition, the Sierra Club was

     largely pleased with the budget proposal's initiatives to protect

     America's National Forests.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the third straight year, the U.S. Forest Service proposes

     "decoupling" logging receipts from annual payments to counties for

     schools and roads, and replacing that money with a stable stream of

     money unrelated to logging levels.  Tying local school budgets to

     logging in National Forests creates an incentive for counties to

     encourage unsustainably high logging levels, and making children's

     educations depend on destroying forests.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"By ending the link between logging and school funding, the Clinton

     administration will strengthen our rural schools and conserve our

     National Forests," Sease said.  "Rural schools deserve a steady

     funding stream that they can count on without having to sacrifice our

     National Forests.  The Clinton administration aims to end the perverse

     policy that hurts America's children."



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, the budget also includes $190 million in subsidies for

     the commercial logging program, paying private companies to destroy

     America's public forests.  The Sierra Club believes the money instead

     should be used for recreation opportunities and fish and wildlife

     protection programs, which benefit Americans and America's forests,

     rather than fattening profits for a handful of corporations.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The budget proposes a record amount of money to combat suburban

     sprawl.  The initiatives focus on increasing transportation options

     and helping local communities protect green space.  The Livable

     Communities budget includes over $200 million for transit systems and

     more funding for Better America Bonds to help state and local

     governments to combat sprawl.  The proposal helps state and local

     governments to purchase open space, protect water quality, improve

     access to parks, and redevelop abandoned city centers.  Despite these

     sprawl-busting efforts, however, the budget also includes funding for

     sprawl-inducing projects, such as building a monstrous replacement for

     the Woodrow Wilson Bridge between Maryland and Virginia.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We wholeheartedly support the President's plans to fight suburban

     sprawl and make our communities healthier places to live by improving

     public transportation, cleaning up our cities and protecting green

     space," Sease said.  "However, we need to cut the pork-barrel spending

     that encourages sprawl at the same time we're working to curb it.  For

     example, the President's proposal includes $600 million to build an

     excessively large replacement for the Wilson Bridge between Maryland

     and Virginia, which will only exacerbate sprawl in Washington, DC."



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The President's plan also calls for increasing funding for

     international family planning to its FY1995 level, a crucial step in

     stabilizing the population pressures on the global environment.  In

     addition, the Sierra Club hopes the President will follow through on

     his pledge to remove the global gag rule restrictions that Congress

     imposed last year on international family planning aid.



     </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The budget plan also aims to tackle global warming, proposing the

     funding necessary to begin that fight.  Included in the budget is a

     significant increase in promoting efficient and renewable energy.  For

     example, the President calls for increasing the budget for clean solar

     and wind energy by more than 25 percent over last year's proposal.  By

     reducing our nation's reliance on burning fuels that produce

     greenhouse gasses, and instead switching to renewable energy sources

     as proposed by the President, we can cut the emissions that cause

     global warming.
