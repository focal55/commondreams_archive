- April 13 - Activists from Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean in 

Washington to participate in the (April 8 - 17) Mobilization for Global 

Justice activities will speak to the media about the impact of International 

Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank policies and practices.  They will 

explain the reasons they felt compelled to travel to Washington to participate 

in the historic series of events bringing thousands to protest the institutions' 

spring meetings.



<p>The speakers will include: Carlos Chen, a Guatemalan who survived a massacre 

by his own country's armed forces of villagers who opposed a World Bank-financed 

dam.  Trevor Ngwane, a South African who sits on the Johannesburg municipal 

council, will describe the pressure exerted by the institutions to privatize 

services in the newly-liberated South Africa. Maria Teresa Pascual, who 

is President of the Freedom From Debt Coalition of the Philippines, will 

describe the work of one of the oldest and largest grassroots organizations 

devoted to education and advocacy on the global economic policies that 

are devastating societies throughout the Southern countries.



<p>Most of the speakers come from countries that have endured many years under 

structural adjustment, the harsh austerity policies imposed by the IMF 

and World Bank on countries too indebted to get credit or capital from 

other sources.  Critiques of those policies will be offered both from the 

speakers' own personal experiences as well as from their work in analyzing 

the broad impact of structural adjustment.
