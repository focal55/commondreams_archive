- October 23 - Ralph Nader today called on Vice-President Gore

to heed the EPA National Ombudsman’s report and immediately halt

operations at the WTI incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio.  “It’s past

time to honor your promise,” Nader told Gore, “there are no more

excuses.  There is a critical mass of information and informed opinion

calling for a halt in operations.”  Nader campaigned in East Liverpool,

Ohio on September 27.



<p>On Friday, the EPA National Ombudsman issued a long-delayed report

recommending that the “EPA and Ohio EPA restrict operations at the WTI

facility immediately by: (1) Halting the feeding of waste to the

incinerator for a period of no less than six months; (2) Make

preparations for a retest of the trial burn or a new trial burn in 2001

as a necessary step in the consideration by Ohio EPA of permit renewal

for the facility next year; and (3) With new data from the new trial

burn, perform a new Addendum to the risk assessment for the WTI

facility.”



<p>Vice-President Gore had called for the report in February, while under

pressure from citizen activists, and staffers had promised its delivery

“before Mother’s Day.”  “The delayed release of this report can’t be

used as an excuse for inaction,” Nader said today.  “The people of East

Liverpool have heard the ‘my hands are tied’ excuse already.”



<p>“The EPA should not ignore these recommendations,” Nader stated, “but

the vice president has already had ample opportunity to make good on his

1992 promise and shut the incinerator down.”



<p>Trial-burns conducted in 1993 revealed that the incinerator released

toxins in quantities greater than the already dangerously high levels

allowed by the EPA.  Mercury and dioxin levels were far higher than

expected, giving the Clinton Administration ample reason to deny

approval of full commercial operation to the WTI incinerator.  As the

September 1994 GAO report that Gore himself requested noted, toxic

emission standards were lowered by Gore’s own EPA in order to allow the

incinerator to operate. “In each case [where toxic emissions exceeded

allowable levels],” the report explains, “EPA responded to the trial

burn results by changing the operating conditions under which the

incinerator could continue to operate.”



<p>The hazardous waste incinerator in East Liverpool, OH burns 60,000 tons

of hazardous waste every year, making it one of the largest incinerators

of its type in the world, despite the fact that its permit expired in

1995.  It is located in an area with a history of environmental

contamination, on a flood plain, and less than 400 yards away from an

elementary school, in violation of numerous state and federal

environmental regulations.  Campaigning for Vice-President in 1992, Al

Gore called the incinerator, then in construction “unbelievable,”

adding: “the Clinton-Gore administration is going to give you an

environmental presidency to deal with these problems.  We’ll be on your

side for a change.”  That statement represents just one more broken

promise by the Clinton-Gore Administration.  No one is more eloquent on

this subject than the parents and residents of East Liverpool, Ohio.
