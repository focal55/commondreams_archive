- March 14 - A review of government



records shows that officials in more than 40 states and the



District of Columbia have allowed critically important water



pollution permits to expire, effectively issuing industries a



license to pollute.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The review, released today by Friends of the Earth and the



Environmental Working Group, also concludes that there is currently



little action afoot to correct this serious problem. Nevada, Rhode



Island, Oregon and Nebraska all had more than two-thirds of their



permits expired. Texas had the largest number of expired permits at



135; Louisiana was second with 116 expired permits; and Ohio,



California and Indiana rounded out the top five with 96, 85 and 81



expired permits respectively.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pollution permits are the legally binding agreements with



factories and sewage treatment plants that limit the volumes and



types of pollution of the nation's lakes and rivers. These permits



are the basis of virtually all water pollution tracking and



reduction, as well as enforcement of water pollution laws. Under



the Clean Water Act (CWA), the nation's cornerstone water pollution



law, permits must be renewed at least every five years. With each



new permit, the pollution limits are lowered toward the eventual



goal of zero pollution.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The findings come amidst growing concern that governors of many



states and the EPA are not enforcing basic pollution laws, and many



environmental analysts are worried. Without up-to-date permits,



environmentalists say states handcuff their environmental



enforcement staff.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If you or I were driving a car or operating a small business



without a valid, up-to-date license, we'd be fined or arrested.



Factories and sewage treatment plants should not be allowed to



operate with expired permits," said Larry Bohlen, director of



health and environment programs at Friends of the Earth.



"Government officials need to do their jobs and get these permits



up to date."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth (FoE) and the Environmental Working Group



conducted a review of the publicly available water pollution



records from the 50 states and the District of Columbia. They found



that 44 states and the District of Columbia have allowed 10 percent



or more of their permits to expire.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Industries and their allies in state governments will whine



about the costs of permitting. The fact is that up-to-date permits



give businesses the opportunity to modernize the way they control



their waste stream, which saves them money," said Velma Smith,



report author and FoE senior analyst.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Without up-to-date permits, how do states think they'll enforce



our environmental laws?" asked EWG Analyst John Coequyt.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FoE rated states on a pass-fail basis, and the grade for each



state was assigned based on the percentage of expired permits as of



the start of this year. States with more than 10 percent of their



permits expired were failed based upon a 10 percent maximum permit



backlog set by the U.S. EPA. The analysis looked only at "major"



permits -- a designation of those facilities that have the greatest



potential to lower water quality due to the volume or type of



pollutants discharged. FoE gave states an extra time cushion, so



that any permit that it lists as expired has been so for at least



three months.
