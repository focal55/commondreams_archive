accepting financial contributions for famine relief in the Horn

of Africa. Millions of people are at risk of starvation in Ethiopia

and the effects of this humanitarian crisis are already being

felt in neighboring countries. An equally devastating famine has

been reported in parts of Somalia, where wells and rivers have

dried up and cholera is now spreading at an alarming rate by refugees

migrating across the Ethiopian-Somali border.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

United Nations and other international aid agencies, which have

established feeding centers in parts of southern and eastern Ethiopia,

report that approximately ten people--most of them children--die

daily as families reach the feeding camps. Little is known about

what is happening in the remote and inaccessible areas of Ethiopia

and Somalia. 

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The failure of rains so desperately needed has placed many

communities at risk. There are all the indications of impending

widespread famine throughout the region,&quot; said AFSC Somalia

Program Director Abdikadir Hassan Mohamed. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Although the international community has responded with pledges

for aid and food shipments to some regions, the scope of the famine

is enormous. Many people from small villages are too weak to travel

to the feeding centers. AFSC will provide relief and recovery

assistance such as cholera medication, food and seeds for the

next planting season to displaced populations. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Contributions marked <b>Horn of Africa Relief</b> can be sent

to AFSC, 1501 Cherry St., Philadelphia, PA 19102 or by calling

1-888-588-2372.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

AFSC began relief and development assistance in Somalia in 1982

in the wake of the Ogaden war and massive drought, in which more

than one million people died and a quarter of the population became

refugees. AFSC has stayed in Somalia--one of the world's poorest

countries--throughout years of civil conflict, maintaining Somali

staff and program activities in the country. The aim is to increase

the socioeconomic security of ethnically and socially marginalized

groups, who are particularly vulnerable in situations of conflict

and political instability.
