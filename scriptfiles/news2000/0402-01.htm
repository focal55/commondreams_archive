   US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 7th and Mission, San Francisco



<p>On Thursday, April 13 attorneys for Stephen Dunifer and Free Radio

Berkeley will appear before the US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to argue

for the reversal of Federal District Judge Claudia Wilken's ruling

granting the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) an injunction

against Stephen Dunifer and Free Radio Berkeley.  Granted on June 18,

1998, after a protracted and internationally recognized 4 year court

battle over Free Speech and 1st Amendment Issues, this injunction

resulted in the silencing of Free Radio Berkeley and the prohibition of

Stephen Dunifer from engaging in any unlicensed broadcast activities.

International recognition of this case was achieved when Federal Judge

Claudia Wilken refused to grant the FCC a preliminary injunction to shut

down Free Radio Berkeley on January, 20, 1995.  It marked the first time

a Federal Court had refused to grant the FCC an injunction to shut down

an unlicensed radio station.  For the next 3 years a protracted court

engagement occurred with a defensive FCC attempting to dodge the bullet

of Constitutional scrutiny.  Finally, on a very narrow technical ruling,

Federal Judge Claudia Wilken did an abrupt about face from her earlier

position and granted the FCC the injunction it had sought on the grounds

that the defendant, Stephen Dunifer, did not have standing to challenge

the Constitutionality of the FCC's regulatory policies.  Shortly after

filling a motion for altering the ruling and having it denied by Judge

Claudia Wilken, attorneys for Stephen Dunifer and Free Radio Berkeley

filed an appeal of the injunction ruling with the US Circuit Court of

Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Now, after 1 1/2 years from the filing

date this case will be heard before a three judge panel of the court of

Appeals.



<p>Speaking on this matter, Stephen Dunifer stated: "Our legal defense team

has noted the extreme irony in the FCC adopting a new low power FM

broadcast service using language directly from our briefs. And, at the

same time, taking an opposite position within the legal framework of

this case.  Going even further, the FCC maintains that I do not have

standing to Constitutionally challenge their regulatory and statutory

framework.  As someone who is recognized as having a primary role in the

flourishing of the micropower broadcasting movement, if I do not have

standing, then who does?  Our appeal process is taking place against a

backdrop of raw corporate muscle, money, and political influence being

exercised by the National Association of Broadcasters to ensure that

only the very rich and powerful mega-media corporations have access to

the airwaves, a public resource.  If legislation sponsored on behalf of

the NAB becomes law then what little crumbs the FCC has given to

community broadcasting in the form of the new LPFM service will be swept

from the table.  Two years ago the National Association of Broadcasters

stated that I had grown from a minor annoyance to become an ominous

threat.  I will continue to do everything possible to live up to that

prestigious accolade.  To the NAB I say, despite your ability to buy off

Congress in order to continue the monopolization of the broadcast

spectrum and deny everyone else the right of Free Speech, your days are

numbered.  Up against the wall, Seattle is coming to the airwaves!"
