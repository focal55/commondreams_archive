<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- June 1 - </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Texas Governor George W. Bush today attacked efforts to

     protect America's most spectacular landscapes and our majestic ancient

     forests, deriding a conservation measure created under President

     Theodore Roosevelt and touting a mismanaged Texas program.  In a

     speech today in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, Governor Bush outlined a plan that

     would allow seemingly endless debate over unprotected land, while

     allowing his oil- and gas-industry allies to continue their

     destruction for decades.

</font></p>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Many of America's favorite vacation spots remain unprotected and

     vulnerable to destruction, but Gov. Bush says he would delay

     protection," said Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope.  "American

     families don't want more foot dragging -- they want our spectacular

     landscapes and ancient forests protected for their children's children

     to enjoy.  Delay means destruction for many of America's wildlands.

     Governor Bush's policy would wrap protections in red tape while oil

     companies continue to drill our public lands and the timber industry

     ravages our National Forests. "

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     In his speech, Bush praised the Texas Landowner Incentive Program for

     protecting rare species.  However, the Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife

     Department does not allow private projects funded by the this program

     to be reviewed by experts on the species of concern.  This lack of

     scientific review lead to the misallocation of $18,000 for an

     environmentally destructive project involving a species not eligible

     for funding through the program.  The $18,000 was used to clear

     vegetation and channelize a stream near Davis Mountains State Park,

     with no intended benefit for endangered species.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Gov. Bush attacked President Clinton's recent designations of National

     Monuments, which have included the north rim of the Grand Canyon,

     California's Sequoia forests and the rocky islands on the California

     coast.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     Roosevelt, the first President to create National Monuments, protected

     the Grand Canyon as a National Monument in 1908; Congress designated

     it as a National Park after more than a decade of debate.  This

     century, each President but Nixon, Reagan and Bush has protected part

     of America's landscape as National Monuments.

</font>

<p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We enjoy the Grand Canyon's wonders today because President Teddy

     Roosevelt designated it as a National Monument nearly a century ago,"

     Pope added.  "If President Roosevelt hadn't acted quickly, but instead

     waited for Congress to finish its debate, the Grand Canyon might have

     been developed and destroyed decades ago."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     On January 30, 2000, The Washington Post's Al Kamen reported that Bush

     environmental advisor Terry L. Anderson "recently published a

     `blueprint for auctioning off all public lands over 20 to 40 years,'

     saying that that would improve `environmental quality and economic

     efficiency.'" Anderson explicitly leaves open the possibility of

     auctioning off Grand Canyon National Park.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     American families treasure our National Parks, National Monuments and

     National Forests as their favorite vacation spots, places to relax,

     hunt, hike, fish and gaze at the vistas.  Texas, however, invests

     little in protecting its natural resources.  The state ranks 43rd in

     per capita spending on fish and wildlife protections, 47th in per

     capita water-quality spending, and 48th in per capita spending on

     state parkland and acquisition.</font>
