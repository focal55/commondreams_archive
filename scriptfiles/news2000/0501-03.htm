- May 1 - -- Today, Handgun Control honored 

Rosie O'Donnell for her tireless dedication to making America's 

children safe from gun violence. 



<p>O'Donnell has used her celebrity status to increase awareness 

for the need for common-sense gun laws, and has been an outspoken 

supporter of both Handgun Control and the Million Mom March Across 

America. 



<p>The event, held at Cipriani on 42nd Street in New York City, 

brought together hundreds of guests from the political and 

entertainment communities along with gun control activists and 

friends and supporters of Handgun Control. Legendary actress 

Lauren Bacall began the program, which also featured former White 

House Press Secretary Jim Brady, New York Representatives Carolyn 

McCarthy and Nita Lowey and Handgun Control President Michael 

Barnes. Sony Music Recording Artist Chantal Kreviazuk, who kicks 

off her nation-wide tour later this month, performed along with 

singer/songwriter Leslie Nuchow, founder of SLAM! Records, a 

socially conscious label that sponsors concerts to benefit 

non-profit organizations. 



<p>At the dinner, O'Donnell received a special award created by 

New York City elementary school students. The children contributed 

their writings and drawings detailing their personal experiences 

with gun violence in their neighborhoods. 



<p>"Everyone who knows Rosie knows how committed she is to 

children's issues and to helping to reduce gun violence in 

America," said Michael Barnes, president of Handgun Control. 

"Rosie has been an outspoken voice for our cause, and we are 

incredibly grateful for her support," said Barnes. "America's 

kids deserve to grow up safe from gun violence, and she has gone to 

great lengths to try and make that a reality." 



<p>Earlier today, Rosie also premiered on her talk show a new 

Handgun Control/Center to Prevent Handgun Violence ad campaign 

featuring voice-overs by celebrity moms Rosie O'Donnell, Susan 

Sarandon, Whoopi Goldberg, Gloria Estefan and Sarah Jessica Parker 

and using home footage of six American children who died at the 

hands of guns. The ad campaign, which urges parents who are 

concerned about the high levels of gun violence in our nation to 

participate in the Million Mom March events across the country, 

began airing today in at least a dozen markets on cable networks.

------ 

<p>Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974 by 

Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. "Pete" Shields, two victims of gun 

violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law 

enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups across 

the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and local gun 

control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI has more than 

400,000 members nationwide, making it the nation's largest 

citizens' gun control lobbying organization. More information about 

HCI and its sister organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun 

Violence, can be found on the website at www.handguncontrol.org.
