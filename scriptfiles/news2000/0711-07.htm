- July 11 - An investigation published



last Friday by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) criticizes



the U.S. government for a negligent response during the 1994



genocide in Rwanda and charges that U.S. officials inhibited



action by the UN Security Council as the genocide unfolded.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Committee for Refugees repeats its call for the U.S.



government to undertake a long overdue investigation into its



own failure to respond appropriately during the 1994 genocide



in Rwanda that slaughtered a half-million to a million people.



The OAU report is the most recent of several investigations



that have excoriated U.S. officials and other world leaders for



their inaction during Rwanda's massive killings.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The OAU report, prepared by an "International Panel of Eminent



Personalities to Investigate the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda," concludes



that the U.S. government "knew full well" about the genocide as



it occurred but refused to respond because of the Clinton



administration's "geopolitical indifference." The report



characterizes the U.S. failure to respond as "inglorious,"



"exceptionally insensitive," and "ridiculous." The report charges



that "no nation did more than the United States to undermine the



effectiveness" of UN peacekeeping efforts in Rwanda. The OAU



panel entitled its report, Rwanda: The Preventable Genocide.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. government has refused to investigate its own failings



and how to avoid them in the future. President Bill Clinton



belatedly apologized in 1998 for the U.S. government's failure



to respond to Rwanda's genocide and stated that he "did not



fully appreciate" the scope of the killings when they occurred.



However, the OAU report joins other investigations in concluding



that U.S. officials were well-informed about the bloodletting



in Rwanda as it took place.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright



on July 9 on ABC television in reaction to the OAU report suggest



that she disagreed with the U.S. policy of inaction during the



genocide when she was U.S. Ambassador to the UN. Albright says



that she was following orders.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I followed instructions because I was an ambassador. But I



screamed about the instructions that I got on this. I felt they



were wrong, and I made that point. But I was an ambassador



under instructions."



-- Madeleine Albright, U.S. Secretary of State, July 9, 2000,



discussing criticism of her role in the passive U.S. response



to 1994 genocide in Rwanda

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"What could I do? What could I do by myself? Nothing....



We were powerless to fix the situation.... What can you do?"



-- Rwandan Hutu religious leader, reacting to recent criticism of



his passive response to 1994 genocide in Rwanda

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I don't know how Madeleine Albright lives with it."



-- Stephen Lewis, former Canadian ambassador to the UN and



co-author of new OAU report, released July 7, criticizing



international community's passive response during 1994 genocide



in Rwanda

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Albright's words again raise serious questions about who



determined U.S. policy during the fateful days of the genocide,



how U.S. decisions were made, what options received consideration,



how crucial information circulated among policy makers, and



how the President could claim to have been poorly informed as



a genocide occurred in full view of the world.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. government stands virtually alone in refusing to conduct



a transparent examination of its policy failures during the



Rwandan genocide. The governments of Belgium and France have



conducted inquiries into their own actions amid the genocide.



In 1996, a multi-donor assessment team published a report, Lessons



From the Rwanda Experience, which concluded that "the role of



the United States was critical" in impeding an international



response to the genocide. In 1999, the UN published a self-critical



report assessing its negligence during the genocide and documenting



steps taken by the U.S. government to weaken UN protection efforts



during the massacres.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Committee for Refugees has repeatedly called for an



independent review of U.S. policies during the genocide. The



OAU report, and the reaction of Secretary of State Albright,



reinforce the need for such an investigation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Clinton's claim that he did not know about the genocide,



and Albright's claim that she was just following orders, are



contradictory, grossly inadequate, and beg for elaboration.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Pass the buck" excuses are common to this day inside Rwanda among



the perpetrators of genocide. Such excuses are unworthy of



America's leading officials.
