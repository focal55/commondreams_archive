VIEQUES, PUERTO RICO 

- May 9 - Carlos Zenon, President of the Vieques Fishermen's Association and leader of

Camp Mount David in the live impact area in Vieques, denounced today the

announcement by the U.S. Navy and by acting Governor Angel Morey that the

U.S. Navy had resumed bombing in Vieques.



<p>Zenon, whose sons Pedro and Cacimar are still in the live impact area along

with several other people, said that the Navy continues with its

psychological warfare against the people of Vieques, as it recently did with

the constant reports about the "imminency" of the arrests.



<p>Zenon said:  "Resuming bombing on this island, even if there were no one

left in the live impact area, is immoral.  But bombing when my sons and

others are there in the live impact area, is further evidence that the lives

of Viequenses are worth very little to the Navy.  If they had the audacity

to bomb today, knowing full well about the presence of several human beings

in the area and knowing full well that there are hundreds of depleted

uranium shells and hundreds of unexploded live bombs that could explode upon

impact by the inert bombs, then the message the Navy is sending is that its

true intention is to continue abusing Vieques and doing whatever they please

to the people of Vieques, regardless of the charade of Clinton's directives

on Vieques."



<p>Zenón stated:  "Rosselló and Clinton know this full well.  You'll now see

how their people go running to Congress to gleefully share the news of the

arrests and the resumption of bombing.  At this stage, no one can have any

doubts that Clinton's directives on Vieques are pro-Navy and anti-Vieques."



<p>Finally, Zenon said:  "This total disregard of the Navy towards the lives,

health and well-being of the people of Vieques is well known by us.  Last

week I said that one can expect anything from the Navy, but that even they

would not dare drop one single bomb if there is even one human being in the

live impact area.  If they actually dropped bombs in the area today, knowing

as they do that there are several people in the area, then we have to say

that one can expect anything from the Navy, however immoral it may be.

Things like these make our struggle for peace more urgent."
