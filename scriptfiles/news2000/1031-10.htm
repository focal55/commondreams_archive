- October 31 - In response to the controversy surrounding the role of American Muslims in the Clinton-Lazio Senate race, the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of The Interfaith Alliance, released the following statement: 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As interfaith religious leaders, we denounce the electoral strategy of appealing to bigotry and prejudice for votes.  Recent public statements and campaign activities such as 500,000 inflammatory pre-recorded phone calls to voters in the New York Senate race have played to our society's ugly stereotypes of Muslims as terrorist sympathizers prone to violence.  



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Equally disturbing is the assumption that anti-Muslim religion baiting is politically expedient.  To attempt to win Jewish votes by exploiting the stereotypes that Jews and Muslims don't get along insults both Jews and Muslims and taints the democratic process of campaigning for votes.  Indeed, the actions in this Senate race represent the worst of our politics and illustrate a willingness to sacrifice ethics in the quest for political victory.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Unfounded accusations against Muslims or American Muslim organizations perpetuates prejudice against the religion of Islam and its followers and undermines the civic voice and contributions that American Muslims make to our political process and communities.  



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"For too long, Muslims in America have been excluded from participating in civil dialogue on public policy matters because of negative and erroneous stereotypes.  Indeed, if working with Muslims makes one vulnerable to the allegation of working with terrorist sympathizers, civic leaders will be less likely to engage members of the Muslim faith community.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The accusations and activities in New York perpetuating stereotypes about Muslims are receiving national attention and contribute to a national paranoia about the intentions and activities of Muslim leaders in communities across our nation.  This type of McCarthy-esque fear and prejudice provokes discrimination, harassment and even hate-violence directed at individuals suspected of being Muslim. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Whether it is about Catholics, Evangelical Christians, Orthodox Jews, Hindus or Muslims - religious bigotry in all its forms is pernicious; it has a chilling effect on political participation in our democracy, a compromising effect on the integrity of religion, and an escalating effect on the culture of hate."



</font>

<p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Founded in 1994, The Interfaith Alliance (TIA) is a non-partisan clergy-led grassroots organization.  Drawing on shared religious principles, TIA advances a mainstream faith-based agenda dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in public life and challenges those who manipulate religion to promote an extreme political agenda.  With more than 120,000 members drawn from over 50 faith traditions, and a national network of activists in every state, TIA promotes civility, mutual respect and cooperation in our increasingly-diverse society.</i>
