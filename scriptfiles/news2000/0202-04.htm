<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Statement of Athan Manuel, Director Arctic Wilderness Campaign





</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We commend the Federal Trade Commission for rejecting the proposed merger of BP Amoco and ARCO, the two largest oil companies in Alaska.  This is a great win for Alaska, consumers, democracy, and the environment.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have said all along that this merger does not pass the laugh test.  Allowing one company to hold a virtual monopoly over the largest oil field in the United States -- Alaska’s North Slope -- would harm the state of Alaska and consumers up and down the West Coast.  



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The FTC commissioners and staff at the Bureau of Competition have been very attentive to the public’s concerns about this merger.  In the dozens of meetings we have held with them since last April when the merger was announced, the FTC has been very interested in hearing from citizens. 



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Monopoly control over Alaska’s oil would result in higher gas prices for consumers in California, Oregon, and Washington.  We are glad that the FTC recognized the severe harm this merger would inflict on consumers.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have been concerned that the new BP Amoco ARCO would use its increased political clout to push its aggressive anti-environmental agenda, which includes drilling in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and offshore at Northstar.  Both are risky and dangerous projects that would scar pristine Arctic ecosystems.  Last month, U.S. PIRG, Greenpeace, Trillium Asset Management, and other socially responsible investors filled a shareholder resolution calling on BP Amoco to cancel drilling plans for America’s Arctic.



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, we hope that the FTC’s rejection of the BP Amoco - ARCO merger will slow down the merger mania that has taken hold of the oil industry in the last two years.  



</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rather than taking this matter to court, we urge BP Amoco to drop its merger plans all together.  It is time for BP Amoco to act like a responsible corporate citizen and recognize that this merger is bad for Alaska, consumers, democracy, and the environment.
