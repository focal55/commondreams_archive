<br>

Friday, July 7 11 a.m.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On The Threshold of NMD Decision, Deep Dissent On Technology



And "Rogue State" Missile Threat

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Friday night (July 7), the last National Missile Defense



(NMD) test before a deployment decision takes place. On Friday



morning, July 7, MIT scientist Ted Postol and other analysts



critical of National Missile Defense (NMD) will join CEO's



representing Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, for a



BLSP-hosted media briefing. Key weapons experts and business



leaders alike will speak on the deficiency and duplicity of the



tests and global consequences of the White House's rush to



deployment. With the intelligence community, military leadership



and the Administration internally divided over the seriousness of



the missile threat, the deployment decision is mired



in political controversy and misinformation on points of scientific



fact.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, the White House has said that pending results of



Friday's test, it will give NMD deployment "a limited green light"



to begin construction of x-band radar in the Aleutian Islands.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ted Postol, MIT scientist and ballistics expert who debunked



overblown claims for the Patriot missile during the Gulf War, and



who more recently brought to national attention charges that NMD



tests had been rigged and knowingly falsified to cover up the fact



that NMD interceptors cannot distinguish between warheads and



decoys. He will release a letter to President Clinton with



additional charges at the briefing.
