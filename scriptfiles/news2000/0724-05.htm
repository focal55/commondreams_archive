- July 24 - Seven Greenpeace activists were arrested after five members of their group boarded the Danish vessel CIC Light to spotlight the shipping of criminal timber from the Amazon rainforest.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The ship's crew reacted suddenly and violently upon spotting the activists.  Two activists were unfurling a large banner which was snatched away.  Two other activists' ropes were cut as they attempted to climb aboard the ship.  The activists plunged from the side into the water where they were subsequently rescued by Greenpeace activists in an inflatable boat.  Three activists, Veronica Froelich from the U.S., Heike Staudigl from Germany, and Paul Goyvaerts from Belgium, remained on board.  All three carried smaller banners.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This reaction is only a symptom of the violence that pervades the global illegal timber trade," said Scott Paul, Greenpeace Forest Campaigner. "Every week criminal timber is being shipped into the U.S. from around the world. The U.S. Government promised to tackle the illegal timber trade, and is simply turning a blind eye to this flourishing market."

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Police officers boarded the ship and arrested the three activists who remained onboard the ship.  The two activists who were dropped into the water, Christian Jonuschies from Germany and Jim Klein from the U.S., eventually boarded the ship and remained roped to the bow until they were taken into custody by the U.S. Coast Guard.  The drivers of the safety boat and the van, James Mitchell and Dexter Sumner, were also arrested.  All were arrested by the Chatham County Sheriff's department on a simple misdemeanor trespass charge.

A recent Greenpeace 18-month investigation in remote regions of the Amazon uncovered hard evidence that several companies who regularly export timber to the U.S. are implicated in the illegal timber trade including the Rimbunan Hijau group, one of the world's top rainforest destroyers. The Brazilian Government estimates that 80% of all logging in the Brazilian Amazon is illegal.

This Greenpeace action is the latest in a series of global protests to protect the Earth's last remaining ancient forests. In the past weeks, Greenpeace activists around the world have exposed criminal timber imports into G8 countries. </font>
