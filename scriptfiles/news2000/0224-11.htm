<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 24 - A

          dangerous pattern of exploiting religion for political gain has

          emerged in this year's presidential campaign, a trend that must end

          immediately before it spirals out of control, according to Americans

          United for Separation of Church and State.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These

          candidates and their cronies have turned this race into a holy

          war,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of

          Americans United. &quot;This is the ugliest exploitation of religion

          for partisan purposes in modern political history. There were plenty

          of questionable campaign tactics early on, but they have escalated

          into sometimes vicious religious demagoguery. These fights risk

          causing interfaith damage that will linger on past the November

          election. They must stop now.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To

          highlight the dangerous pattern, Lynn cited multiple examples:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>*

          Gov. George W. Bush</b> kicked off his campaign in South Carolina with

          an appearance at Bob Jones University in South Carolina, a university

          that has banned interracial dating among its students, has called the

          pope the &quot;Antichrist&quot; and referred to the Catholic Church as

          a &quot;satanic cult.&quot; Bush also caused an early campaign

          controversy by telling an Iowa debate audience that Jesus is his

          favorite political philosopher.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>*

          TV preacher Pat Robertson</b>, as part of an effort to support Bush's

          campaign, has weighed in heavily, using his Christian Coalition and

          Christian Broadcasting Network. Robertson defended Bush's appearance

          at Bob Jones on national television, and then bragged on his &quot;700

          Club&quot; program that Christian Coalition Executive Vice President

          Roberta Combs organized every county in South Carolina, thus taking

          credit for Bush's primary victory. Robertson also organized a press

          conference the day before the South Carolina primary to denounce

          Warren Rudman, one of McCain's campaign chairmen, as a &quot;vicious

          bigot&quot; because of Rudman's criticism of the Religious Right. More

          recently, with a pre-recorded message, Robertson called thousands of

          Michigan residents, repeating his harsh attack on Rudman.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>*

          Sen. John McCain's campaign</b> placed thousands of phone calls to

          Catholic voters in Michigan, attempting to tie Bush to the

          anti-Catholic beliefs of Bob Jones University. First the campaign

          denied being involved with the calls, then later acknowledged being

          responsible for them.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>*

          Sen. Robert Torricelli</b>, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial

          Campaign Committee, apparently hoping to compound Bush's embarrassment

          from the appearance at Bob Jones University, announced that he will

          introduce a congressional resolution to condemn the school's religious

          beliefs.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>*

          Pat Buchanan</b>, seeking the Reform Party nomination, opined that he

          knew the &quot;true faith&quot; (Christianity) and said he &quot;would

          like all folks to come to it.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>*

          Multiple churches</b> have also been drawn into the religious strife

          surrounding the campaign. Despite federal tax law that prohibits

          houses of worship from intervening in political campaigns, Vice

          President Al Gore appeared at Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church

          in New York on Feb. 13, and was <a href="http://www.au.org/pr21400.htm">endorsed

          from the pulpit by the church's pastor</a>, the Rev. Floyd Flake.

          Similarly, the Rev. E.L. Branch at Third New Hope Missionary Baptist

          Church in Detroit <a href="http://www.au.org/pr22200.htm">told his

          congregation</a> on Feb. 20 that they could help disrupt Michigan's

          GOP primary by voting for McCain.&nbsp;<o:p>

          </o:p>

          </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>*

          Vice President Al Gore</b> has made religion a centerpoint of his

          campaign. As Elaine Kamarck, one of Gore's top advisors, told a

          newspaper last summer, &quot;The Democratic Party is going to take God

          back this time.&quot; Additionally Gore has repeatedly told reporters

          that he is a born-again Christian who often asks himself 'what would

          Jesus do?'</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Observed

          AU's Lynn, &quot;Right now in Iran voters are trying to separate

          religion and politics. Unfortunately, here in the United States, we

          appear to be going in the opposite direction.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;<a href="http://www.au.org/pr121799.htm">Late

          last year</a>, I voiced concerns about this trend,&quot; Lynn

          concluded. &quot;Now we're seeing how divisive this issue can be. All

          the presidential campaigns should immediately drop this tactic from

          their political bag of tricks.&quot;</font></p>
