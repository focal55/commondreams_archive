- July 11 - Unhappy with Webster's description of the word "emergency," Congress has

redefined the word.  According to the recently passed fiscal 2001 Military

Construction Appropriations Bill, there are several new categories of

emergencies including: need to brag in press releases about amount of pork

one has garnered for his/her home state, inability to secure funding

through appropriate legislative processes, and falling stock prices of key

defense contractors.  



<p>These new "emergency" expenditures were first reported in an analysis of

the bill, conducted by the Council for a Livable World Education Fund, that

includes the fiscal 2000 supplemental appropriations legislation. The

analysis reveals that members of the Military Construction Appropriations

Subcommittees and the chairs and ranking members of the Appropriation

Committees collaborated to provide their home states and districts with

$620 million in add-ons representing 77% of the total increase ($800

million) above the president's request.



<p>However, the real pork is found in the supplemental appropriations portion

of the bill.  According to Congress, physical fitness centers in senior

citizens homes, firearms training facilities, and youth centers are now

eligible for "emergency" funding.  



<p>Lockheed-Martin received a $468 million order for six unneeded C-130J Cargo

planes and an "emergency" Gulfstream jet for the commandant of the Coast

Guard.  Boeing was given another $90 million to finish paying for

unrequested fighter planes they could not complete with funds appropriated

last year.  The only real emergency seems to be jacking up the stock prices

of defense contractors.  



<p>Despite totaling $19 billion, the bill was not released to

non-appropriations committee members of the House of Representatives prior

to the vote and members of the Senate were only given several hours to scan

the bill. 



<p>Congress continues to cry about military readiness woes, yet, none of the

add-ons to the supplemental appropriations bill addresses these problems.

While troops complain of poor benefits and a lack of spare parts Congress

is adding money for the Olympics and ski resorts.  



<p>Senator John McCain (R-AZ) was quick to point out other wasteful funding:

"It is ironic that the emergency spending bill before us today includes $20

million for abstinence education, because the taxpayers are really getting

screwed."



<p>Copies of the Council's Military Construction Bill analysis are available

upon request.
