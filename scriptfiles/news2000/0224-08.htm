<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DOBBS FERRY, NY -   

February 24 - Today, as the New York League of

Conservation Voters endorsed Gore as their environmental candidate, activists

concerned about global warming gathered outside in what should have been the

cold with their thirty foot model of the world enveloped by an infectious

disease-carrying mosquito. These

non-partisan campaigners have followed the presidential candidates throughout

the early primary states. Along the

way, the campaigners have traveled through drought-ridden Iowa, snow-lacking

New Hampshire and now balmy, fifty degree New York, urging the candidates to

inform the public about their plans to solve global warming. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;All the candidates

have stated publicly that global warming is a threat. We are here to ensure that they continue to commit to a dialogue

about their plan to solve the problem,” said Kate Simmons, Global Warming 2000

New York field staff member.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the U.S.

Environmental Protection Agency, temperatures could increase from 1.6-6.3

degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100. Diseases that thrive in warmer climates, such as dengue and yellow

fever, malaria, encephalitis and cholera are likely to spread due to the

expanded ranges of mosquitoes and other disease-carrying organisms. New York City experienced a small taste of

what global warming could mean when an<strong> <span

style='font-weight:normal'>encephalitis</span></strong><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

normal'> </b>outbreak occurred in <strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>the city</span></strong><b

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> </b>this past August. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Activists have not been

alone in their efforts to create a dialogue about global warming solutions

during the early primaries. Over 100

local elected officials and 400 scientists have joined in calling on the candidates

to lay out their plans to address global warming. Lizann Altman, a Southampton town council member stated that,

&quot;Here in Southampton, we are very concerned that global warming-induced

sea-level rise will negatively impact our coastal community. This is an essential issue for all the

presidential candidates to debate.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout the month of

March, Global Warming 2000 activists will continue to urge the candidates to

lay out comprehensive plans to solve global warming. Working with local elected officials, scientists, health

specialists and the religious community, activists will use visibility tactics

such as giant inflatable mosquitoes and other public demonstrations to keep the

pressure on the candidates and the public aware of the global warming threat in

their communities. Yesterday, one team

activist even feigned fainting into the arms of Vice President Gore to

highlight the impacts of heat related illness due to global warming in Florida. <o:p></o:p> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The presidential

candidates need to be aware of the health and environmental impacts of global

warming,&quot; said Matt Stembridge, Global Warming 2000 New York Campaign

Director. &quot;No matter where they

are, with which party they are affiliated, or with whom they are meeting, we

will continue to urge each candidate to further present their own plan to solve

global warming.” Digital image of the inflatable prop is available at the Ozone Action
