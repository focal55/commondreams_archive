- May 1 - Greenpeace today warned that the five 

Nuclear Weapons States have decided to fiddle while the world 

may burn.  Hopes of a positive outcome at the 2000 Review 

meeting of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty may be all but 

dashed by a statement from the U.S., China, France, Russia, and 

the U.K. about their progress.  

</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The joint statement is an attempt to alleviate the concerns 

expressed by Non-Nuclear Weapons States (NNWS), but instead 

heightens concern by showing the NWS action on disarmament 

will be limited to platitudes. Greenpeace termed the statement an 

empty apologia and called for immediate action to reduce and 

eliminate weapons stockpiles.  

</font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is a lame attempt to excuse the inexcusable.  The NWS has 

failed to take meaningful action on disarmament", said William 

Peden, Greenpeace Disarmament Campaigner in New York. "What 

is needed now is action, not more words".  

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Under the 1970 Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the five 

weapons States are bound by Article VI to pursue meaningful 

steps towards nuclear disarmament. In return, the non-weapons 

States agree to forego nuclear weapons. However, in the 

intervening three decades, the weapons States have massively 

increased their arsenals.  

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

While the end of the Cold War saw some progress on stockpile 

reductions between the U.S. and Russia, more than 30,000 nuclear 

weapons remain in existence, thousands of which are on hair-

trigger alert.  

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The five nuclear weapon States are expected to formally release 

the joint statement to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Review 

Conference underway at UN Headquarters at 4.30 PM EDT today.  

In the statement, the weapons States fail to meet the 182 non-

weapons States’ requirement that the weapons States eliminate 

their nuclear weapons as required by the Treaty.   

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Greenpeace called on the NWS to immediately agree a program of 

action on disarmament. This includes:  

</font>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cancel U.S. plans for National Missile Defense (Star Wars); 

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), particularly 

China and the U.S.; 

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Initiate negotiations on Strategic Tactical 

Arms Reduction Talks (START 3); 

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Take all nuclear weapons off 

alert; and 

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Halt all new nuclear warhead development;  



</font>

<p></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Ten years after the end of the Cold War," Peden said, "the NWS 

maintain their refusal to disarm. Their actions not only weaken the 

NPT and the entire international arms control regime, but ensure 

that the world continues to live with the constant threat of a nuclear 

holocaust". </font>
