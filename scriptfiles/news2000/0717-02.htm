- July 17 - News Advisory:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. Representatives Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), Lynn Rivers (D-MI),



Barney Frank (D-MA), Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Peace Action and our



50-foot mock nuclear missile will protest Star Wars missile defense



on the East Lawn of the U.S. Capitol, Tuesday, July 18 at 11:00 am.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Kucinich initiated a letter signed by 53 Representatives



demanding the FBI investigate the alleged cover-up of test data



after the Clinton Administration classified a letter from Dr.



Theodore Postol of MIT pointing out the BMDO's own data shows the

system cannot distinguish between missiles and decoys.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The unsuccessful July 7th test has further raised criticism of



Star Wars. "The public will never trust a missile defense system



when even relatively simple technologies like booster rockets don't



perform reliably," said Gordon S. Clark, Peace Action's Executive



Director. "The American people will not tolerate wasting billions



of dollars on a system that won't work, won't address the most



likely threats, and whose only success will be to provoke a new



arms race."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peace Action's 50-foot mock nuclear missile drives this point



home with its 35-foot banner reading, "Here We Go Again! More



Nukes, More Star Wars, More $$ Wasted." The mock missile is part of



a nationwide missile stop tour designed to raise opposition to



missile defense.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peace Action expects a tough fight on Star Wars as corporate



lobbyists pour millions of dollars into campaign coffers. William



Hartung of the World Policy Institute will speak to this issue



based on his new report, Tangled Web: The Marketing of Missile



Defense 1994-2000. "President Clinton and the congressional



Republicans are playing politics with missile defense, and Boeing



and Lockheed Martin are laughing all the way to the bank," said Mr.



Hartung.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Representatives speaking Tuesday, who have been outspoken in



the need to cut wasteful Pentagon spending and redirect it to human



needs, will point out that while contractors enjoy a windfall from



Star Wars, funding for community needs continues to be cut.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

<i>Peace Acton is the nation's largest grassroots peace and justice



organization with 70,000 members and 27 state affiliates. Peace



Action is devoted to stopping Star Wars as part of its nuclear



abolition campaign.</i></font>
