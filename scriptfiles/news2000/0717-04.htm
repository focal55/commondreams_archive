- July 17 - The Center for Economic and Policy Research

    (CEPR) today released a new study which constructed projections for the administrative

    costs that workers would incur under the individual savings accounts proposed by Governor

    Bush and Vice-President Gore. The study found that both plans would lead to substantial

    administrative costs, which will be a large source of income to the financial industry. </font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study projected that the administrative costs of the accounts proposed by Governor

    Bush will be between $250 and $360 billion over the plan's first twenty years. The cost

    for the first forty years will be between $1.2 and $1.8 trillion. These costs are entirely

    a net addition to the cost of administering the Social Security program at present, since

    the creation of the new accounts will not lead to any savings in the cost of administering

    the existing program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study projected that the administrative costs of the supplemental savings accounts

    proposed by Vice-President Gore will be between $390 and $560 billion over the first

    twenty years. Over a forty year period the administrative costs will be between $1.7 and

    $2.4 trillion. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the purpose of the accounts proposed by Vice-President Gore is to provide a

    voluntary second tier of savings, in addition to the guaranteed benefit provided by Social

    Security, some additional administrative costs must incurred. The study compares the

    projected cost of the decentralized system proposed the Vice-President with estimates of

    the cost of a centralized system of accounts, such as the Universal Savings Accounts

    proposed last year by President Clinton. The study projects that the unnecessary costs

    associated with the Gore proposal -- the difference between the cost of a decentralized

    system and a centralized system -- will be between $215 and $380 billion over twenty

    years. Over a forty year period the unnecessary costs would be between $850 and $1140

    billion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study was done by Dean Baker, co-director of CEPR. Dr. Baker is co-author (with

    Mark Weisbrot) of <i>Social Security: The Phony Crisis</i> (University of Chicago Press,

    2000).</font>
