- April 12 - The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), the nation's largest non-profit animal

protection organization with over seven million members and constituents, applauded the decision announced late yesterday

by U.S. Federal District Court Judge Thelton Henderson in San Francisco that overturned a decision by Commerce Secretary

William Daley that would have allowed tuna caught by methods that harass, injure and potentially kill dolphins to be sold

in the United States and labeled as "dolphin safe."

<br>

<br>

        The case was brought by The HSUS, Earth Island Institute, environmental activist David Brower, and other

environmental organizations. Regulations changing the dolphin-safe label were set to go into effect on April 11.

<br>

<br>

        "Secretary Daley flouted a law that was the result of a compromise between those who wanted to open U.S. markets to

dolphin-deadly tuna and dolphin protection advocates. The law relied on the secretary to make an objective decision based

on the best available scientific evidence," said Patricia Forkan, HSUS executive vice president. "We're pleased that the

court agreed that Secretary Daley did not live up to his end of the bargain."

<br>

<br>

        In announcing his decision, Henderson stated,"...the Secretary acted contrary to the law and abused his discretion

when he triggered a change in the dolphin safe label standard on the ground that he lacked sufficient evidence of

significant adverse impacts."

<br>

<br>

        "The decision gives consumers the choice to buy truly dolphin safe tuna," said Josh Floum, a partner in the

Emeryville, Calif. law firm, Legal Strategies Group. "It is time that we developed a new relationship with dolphin

species," added Floum, who has spearheaded for more than 10 years landmark litigation to protect dolphins on behalf of

Earth Island and other groups. "We need to move from exploitation to cooperation."

<br>

<br>

        The groups argued that Daley violated several U.S. laws that protect dolphins and consumers when he decided in

April 1999 that the intentional chasing, harassing and netting of dolphins in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean does not

adversely impact depleted dolphin populations in the fishery.

<br>

<br>

        Congress, at the behest of the Clinton Administration and lobbyists for Mexico, set up the showdown between Daley

and dolphin advocates when in 1997 they passed the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act. That law weakened

provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which banned U.S. tuna fishers from encircling dolphins; the Dolphin

Protection Consumer Information Act, which set up a system for labeling tuna as "dolphin safe;" and other laws regulating

tuna imports. 

<br>

<br>

        The 1997 law cleared the way for foreign tuna companies that catch tuna by setting nets on dolphins to import the

tuna to the U.S. and label it as "dolphin safe" as long as observers on tuna boats do not witness any dead or seriously

injured dolphins. Dolphin advocates succeeded in including a provision that required the Secretary of Commerce to find that

the intentional chase, harassment, and netting of dolphins in purse seine nets does not adversely impact depleted dolphin

populations in the ETP before the provisions of the law, including changing the *dolphin safe* label, could be implemented.

<br>

<br>

        On April 29, 1999, Secretary Daley issued a preliminary finding stating that researchers could not determine with

certainty that the intentional chasing and encircling of dolphins was having a "significant adverse impact" on depleted

dolphin populations. Daley issued the finding even though the agency's own scientists found evidence that some already

depleted dolphin populations are not recovering at the expected rate and may even be declining in the Eastern Tropical

Pacific Ocean. The HSUS, Earth Island Institute and the other plaintiffs argued that Congress did not require certainty in

the scientific evidence gathered by international and U.S. scientists. Indeed, certainty is an unreasonable standard given

the limits of most research, and especially when it is conducted in an environment as remote as the open ocean. The

plaintiffs argued that the evidence is overwhelming that dolphin populations are not recovering because of the methods used

by tuna fishers, which should have led Daley to deny the change in the label.
