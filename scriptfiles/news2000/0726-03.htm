- July 26 - The House passed the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources

Emergency Act by voice vote early today in support of its five-year

reauthorization. The Human Rights Campaign lauded House lawmakers for the

move and urged the House and Senate to move steadily toward reconciling

their differences on the legislation before it reaches President Clinton's

desk for approval.

        <p>"We are pleased by the efforts in the House and are looking forward

to working with Congress and the Administration to win final approval for

this key legislation before the 106th Congress adjourns," said HRC Political

Director Winnie Stachelberg.

        <p>Reps. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Henry Waxman, D-Calif., introduced

the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 on July 13. After holding a

hearing on the legislation, the House Commerce Committee moved swiftly to

consider the bill and recommended its passage. Among other provisions, the

legislation reauthorizes the CARE Act for five more years and retains its

multi-title structure, allowing resources to be targeted to those areas

hardest hit by the epidemic.

        <p>The House action follows a Senate vote, on June 6, for a five-year

reauthorization of the measure. Sens. James Jeffords, R-Vt., and Edward M.

Kennedy, D-Mass., introduced the reauthorization March 28 in that chamber.

        <p>The CARE Act, the largest discretionary federal investment in the

care and treatment of people living with HIV/AIDS, provides care and

treatment to individuals and their families impacted by HIV/AIDS. It

supports a wide range of community-based services, including primary home

health care, case management, substance abuse treatment and mental health

services, and nutritional and housing services. It also supports the AIDS

Drug Assistance Program, which has provided drug therapies to uninsured and

underinsured people with HIV/AIDS, thereby lowering the HIV/AIDS death rate

to its lowest point in nearly a decade.

        

<p><i>HRC is the largest national lesbian and gay political organization

with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress,

provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that lesbian and

gay Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the

community.</i>
