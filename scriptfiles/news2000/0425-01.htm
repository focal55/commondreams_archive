- April 25 - In a new report issued today



on Nike's Asian manufacturing practices, a coalition of labor,



student, and human rights groups demonstrates that while Nike has



stated that they have improved their labor practices, the truth is



that sweatshop factories still produce Nike goods.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, "Sweatshops Behind the Swoosh," compiles for the first



time detailed Nike manufacturing information from three Asian



countries and shows that "Nike remains a sweatshop producer on a



global scale." In fact, according to the report -- which is being



released today at a demonstration in front of New York's Niketown --



some of the information directly contradicts Nike's own code of



conduct.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report makes it clear that Nike is making China the country of



choice for its global sweatshop strategy, recently having moved



40 percent of its contracting work there. It has also become evident



that exploitation of Chinese workers is clearly a profitable business



proposition for the company. In fact, the average Nike worker appears



to be worse off than typical Chinese apparel workers (based on Nike



and DOL numbers).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is estimated that Nike workers in China receive at most $1.50



for every pair of Nike shoes, which retail typically for $80-$120.



Nike could easily afford to double or triple what it pays its Chinese



workforce. Instead, Nike supports Permanent Normal Trade Relations



with China, which would permanently set the rules of trade in a



manner that would allow Nike to continue to build its sweatshop



headquarters in China.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Five Nike executives (including the wife of one executive) have



contributed to Congressman David Dreier's American Success PAC.



Dreier is the Republican whip behind giving China Permanent Normal



Trade Relations.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also demonstrates that Nike's efforts in this regard



are not limited to China. For example, while Nike has bragged about



wage increases at its Indonesia footwear plants, the facts make it



clear that these claims are wildly misleading. Workers' real



inflation-adjusted wages have actually fallen at these plants, due

to



the Asian financial crisis. The "increases" touted by Nike did not



keep up with the deterioration of the Indonesian currency and rapidly



rising costs for basic products such as food and clothing.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report is being issued in New York City this afternoon at a



4:30 p.m. rally in front of the flagship Niketown Store on 57th



Street between 5th and Madison Avenues in Manhattan. In addition to



UNITE (Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees),



groups endorsing the report are Global Exchange, National Labor



Committee, People of Faith Network, Press for Change, Resource Center



of the Americas, and United Students Against Sweatshops.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coalition's white paper states: "The deplorable conditions in



Nike factories are Nike's fault. In a global economy with no rules



that protect workers, it is companies such as Nike who direct the



global sweatshop in industries such as clothing and footwear. To



rescue its brand image, Nike must turn from public relations to



paying a living wage, providing humane working conditions, and



respecting the right of workers to organize. And to stop the



sweatshop system of global trade, we all need to demand that workers'



rights be linked to the trading rights that are the lifeblood for



companies like Phil Knight's Nike."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Findings

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report brings together three accounts of working conditions at



Nike production facilities in Indonesia, China and other locations

in



Asia. Among its findings are:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- A recent survey of 3,500 workers producing for Nike in



Indonesia finds serious labor abuses, including low wages, abusive



treatment, and excessive work hours. 57 percent of Nike athletic shoe



workers and 59 percent of Nike clothing workers reported that they



had seen workers being shouted at or subjected to cruel treatment by



their supervisors. Examples of abuse that workers cited included wage



deductions, having their ears pulled, being pinched or slapped, being



forced to run around the factory or having to stand for hours in



factory yards (known as "being dried in the sun"). Workers' most



common complaint was being forced to work excessive overtime -- more



than 72 hours per week during peak periods. Nike's code of conduct



calls for working hours to be limited to 60 hours. The vast majority



of Nike shoe workers interviewed told surveyors their basic wages at



the time of the survey were between $33 U.S. (Rp 251,000) and $39



U.S. (Rp 300,000) per month -- which comes to about 16-19 cents an



hour. This wage does not even come close to covering the costs of a



family's basic human needs. Nike apparel workers in Indonesia earn



even less than Nike footwear workers. The survey found that 31



percent of the 1,200 Nike apparel workers interviewed earned less



than the equivalent of $33 U.S. dollars per month (Rp 250,000). That



is 25 percent percent less than what even Nike says is that it takes



to meet one person's minimum physical needs, without taking into



consideration providing for family members or savings.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Reports based on interviews with Nike workers in China reveal



inhumane working hours including 12-hour days and 7-day weeks, low



wages, illegal deductions, and use of the notorious dormitory system.



About 50 Nike footwear and apparel factories in China employ over



111,000 workers. A new set of reports based on recent investigations



documents that Nike workers in China continue to suffer deplorable



conditions. In December, 1999 and March, 2000, the Hong Kong



Christian Industrial Committee (HKCIC) interviewed workers at



factories producing for Nike in China's Guangdong province. Their



reports show that workers who make Nike products endure abusive and



often illegal conditions (please note, the spellings are from the



HKCIC). Workers report that they are required to work 12 1/2 hour



days and seven day work-weeks, with one day off per month at one Nike



contractor (Hung Wah/Hung Yip garment factory). At another factory



(Wei Li Textile) some workers report working 12 hour days. A worker



at the Qingdau Sewon Shoes Company told the HKCIC that she must work



overtime everyday, sometimes until 2-3 a.m. Not only are these



conditions extreme and inhumane, they also clearly violate Chinese



law where the legal limit is a 40 hour week plus overtime that must



average less than 9 hours (36 hours/ month). Nike's code of conduct



limits the workweek to 60 hours.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nike advertises with apparent pride that many of its workers are



housed in dormitories on factory premises. But the workers in most



Nike plants are trapped in the dormitory system. Low wages force



workers, most of whom have migrated from distant rural provinces, to



live in dorms where they live 8- 12 people to a room. Workers live



within the grounds of the factory, with severe limitations on their



freedoms. At two factories, management withholds one month's wages,



making it difficult for workers to quit without management's



permission if they hope to receive their back pay. In one Nike



contractor factory, workers live 12 to a room, and share three



toilets for 36 women. Workers pay 35 RMB a month for the privilege

of



living in this dorm.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nike's Code of Conduct states that the Company will not



countenance discrimination in hiring based on gender, marital status,



or age, among other worker characteristics. However, a recruitment



advertisement for the factory found by HKCIC investigators advised



potential applicants of the following "requirements": "Gender: female



only; Age: 17-21; Marital status: management requires applicants to



present a 'single certificate' certifying workers' single marital



status."
