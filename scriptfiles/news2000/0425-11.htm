- April 25 - Led by Doris Haddock ("Granny D") and the revered environmental writer 

Bill McKibben, the 32-member John Muir Democracy Brigade, a merger of 

campaign-finance and environmental activists, sallied forth in the Rotunda of 

the national Capitol on Friday, April 21, with banners and speeches for an 

end to the endangerment of the earth by oil, coal, and nuclear industries.  

All 32, including Granny D, McKibben, and leaders of various organizations, 

were arrested by the Capitol police for "demonstrating" in the Capitol 

contrary to a federal law which carries a maximum six-month jail term.

    <p>"We no longer have proper representation," Ms. Haddock, the 90-year-old 

woman who walked across the continent for campaign finance reform, told a 

press conference on the Senate lawn before she led the group into the 

Rotunda. "Our elected leaders are consumed by the need to raise election 

funds from special interests, and they no longer are able to represent the 

needs of the people or of our ravaged earth.

    <p>"We must declare our independence from the corrupting bonds of big 

money," she continued.  "Our right to alter our government must be used to 

sweep these halls clean of greedy interests so that people may use this 

government in service to each other's needs and the protect the condition of 

our earth."

    <p>This was the fourth Democracy Brigade action, and the largest, since last 

Oct. 26th. The demonstrators carried enormous banners proclaiming that 

"Campaign Finance Corruption Leads to Environmental Destruction," "When 

Democracy Is For Sale So Is the Environment,"  and "Clean Elections Equal 

Clean Environment," and demanding:  "Stop Global Warming--Ban Campaign 

Contributions from Global Warmers."  The Brigades, a project of the Alliance 

for Democracy, are demonstrating on behalf of full public funding for public 

elections.  They aim to obtain official congressional hearings on that 

proposal by the spring of next year.

    <p>McKibben, the author of THE END OF NATURE, said that there is now a 

"strong consensus" in the scientific community that global warming is 

dangerous and that even some large companies, such as British Petroleum and 

Shell, have joined in the concern.  "The only people that seem not to get it 

work in that building behind us," which "may have something to do with the 

millions and millions of dollars that flow in to that building from the 

interests that do not want to change the status quo," McKibben said.

    <p>Referring to Granny D's walk, McKibben said, "When I'm 90 I plan to  walk 

across the country, and hopefully it will still be as sweet and lovely a 

country as it is now."

    <p>John Passacantando, executive director of Ozone Action, declared that 

"this type of peaceful civil disobedience is the new face of democracy.  It's 

not just about voting any more because in some way that has been stolen from 

us by what's going on in this building behind us....It has ceased to be the 

people's house."

    <p>At some point, said Randy Hayes, president of the Rainforest Action 

Network, democracy "becomes a democracy theme park," in which the two major 

parties represent "a distinction without a difference" and jeopardize "the 

earth itself."  Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass 

Energy Project, told the press conference:  "The Democracy Brigade is here 

today to demonstrate that people will not stand for this type of legalized 

bribery any longer."

    <p>Representing the principal sponsor of the event, the Alliance for 

Democracy, Ronnie Dugger said, "We are a part of a general nonviolent 

uprising of the people against the sale of our government to the highest 

bidder."  Congress and the White House, by "risking the killing of this green 

and pleasant earth and all that lives on it" to rake in campaign 

contributions, are committing "a crime so vast it has no name," Dugger also 

said.

    <p>The speakers and allied activists then followed Granny D into the Capitol 

Rotunda and  spoke out in six separate groups, which the Capitol police 

arrested one at a time.  McKibben was arrested with the first group and Ms. 

Haddock with the third.  Ms. Haddock was reading a passage from the 

Declaration of Independence when she was arrested and handcuffed.  The 

demonstrators, including all the speakers at the press conference, were 

photographed and their thumbprints taken, and they were ordered to appear in 

District of Columbia court on May 24th to answer the charges against them.

        <p>The press conference and Rotunda speak-out were carried at length on 

C-Span and were featured news on NPR's "All Things Considered."  Ms. 

Haddock's arrest was the subject of an AP story and a feature article in Roll 

Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper.

    

<p>The Rotunda actions will continue throughout the year 2000.  Those who 

wish to participate in the next action may contact Randy Kehler at telephone 

413-624-3836, or by email at randyk@javanet.com.  Further information may be
