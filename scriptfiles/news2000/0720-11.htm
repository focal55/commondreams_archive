- July 20 -  On the eve of the official opening of Group of Eight

Summit in Japan, U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone, a member of the Foreign Relations

Committee, urged President Clinton  today to use the opportunity to raise

concerns with the actions of the Russian Government in Chechnya.  While

Wellstone expressed disappointment that the Group of Eight did not include the

situation in Chechnya on its formal agenda, he called on the President to

communicate the serious concerns of many in Congress about Russia’s conduct in

Chechnya, and to take concrete action to demonstrate U.S. concern during

bilateral talks with President Putin.  



<p>“By not taking concrete steps during this Summit to demonstrate to the Russian

Federation that its conduct is unacceptable for a democratic nation, is to

condone it. I fear we have already given human rights a back seat to economic

issues by not placing Russian conduct in Chechnya on the formal agenda of the

G-8 Summit. I hope that will not be the outcome of our bilateral talks with

Russia,” Wellstone said.



<p>Wellstone also said Clinton should demand that the Russian Federation push for a

negotiated, just settlement to the conflict. He pointed out that the conflict

will not be resolved by military means, and said the Russian Federation should

initiate immediately a political dialogue with a cross-section of

representatives of the Chechen people, including representatives of the

democratically elected Chechen authorities. The United States should remind the

Russian Federation of the requests of the Council of Europe for an immediate

cease-fire and initiation of political dialogue, and of Russia’s obligation to

that institution and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. 



<p>“Let’s remember, what was the Group of Seven, and became the G-8 with the

inclusion of the Russian Federation, is an association of democratic societies

with advanced economies. Although Russia is not yet a liberal democracy or an

advanced economy, it was invited to take part in this group to encourage its

democratic evolution. Today as I watch Russia refuse to initiate a political

dialogue with the Chechen people, and continue to deny international

humanitarian aid organizations and international human rights monitors access to

Chechnya, I must question that evolution,” Wellstone said.



<p>The war in Chechnya from 1994-1996 left over 80,000 civilians dead, and the

Senate Foreign Relations Committee has received credible evidence that the

current war has again resulted in the death of thousands of innocent civilians

and the displacement of well over 250,000 others.
