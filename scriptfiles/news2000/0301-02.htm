- March 1 - The following was released



today by Greenpeace:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A group of "polar bears" (Greenpeace activists) have established



a protest camp at BP Amoco headquarters to highlight concerns



about the company's role in the global warming that is destroying



polar bear habitat.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new camp rose two days after Greenpeace established Ice Camp



Sirius on the frozen Arctic Ocean near the site where BP Amoco



intends to build its controversial Northstar offshore oil facility.



If allowed to proceed, the Northstar project will open a new



frontier for oil, the burning of which is the primary cause of



global warming.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By setting up camp at company headquarters, Greenpeace is



confronting BP Amoco executives with the impact of their actions,"



said Greenpeace climate specialist Iain MacGill. "If they don't



stop drilling for and burning new sources of oil, global warming



will become much worse." Already, global warming is having a



profound effect on the polar regions. "Polar bear populations are



already under severe stress because their hunting grounds are



literally melting away," continued MacGill.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both the Alaska and Chicago Greenpeace camps are powered by wind



and solar energy sources-an overt challenge to BP Amoco to make



good on its claim that it will push ahead with solar power. From



their camp near the Northstar site, Greenpeace activists will keep



close watch on Northstar activities. The facility calls for a



dangerous, untested sub-sea pipeline that exposes the fragile



Arctic environment to a one-in-four chance of a major oil spill.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Greenpeace is challenging BP Amoco's claim that it's concerned



about the fragile Arctic ecosystem and global warming," added



MacGill. "Proof of that concern would be pulling out of Northstar



and putting the company on a pathway to solar power."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace also will use the two camps as platforms to gather



support for a BP Amoco shareholder resolution that calls on the



company to pull out of Northstar and reinvest the savings in its



solar division. The resolution will be voted on at the company's



upcoming annual general meeting April 13.</font>
