-  

February 8 - Defenders of Wildlife,



Earth Island Institute and others today filed a lawsuit against



the Clinton Administration for what they call its refusal to



abide by U.S. law on dolphin conservation in its "zest to please



foreign trading partners." The case was filed in the U.S. Court



of International Trade.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lawsuit targets the Commerce Department's Final Rule



implementing the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act



(IDCPA). The conservationists assert that the rule ignores the clear



requirements of the IDCPA, which Congress passed in 1997 to specify



procedures for catching and importing tuna that is caught by



encircling schools of dolphins swimming above the tuna. The IDCPA



also mandates strict conditions for lifting embargoes on tuna from



Mexico, Venezuela and other countries that previously refused to



adopt dolphin protection programs comparable to that of the United



States. These embargoes were put in place ten years ago in response



to consumer demand for clamping down on encirclement of dolphins with



tuna nets, a fishing method that has resulted in the deaths of more



than 7 million dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP)



over the past four decades.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today's legal action to protect dolphins is also about



defending the American consumer who wants to be sure that no dolphins



have been killed or injured in order to supply the can of tuna bought



in the local grocery store. The Commerce Department's program



changes provide little if any assurance of dolphin safety. The final



rule reflects a zest to please foreign trading partners, particularly



Mexico, who export tuna to the United States, rather than a desire

to



protect dolphins or consumers," said Defenders President Rodger



Schlickeisen.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The IDCPA amended the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972



(MMPA) to implement an international agreement governing tuna fishing



practices on dolphins in the ETP. Enactment of the MMPA and its



amendments have contributed to significant reductions in dolphin



mortality by U.S. tuna fishermen. However, despite clear



requirements in the MMPA, the agencies have failed to implement



adequate systems for ensuring the separation and tracking of imported



dolphin-safe and unsafe tuna, failed to provide incentives for vessel



captains to reduce tuna-related dolphin deaths, failed to set annual



targets for reducing dolphin mortality, and failed to conduct



important dolphin research.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The MMPA also requires the U.S. market to remain closed to



foreign tuna until nations clearly demonstrate that they are meeting



the obligations of the international agreement. Despite the failure



of nations such as Mexico to meet their financial and dolphin



protection obligations of the program, the embargoes against dolphin



unsafe tuna could be lifted very soon.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We will demonstrate that the Clinton Administration has



blatantly violated the Marine Mammal Protection Act's dolphin-safe



tuna requirements. The root cause of this program failure is trade



politics and foreign pressure," stated William J. Snape, III,



Defenders Vice President for Law, who is litigating this case.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other plaintiffs in the lawsuit include biologist Samuel



LaBudde, whose undercover videotape of dolphins dying in tuna nets



helped lead to the successful federal "dolphin safe" tuna program,



and Environmental Solutions International (ESI). ESI's Christopher Croft, after serving as a government observer for dolphin protection



on tuna boats, worked for Defenders of Wildlife to help lead the



coalition that passed legislation setting up the dolphin-safe label.



Environmental activist leader David Brower, the Humane Society of the



United States, American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to



Animals, Earthtrust, Greenpeace Foundation, American Humane



Association, Animal Welfare Institute, International Wildlife



Coalition, Animal Fund and Craig Van Note are also plaintiffs. This



lawsuit joins another filed last summer by these and other groups for



the Administration's arbitrary and capricious decision to weaken the



meaning of the dolphin-safe label found on tuna cans, ignoring



scientific information supplied by the government's own researchers.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration has been negotiating the lifting of the tuna



embargoes with Mexico and other nations since the mid 1990s, when



U.S. MMPA dolphin provisions were ruled illegal by a dispute body of



the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, the predecessor to



the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 1997, the Endangered Species



Act (ESA) became the second U.S. environmental law ruled by the WTO



to be inconsistent with international trade rules. That ruling has



led to a weakening of protections afforded to endangered sea turtles



caught in foreign shrimp nets.</font>
