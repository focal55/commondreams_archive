- February 24 - The following was



released today by Friends of the Earth:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gore's Environmentalism For Sale?

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 1992 promise by Vice-President Gore to ensure "no net loss"



of U.S. wetlands was broken last spring when the White House



endorsed a draft state-federal plan that would permit the



destruction of 500 acres of New Jersey wetlands and allow the



construction of a shopping mall by the Mills Corporation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Feb. 28 issue of The American Prospect,



the proposed shopping mall project "would not only decimate a



recovering wildlife refuge, but also mar the region's human landscape



by creating traffic jams and urban sprawl." Plans to develop the



Meadowlands have been denounced for over 10 years by



environmentalists and more than 1000 New Jersey residents.



According to the Friends of the Earth Political Action Committee,



this revelation is especially disturbing in the wake of a $43,000



contribution to the Gore 2000 campaign by executives, contractors and



family members of the Mills Corporation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Real convictions should not be set aside for campaign



contributors," said Friends of the Earth PAC president, Brent



Blackwelder. "Al Gore is allowing the public to conclude that his



environmentalism has a price tag on it."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blackwelder also expressed concern that today's endorsement of



Gore by the New York League of Conservation Voters and an earlier



endorsement by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. -- who is an outspoken



critic of the proposed Meadowlands project is turning a blind



eye to the Mills Corporation deal. The American Prospect quoted



Kennedy as saying, "It is disappointing to see Al Gore succumb



to this kind of mercenary approach."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Despite promises to the contrary, the Clinton-Gore administration



has allowed nearly every harmful wetland decision remaining from the



Reagan/Bush era to remain in place," said Blackwelder, citing more



than a dozen examples of unsound wetland decisions. "Is this what we



can expect from Al Gore in the future? The answer, unfortunately,



appears to be 'yes.'"
