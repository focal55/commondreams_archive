- May 18 - The <a href="http://www.ginetworks.com/~alans/njc.htm">National

Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals</a> has joined a nationwide fight to stop <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/rad-food/radfoodindex.htm">food irradiation</a>,

bringing the strength of its 7,500 members to the campaign.</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Council, which is affiliated with the American Federation of Government Employees

(AFGE, in turn affiliated with the AFL-CIO), represents federal food inspectors throughout

the country. The council joined out of concern that changes in the meat inspection process

are making for a dirty meat<b> </b>supply and thus endangering consumers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those changes include a move to allow the meat industry to police itself &#150; rather

than relying primarily on federal inspectors &#150; and to use food irradiation to replace

inspectors. The industry is poised to rake in greater corporate profits by speeding up its

slaughter and processing lines, irradiating meat, then passing the increased costs on to

consumers by selling them so-called premium meat at higher prices. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The meat industry wants to use irradiation as an excuse to push inspectors out of

their facilities,&quot; said Arthur Hughes, vice chairman, National Joint Council of Food

Inspection Locals, AFGE. &quot;Irradiating meat is the meat industry's answer to filthy

meat processing practices that leave meat contaminated with feces, urine and pus.

Consumers will be the losers, because no one will be around to ensure the food supply is

safe.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Council joins <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/">Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy and

Environment Program</a> and the <a href="http://www.whistleblower.org/">Government

Accountability Project</a>, which are leading a campaign on behalf of more than 170 state

and national organizations to reverse the federal government&#146;s decision to permit

food irradiation. The food inspectors will help educate consumers about the perils of food

irradiation and will lobby the government to curb the use of irradiation. Members of the

coalition &#150; which includes the Center for Food Safety, the Campaign for Biodemocracy,

Friends of the Earth, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, the Nuclear

Information and Resource Service, and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine

&#150; worry that food irradiation isn&#146;t safe.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Food irradiation is a process in which food is exposed to high levels of radiation to

kill bacteria and extend shelf life. Although the meat industry claims that irradiation

will make food safer, the health impacts of eating irradiated food are uncertain. New

chemicals called unique radiolytic products are created in the irradiation process. No

testing has been done to identify these chemicals, much less to determine if they are safe

for human consumption. Evidence indicates that chromosomal damage (among other problems)

could occur as the result of consuming irradiated food. Further, meat that is treated

using irradiation often gives off a very strange odor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;No long-term studies have been done to determine the health effects of eating

irradiated food. Food irradiation has not been proven safe,&quot; said Wenonah Hauter,

director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program. &quot;The body

of research on irradiated food has yielded conflicting results.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Taking on powerful government agencies and big corporate special interests to

protect American consumers is an enormous undertaking,&quot; said Felicia Nestor, director

of the Government Accountability Project's food safety program. &quot;The involvement of

the Food Inspectors Union will make a significant contribution to protecting

consumers.&quot; </font>
