- October 3 - The number of critically endangered freshwater turtle species has more than doubled in just the last four years, according to a report released today by TRAFFIC, World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), and other conservation groups. With three-fourths of Asia's freshwater turtles now listed as threatened, and over half considered endangered, scientists and conservationists are calling for far more effective measures to protect these animals, which are heavily exploited in the region primarily for food and traditional medicine.

According to TRAFFIC North America Senior Program Officer Craig Hoover, softshell turtles are especially popular as a luxury food, fetching prices which may be six times the price of lamb or chicken. "In addition, turtle shell is traded to supply the traditional Chinese medicine industry, which uses it in a variety of applications. The turtle jelly made from the shell is claimed to have cancer-curing properties, and is consumed as a general health tonic. Imports of turtle shells into Taiwan alone comprise on average over 30 metric tons per year, and the total trade may add up to several times this amount."

The report, consisting of proceedings from the Workshop on Trade in Tortoises and Freshwater Turtles in Asia, held last year in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, documents the threats facing these species and recommends actions to address the growing crisis. Organized by TRAFFIC, WCS and WWF, the workshop, brought together over 40 regional turtle experts from 16 countries, primarily within East, South and Southeast Asia. TRAFFIC is the wildlife trade monitoring program of WWF and the World Conservation Union (IUCN).

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These findings clearly show that not enough is being done to prevent Asia's freshwater turtles from literally being eaten out of existence," said Dr. Joshua Ginsberg, WCS director for Asia Programs. "Turtles have been protected from their enemies for millennia by their hard shells - but these are hard times for animals with hard shells as they are not impervious to the butcher's knives."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Of the 90 species of Asian freshwater turtles and tortoises, 74 percent are considered threatened, according to the IUCN/Species Survival Commission Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group, as well as the Asian Turtle Trade Working Group. Over half of Asian freshwater turtle and tortoise species are endangered, including 18 critically endangered species, and one that is already extinct: the Yunnan box turtle Cuora yunnanensis.  According to scientists, this animal probably vanished decades ago but has only now been formally declared extinct.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The workshop participants urged that all currently recognized turtle species native to Asia be listed in Appendix II of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) and that some species be transferred to 

Appendix I of CITES, which would prohibit all international trade in the species.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

A proposal to regulate the trade in all nine species of Asian box turtles under Appendix II of CITES was adopted at the recent meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES, held last April.  An Appendix II listing of a species requires that international trade be regulated through a system of permits.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, a resolution was adopted recognizing that an increasing number of freshwater turtle and tortoise species are threatened by trade, especially in Asia. The resolution called for increased efforts to work cooperatively to control illegal trade and take steps to ensure the trade is sustainable. The resolution also called on the CITES Secretariat to host a workshop to further explore the threats posed by trade and work towards solutions that ensure the conservation of the species.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The World Conservation Union Red List of Threatened Species released last week listed 24 turtle species worldwide as critically endangered, compared to 10 species in the last assessment in 1996. "With the number of critically endangered species more than doubling in just the last four years, it is evident that the situation is deteriorating rapidly," Hoover said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The workshop and proceedings: present information on the status of more than 80 individual species at national levels; map trade routes and types of demand; analyze legislative and enforcement frameworks protecting turtles; and assess national and regional threats to turtle populations posed by the trade. Among the recommendations found in the proceedings is a thorough review and improvement of national legislation for effective protection of turtles in the region as well as for prompt enforcement of all local, state and national regulations and legislation concerning the conservation of turtles.  The participants also urged that more research be done on the trade and greater public awareness efforts be made to highlight the threats facing these species.
