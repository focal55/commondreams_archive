- July 20 - Organizers of the Association of

State Green Parties (ASGP), which organized the Green

Party National Nominating Convention in Denver,

Colorado on June 24 and 25, have posted the platform

adopted at the convention at <a href="http://www.gp.org">http://www.gp.org</a>.



<p>This is the platform for which the state Green Parties

voted at the convention, and is the sole platform on

which Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke are running for

President and Vice President, respectively.  



<p>The ASGP/convention platform should not be confused

with the platform of the Greens/Green Party USA

(GPUSA), which represents an activist contingent

within the larger Green movement in the United States.

 Some state Green Parties hold affiliations with both

ASGP and GPUSA, but the GPUSA platform has no formal

connection with ASGP, the Denver convention, or the

Nader campaign.  The GPUSA platform was incorrectly

associated with the Nader campaign and, by inference,

with ASGP by a caller to National Public Radio's "Talk

of the Nation" and in a recent column by Jonathan

Chait in The New Republic (July 10 & 17, 2000).



<p>The Green Party platform directly opposes major

policies of the Democratic Party platform adopted on

July 7, on which Al Gore has based his campaign and

the Republican Party platform of George W. Bush.  



<p>Mr. Nader said in his speech to the NAACP last week,

"The Green Party Platform hands down is the most

thorough, justice-saturated platform of any political

party platform of the day. Reminds me of some of the

great platforms of many decades ago when parties -- at

least one -- stood tall for the working people of this

country."



<p>The 2000 Democratic platform would gut the social

safety net, especially New Deal and Great Society

efforts over the past seven decades to improve the

lives of working and poor Americans, in favor of debt

reduction, and endorses the authority of international

free trade cabals to override national and local

labor, environmental, and human rights protections.  



<p>The Democratic platform converges with Republican

policy in favoring aggressive military intervention

and increased military spending, policies that Greens

see as a betrayal of the promised post-Cold-War peace

dividend, for the profit of defense contractors.  



<p>Greens have protested all such policies, and the Green

platform demands national health insurance, livable

wage and collective bargaining guarantees, increased

environmental and human rights protections, massive

cuts in defense spending, and the end of free trade

cabals.
