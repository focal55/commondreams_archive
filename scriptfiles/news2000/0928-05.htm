- September 28 - Feminist Majority



Foundation President Eleanor Smeal called today's FDA approval



of mifepristone, formerly known as RU 486, by the U.S. Food and



Drug Administration "a total victory for the U.S. women. At



long last, science trumps anti-abortion politics and medical



McCarthyism. If this medication was primarily for men, the



French developers would already have received a Nobel Prize in



medicine."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Smeal continued, "Mifepristone will reframe the abortion



debate by providing more and earlier access. By increasing the



number and geographic spread of abortion availability,



mifepristone will lead to a decrease in clinic violence and an



increase in women's privacy."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"FDA approval of this medical breakthrough also means that



long-stalled and desperately-needed trials on mifepristone's



other uses such as treating uterine fibroid tumors, ovarian



cancer, endometriosis, meningioma (brain tumors), and some types



of breast cancer and other serious diseases and conditions that



mostly afflict women can finally move forward. We call upon NIH



to devote funding for these trials to help make up for the many



years of research time that has been lost to anti-abortion



politics," added Smeal.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In December of 1998, the Feminist Majority Foundation became



the sole provider of mifepristone for compassionate use patients



in the U.S. Physicians are able to obtain "compassionate use"



FDA permission for treating patients who have exhausted other



treatment options for critically ill patients with serious



diseases such as meningiomas, endometrial cancer, Cushing's



Syndrome, and breast cancer which show some clinical response to



mifepristone. The Foundation currently is supplying medication



for 40 patients.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Feminist Majority Foundation has led the 12-year campaign



to make mifepristone available in the U.S. The Feminist Majority



Foundation in July 1990 led the first-ever U.S. delegation to



meet with then Roussel Uclaf CEO Dr. Edouard Sakiz. The



Feminist Majority Foundation delivered more than 700,000



petitions to Roussel Uclaf and Hoechst AG urging release of the



compound and won support for mifepristone from almost every



major U.S. women's rights organization and medical and



scientific association. The decision of Roussel Uclaf to



transfer mifepristone patent rights to a U.S. organization has



in significant part been credited to the Feminist Majority



Foundation's mobilization of support for the medication.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mifepristone is now available in the United Kingdom, Sweden,



Norway, Germany, Switzerland, Russia, Israel, China, and a



growing list of countries. More than 10 million women have used



the medication as a safe, effective method of early abortion.

</font>
