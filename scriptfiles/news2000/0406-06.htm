- April 6 - Despite a certain veto expected from President Clinton,

     Big Oil's Senate allies have advanced a backdoor attempt to exploit

     the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and

     gas development.  A majority of Senators has threatened a treasured

     American landscape, home to grizzly and polar bear, wolves, migratory

     birds and caribou.



     <p>By the narrow margin of 51-49, the Senate tabled an amendment by

     Senator William Roth (R-DE) and Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) to strip

     out a provision in the FY 2001 Budget Resolution that assumed $1.2

     billion in anticipated revenue from the from as yet unauthorized oil

     drilling in the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge.



     <p>"Drilling the Refuge would be as shortsighted as damming the Grand

     Canyon for hydroelectric power or tapping Old Faithful for geothermal

     energy," said Sierra Club Legislative Director Debbie Sease.  "Last

     month President Clinton said he would reject `drilling in the

     protected and treasured natural habitats of Alaska.'  We hope he will

     follow through on that promise and veto any budget that contains

     Arctic drilling money.  Rest assured we will continue to vigorously

     defend this American treasure."



     <p>The coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge is the last sliver (5 percent)

     of Alaska's North Slope not currently available for oil and gas

     development.  It is currently off-limits to oil and gas development.

     But drilling advocates, led by Senator Frank Murkowski (R-AK) are

     using backdoor methods and red herrings like high gas prices to pass

     legislation to exploit the Refuge.  Their latest avenue of attack is

     to include revenues derived from future Arctic lease sales in the

     federal budget bill.



     <p>The oil industry and their Congressional allies have seized upon

     drilling the Arctic as a way to lower oil prices.  However, opening

     the Refuge would have no impact on prices at the pump.  It is not

     clear that there is any economically recoverable oil in the Arctic

     Refuge at all.  At best, the Refuge would yield only a six-month

     supply of oil.  And it would take a decade before the first drop of

     gas made it to the pump.



     <p>"America can never drill its way to energy independence.  We import

     more than 55% of our oil and America sits on less than 3 percent of

     the world's known energy reserves," said Melinda Pierce, Sierra Club

     Washington Representative. "The answer to the country's energy needs

     lies in energy efficiency and renewables, not beneath the surface of

     the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge.  This national treasure must

     not be sacrificed."



     <p>The coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is referred

     to America's Serengeti.  Nestled between the towering mountains of the

     Brooks Range and the Beaufort Sea in northeast Alaska, the narrow 1.5

     million acre coastal plain is the biological heart of this untamed

     wilderness.  It is home to unique and abundant wildlife.   The coastal

     plain is also the calving grounds of the 129,000 member Porcupine

     River Caribou Herd, which migrates over 400 miles each year to this

     same place to give birth to their young.
