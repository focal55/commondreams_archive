<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->A state judge in New Orleans has 

removed six teenage boys from a 

juvenile prison after finding they had 

been brutalized by guards, kept in 

solitary confinement for months and 

deprived of shoes, blankets, education and medical care.



<p>  The descriptions of conditions at 

the prison in Jena, in central Louisiana, are stark. But the criticism is 

particularly troubling, federal officials and lawyers for the prisoners 

say, because the prison is run by the 

Wackenhut Corrections Corporation, 

the world's largest for-profit prison 

operator. The judge said the company, which generally has a good reputation in the industry, had treated the 

youths no better than animals.



<p>  The situation raises a fundamental 

question about privately run prisons: Can corporations operate them 

more efficiently than state governments without skimping on essential 

services and proper training?



<p>The teenage inmates were freed or 

transferred to other prisons by 

Judge Mark Doherty of Orleans Parish Juvenile Court, who said that the 

boys had been entrusted to Jena's 

personnel "for the avowed purpose 

of rehabilitation."



<p>  Instead, Judge Doherty said, they 

"wound up in a place that drives and 

treats juveniles as if they walked on 

all fours. These young people deserve to be treated like human beings, not animals." 



<p>      Judge Doherty, a Republican and 

former prosecutor, said  he would devote the next two weeks to hearings 

for 12 other boys he has sentenced 

who are at Jena, to determine whether he can also remove them.



<p>  Justice Department officials and 

others said the problems at Jena 

were at least partly caused by Wackenhut's efforts to cut costs. Consultants for the department and a federal judge found the company had 

stinted on food, clothing, education, 

and medical treatment for 276 inmates, and on training for guards.



<p> The Justice Department sent experts to Jena as a result of an investigation it has mounted in recent years 

into widespread reports of abuses in 

Louisiana's other juvenile prisons. 

Additionally, Judge Frank J. Polozola of Federal District Court in Baton Rouge has overseen conditions in 

jails and prisons throughout the state 

for more than a decade following 

lawsuits on behalf of inmates.   

<p>



<p>  In a statement, Wackenhut said it 

was disappointed by the Justice Department's charges. The criticisms, 

it said, were overstated and ignored 

progress it had made toward resolving problems at the prison. "The 

bottom line is that the juvenile facility at Jena is a well-managed and 

safe facility," Wackenhut said.



<p>   Other private prisons across the 

country have drawn official criticism. But most of those have been 

run by smaller companies set up in 

recent years, as a prison-building 

boom has fostered new industry 

growth.



<p> Wackenhut, based in Palm Beach 

Gardens, Fla., operates 39,308 beds 

in 56 institutions in 13 states and 

seven foreign countries. The reports 

do not make clear whether top company officials knew about the problems at Jena.



<p>   Private prison operators like 

Wackenhut say they can make money by applying better management 

skills than government. On its Web 

site, Wackenhut says it "insists that 

each of its facilities is a model of 

modern correctional management." 



<p>     But a report in February by four 

experts hired by the Justice Department concluded that the problems at 

Jena "seemed to be linked to the 

reluctance of Wackenhut Corrections to spend adequate funds to provide for the care of the youth." 



<p>    And John Whitely, a former warden of the Louisiana state penitentiary at Angola who examined the Jena 

prison for for Judge Polozola, said 

that the pervasive lack of shoes, underwear, blankets and mattresses 

for inmates was "just cheap."  



<p> After reading the reports, Judge 

Doherty went to Jena himself and 

interviewed inmates. He also conducted hearings of his own to determine the facts of cases involving 

youths sentenced in his court.



<p> Judge Doherty said one boy he 

released, a 17-year-old found guilty 

of robbery, had been forced to lie on 

the floor on his stomach with a 

guard's knee in his back, which 

caused excruciating pain since the 

boy had recently had an operation 

for gunshot wounds in his abdomen 

and was wearing a colostomy bag.



<p>      A Justice Department official said 

the government had given Wackenhut and the state Department of Corrections a proposal for improvements at Jena. "We are waiting to 

hear back from them, but the window is short," the official said, indicating that the department was considering a lawsuit against Wackenhut if changes are not made quickly.



<p>    As is often the case in Louisiana, 

the prison is also enmeshed in a 

political corruption scandal.   

<p>A friend 

of former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards, 

Cecil Brown, was indicted in New 

Orleans in November on federal 

charges of  funneling $845,000  from 

Fred Hofheinz, a former mayor of 

Houston, to Mr. Edwards for the contract to build the prison at Jena. 



<p>      Mr. Edwards was named as an 

unindicted co-conspirator, said Eddie Jordan Jr., the United States attorney in New Orleans. Mr. Edwards 

is on trial on federal charges of extortion, racketeering and money-laundering in connection with the 

award of a riverboat casino license. 

 Given that case, Mr. Jordan said, it 

would have been superfluous to indict him for the Jena payoffs.



<p>      Though Mr. Hofheinz won the Jena 

contract, he was unable to raise the 

money to build the $12 million prison 

and sold the rights to Wackenhut.



<p>       Before the prison opened 14 

months ago near Jena about 100 

miles northwest of Baton Rouge, 

Wackenhut and state officials said it 

was being built to provide treatment 

for juveniles with drug addictions. 

But the Justice Department experts 

said virtually no drug treatment programs were run at Jena.



<p>      Instead, they found "a dangerous 

place to be," with a quarter of the 

inmates  "traumatically injured" in 

a two-month period, many by untrained guards. Those guards, the 

experts said, routinely threw the inmates against walls, twisted their 

arms or shoved them to the ground 

because they had not been taught 

other ways to control the boys. 



<p>      Dr. Nancy Ray, an author of the 

report, said many boys had no shoes 

or jackets in the winter; some were 

forced to spend the day "huddled 

under a shared sheet or blanket" to 

keep warm, rather than attend classes held in another building.



<p> Inmates often went days without 

clean underwear, she said, and sometimes fought over newly washed 

clothes. Once, she said, inmates 

started a riot by  rushing a food cart 

because of a shortage of food. 



<p> Low pay and poor management at 

Jena, Dr. Ray said, have led to high 

turnover in personnel: five wardens 

since Jena has been open, and 600 

persons have filled its 180 staff positions. Because of Jena's remote location, qualified personnel have been 

difficult to obtain, Dr. Ray said.



<p> She said Wackenhut had skipped 

some elementary procedures like 

background checks on prospective 

employees for criminal records; 

some guards were hired despite having arrest records for assault. 



<p>      In his report, Mr. Whitely found 

some guards who walked off their 

posts, leaving the inmates in control 

of their barracks while the boys frequently slept through what few classes were offered. Even one of the 

wardens told Mr. Whitely that Jena 

was "a comedy of errors." 



<p>      A quarter of the inmates have 

I.Q.'s of less than 70, Dr. Ray said, 

but no special education is provided 

for them. And guards, most of whom 

were white, often used racial epithets 

when talking to the inmates, who 

were predominantly black, the report said.



<p>      A 15-year-old inmate from New 

Orleans also released by Judge Doherty tried to commit suicide 20 

times by swallowing razor blades or 

hanging himself by a sheet, the inmate  said in an interview. David 

Utter, the inmate's lawyer, said Jena's files contained nearly two dozen 

reports that guards had used physical force against the teenager, causing a broken wrist and fingers. 



<p>      The teenager, whose name cannot 

be used because he is a juvenile, said 

he learned about Wackenhut one day 

when he was in the visitors room 

awaiting an appointment with his 

lawyer and read a promotional brochure. "Then I figured out," he said, 

"Wackenhut was using us kids to 

make money."
