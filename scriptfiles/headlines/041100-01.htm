<p>The Microsoft Corporation has quietly hired Ralph Reed, a senior consultant to Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign, to lobby Mr. Bush in opposition to the government's antitrust case against the software giant.

<p>Microsoft's aim, the company says, is to curry favor with the apparent Republican presidential nominee, hoping he will speak out against the government's case -- and, perhaps, take a softer approach toward the company if he is elected president.

<p>Mr. Reed, former head of the Christian Coalition, is well situated to take on the assignment since his firm, Century Strategies, is one of Mr. Bush's top consultants. During the primary campaign, Mr. Reed frequently appeared on television to talk on behalf of the campaign. 

<p>&nbsp;Today, Mr. Reed declined to talk 

about his company's contract with 

Microsoft, saying, "We have a policy 

of not discussing our clients." Another executive of his company, 

speaking on condition of anonymity, 

said Microsoft had hired Century 

Strategies to lobby other political 

candidates as well.



<p>



<p> Mark Murray, a spokesman for 

Microsoft, said the company had 

hired Century Strategies to counter 

"a comprehensive lobbying campaign by our competitors" to promote the government's suit. The 

company also said it had been 

"working very hard to get our point 

of view across to all the presidential 

candidates," including Vice President Al Gore. Microsoft has not said 

how it has lobbied Mr. Gore and his 

staff.



<p> Last week, a federal judge found 

Microsoft in wide violation of antitrust laws. And in large part because 

of the government antitrust suit, Microsoft has been trying to make 

friends among the candidates, Republicans and Democrats alike.



<p> An accounting by the Center for 

Responsive Politics shows that, during the current election season, Microsoft and its employees have donated more than $727,000 to political 

parties -- 53 percent of it to the 

Republicans and 47 percent to Democrats.



<p> One obvious goal, while the antitrust case drags through a year or 

more of appeals, is to convince the 

next president, Congress and the 

public that the case should be abandoned. But the current campaign by 

Mr. Reed's company is much more 

closely aimed at the Bush campaign.



<p> A series of e-mail messages from 

John Pudner, senior project manager for Century Strategies, laid out 

a detailed plan by Mr. Reed's staff 

and his contractors to recruit senior 

Bush supporters from around the 

country in an effort to undermine the 

government's suit.



<p> The Bush supporters -- and the e-mail showed that Mr. Pudner is 

screening them carefully to make 

sure they are influential within the 

campaign -- are being asked to write 

letters to Mr. Bush saying they believe the government's case is misguided, and that the American people oppose it.



<p> Mr. Pudner's e-mail messages instruct "state operatives" of the firm 

to send him biographical information 

about Bush supporters who could 

help influence the Bush campaign. 



<p> Only after he has verified that the 

supporters are sufficiently influential are the regional lobbyists, working on contract for Century Strategies, authorized to solicit more letters.



<p> He said that the company intended 

to gather the letters through the end 

of this month. "We will reject letters 

that are not from someone" the company counts as influential, he wrote.



<p> The e-mails were made available 

to The New York Times by a recipient who did not agree with the goals 

of the campaign. One lobbyist said 

Century Strategies was offering the 

regional contractors $300 a letter -- 

a high price for this sort of work.
