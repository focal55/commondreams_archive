The thick ice that has for ages 

covered the Arctic Ocean at the 

pole has turned to water, recent 

visitors there reported yesterday. 

At least for the time being, an ice-free patch of ocean about a mile 

wide has opened at the very top of 

the world, something that has 

presumably never before been 

seen by humans and is more evidence that global warming may 

be real and already affecting climate.



<p> The last time scientists can be 

certain the pole was awash in 

water was more than 50 million 

years ago.



<p> "It was totally unexpected," 

said Dr. James J. McCarthy, an 

oceanographer, director of the 

Museum of Comparative Zoology 

at Harvard University and the co-leader of a group working for the 

 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is sponsored 

by the United Nations. The panel 

is studying the potential environmental and economic consequences of marked climate 

change.



<p> Dr. McCarthy was a lecturer on 

a tourist cruise in the Arctic 

aboard a Russian icebreaker earlier this month. On a similar 

cruise six years ago, he recalled, 

the icebreaker plowed through an 

icecap six to nine feet thick at the 

North Pole.



<p> This time, ice was generally so 

thin that sunlight could penetrate 

and support concentrations of 

plankton growing under the ice. 

Dr. McCarthy said the icebreaker's Russian captain, who has 

made the voyage 10 times in recent years, said he had never 

before encountered open water at 

the pole.



<p> Another lecturer, Dr. Malcolm 

C. McKenna, a paleontologist at 

the American Museum of Natural 

History, said the ship, the Yamal, 

crunched through miles of unusually thin ice and intermittent open 

water on the approach from Spitsbergen, Norway, to the pole. When 

the ship reached the pole -- which 

Dr. McKenna and his wife, Priscilla, confirmed with a hand-held 

Global Positioning System  Priscilla, confirmed with a hand-held 

Global Positioning System  navigation device -- water lapped its 

bow.



<p> "I don't know if anybody in 

history ever got to 90 degrees 

north to be greeted by water, not 

ice," Dr. McKenna said in an interview. He instantly snapped pictures to document the phenomenon in photographs.



<p> The Yamal eventually had to 

steam six miles away to find ice 

thick enough for the 100 passengers to get out and be able to say 

they had stood on the North Pole, 

or close to it. They saw ivory gulls 

flying overhead, the first time ornithologists said they had ever 

been sighted at the pole.



<p>    Over the last century, the average surface temperature of the 

globe has risen by about 1 degree 

Fahrenheit, and the rate of warming has accelerated in the last 

quarter century. (That's a significant amount, considering that the 

world is only 5 to 9 degrees warmer 

now than it was in the last ice age, 

18,000 to 20,000 years ago.) Scientists 

and policy makers are still arguing 

about whether this is a natural fluctuation or an effect of industrial society's releasing heat-trapping gasses 

into the atmosphere.



<p> "Some folks who pooh-pooh global 

warming might wake up if shown 

that even the pole is beginning to 

melt at least sometimes, as in the 

Eocene," Dr. McKenna added.



<p> The Eocene was the geological period when the world's climate grew 

significantly warmer. Around 55 million years ago, according to sedimentary and fossil evidence, tropical 

vegetation spread inside the Arctic 

and Antarctic circles. Water and jungles dominated the polar environments, and in the generally warm 

world, mammals for the first time 

grew in number, size and diversity.



<p> Previous studies of satellite and 

submarine observations have 

seemed to establish a warming trend 

in the northern polar region and 

raise the possibility of a melting icecap.



<p> Scientists at the Goddard Space 

Science Institute, a NASA research 

center in Manhattan, compared data 

from submarines in the 1950's and 

60's with 90's observations, demonstrating that the ice cover over the 

entire Arctic basin has thinned by 45 

percent. Satellite images have revealed that the extent of ice coverage 

has significantly shrunk in recent 

years.



<p> Dr. McCarthy said he would report 

the encounter with open polar water 

to environmental scientists and consult other scientists to see if new 

satellite remote-sensing data have 

detected the extent of the melting.



<p> Recalling the reaction of passengers when they saw an iceless North 

Pole, he said: "There was a sense of 

alarm. Global warming was real, 

and we were seeing its effects for the 

first time that far north."



<p> In their models of climate patterns, scientists have long suggested 

that the northern polar region would 

be affected earlier and more seriously than the southern region.



<p> They said the greater expanse of 

land in the northern hemisphere 

should respond more rapidly to temperature change, presumably leading to marked climate change.
