It's one of those indelible images from the Vietnam War era -- 1969, 

Woodstock, Country Joe McDonald up on the stage, belting out the 

era's anti-war anthem to more than half a million gyrating, 

mud-slathered, toasted-to-the-gills fans.	 



<P>``Come on, all of you big strong men/Uncle Sam needs your help 

again/He's got himself in a terrible jam/Way down yonder in 

Vietnam.''	 

</P>

<P>The jam in Vietnam ended a quarter of a century ago, at a cost of 

more than 2 million Vietnamese civilians and soldiers, as well as 

58,220 American service men and women, whose memory is being honored 

today. But the ``Feel Like I'm Fixin' To Die Rag,'' the anthem of the 

anti-war '60s and '70s and the signature song of Berkeley's own 

Country Joe, stayed on and on and on.	 

</P>

<P>``Because of that song and the Woodstock film,'' McDonald said the 

other day, ``I'm linked to the Vietnam War, like it or not. In 

whatever way people feel about the war, that's how they view 

Country Joe.''	 

</P>

<P>Things have mellowed. A lot of those Woodstock kids cut their hair 

and are now driving Beemers and washing down the second half of their 

lives with Dom Perignon.	 

</P>

<P>But McDonald, who is now 58 years old, became frozen in the aspic of 

Indochina. And through a combination of personal obsession, colored 

by his own experience of being a Navy veteran turned anti-

war activist, he has become the champion of Vietnam veterans.	 

</P>

<P>``I may dislike the generals and the politicians,'' he said of his 

anti-war days, ``but I never said anything bad about the individual 

soldiers.'' It's a sentiment he has carried to numerous veterans' 

rallies during the past three decades.	 

</P>

<P>After a while, McDonald found that in some military circles he was 

``being mentioned in the same breath as Jane Fonda,'' who became 

known as ``Hanoi Jane'' for her highly publicized support of North 

Vietnam during the war.	 

</P>

<P>``It's bothersome to be mentioned that way,'' McDonald said, 

pointing out that he was trained as an air traffic controller and 

served from 1959 to 1962 in the Navy, stationed in Japan. ``I 

enlisted when I was 17 years old, and I've experienced what every 

military veteran has experienced -- a bell-shaped curve of emotions. 

Before you go in, you wonder about patriotism and you're scared and 

you're not scared. Then you go in and you learn that it's a lot more 

complicated than just a bunch of push-ups and pull-ups and shooting a 

gun.''	 

</P>

<P>After he was discharged, McDonald became a rock singer, and when the 

bitterly satirical ``Feel Like I'm Fixin' To Die Rag'' came out, it 

crystallized the experience of many Vietnam vets.	 

</P>

<P>After the war ended, McDonald found himself in big demand to play 

benefits for veterans causes that desperately needed money.	 

</P>

<P>And it was during those years that McDonald persuaded the city of 

Berkeley to affix a bronze plaque honoring the notoriously anti-war 

city's 22 Vietnam War dead on the city's veterans building. He also 

helped create an interactive Web site 

(<A HREF="http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/links/comm/vvm/default.htm">www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/links/comm/vvm/default.htm</A>) that, in stark 

black and white, brings to electronic life the images and 

remembrances from the slain veterans' family, friends and former 

comrades in arms.	 

</P>

<P>Now, working with the San Francisco veterans group, Swords to 

Plowshares, McDonald is trying to get San Francisco officialdom to 

pay symbolic attention to the 163 San Franciscans who died in the 

Vietnam War by doing for San Francisco what he did for Berkeley.	 

</P>

<P>``If Berkeley can relate to its past and bring out the scrapbooks 

and allow people to heal and have closure,'' he said, ``San Francisco 

can do it if they want to. Isn't it time to do the right thing?''	 

</P>

<P>McDonald wants the city to hang a plaque, preferably at the War 

Memorial Veterans Building across the street from City Hall, and 

create its own Web site to honor its Vietnam War dead. He said he 

mentioned this to Willie Brown at a party during the San Francisco 

mayoral campaign five years ago -- ``you get to talk to him for a hot 

minute'' -- and Brown said, sure, let's do it, it's a good idea, and 

went on to be mayor and nothing's happened since.	 

</P>

<P>Asked about McDonald's idea the other day, Brown said, ``I think 

he's right. There should be some acknowledgment. There should be a 

Vietnam memorial somewhere in San Francisco.'' But he said the 

memorial would have to be privately financed.	 

</P>

<P>``I hope by the end of my term we can have something,'' Brown said, 

pointing out that it took years of lobbying in Sacramento to get a 

Vietnam veterans memorial on the Capitol grounds.	 

</P>

<P>In fact, San Francisco has had a memorial to its war dead since 

1932, when the War Memorial Veterans Building and Opera House on Van 

Ness Avenue, built to honor the dead of World War I, were dedicated. 

But there are no plaques honoring San Francisco veterans.	 

</P>

<P>Whenever the subject of honoring the city's war dead with specific 

plaques comes up, the War Memorial Board of Trustees turns it down, 

something that rankles veterans and San Francisco politicians alike.	 

</P>

<P>Two years ago, Supervisor Barbara Kaufman asked members of the War 

Memorial Board why they couldn't put up plaques and received a reply 

from the memorial's managing director, Elizabeth Murray.	 

</P>

<P>``Over the years, there have been various proposals for the 

placement of plaques and/or monuments on the `San Francisco War 

Memorial' to memorialize the purposes for which the War Memorial was 

constructed,'' Murray wrote. ``However, for a variety of reasons, 

none of these proposals were implemented.''	 

</P>

<P>Murray told Kaufman that the two buildings themselves, along with 

their common courtyard, ``were intended to convey homage and spirit 

as a memorial to veterans.''	 

</P>

<P>Kaufman, however, thinks there's a problem. 	 

</P>

<P>``The way we treated Vietnam veterans was different from the way we 

treated other veterans,'' she said. ``They weren't treated as heroes, 

they were treated as if they were the enemy. It's pretty disgraceful 

the way we treated the Vietnam veterans.''	 

</P>

<P>``But I can see where the trustees would argue that we already have 

two magnificent monuments for those who have fought for our 

country,'' she said.	 

</P>

<P>For those whose loved ones died in Vietnam, however, a plaque 

honoring the Vietnam War dead should have been erected a long time 

ago, she said.	 

</P>

<P>``We, the survivors, are still waiting for the city of San Francisco 

to honor their sacrifice,'' said Margo McRice of Castro Valley, whose 

first husband, Army Lt. Arthur R. Timboe, was killed during the Tet 

Offensive in early February 1968, six weeks before his 24th birthday. 

``As this is the 25th anniversary of the official end of the war in 

Vietnam, I feel time is of the essence.''	 

</P>

<P>The San Francisco memorial plaque or statue is still in search of a 

powerful sponsor, but the memorial Web site may have better luck.	 

</P>

<P>A ranking member of San Francisco's Veterans Affairs Commission, one 

of the city's two official veterans organizations, said he is eager 

to do something for the city's Vietnam War dead and welcomed the idea 

of opening up the commission's Web site (<A HREF="http://www.ci.sf.ca.us/vets/">www.ci.sf.ca.us/vets/</A>) to 

the kind of interactivity already in use in Berkeley.	 

</P>

<P>``I think it's a great idea to add the Vietnam vets to this Web 

site,'' said Commissioner Wallace Levin, a San Francisco private 

investigator who is also a Korean War veteran and past president of 

the commission. ``There's no reason why we shouldn't recognize the 

Vietnam veterans.''	 

</P>

<P>He said he would bring up the idea when the commission meets at 6 

p.m. June 5 at the Veterans Building, 401 Van Ness Ave. 

</P>

<P>At the city's Department of Telecommunications and Information 

Services, Deputy Director Rod Loucks said that adding the names of 

the 163 San Francisco veterans who gave their lives in Vietnam would 

not be very difficult and would fit within the purpose of the 

taxpayer-supported site.	 

</P>

<P>``The intent of the city's Web site is not only for government 

people,'' he said, ``but is also a community-

based resource.''	 

</P>

<P>Loucks said there might be a problem paying for Web-savvy techs to 

get the material on the Web site -- it could cost up to about $5,000 

for an interactive site -- but McDonald said that in the past he has 

been able to raise money to pay for these memorials.	 

</P>

<P>McDonald said he is inured to the fact that these things don't 

happen overnight and he takes comfort from his friend Jan Scruggs, 

the veteran who conceived the idea of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial 

(The Wall) that was dedicated in Washington, D.C., in November 1982, 

after Scruggs and others spent three years raising $8.4 million from 

private donations to get the wall designed and built.	 

</P>

<P>``Inertia is always easy, particularly with government officials,'' 

Scruggs said the other day. ``All that's needed there is some 

leadership, and I'm sure Country Joe and other veterans will get 

behind this thing and make it happen. Symbols are very important, as 

many small towns and large towns have found out. Commemorating 

tragedies and triumphs is part of the fabric of a city. It's the type 

of thing people have to remember.''

``I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag''	 

Well, come on mothers throughout the land,	 

Pack your boys off	 

to Vietnam.	 

Come on fathers,	 

don't hesitate,	 

Send 'em off before	 

it's too late.	 

Be the first one	 

on your block	 

To have your boy	 

come home in a box.	 

And it's one, two, three,	 

What are we fighting for?	 

Don't ask me, I don't give a damn,	 

Next stop is Vietnam.	 

And it's five, six, seven,	 

Open up the pearly gates,	 

Well there ain't no time	 

to wonder why	 

Whoopee! we're all gonna die.
