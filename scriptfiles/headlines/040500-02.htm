IGUALA, Mexico - Humble Mexicans who stand in the way of 

depleting  the country's natural resources have often faced brutal 

treatment, but one such man has 

discovered in recent days that he has 

international friends to help him 

fight his cause.



<p>    The man is Rodolfo Montiel, who 

organized peasants to block roads 

after loggers began felling virgin forests near his village in the mountains 

north of Acapulco. That peaceful 

1988 protest slowed the logging, but it 

infuriated wealthy landowners and 

the generals at a nearby garrison. 



<p>    Gunmen have since killed several 

members of Mr. Montiel's rural ecological organization, and  last May 

soldiers seized and tortured Mr. 

Montiel, he said, accusing him of 

drug and weapons crimes. 



<p> The charges were riddled with 

contradictions, but were enough to 

send him to a penitentiary pending a 

felony trial. One of the human rights 

lawyers defending him has been kidnapped, twice.



<p>    But last Friday,  Amnesty International declared Mr. Montiel to be  a 

prisoner of conscience, provoking a 

flood of protest letters to the Mexican authorities. And on Wednesday, 

a San Francisco foundation is to announce that it has awarded him a 

$125,000 environmental prize.



<p>    "The only award I've gotten from 

the government is prison, so I don't 

know quite what to think about this 

prize from foreigners," Mr. Montiel, 

a robust, nearly toothless man of 44, 

said in an interview today in a federal prison in Iguala, two hours' 

drive south of Mexico City. "Are you 

sure this doesn't involve some hidden punishment?"



<p>    [David Najera, a government 

spokesman, said Tuesday that President Ernesto Zedillo was unaware of 

the details of Mr. Montiel's case. 

"But it worries us, and we'll focus on 

it now," he said, adding that Mr. 

Zedillo's government has emphasized respect for the environment.] 



<p> The government showed only hostility to Mr. Montiel's complaints in 

1995 after local authorities  began to 

promote logging in the mountains of 

Guerrero State, signing timber contracts with Boise Cascade, the Idaho-based lumber company.



<p>     Mr. Montiel, who has only a first-grade education, sent letters to Mexico's environment minister, to the 

governor of Guerrero and to a dozen 

other authorities, reporting that laws 

were being trampled, local rivers 

were drying up, and thousands of fish 

were dying.



<p>    "Our defense of the forest is a 

struggle for our way of life," Mr. 

Montiel wrote in one letter. "The 

earth without trees becomes a 

desert, because the soul of the water 

lives in the cool of the forest."



<p>    Only one authority ever responded: a Guerrero official accused Mr. 

Montiel of belonging to "an ecological guerrilla organization."



<p>    Shortly after Mr. Montiel's group 

blocked roads to stop the timber 

trucks in spring 1998, Boise Cascade 

pulled out of Mexico.



<p>    [Doug Bartels, a spokesman, said 

Tuesday that Boise Cascade left because it could not get enough logs to 

keep its 100-employee sawmill running. Referring to the arrests of Mr. 

Montiel and a friend in May 1999, he 

said,  "If these two individuals have 

been wrongly arrested, that's regrettable."]



<p>    Soldiers who detained the two men  

tied and beat them, held them for two 

days partly submerged in a river, 

forced them to hold marijuana 

plants and rifles as soldiers took 

photos, and later pressured them to 

sign a confession, Mr. Montiel said. 

Mr. Montiel urinated blood for 

months after his torture, he said.



<p>    Under cross-examination by Mr. 

Montiel's lawyers last fall, army officers contradicted themselves over 

details of his arrest. Days later, one 

of the lawyers, Digna Ochoa, was 

kidnapped and beaten by assailants 

in Mexico City. In October, intruders 

accosted Ms. Ochoa again for hours 

in her home.
