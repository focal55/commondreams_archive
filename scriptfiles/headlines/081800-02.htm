LOS ANGELES - The Los Angeles Police Department calls them "scouts," and they are so good

at their job that, during this week's protests, some were shot at and others

were arrested--by their own colleagues.

<P>

   The LAPD undercover officers assigned to join the crowds of demonstrators

drawn by the Democratic National Convention are a young, purposefully rag-tag

group that has blended easily and invisibly into the sea of young protesters.

<P>



   Throughout the week, they have provided a key element in the police

intelligence gathering network, as they circulated unnoticed within crowds

across the city.

<P>

   The LAPD's undercover operation was "an extremely critical part of the

&#091;department's&#093; plan," said Cmdr. Tom Lorenzen, who oversees the Police

Department's convention planning unit. "Without good intelligence, we would

not be as efficient as we are."

<P>

   One morning this week, some of these undercover officers met before going

out on the streets in their work clothes: T-shirts and shorts, bandannas,

flip-flops and sneakers. They are allowed to break department policy by

wearing beards and keeping their hair long. One even wore a "Free Mumia"

bandanna.

<P>

   When asked if they were worried about getting swept up in trouble, they

shrugged. It's all in a day's work for these officers. One, however, said,

smiling, that he was a little worried about being shot "by one of those,"

pointing to fellow officers in uniform checking out shotguns.

<P>

   In fact, a few were shot at by their colleagues using stinger rounds and

bean bag projectiles during Monday's melee in which hundreds of police

attempted to move the large crowd that lingered after a concert by the rock

group Rage Against the Machine, police sources said. A day later, a couple of

these undercover officers were arrested in a bicycle protest in which about

100 cyclists tried to block city streets, these sources said.

<P>

   The arrests of 42 animal-rights activists Tuesday, allegedly while in

possession of materials authorities said could be made into homemade flame

throwers, came from information supplied by undercover officers, police said

Thursday.

<P>

   Federal and other local agencies also had undercover officers working

inside the demonstrations this week, police sources said.

<P>

   But the LAPD has a particularly long and rich history of spying on

political dissenters dating back to the "Red Squad" of the 1930s that

regularly broke up union and leftist meetings, hustling protesters to jail.

Then, in the late 1970s and 1980s, it was learned that officers from the

Public Disorder Intelligence Division had infiltrated left-wing groups and

that others had spied on local politicians and critics of the department.

<P>

   Because of the LAPD's dubious history of political spying, this week's

activities have lead some to wonder whether the officers are observers or

provocateurs.

<P>

   "The concern always is the chilling effect it would have on protected

speech activities," said Erwin Chemerinsky, a professor of constitutional law

at University of Southern California. "Even if we're doing nothing wrong as a

group we still might talk differently if we know there is an uninvited police

officer among us."

<P>

   Lisa Fithian, an organizer with D2KLA and the Direct Action Network, said

members of her group saw people dressed as protesters sitting in a police car

after last Sunday's anti-police rally.

<P>

   "It's standard operating procedure: infiltrate and disrupt," Fithian said.

"They are potentially trying to incite problems in the midst of our

demonstrations. We're not doing anything illegal, we're not doing anything

wrong. The question is do they create problems in the midst of our meetings or

actions?"

<P>

   LAPD officials say the information gathered this week was invaluable. And

the use of technology such as cell phones has vastly improved the undercover

operation.

<P>

   That intelligence has improved the department's ability to more quickly

move officers to specific areas of trouble, officials said.
