<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There may be no more treacherous land mine on the 

political horizon than abortion -- an issue with the potential to 

explode along every step of the 2000 presidential campaign.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  From Iowa to New Hampshire and then on to South Carolina and 

California, the candidates have been questioned about where they 

stand regarding a woman's right to choose an abortion. And woe to 

those who try to sidestep the question, obscure their position or 

morph their words from one place to the next.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``In 1992, it was `the economy, stupid,' '' said Belle 

Taylor-McGhee, president of the California Abortion Rights Action 

League. ``Right now, it's `abortion, stupid.' ''	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   That is because the next president is expected to appoint three 

to five Supreme Court justices -- and thereby will wield enormous 

power to recast Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court 

decision that provided for legal abortion.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  And though it is rarely included among the top 10 concerns of 

voters, a candidate's position on abortion carries enormous weight, 

particularly with women, who comprise the crucial ``gender gap'' at 

the polls, political insiders say. Abortion has become a kind of 

litmus test in itself -- a good indicator of where a candidate stands 

on a variety of related social issues.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``The position on the right to choose basically speaks to the 

fundamental principle on how we value women in our society,'' said 

Taylor-McGhee. ``That includes health care, how she can raise her family 

with a fair wage and how she can provide education for her children 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--because if you don't have the power to decide when the time is 

right for you to become a parent or not, you really can't decide 

anything else.''	 

</font>

<H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GOP CANDIDATES OPPOSE ABORTION</font></H3>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Without exception, the Republican presidential candidates -- Texas 

Gov. George W. Bush, Arizona Sen. John McCain, publisher Steve Forbes 

and former Ambassador Alan Keyes -- are vehemently opposed to 

abortion. All have said they will support the repeal of the Roe vs. 

Wade decision if they are elected.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  But Bush has taken heat for sidestepping abortion questions and 

has been pressed repeatedly for failing to promise he would appoint 

anti-abortion judges and select an anti-abortion running mate. He said recently that ``it should be up to each state legislature'' to decide what restrictions to place on abortion.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   McCain has had to soften a statement -- made in an interview with 

The Chronicle last year -- in which he worried that an immediate 

repeal of Roe vs. Wade could send women back to illegal abortion 

mills. The senator argues that he always has been unquestionably 

anti-abortion and wants to see Roe vs. Wade repealed, but he has said 

the GOP ``must be an inclusionary party'' that respects all views on 

the issue.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Forbes has faced criticism that he has changed his political views 

on the subject -- becoming far more hard-line -- for political 

expediency, specifically to win the critical backing of the Christian 

right. And Keyes has made the outlawing of all abortions one of the 

central issues of his campaign.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Among the Democrats, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey 

Sen. Bill Bradley strongly support abortion rights.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  But they, too, have been mired in controversy around the issue. In 

New Hampshire, Bradley openly questioned Gore's commitment on the 

abortion issue, citing a letter Gore wrote to a congressional 

constituent in 1987 in which he said abortion was ``arguably the 

taking of a human life.''	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Asked to explain, Gore said, ``I used the word `arguably,' and 

yes, my position has changed. . . . I would not use that phrasing 

today.''	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Bradley said revisiting Gore's old position is legitimate, because 

it raises questions about the vice president's consistency on the 

issue -- and his truthfulness.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  The arguing about credentials does not change the bottom line, 

said Democratic political consultant Garry South: ``You can gussy it 

up, but you are either for a woman's right to choose -- or you are 

not.''	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  And on this issue, in California, South argues that recent 

political history -- and polling -- proves Republicans are vulnerable 

on the issue.	 

</font>

<H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PRO-CHOICE CALIFORNIANS</font></H3>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Bob Dole, the GOP's 1996 presidential candidate, took repeated 

criticism for his anti-abortion position and lost the state -- 

particularly female voters -- handily to Bill Clinton. And Dan 

Lungren, the GOP's 1998 gubernatorial candidate, touted his 

anti-abortion views across the state and went down to the largest 

defeat in modern political history here, again with women voting in 

large numbers against him.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``Consistently, Californians are pro-choice, and by a very large 

margin,'' said pollster Mark Baldassare of the Public Policy 

Institute of California, whose surveys show ``7 out of 10 said 

government should not interfere with women's rights to abortion.''	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  But GOP presidential candidate Keyes, in a recent interview with 

The Chronicle, argued that Republicans can win on abortion -- if they 

stick to their convictions.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``All of the major victories that the Republican Party has won in 

the last 20 years have been on the strength of pro-life, conservative 

candidates,'' Keyes said. ``(Take) the '94 Congress, with a freshman 

class that was overwhelmingly pro-life, moral, conservative.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``These folks won because they had moral, conservative 

convictions. So I just think that the pundits fly in the face of real 

experience,'' he said. ``It's not true that pro-life people win all 

the time, but it is true that it has not been any kind of 

liability.''	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  And anti-abortion groups insist that more change is coming.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``As technology changes, hearts are changing, because the proof is 

in the pictures,'' said Mark Washburn, president of Capitol Resource 

Institute, a nonprofit, bipartisan family advocacy group in 

Sacramento. ``Years ago, we had discussions about viability (of the 

fetus) -- and it was 30 weeks. Now it's 25 weeks. . . . The other side 

could get away with calling it a blob of tissue, but it's hard to 

argue that when you get an (ultrasound) picture of a baby (in the 

first trimester).	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  ``The younger generation is seeing it more clearly than some of 

their elders, even,'' Washburn said. ``The newest voters, 18 to 24 

(years old), are more pro-life than ever. And as they start having 

children, it will swing even harder to pro-life.''	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  But as Californians prepare to go to the polls, advocates say they 

are prepared to organize and fight the issue to the end -- and that 

the presidential candidates know it.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ``The reason George Bush has been running away from the issue, and 

John McCain has straddled it,'' said Taylor-McGhee, ``is that they 

know if you are rabidly opposed to a woman's right to choose here, 

you cannot win.''	 

</font></P>

<H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ABORTION ISSUES</font></H3>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The next president is expected to appoint three to five judges to 

the U.S. Supreme Court, which could have a dramatic impact on laws 

regarding the availability of legal abortion. The president's bully 

pulpit brings with it enormous power to lobby for -- or veto -- key 

legislation related to reproductive rights, such as parental consent 

laws or a ban on late-term abortions. The president also wields huge 

financial clout: the power to approve or veto federal funding for 

programs such as teen education, family planning and contraception 

services for poor women. The Chronicle asked the candidates to 

comment on related issues:	 

</font></P>

<P></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--Constitutional Amendment Banning Abortion	 

George W. Bush: Supports the goal of a ``Human Life'' constitutional 

amendment with exceptions for rape and incest and to save the life of 

the mother.	 

Steve Forbes: Supports a constitutional amendment banning abortion 

except to save the life of the mother.	 

Alan Keyes: Supports a constitutional amendment banning abortion.	 

John McCain: Supports a constitutional amendment with exceptions for 

the life of the mother, rape and incest.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill Bradley: Opposes constitutional ban on abortion.	 

Al Gore: Opposes constitutional ban.	 

</font></P>

<P></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--Federal Family Planning Funding	 

George W. Bush: Opposes the use of federal funds to provide or advocate 

for abortion, but supports ``practical steps to reduce the number of 

abortions,'' such as helping women in crisis through maternity group 

homes, encouraging adoption, promoting abstinence education and 

passing laws requiring parental notification and waiting periods.	 

Steve Forbes: Would prohibit the federal government from granting any 

public funds to groups that recommend or perform abortions in the 

United States or abroad.	 

Alan Keyes: Opposes family planning funding.	 

John McCain: Opposes the use of taxpayer money to perform, promote 

or support abortion on demand and opposes the use of U.S. dollars to 

fund international organizations that provide or facilitate abortion.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill Bradley: Supports federal funding for family planning, opposes 

restrictions on funds for international family planning programs and 

supports requiring health insurers to provide a full array of 

contraception options in their health plans.	 

Al Gore: Supports increased funding for family planning services.	 

</font></P>

<P></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--Federal Clinic Access Law	 

George W. Bush: Supports the free speech rights of citizens to peacefully 

and legally demonstrate; opposes any violent protest.	 

Steve Forbes: Opposes violence at clinics, but opposes laws like the 

Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which established a safety 

zone around women's health clinics, because it targets a specific 

group such as anti-abortion demonstrators for specific type of free 

speech.	 

Alan Keyes: No response.	 

John McCain: Wants to maintain open access to clinics and is 

concerned about acts of violence, but believes the federal law is 

wrong because it criminalizes peaceful demonstrations.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill Bradley: Supports laws prohibiting protesters from blocking 

access to reproductive health centers and strongly opposes any effort 

to weaken those laws.	 

Al Gore: Supports federal access law. Clinton-Gore administration 

this year proposed $4.5 million in the federal budget to provide more 

security at health care facilities and established a task force to 

assess further security needs.	 

</font></P>

<P></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--Late-Term Abortion	 

George W. Bush: Strongly opposes and would sign legislation to ban it.	 

Steve Forbes: Urges a ban.	 

Alan Keyes: Strongly opposes.	 

John McCain: Strongly opposes; co-sponsored law to ban late-term 

abortions and has taken a leading role in the fight to overturn 

Clinton's veto of the legislation.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill Bradley: Opposes a ban on late-term abortions, unless it 

contains protections for the life and health of the mother.	 

Al Gore: Opposes late-term abortions, except where necessary to 

protect the life or health of the mother.	 

</font></P>

<P></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--Parental Consent for Contraceptives and Abortion	 

George W. Bush: Supports.	 

Steve Forbes: Supports.	 

Alan Keyes: Supports.	 

John McCain: Supports. Original co-sponsor of the Child Custody 

Protection Act of 1999, making it a federal offense to transport a 

minor across state lines to obtain an abortion in order to avoid 

state parental consent laws.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill Bradley: Believes a minor should seek advice from parents or 

another adult whenever possible, but believes a legal requirement 

that applies to all cases is not appropriate.	 

Al Gore: Opposes. Says that while teenagers should be encouraged 

to talk to their families, those who do not have a family they can 

talk to should not be penalized.	 

</font></P>

<P></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--Litmus Tests for Judges	 

George W. Bush: Declines to specify whether his judges or vice president 

would be ``pro-life.'' Has promised to appoint ``strict 

constructionists'' who ``do not legislate from the bench.''	 

Steve Forbes: Promises to choose a running mate and appoint judges 

who share his views on abortion.	 

Alan Keyes: Would choose people who share his view.	 

John McCain: Opposes.	 

</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill Bradley: Would appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution 

and respect precedent, including the right to privacy.	 

Al Gore: ``A Supreme Court appointment in a Gore administration 

would support a woman's right to choose.''
