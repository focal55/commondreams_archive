A prominent antimissile critic has 

found what he says is a major flaw  in 

the Pentagon's antimissile plan and 

is calling on the White House to appoint a high-level scientific panel to 

investigate what he says were fraudulent efforts to cover it up.



<p>  If the critic is correct, the flaw 

 may cripple or even kill the proposed 

weapon system, the cost of which is 

estimated at up to $60 billion. 



<p>      The critic is Theodore A. Postol, 

professor of science and national security studies at M.I.T., author of 

many reports on antimissile systems 

and in the 1980's a science adviser to 

the chief of naval operations on ballistic missile technologies and potential weapons against them. He made 

his new accusations in a May 11 

letter to John D. Podesta, the White 

House chief of staff, after reviewing 

Pentagon data gathered by an antimissile whistle-blower.



<p> Dr. Postol's critique centers on the 

hardest part of the missile defense 

challenge, distinguishing incoming 

weapons from decoys and destroying 

them.



<p>      In the letter, a copy of which he 

gave to The New York Times, Dr. 

Postol said Pentagon sensor data he 

had obtained from the first antimissile test flight in June 1997 showed 

that the ground-based interceptor 

was inherently unable to make the 

distinction  and that the Pentagon 

and its contractors had tried to hide 

this failure.



<p>      The coverup, he said,  was "like 

rolling a pair of dice and throwing 

away all outcomes that did not give 

snake eyes."



<p>     An inability to tell cheap decoys 

from costly warheads in theory could 

force a defender to fire interceptors 

at every threatening object, which as 

a practical matter could make the 

system useless.



<p>      P. J. Crowley, a spokesman for the 

National Security Council, said the 

White House was carefully weighing 

Dr. Postol's appeal but was unlikely 

to move quickly.



<p>      "It's premature to say this merits 

an outside review," Mr. Crowley 

said. "We have to let the Department 

of Defense complete its deployment 

readiness review," which starts in 

late June and  lasts a month.



<p>      A senior federal official, who spoke 

on the condition of anonymity, said 

that if a scheduled antimissile flight 

test failed, that would tend to bolster 

 concerns about the system and probably help prompt an independent investigation.



<p>      Lt. Col. Richard Lehner of the Air 

Force, a spokesman for the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, said   a detailed written 

response was being prepared for Dr. 

Postol and the White House.



<p>         "We take allegations of fraud very 

seriously," Colonel Lehner said. "We 

have looked at many of these allegations in the past, and have found 

nothing which supports either the 

scientific criticisms or any fraud."



<p>      But Richard L. Garwin, a top federal science adviser who has expressed doubts about some aspects 

of the missile defense idea, said he 

had seen Dr. Postol's letter and considered his technical points "very 

important."



<p> In a recent New York Times/CBS 

poll, 58 percent of the respondents 

said they favored trying to build an 

antimissile defense. But that figure 

dropped to 25 percent, the poll found, 

when respondents were asked what 

their opinion would be "if many scientists conclude it is unlikely that 

such a system will ever work."



<p>      Testing of the would-be antimissile 

weapon has not gone smoothly. The 

first two flight experiments simply 

gathered sensor data on mock warheads and decoys. The most elaborate of these, in June 1997, is the 

subject of Dr. Postol's attack.



<p>      Last October, the Pentagon hailed 

the first intercept try as a success 

but later conceded that the interceptor  had initially drifted off course 

and picked out the decoy balloon 

rather than the warhead. In a January test, a sensor coolant leak caused 

the interceptor to miss the target. 



<p>      A third intercept test is set for late 

June.   

<p>President Clinton is expected 

to decide afterward whether the 

United States should build a limited 

defense against missile attacks by 

rogue countries.



<p>      To date, targets in the interception 

tests have consisted of a single mock 

warhead and a single decoy balloon. 

The Pentagon says it plans to increase decoy complexity in future 

tests. 



<p>      In his letter to the White House, Dr. 

Postol said the Pentagon's analysis 

of the more elaborate June 1997 sensor test  "urgently needs to be investigated by a team of scientists who 

are recognized for their scientific 

accomplishments and independence 

from the Pentagon." His three-page 

letter had four detailed attachments 

meant to back up his claims. 



<p>      His charges are based partly on an 

antimissile criticism by Nira 

Schwartz, a former senior engineer 

at TRW, a top military contractor. In 

a suit against TRW, Dr. Schwartz 

has accused the company of faking 

antimissile tests and evaluations of 

computer programs for the interceptor's sensor and then firing her when 

she protested. Through her litigation 

and a Pentagon inquiry,  Dr. 

Schwartz obtained many antimissile 

reports and data, some of which she 

has shared with Dr. Postol.



<p>      A nuclear engineer by training, Dr. 

Postol in his analysis of the Pentagon 

reports goes beyond questions of 

computer analysis of data from incoming targets. In fact, he said, the 

test showed that warheads and decoys appear so similar that sensors 

might never be able to tell them 

apart.   

<p>He also says the Pentagon 

conspired to cover up this sensor 

problem.



<p>      The brightness readings from the 

mock warhead and decoys, he told 

the White House, "fluctuated in a 

varied and totally unpredictable 

way," revealing no feature "that 

could be used to distinguish one object from the other."



<p>      Faced with this upset, Dr. Postal 

continued, the analytical team arbitrarily rejected and selected data to 

create an "elaborate hoax" that was 

then hidden in reports by the use of 

"misleading, confusing, and self-contradictory language."
