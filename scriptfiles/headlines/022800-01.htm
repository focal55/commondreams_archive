<p>After 

years of trying to balance its books 

by cutting service, Amtrak has concluded that to succeed it should instead create  routes, offer more frequent service on existing lines and 

organize itself more like the airlines, 

so people can change  trains and get 

to places more efficiently.



<p>     Railroad officials say the railroad 

plans to announce on Tuesday that it 

will run a train from New York to 

California, which it believes is unprecedented. It also plans to expand 

service to Monterrey, Mexico, and 

Toronto, and stretch its Florida-to-New York service  to Boston. It will 

add a third daily train between New 

York and Chicago, in hopes that if it 

gives travelers more schedule 

choices, more people will choose 

trains over cars or planes. And it 

hopes to attract business travelers 

on routes like Washington to Atlanta 

on overnight trains.



<p>      It is a major change of strategy for 

the company, which has  managed to 

sidestep growth since its creation by 

Congress in 1971. 



<p>      "We've been trimming, cutting 

and shrinking up, to save some out-of-pocket cash," said George Warrington, the Amtrak president. "But 

we found out that if you reduce the 

scope of your network, you take out a 

significant percentage of revenue." 



<p>          Governor Thommy G. Thompson 

of Wisconsin, who is chairman of 

Amtrak's board, said in a telephone 

interview, "We're going to grow it 

into profitability."



<p>          Mr. Thompson and Mr. Warrington emphasized, in separate interviews, that part of the strategy was 

to carry more high-value freight. The 

transcontinental train, for example, 

will have refrigerated cars for carrying produce, which the railroad says 

will make it profitable. 



<p> Asked how many people would 

prefer a 58-hour rail trip to a 6-hour 

flight, Mr. Thompson said, "Some 

people will, sure, people that love rail 

passenger service, people who are 

retired and want to see the country 

instead of just flying over it." 



<p>         Cutting trains that did not earn 

back their direct costs and their 

share of overhead costs, Mr. Warrington said, reduced the number of 

passengers fed into the system, some 

of whom would have continued their 

trips on more profitable routes.



<p> Now the railroad wants to add 

trains that can earn back  direct 

costs, and make some contribution, 

even  a small one, to the  overhead.



<p>      "The airlines figured this out a 

long time ago," said Mr. Warrington, 

who plans to imitate the airlines in 

other ways, including offering discounts for tickets sold to leisure travelers weeks in advance, and raising 

the price for last-minute travelers.



<p>      The new schedules, which will be 

in place by 2003, include overhauling 

50 passenger cars and locomotives, 

some of them in storage for years, 

and buying or leasing 2,000 box cars, 

refrigerator cars and "roadrailers," 

which have tires and train wheels.



<p>   Amtrak is negotiating with the 

freight railroads over whose tracks 

it operates, offering them a share of 

the added profits, and hopes to carry 

goods on its passenger trains that 

now move by truck, including  meat 

and poultry and manufactured goods 

like car parts.



<p>      The changes will increase the 

number of miles Amtrak trains travel every year to 38 million from 4 

million and, Amtrak hopes, raise the 

number of passenger-miles  to 6.7 billion from 5.3 billion last year. A passenger mile is one paying passenger 

traveling one mile. 



<p> And the changes will improve the 

bottom line by $65 million a year, 

 company officials say, which is essential because Congress has said it 

will end operating subsidies in 2002.



<p>      The expansion plans require 

agreements with the freight railroads but do not need approval by 

Congress. The changes are big for 

Amtrak but small in the scope of the 

overall transportation picture. The 

railroad is seeking a shift in its share 

of the intercity passenger market, 

which is now less than 1 percent. If it 

gets all the mail and express freight 

business it wants, the total would 

amount to 0.13 percent of that market. For the freight railroads and the 

trucking companies, "that's a rounding error,"  Mr. Warrington said. 



<p>      The Amtrak Reform Council, a 

panel created by Congress in 1997 to 

report on the railroad's progress, 

said recently that from 1989 to  1998, 

while the airlines' passenger miles 

increased by 35.3 percent  and intercity buses' passenger miles increased  by 7.8 percent, Amtrak's 

 shrank by 1.4 percent.
