UNITED NATIONS  - The United States Thursday bluntly

ruled out

any

action by the UN Security Council to contain the escalating

violence in the

Middle East which has resulted in the deaths of over 90

Palestinians since

last

week.

<P>

US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke told reporters that Washington

will ''strongly

oppose'' any attempts to bring the issue before the 15-member

Security

Council. 

<P>

As one of the five permanent members of the Council - along with

Britain,

France, China and Russia - the United States can not only wield

its influence

to block any meetings, but also veto any resolution brought before

the

15-member Council. 

<P>

Any negative resolution, Holbrooke warned, will have an

''explosive''

effect on

the situation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. ''We

have made this

abundantly clear to our friends and colleagues in the Security

Council,'' he

added.

</TABLE></font>The new round of violence Thursday also threatened to derail the

delicate

negotiations being conducted by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan

who has

already

met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader

Yassir

Arafat. 

<P>

On Wednesday, Annan announced that Palestinian and Israeli

officials had

assured him that a meeting will be convened at the highest level

of a

trilateral security committee to deal with the current unrest. 

<P>

This committee, which was set up as a result of a US-brokered

Israeli-Palestinian peace accord in 1998, is made up of senior

security

officials of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the United

States. 

<P>

But this announcement has been overshadowed by new violence which

could

endanger the negotiations being conducted by Annan. A UN spokesman

said

Thursday that since Annan was travelling there was no immediate

reaction from

him to the new developments on the ground.  

<P>

Ambassador Nasser al-Kidwa, Permanent Observer of Palestine to the

United

Nations, told reporters that he has formally requested ''an

immediate meeting

of the Security Council'' to resolve the spreading crisis in the

Middle East. 

<P>

Al-Kidwa said he was calling for ''immediate action by the Council

to bring an

end to the illegal military actions and the extremely dangerous

situation that

has developed'' in the West Bank and Gaza. 

<P>

Describing the Security Council inaction as ''scandalous'', he

said that the

Council refuses to act ''only when it concerns Palestinians'' -

implying the

heavy political pressure exerted by Israel on the United States. 

<P>

Last Saturday the United States abstained on a resolution which

deplored ''the

provocation carried out at Al-Haram Al-Sharif in Jerusalem'' where

a visit by

right-wing Likud leader Ariel Sharon set off riots in the occupied

territories. 

<P>

The original draft resolution, which called for an international

commission of

inquiry to probe the violence, was watered down to avoid a US

veto. 

<P>

The New York Times reported Monday that US President Bill Clinton

had asked to

delay the vote for 24 hours so he could get personally involved. 

<P>

The Times quoted unnamed US officials as saying that only after

the Israelis

gave their blessings to an abstention - following a change in the

language of

the resolution - that Washington went ahead and abstained. 

<P>

Holbrooke described the resolution as ''biased, one-sided and

unhelpful''. 

<P>

''With that resolution, the Security Council effectively ended its

usefulness

in the Middle East crisis,'' he added.  

<P>

While Washington strongly supported Annan's peace efforts, he

said, any

session

of the Security Council will only jeopardise the Secretary-

General's

mission. A

Council session, he said, will not help peace in the region. 

<P>

Phyllis Bennis, Fellow of the Institute for Policy Studies, argues

that the

United Nations is the right venue for resolving the Middle East

crisis - it

always has been. 

<P>

''It is an international crisis that must be resolved by

international law and

the international community. The US should step back and let the

UN do its

job,'' she says. 

<P>

The request for a Council session came following the killings of

two Israeli

soldiers Thursday. As a result of the killings, the Israeli

military deployed

helicopter gunships to attack the headquarters of the Palestine

Authority and

other targets in the West Bank and Gaza strip. 

<P>

Ali Abunimah of the Arab-American Action Network said that ''it

was entirely

predictable that the killing of two Israeli-occupation soldiers

would produce

banner headlines and moral outrage of a kind that has been all but

absent

during two weeks of massacre of unarmed civilians by Israeli

troops''.  

<P>

''Israel, the occupying power, has taken military actions today

tantamount to

the declaration of an overall war against the entire Palestinian

people, which

is already under military occupation,'' Al-Kidwa said. 

<P>

The Israeli occupying forces, he said, have encroached on

Palestinian cities,

''dramatically increasing their presence in the vicinities of

these cities and

fired rockets from helicopter gunships and Israeli military ships

to destroy

several official Palestinian locations in Ramallah and near Gaza

city.  

<P>

''These violent, military actions have resulted in the loss of

Palestinian

lives and the severe destruction of property in wholly civilian

areas in the

Occupied Palestinian Territory,'' he said. 

<P>

If the Security Council refuses to act, Al-Kidwa said he will have

no choice

but to ask for the resumption of the 10th emergency Special

Session of the

189-member General Assembly so as to bring the entire issue before

a wider 

membership of the United Nations. 

<P>

The Assembly has held four rounds of an ongoing 10th emergency  

Special 

Session, 

beginning in 1997 through 1999, all of which focused on the  

situation in the 

occupied Israeli territories, including East Jerusalem.
