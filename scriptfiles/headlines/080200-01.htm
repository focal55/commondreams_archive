PHILADELPHIA - Scores 

of protesters were arrested in a running cat-and-mouse contest with the 

police across downtown thoroughfares today as they sought to disrupt 

the Republican National Convention 

with illegal hit-and-run demonstrations. 



<p>  The evening rush-hour traffic was 

turned into gridlock around City Hall 

as hundreds of young demonstrators, 

some of them masked with bandannas, blocked a main entrance of the 

interstate highway and strutted as 

they pleased at key points in the city, 

clogging intersections with only selective interference from the police.

</TABLE></font>With the city intent on maintaining 

an upbeat convention gleam, the police clearly worked to avoid the sort 

of full-scale, baton-wielding clashes 

with street demonstrators that occurred last winter at the World 

Trade Organization conference and 

damaged Seattle's reputation. Demonstrators, on the other hand, clearly 

worked to steal the media spotlight 

and create street scenes of nonstop 

political protest as the focus for the 

15,000 news workers here covering 

the Republican convention. 



<p>      The convention, three miles away, 

remained unfazed. But delegates increasingly watched the local television coverage of protests out beyond 

their meeting through the slower 

parts of their agenda. Some delegates reported inconvenience in journeying around protest-clogged 

streets to reach the convention arena 

in South Philadelphia. But none were 

heard demanding a more hard-edged 

response from city authorities.



<p>      The Associated Press reported 

that at least 280 people had been 

taken into custody last night. The 

police said that  four officers were 

injured and 20 patrol car windows 

smashed across the day of increasing disruption. A score of demonstrators, chanting denunciations of capital punishment, were arrested after 

blocking the westbound entrance to 

the interstate Vine Street Expressway north of City Hall.



<p>      "The whole world is watching!" 

they screamed, echoing the protest 

of the 1968 anti-war demonstrators 

on the chaotic streets around the 

Democratic convention in Chicago.



<p>      And, indeed, the police seemed 

well aware of who was watching. 

They carefully read arrest warnings 

three times, then gingerly arrested 

the sit-in demonstrators while five 

news helicopters hovered  and a platoon of reporters and photographers 

stood within a few feet.



<p>      Protesters representing a score of 

causes seemed energized by the day, 

the most tense and chaotic thus far in 

the convention week. They vowed to 

deploy their darting street tactics 

further over  the next two days.



<p>      "Ridiculous," one delegate angrily 

muttered outside the Doubletree Hotel south of City Hall as his path was 

momentarily blocked by a swirl of 

demonstrators, police officers and 

news workers tying up Broad Street.



<p>                  "They're just rebels without a 

cause," declared Erik Lipson, a 38-year-old resident with tickets for the 

evening convention session. He 

watched a two-hour standoff between the police and protesters and 

was ultimately branded "bourgeoisie" by one demonstrator. "A bunch 

of spoiled suburban kids," Mr. Lipson continued as demonstrators attracted more and more attention. 



<p>          The American Civil Liberties 

Union accused  the police of precipitating the uglier street mood today 

by raiding a West Philadelphia warehouse where protesters were preparing props and puppets for passive-resistance demonstrations. 



<p>      The police, to the contrary, said 

the warehouse was raided  because it 

was being used as the planning headquarters for illegal disruptions of the 

convention week.



<p>          Late tonight, the best evidence police could cite was that chicken wire 

and plastic tubing were found in the 

warehouse, which they contended 

were the ingredients of illegal protest material. Civil rights critics 

seized upon this as evidence only of 

gross over-reaction.



<p>      "Police Commissioner John Timoney has taken off the velvet gloves to 

show the iron fist," said Stefan 

Presser, legal director of the state 

A.C.L.U.



<p>  Mr. Presser referred to the contrast between the increasing tensions of today and the scene on Monday when the police chose to escort, 

rather than confront, welfare protesters in an illegal march for three 

miles down Broad Street. 



<p>      Mr. Presser insisted the warehouse raid was provocative while the 

police said it was necessary. At the 

same time he deplored reports of 

some demonstrators resorting to 

vandalism and setting trash fires as 

they raced through the streets.



<p>   "The whole city loses if this situation deteriorates," he warned.   

<p> 



<p>       Commissioner Timoney has repeatedly said that the police will be 

flexible in their response to unexpected protests and provocations. 

But the city has also emphasized that 

it must protect public safety and the 

conventioneers' peace. It has made 

provisions for thousands of arrests 

and detentions. Thousands of police 

officers were at the ready, with bike 

squads closely tailing most of the 

demonstrators but not arresting 

them as they impulsively went off on 

fresh tangents in their protests.
