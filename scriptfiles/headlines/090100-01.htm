Ralph Nader, running for president as the Green Party nominee, 

railed against big business from the 

heart of corporate America yesterday, crisscrossing Manhattan to condemn environmental pollution, the 

exploitation of workers and the 

abuse of taxpayer dollars through 

"corporate welfare."



<p> He also dismissed his opponents, 

Vice President Al Gore and Gov. 

George W. Bush of Texas, as candidates whose similarities (favoring 

businesses over workers, in Mr. Nader's view, and taking millions from 

corporate donors) outweighed their 

differences.

</TABLE>Mr. Nader, the consumer advocate 

whose long-shot candidacy has received comparatively little national 

media attention, began his salvos 

from a prominent platform: a morning interview with Matt Lauer on 

NBC's "Today" show.



<p>  "They are different in a few areas, 

but the rhetoric is more different 

than the reality," Mr. Nader said of 

Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore on "Today," 

as about 300 people milled about on a 

Rockefeller Center sidewalk outside 

the studio. Some held signs demanding that the major candidates open 

the presidential debates to Mr. Nader and one of the Reform Party 

candidates, Patrick J. Buchanan. 

Two men made the point  by wearing 

chicken suits to represent Mr. Bush 

and Mr. Gore.



<p>    After "Today," Mr. Nader gave  a 

separate interview on NBC's cable 

cousin, MSNBC, then crossed the 

street to the headquarters of the network's corporate parent, General 

Electric,  where he criticized the 

company for polluting the Hudson 

River.   

<p>He also attacked Mr. Gore 

and Mr. Bush for taking contributions from the company.



<p> "It is time for General Electric to 

obey the law and pay for its poisoning of the Hudson River and stop 

lying and deceiving the public about 

the dangers," Mr. Nader said, referring to G.E.'s legal discharge of 

PCB's  into the Hudson until 1977, 

when the chemicals were banned by 

the federal government.   

<p>He called 

for Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore to give 

back the money their campaigns had 

received from General Electric.



<p> From there, Mr. Nader went to the 

Bowery, where he protested with 

union workers at the New Silver Palace Restaurant, a 900-seat dim sum 

parlor and banquet hall that once 

was the only unionized restaurant in 

Chinatown. Former employees have 

waged a three-year battle with the 

restaurant's management, which 

has been accused by federal labor 

officials of antiunion hiring practices.



<p> Mr. Nader finished his campaign 

day on Wall Street, where he criticized the City and State of New York 

for offering multimillion-dollar tax 

breaks and other incentives to persuade companies like the New York 

Stock Exchange  to stay in Manhattan.



<p> "Here is this bastion of global capitalism on welfare," Mr. Nader said, 

after taking a private tour of the New 

York Stock Exchange. "It will take 

hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars in order to build them a new 

building. At the same time, hundreds 

of neighborhoods are suffering from 

inadequate funding of their vital 

needs."



<p> Mr. Nader said that such "corporate welfare" was emblematic of the 

problems of America's current two-party political system. Mr. Nader's 

candidacy is widely seen less as an 

attempt to capture the White House 

in November than an effort to influence the public debate.



<p>  At various points since announcing 

his candidacy, it appeared as if Mr. 

Nader could garner a high enough 

percentage of the vote -- mostly 

from Mr. Gore -- in several important states, including California and 

Michigan, to push Mr. Bush ahead.



<p> But recent polls have suggested 

that Mr. Nader's moment appears to 

be fading, given Mr. Gore's surge  in 

the polls after the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.



<p> For example, a Field poll released 

last week showed that Mr. Nader 

was supported by 4 percent of California voters, compared with 7 percent in a similar survey in June.



<p> Mr. Nader's swing through New 

York City yesterday followed a series of fund-raisers and appearances 

on the East End of Long Island on 

Wednesday. Earlier in the week, he 

and his running mate, Winona LaDuke, staged a boisterous rally in 

Portland, Ore., that drew more than 

10,000 people.



<p> At his Manhattan appearances, 

Mr. Nader was trailed by small but 

loyal bands of supporters: college 

and high school students, environmentalists and those who said they 

were concerned about the influence 

of large corporations.



<p>   "I don't care how much of a threat 

he is to Bush and Gore," said David 

Joseph, 33, a graduate  student in 

French at Hunter College,  outside 

the NBC studios yesterday morning. 

"I want to see something new, something fresh in the debates."



<p> Steve Rogovin, 59, of River Vale, 

N.J., who moved off the steps of a 

building for Mr. Nader's Wall Street 

news conference, said he would probably not vote for Mr. Nader, but was 

happy to see him in the race.



<p> "He is man for the people," Mr. 

Rogovin said. "I don't believe he will 

get elected or get a chance to debate 

the two power brokers. Think, he 

would act as devil's advocate."



<p> That is why, Mr. Rogovin said, he 

answered, "By all means" when Mr. 

Nader asked if he could use the steps.
