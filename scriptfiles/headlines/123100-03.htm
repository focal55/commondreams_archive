WASHINGTON   - Acting at the last moment, President Clinton 

on Sunday authorized the United States to sign a treaty creating

the world's first permanent international war crimes tribunal to

bring to justice people accused of crimes against humanity.

<p>The president said his action, taken with some reservations,

builds on U.S. support for justice and individual accountability

dating to American involvement in the Nuremberg tribunals that

brought Nazi war criminals to justice after World War II. ``Our

action today sustains that tradition of moral leadership,'' he

said.

<p>The treaty should not be submitted to the Senate for

ratification until certain concerns are met, he said.

<p>``I believe that a properly constituted and structured

International Criminal Court would make a profound contribution in

deterring egregious human rights abuses worldwide...,'' the

president said in a statement issued at the White House.

<p>The treaty must be ratified by the Senate before U.S.

participation in the tribunal becomes final. Fierce opposition to

its terms is expected from conservatives led by Sen. Jesse Helms,

R-N.C.

<p>The president said he acted ``to reaffirm our strong support for

international accountability and for bringing to justice

perpetrators of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.''

<p>``In signing, however, we are not abandoning our concerns about

significant flaws in the treaty,'' the president said. ``In

particular, we are concerned that when the court comes into

existence, it will not only exercise authority over personnel of

states that have ratified the treaty, but also claim jurisdiction

over personnel of states that have not.''

<p>``Given these concerns, I will not and do not recommend that my

successor submit the treaty to the Senate (for ratification) until

our fundamental concerns are satisfied,'' he said.

<p>Clinton acted at Camp David, the presidential retreat in western

Maryland where he and his family are spending the last New Year's

weekend of his administration.

<p>Sunday was the deadline for countries to sign on to the

international criminal court treaty and transmit it to United

Nations  headquarters in New York. After Sunday, ratification is the

only way a government can express support for the treaty or

associate itself with it.

<p>The court would be the first permanent institution created

specifically to try charges of war crimes, genocide and crimes

against humanity. At present the United Nations has two

specifically targeted and temporary war crimes courts in operation.

One deals with suspects from the Bosnia-Herzegovina civil war of

the early 1990s and the other with people implicated in atrocities

during unrest in Rwanda in 1994.

<p>Treaty supporters contend that a permanent international war

crimes court is ``the missing link'' in the global legal system and

say that over the past half century there have been many instances

of war crimes and crimes against humanity that have gone

unpunished.

<p>For example, supporters note that no one has ever been held

accountable for the alleged genocide in Cambodia in the 1970s when

an estimated 2 million people were killed by the Khmer Rouge  or for

killings in such other countries as Mozambique, Liberia and El

Salvador.

<p>Support for a permanent international war crimes tribunal was

first expressed in the years immediately after World War II.

Interest in creating such a court has been voiced periodically ever

since.

<p>The United Nations contends that setting up temporary courts to

deal with alleged war crimes in specific countries has been an

inadequate response because unavoidable delays lead to such

consequences as deteriorated evidence, escaped or vanished

witnesses, and witness intimidation.

<p>Some in the United States have expressed concern, however, that

U.S. approval of such an international tribunal might subject

American citizens to politically motivated prosecutions.

<p>Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has

campaigned vigorously against the court. He has pledged to give top

priority during the congressional session starting next week to

passage of a bill that would bar U.S. cooperation with any such

international tribunal.

<p>Helms also has tried to persuade Israel, which also is delaying

its decision until the last minute, to reject the international

court. In an opinion piece in an Israeli newspaper this month,

Helms said that if the court existed now, senior Israeli officials

possibly could have been indicted for actions taken to put down the

ongoing spasm of anti-Israeli violence by Palestinians.

<p>The United States and Israel were among the handful of countries

that did not sign the statute creating the treaty when it was

issued in Rome in 1998.

<p>Four countries signed the treaty on Friday - the Bahamas,

Mongolia, Tanzania and Uzbekistan - which brings the number to 136.

<p>Twenty-seven have ratified it, and 60 are needed before the

treaty can enter into force.

<p>Human rights groups pushed Clinton on Friday to sign the treaty.

Human Rights Watch said ``history will look harshly on President

Clinton if he fails to sign,'' and Amnesty International said

Clinton's signature ``will demonstrate U.S. support for the rule of

law and for equal justice for all.''
