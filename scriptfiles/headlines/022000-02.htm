<p>Dr. H. Kirk Hammond, a cardiologist at the University of California in 

San Diego, never envisioned himself 

an entrepreneur. "I'm a blue jeans-wearing, tieless character," he said.   

<p>



<p>But when he invented a gene therapy 

technique to treat heart disease, he 

did what any self-respecting academic scientist does these days: he 

started a biotechnology company.   

<p>



<p>     Today, he has one foot in academia 

and the other in industry. On campus, he trains doctors and runs a 

gene therapy lab, financed in part by 

his company, Collateral Therapeutics. As its  chief scientist, he has  

drummed up support for a public 

 offering of stock, and helped design 

 clinical trials for  his therapy. 



<p>       But there is one bright line that Dr. 

Hammond says he will not cross: He 

will not treat patients who are enrolled in studies of his invention. "I 

think it would look bad for me to be 

involved in any direct way," he says.



<p>       With the biomedical revolution in 

full swing, academic scientists who 

lack industry ties have become as 

rare as giant pandas in the wild. But 

as Congress begins to investigate 

lapses in federal oversight of gene 

therapy experiments, lawmakers, 

bioethics experts and federal regulators  say they are troubled that so 

many researchers have a financial 

stake in companies testing their discoveries -- companies whose fortunes, with those of the scientist, can 

rise and fall on a single product. 



<p>     The fear is that the lure of profit 

could color scientific integrity, 

prompting researchers to withhold 

information about potentially dangerous side effects or push for experiments that might not be quite 

safe. 



<p> Of particular concern are doctors 

who enroll and treat patients in clinical studies that are paid for by the 

companies they own, a practice that 

the Food and Drug Administration 

says is growing in gene therapy.



<p>        Some universities, including the 

University of California at San Diego, simply do not allow it. Even if Dr. 

Hammond wanted to test his own 

invention, he could not do so and keep 

his university job. But the rules are 

not the same across the board. 



<p>        Dr. Ronald G. Crystal, a gene therapy researcher at Cornell University's Weill Medical College, has treated patients in small  studies paid for 

by the company he founded, Gen-Vec. So has Dr. Jeffrey M. Isner, a 

scientist at St. Elizabeth's Medical 

Center in Boston. Dr. Isner, along 

with the medical center and two other partners, founded a company 

called Vascular Genetics, of which 

he owns 20 percent. Both doctors 

declined to be interviewed for this 

article. 



<p>      But both have drawn the attention 

of members of the Recombinant 

DNA Advisory Committee, the National Institutes of Health panel that 

oversees gene therapy research. Dr. 

Crystal was criticized for asking the 

panel not to disclose that a heart 

disease patient had died of an underlying illness during a gene therapy 

experiment. And before the panel 

learned that most gene therapy researchers were failing to comply 

with its guidelines to report patient 

side effects, Dr. Isner was singled 

out for failing to do so.



<p>    Dr. Ruth Macklin, a member of the 

advisory panel and professor of bioethics at Albert Einstein College of 

Medicine in the Bronx, said she worried that researchers with financial 

conflicts would try to keep information about risks a secret for fear it 

would hurt investment in their companies. 



<p> Dr. Macklin said she would like the 

panel to require doctors who own 

stock or have other financial interests in companies to disclose those 

interests on the consent forms distributed to patients.



<p>      Others, like Dr. David Blumenthal, 

who directs the Institute for Health 

Policy at the Massachusetts General 

Hospital, would ban the practice outright. "I'm not comfortable with scientists' owning substantial equity in 

small firms that are sponsoring their 

clinical research," Dr. Blumenthal 

said. "I think it creates a conflict of 

interest, and the conflict is particularly difficult to justify in cases 

where patients' welfare may be affected." 



<p>      Food and Drug Administration officials are also uncomfortable. Dr. 

Jesse Goodman, deputy director of 

the agency's Center for Biologics 

Evaluation and Research, said that 

in a typical clinical trial sponsored 

by a large drug company, the company served as a check on the researcher, ensuring that information about 

side effects was properly disclosed 

and that patients were given clear 

information about the benefits and 

risks. 



<p> But when the company and the 

researcher are one and the same, he 

said, that check is absent. He said the 

agency was trying to decide whether 

additional oversight was needed to 

protect patients in such studies.



<p>        Yet the issue of just what is a 

conflict can get murky. A case in 

point is the University of Pennsylvania, where an 18-year-old patient, 

Jesse Gelsinger, died in a gene therapy experiment last fall,  bringing 

 the current wave of scrutiny. The 

principal investigator of the study 

was Dr. James Wilson, director of 

the university's Institute for Human 

Gene Therapy. He is also the founder 

of a biotechnology company, Genovo, 

in which both he and the university 

hold stock. 



<p>     The relationship is so entangled, 

said Peter Erichsen, the university's 

general counsel, that it  set up two  

committees  to oversee it. Dr. Wilson 

cannot sit on Genovo's scientific advisory board and his work as a company consultant is unpaid. He may 

not participate in clinical studies 

paid for by the company. 



<p>      In an interview shortly after Mr. 

Gelsinger's death, Dr. Wilson said he 

agreed with the restrictions. "I think 

it gets a little bit concerning when 

the person who has responsibility for 

enrolling patients is the scientist who 

is driving" the research, he said 

then. "I think that's a conflict."



<p>      But Genovo contributes one-fifth of 

the  $25 million annual budget at the 

gene therapy institute, and in return 

has exclusive rights to develop  Dr. 

Wilson's discoveries into commercial products. 



<p> So while the company did not pay 

for the study that cost Mr. Gelsinger 

his life -- it was financed by the 

National Institutes of Health -- Genovo does have an indirect interest in 

all of Dr. Wilson's work. Indeed, Dr. 

Wilson was required to disclose his 

connection to Genovo on the "informed consent" document that explained the study's benefits and risks 

to patients.



<p>      What effect, if any, such relationships have on the outcome of clinical 

studies is difficult to evaluate, said 

Dr. Mildred Cho, a bioethicist at 

Stanford University who has studied 

conflict-of-interest policies at the 100 

largest research institutions in the 

country. "There is almost never a 

smoking gun," she said.   "You can't 

say Jesse Gelsinger died because 

Jim Wilson had stock in Genovo."



<p>      Evidence is beginning to emerge, 

however, that industry ties do color 

scientific judgment. In a 1996 analysis of 789 articles in medical journals, Dr. Sheldon Krimsky, a professor of urban and environmental policy at Tufts University, found that 34 

percent of the authors had a financial 

interest -- most frequently a patent 

pending -- in the subject matter being studied. 



<p>      In a later study, Dr. Krimsky interviewed the authors of articles in 

medical journals about calcium 

channel blockers, commonly prescribed for high blood pressure and 

chest pain from angina. Among those 

who supported the use of the drugs, 

96 percent had a relationship with 

the pharmaceutical industry,  compared with 60 percent who were neutral toward the drugs and 37 percent 

who were critical of them.



<p>      No  federal regulations govern the 

specifics of scientists' relationships 

to the companies they create. The 

National Institutes of Health require 

universities to set their own policies, 

but experts say the rules vary widely. Some researchers can sit on the 

scientific advisory boards of their 

own companies; others must maintain a greater distance. Some can 

have only a small investment. Others 

can have a significant equity stake. 

Dr. Hammond owns 15 percent of 

Collateral Therapeutics. Dr. Wilson's 

equity in Genovo is not public, but 

Mr. Erichsen, the university  lawyer, 

 said that Dr. Wilson and his family 

could own no more than 30 percent of 

the company,  and Dr. Wilson said 

half of his holdings were in a blind 

trust for his children.



<p>      Twenty years ago, before the revolution in genetics, academia was academia and industry was industry, 

and rarely was there any overlap.



<p>  Now, so many university scientists 

have started their own companies 

that deans of medical schools no 

longer talk about eliminating conflict 

of interest; the current buzzword for 

dealing with conflicts is "management." The primary management 

tool, university officials say, is disclosure. But that means disclosure to  

supervisors -- not to the public.



<p>       Congress has helped fuel the trend 

of scientists' starting their own companies. In 1980, it passed the Bayh-Dole Act, a law designed to speed up 

the commercialization of academic 

discoveries. It encouraged universities to patent inventions, and then 

assign the rights to those patents to 

private companies that could develop them into products. Instead of 

relying on existing companies, scientists like Dr. Hammond began raising venture capital and starting businesses of their own.



<p>      Universities like the Bayh-Dole 

Act because it generates income 

from licensing fees and royalties, 

and because it gives their best scientists incentive to stay in academia. 

Scientists like it because it helps 

them carry discoveries from the laboratory to the bedside, and because 

they no longer have to leave the 

prestige of academia to earn the 

money available in industry.



<p>      For some, it has been quite lucrative. Dr. William Haseltine, the chief 

executive of Human Genome Sciences in Rockville, Md., founded seven biotech companies while a professor at Harvard University. "I don't 

even know how many millions I've 

made," Dr. Haseltine said. But, he 

insisted, "the motivation was not primarily money."



<p>  "The motivation was the joy of 

conceiving ideas and reducing them 

to practical reality to make a difference in people's lives," he said.



<p>      That, said Dr. Hammond of the 

University of California at San Diego, was precisely why he started 

Collateral Therapeutics. In the late 

1980's, he said, he began looking at 

patients with heart disease whose 

bodies had grown new blood vessels 

to do the work of the blocked ones. It 

struck him that there must be a gene 

that would promote this beneficial 

blood vessel growth,  and that "it 

would be really nice just to be able to 

put those genes into patients."



<p>      By 1993, he said, he had figured out 

how to do it. "Back then, I was completely ignorant of business, and to 

be honest, quite alienated by business," he said. "But I had two young 

daughters and not a lot of money, a 

retirement in my future and I had 

sense enough to know that what I had 

discovered was important." 



<p>      The patent was filed in 1995, but 

the university could not get any companies interested in licensing it.  So 

Dr. Hammond met with some venture capitalists and started Collateral Therapeutics, which quickly licensed the patent rights. Within 

months, the company was working 

with a German  pharmaceutical firm, 

Schering A.G., which began human 

tests of  Dr. Hammond's technique in 

May 1998.



<p>      Even without participating in the 

clinical trial, the arrangement has 

been a delicate balancing act for Dr. 

Hammond. He takes unpaid leave 

from his university job when he is 

traveling on company business. He 

accepts payment as a consultant, but 

his job as vice president for research 

is unpaid. Although Collateral Therapeutics provides research money for 

his laboratory, he said, the company 

does not hold exclusive rights to 

commercialize his discoveries, as is 

the case with Genovo and Dr. Wilson 

at the University of Pennsylvania.  

And Dr. Hammond cannot sell his 

shares in Collateral while human 

testing is under way, he said, because the  Securities and Exchange 

Commission prohibits it.



<p>      "It's theoretical money; I can't do 

anything with it because I'm an insider," he said. "The university 

would love me to sell all of it. They 

think that makes me less contaminated in some way. I think that's 

nonsense."
