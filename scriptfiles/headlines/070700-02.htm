WASHINGTON, July 6 -- A leading critic of national missile defense, 

Theodore A. Postol,  said in a letter to 

President Clinton today that Mr. 

Clinton's advisers had made misleading statements about the proposed shield and urged creating an 

independent commission of top scientists to evaluate the plan. 



<p>Three major science groups also 

opposed the plan. The American 

Physical Society, with 42,000 physicists; the Federation of American 

Scientists; and the Union of Concerned Scientists jointly announced 

that they urged Mr. Clinton not to 

deploy a missile defense system, regardless of how its ground-based interceptor performs in a test on Friday night. 



<p> An antinuclear organization, 

Greenpeace, announced that it was 

sending a Dutch icebreaker, the Arctic Sunrise, to a "hazard zone" designated by the Air Force off the 

launching site at Vandenberg Air 

Force Base, Calif., to try to stop the 

test. 



<p> "Mr. President, you have the finger on the Star Wars button," Greenpeace wrote in a letter to Mr. Clinton. 

"We urge you take it off and make 

the world a safer place." 



<p> To the Pentagon, the attacks might 

look like the revenge of the scientists. 

Fifty Nobel laureates have said any 

movement to deploy a missile defense system would be "premature, 

wasteful and dangerous." 



<p> The most relentless and detailed 

criticism has been from Dr.   

Postol, a 

professor of science and national security studies at the Massachusetts 

Institute of Technology. He contended in his letter Clinton that Pentagon 

officials have in recent weeks "made 

numerous technologically illiterate 

and highly misleading statements" 

about the missile proposal.



<p> Dr. Postol said a statement by the 

under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, 

Jacques Gansler, at a news conference on June 20 that the system's X-band radar could discriminate between a real target and a decoy was 

based on faulty science.



<p> Dr. Postol added that the contention at that news conference by Lt. 

Gen. Ronald T. Kadish of the Air 

Force, director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization at the Pentagon, that the decoy to be used on 

Friday was "representative" of the 

expected decoy threat was also false. 



<p>    In statements today, the Pentagon 

defended the integrity of its program 

without addressing Dr. Postol's specific statements.   

<p>



<p> "Dr. Postol has raised issues that 

the independent review team and the 

Ballistic Missile Defense Organization are addressing," a spokesman 

for the Pentagon, Kenneth H. Bacon, 

said in a statement. "Developing a 

national missile defense system 

poses difficult technical challenges."



<p> Defense Secretary William S. Cohen "is confident that his team is 

following a systematic and reasonable course to solve these problems," Mr. Bacon added.



<p> A spokesman for the National Security Council, P. J. Crowley, said, 

"We've asked the Pentagon for an 

analysis of the questions he raises, 

and the Pentagon is in the process of 

getting back to us."   



<p>  The Pentagon said that  weather 

conditions appeared good and that 

the test on Friday was on schedule.
