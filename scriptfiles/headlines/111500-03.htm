ST. PAUL, Minn.  -- As the office of president hangs in the

balance a week after Election Day, Ralph Nader brushed off his role

as a spoiler.

<p>

   The Green Party candidate on Tuesday blamed Democratic Vice

President Al Gore for not inspiring more people to vote for him.

<p>

   ''There aren't many presidential candidates who can't carry

their own state,'' he said.

<p>

   Nader, who has been criticized in recent weeks by some for

taking votes from Gore, showed no remorse.

</TABLE></font>''Third parties are considered relevant only if they tip the

ballot,'' he said before speaking to hundreds gathered the

University of St. Thomas about ''the corporatization of America.''

<p>

   The battle continues between Gore and Republican George W. Bush

over Florida's 25 electoral votes, reinforcing how important those

Nader votes were.

<p>

   Nader carried about 3 percent of the vote nationally, including

5 percent in Minnesota and 1 percent (or 97,421 votes) in Florida,

the state likely to decide the presidential race.

<p>

   Exit polls suggested that nearly half the Nader voters would

have voted for Gore if it had been a two-way race and about

one-fifth would have voted for Bush.

<p>

   Bush's lead in Florida dwindled to 300 votes after a week of

recounts, hand counts and numerous legal challenges.

<p>

   ''Because of the closeness of the vote tally, I don't think it

will ever be truly known who won Florida. ... It's going to

probably be decided in the courts,'' Nader said.

<p>

   The longtime consumer advocate said he opposed hand counts to

determine a winner unless it were done in every county. Whatever

method is used to determine a winner, it should be uniform, he

said.

<p>

   ''I'd be against a hand count in four counties. ... It certainly

calls for a change in the future,'' he said.

<p>

   Despite the possibility of one presidential candidate receiving

the popular vote and one receiving the electoral college vote,

Nader said it was unlikely that the Electoral College would be

abolished.

<p>

   ''The small states like the Electoral College,'' he said, adding

that ''there's no period in our history that provoked the need to

look at change like the last week.''

<p>

   Nader remained unapologetic, urging people to support a ''viable

third party'' that would serve as a watchdog for Republicans and

Democrats after Election Day.

<p>

   ''We're going into more of a lobbying mode,'' he said. ''The

Green Party has to play a watchdog role ... to hold the two

parties' feet to the fire.''

<p>

   No matter who ultimately is named president, Nader said, the

winner isn't likely to get much done due to the closeness of the

race and the makeup of Congress.

<p>

   ''There's not going to be anything bold ... accomplished in the

next four years,'' he said.

<p>

   Nader's long-shot campaign emphasized his criticism of big

business and the two-party political system. He has long insisted

that no major differences exist between the Democrats and the

Republicans -- or their presidential candidates.

<p>

   ''The presidential elections are too much about horse races and

not enough about serious proposals,'' he said.

<p>

   He said it was too early to say whether he would run again in

2004.

<p>

   ''The Green Party effort this year, which will build to

thousands of state, local and federal candidates in the year 2002,

will spell the end of the two-party grip on our political system,''

he said.

<p>

   He said he disagreed with the notion that the Green Party should

build itself from the bottom up.

<p>

   ''I don't buy this start at one end or the other,'' he said.

''We should start at all ends.''
