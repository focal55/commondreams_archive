Dogged 

by years of controversy over its mission and its graduates, the Army's 

School of the Americas is on the 

verge of getting a new charter, a new 

curriculum and a new name. It appears likely, however, to face the 

same old protests.



<p> The Army's plans to reorganize 

the school, which has trained generations of soldiers from Central America and South America, cleared a 

major hurdle this week when the 

House narrowly rejected an amendment that would have closed it down.



<p> If the Senate goes along, as expected, the school that critics have linked 

to human rights violations  by former 

students will officially "close" and 

"reopen" later this year as the Defense Institute for Hemispheric Security Cooperation.



<p> The Army proposed the changes 

last month, prompted by rising opposition to the school from religious 

groups and, more importantly, from 

some members of Congress, who 

nearly succeeded in cutting off the 

school's financing last year.



<p> Opened in Panama in 1946 and 

moved to its current location at Fort 

Benning, Ga., in 1984, the school has 

been the primary training ground for 

more than 60,000 Latin American 

military and police.   

<p>Some were later 

implicated in the region's most notorious abuses, like the murder of six 

Jesuit priests in El Salvador in 1989.



<p> The secretary of the Army, Louis 

Caldera, said in an interview that 

critics have unfairly tarnished the 

school's reputation because of the 

actions of very few. Nonetheless, he 

said, the changes would give the 

school a focus that was more academic and less strictly military. 



<p> "I thought it would be a mistake to 

close the school down," Mr. Caldera 

said, "because that would be turning 

our backs on the countries of Latin 

America."



<p> Because Congress chartered the 

school, the Army had to seek approval for its changes. 



<p> In addition to having a new name, 

the school would have an advisory 

board to review its curriculum and 

report to Congress. Authority over 

the school would be transferred from 

the Army to the Department of Defense, and students would be required to have at least eight hours of 

instruction in human rights in each 

course.



<p> Mr. Caldera said the Army would 

try to increase the number of civilian 

students, and emphasize training political and military leaders in the 

proper role of the military under the 

region's emerging democratic governments.



<p> The school would remain at Fort 

Benning and still offer courses involving purely military tactics and 

strategies, prompting opponents to 

denounce the changes as cosmetic.



<p> When the Army's proposal came 

before the House on Thursday as 

part of the defense authorization bill, 

four members sponsored an amendment to shut the school and create a 

committee to review military training for Latin Americans.



<p> "Even with a new coat of paint, the 

School of the Americas has trained 

far too many killers of innocent people to remain a part of our foreign 

policy," said one of the sponsors, 

Representative John J. Moakley, 

Democrat of Massachusetts. 



<p> But the amendment lost on a roll-call vote of 214 to 204 after lobbying 

by Army, Pentagon and Clinton administration officials. A day before 

the vote, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and Secretary of State 

Madeleine K. Albright sent members 

a joint letter saying the Army's proposal would "allow us to move past 

what had become a contentious annual debate on the school's legacy 

and focus on the question of how best 

to engage militarily our friends and 

allies in the hemisphere."



<p> The Army's proposal won approval when the House overwhelmingly 

approved the larger authorization 

bill late Thursday.



<p> The Rev. Roy L. Bourgeois, a 

priest who has organized protests 

against the school for a decade from 

his apartment at Fort Benning's 

main gate, said the changes would 

not diminish the movement against 

the school. The protests have grown 

from a handful of opponents to a 

crowd in November that was estimated at more than 8,000.



<p> "After thinking this thing out, we 

realized what they're really talking 

about is a name change," he said in a 

telephone interview today. "For us, 

this is the same old school doing 

what it's always been doing."
