MIAMI --    Marie Sylvain, a longtime nursing home worker, was 

so upset about her low wages and workload -- feeding, washing, dressing and 

changing linens for 14 patients each shift -- that she decided to lead a 

unionization drive.	 

<P>  But her employer soon fired her, and the organizing drive quickly fizzled 

as her 70 co-workers feared they would also be dismissed if they pushed for 

a union.	 

</P>

<P>  That was 4 1/2 years ago. Today, Sylvain voices intense frustration that, 

because of extended legal appeals, she has still not been reinstated even 

though a judge ruled nearly three years ago that her firing violated the 

National Labor Relations Act, which prohibits employers from firing or 

otherwise penalizing workers for supporting a union.	 

</P>

<P>  Sylvain is one of thousands of workers who are dismissed, demoted or 

otherwise punished each year for backing a union.	 

</P>

<P>  A recent study of National Labor Relations Board data showed that from 

1992 to 1997, employers fired or otherwise punished more than 125,000 

workers for supporting a union.	 

</P>

<P>

</P>

<P> Numerous academic studies show that it often took three, four, even five 

years for fired workers to be reinstated, delays that union leaders say 

often cause organizing drives to die at a time when the labor movement is 

seeking to add hundreds of thousands of members and reverse its decades-long 

decline.	 

</P>

<P>

</P>

<P> ``U.S. labor law is stacked against employees who wish to organize a 

union, allowing employers to intimidate and coerce workers not to 

unionize,'' said John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO.	 

</P>

<P>  But some experts said unions are having troubles attracting more members 

not because of firings, threats and delays by the labor board but because of 

economic changes, especially the shift from manufacturing to services.	 

</P>

<P>  ``Job growth is coming where unions are historically weak,'' said Leo 

Troy, a labor economist at Rutgers University. ``The economy is leaving 

unions behind. Employer behavior is virtually irrelevant to labor's decline. 

Employer behavior is an easy scapegoat.''	 

</P>

<P>  Labor's concern about obstacles to organizing is one reason labor is 

supporting Vice President Al Gore in the presidential race despite 

differences with him over trade.	 

</P>

<P>  In appearances at union conventions, Gore has vowed to push for changes 

that would make it easier for unions to organize workers.	 

</P>

<P>  ``Vice President Gore has been the most outspoken champion of the freedom 

to join a union since Franklin Delano Roosevelt,'' Sweeney said.	 

</P>

<P>  A recent report by Human Rights Watch concluded that because of 

systematic violations by employers and long delays in obtaining legal 

redress, the United States was violating international agreements 

guaranteeing the rights of workers to form unions.	 

</P>

<P>  ``Most people view these issues as just a labor-management dispute,'' 

said Lance Compa, a Cornell University labor relations professor who wrote 

the report by Human Rights Watch, ``but we think the focus should be that 

there is a right of freedom of association recognized under international 

law, and that right is being widely denied in the United States.''	 

</P>

<P>  In the 1950s, several hundred workers suffered reprisals each year for 

backing a union, according to NLRB data. But Charles Morris, a professor 

emeritus at Southern Methodist University, said that by the late 1990s, 

employers carried out reprisals against more than 20,000 union supporters 

each year. He also found that one out of 18 workers involved in unionization 

drives faces some type of punishment for supporting the union.	 

</P>

<P>  Sylvain said her firing frightened other workers from backing a union at 

Palm Gardens nursing home.	 

</P>

<P>  ``They say, `Look what happened to Marie,' '' said Sylvain, who said she 

was paid $6.50 an hour, so little that she needed food stamps and Medicaid 

to support herself and her two children. ``The law gives you something with 

one hand, and then it takes it away with the other.''	 

</P>

<P>  But business groups argue that after eight years under President Clinton, 

the nation's enforcement is stacked against management, not unions.	 

</P>

<P>  ``Back in the 1950s, unions were fat and happy and represented 35 percent 

of the labor force,'' said Randy Johnson, vice president for labor policy at 

the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Now that they represent just 9 percent of 

private-sector workers, they're blaming the law for their problems.''	 

</P>

<P>  Many labor experts say the penalties that employers face for firing union 

supporters are so modest that it makes economic sense for companies to flout 

the law.	 

</P>

<P>  When the NLRB ruled that Ernest Duval and six other fired workers should 

be reinstated five years after a nursing home in Palm Beach fired them for 

leading a unionization drive, the labor board concluded that he was due 

$1,800 in back pay. The award was modest because federal law requires 

employers to pay the wages workers missed since their dismissal, minus 

whatever they earned in other jobs they took after being fired.	 

</P>

<P>  The Human Rights Watch report said: ``An employer determined to get rid 

of a union activist knows that all that awaits, after years of litigation if 

the employer persists in appeals, is a reinstatement order the worker is 

likely to decline and a modest back-pay award. For many employers, it is a 

small price to pay to destroy a workers' organizing effort by firing its 

leaders.''
