<!--zonk pullout summary -->FEARS that genetically altering foods could produce unexpected new toxic substances were suppressed by the American government, a conference in Edinburgh was told yesterday.<!--zonk endpullout -->

<p>



 A lawyer who has forced the US Food and Drug Administration to disclose documents expressing its own scientists' qualms about GM food tests challenged the organisers of the OECD conference on GM foods and human health to prove that such food on sale in America and Europe was safe.

<p>



 Steven Druker was given access to 40,000 pages of FDA files under public disclosure legislation in pursuit of a lawsuit yet to be resolved. It calls for the FDA to introduce mandatory testing of GM foods and to stop sales until this is done.

<p>



 He told an alternative meeting organised by environmental groups at the Scottish Parliament that the concerns of 11 of 17 FDA scientists responsible for drawing up policy on testing had been ignored when the FDA drew up rules on GM food safety. These allowed the rapid development of the industry in the early 1990s.

<p>



 One of the FDA scientists challenged the principle of "substantial equivalence", the idea that a GM vegetable containing a new gene is effectively the same as its natural constituents. This was developed by the OECD and used by regulators to establish whether food required further safety tests.

<p>



 Dr Linda Kahl told James Maryanski, FDA biotechnology co-ordinator, in one of the internal memorandums released, that the process of genetic modification was fundamentally different to classical plant breeding. Dr E J Matthews, of the FDA's Toxicology Group, said GM plants "could contain unexpected high concentrations of plant toxicants".

<p>



 Mr Druker said that if there were reasonable doubts expressed about the safety of GM crops, they should not be on the market. He accused FDA officials and advisers with close connections to biotechnology companies of having "badly misled" President Clinton and Vice-President Gore. He said the FDA's policy on GM foods was "science debased" and "a national scandal".

<p>



 Dr Maryanski said: "These scientists were doing exactly what they were supposed to be doing, looking at all possible angles of the use of the technology and the implications for food supply. Their views were taken into account in our final policy statement."

<p>



 Prof Sir John Krebs, chairman of the Government's new Food Standards Agency, and chairman of the conference, agreed to take on the questions raised by Mr Druker as part of the agenda.

<p>



 He said he hoped the concerns identified by Mr Druker, the Soil Association, Greenpeace and the Natural Law Party would be discussed and that any unresolved issues would be further refined by the conference and identified in a report to the G8 meeting in July.

<p>



 Earlier, the conference was told that China expected to have half its fields growing GM crops within five years. Prof Zhaingliang Chen, of Beijing University, said that there were between 1.2 million and 2.4 million acres of GM crops in China. It was difficult to be exact as farmers kept seed for further use.

<p>



 This put China third or fourth in the world in the total crops grown. He said GM technology was very important for feeding more than one billion Chinese who lived on only seven per cent of the world's cultivatable land.

<p>



 Twenty GM products were approved for use in China last year, he said, and 25 laboratories were involved in GM rice research. The performance of GM cotton, developed by Monsanto and domestic Chinese laboratories, was "amazing".

<p>



 Prof Chen reported that the unpublished results of 30-day safety tests run by the Chinese on rats fed with GM sweet peppers and tomatoes showed no significant differences to rats fed on conventional vegetables. 

<p>



 This year his university is going to replicate tests on potatoes carried out by Dr Arpad Pusztai, the British scientist, which led him to express concerns about possible toxins created by the process of modification.

<p>



 Prof Gordon Conway, British-born president of the Rockefeller Foundation, and a veteran campaigner against pesticides in agriculture, said the foundation was endorsing GM technology as part of its long-standing concern to feed the world.

<p>



 The concerns of European consumers, who stood to gain nothing from GM food, other than potential risks, were "logical" but there were potential gains for the developing world. "We believe the potential is great, the risks small, but if risks come forward, we will have to rethink that strategy."<br>
