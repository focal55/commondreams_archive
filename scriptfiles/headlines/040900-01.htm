The 

Clinton administration is opposing a 

World Bank proposal that would increase exports from the world's 

poorest and most indebted nations 

for fear that it would inflame sentiments in Congress against President 

Clinton's efforts to win passage of an 

African trade bill and give China 

permanent normal trading status. 



<p> The proposal, pressed by the leaders of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in preparation for their meetings here next 

week, would allow some of the poorest nations of Africa, Latin America 

and Asia to sell  goods to the United 

States and other Western nations 

without facing any tariffs or import 

quotas. That could provide a huge 

economic advantage for those developing countries, going significantly 

beyond the administration's efforts 

to get Congress to forgive their debts 

as they undergo economic reforms. 

<p>The administration's opposition to 

the proposal comes at an awkward 

moment, as demonstrators critical 

of the international lending institutions assemble for a week of protests 

during their meetings. Many of the 

protesters believe that the financial 

groups do too little on behalf of the 

poorest nations.

<p>    But as the trade proposal was argued out behind the closed doors of 

the World Bank and the I.M.F., the 

administration worked behind the 

scenes to scuttle it, said World Bank 

officials involved in the negotiations. 

Those officials said they believed 

that the White House feared that if 

they made such a commitment, it 

would undercut the delicate support 

for the Africa trade bill, which has 

been stuck in Congress, and that any 

promise of further opening America's markets could undermine the 

huge effort to persuade Congress to 

normalize trade with China.



<p>  "We are really caught in the middle here," one senior administration 

official said on Friday, explaining 

why the White House had refused to 

endorse a plan that would aid some 

of the most struggling nations, including Senegal, Nicaragua, Congo, 

Kenya, Honduras and Nigeria, which 

pose little competitive threat to 

American firms.



<p>  "The best way to lift nations out of 

poverty is through trade," the administration official said. "But doing 

the right thing here is not easy. We 

can't even get far more modest 

measures through the Hill."



<p> Charlene Barshefsky, the United 

States trade representative, said she 

had been unaware of the efforts to 

water down the World Bank effort. 

But she said that "the United States 

has a long record of support for and 

delivery of preferential trade privileges for least-developed countries." 



<p> She said that the United States, 

 working with Europe, Japan and 

Canada, has proposed an initiative 

 within the World Trade Organization 

that would take much the same approach as the principles set out by 

the World Bank.   

<p>



<p> Such a program, however, would 

likely be narrower in scope and be 

enacted only after Congress votes on 

the Africa and China issues.



<p> The administration's quandary underscores the enormous economic 

tensions that will be on display in 

Washington in coming days. Poor 

nations will argue, as they did during 

the Seattle trade meetings three 

months ago, that the United States 

and other rich nations are using their 

enormous prosperity and technology 

to grow rapidly at the expense of 

countries being left far behind by 

economic globalization. 



<p> That view is essentially endorsed 

in several reports prepared for the 

spring meetings of the World Bank, 

which fights poverty, and the I.M.F., 

which intercedes in economic crises.



<p> During his radio address today, 

President Clinton briefly mentioned 

his hope that Congress would agree 

to gradually wipe away the debt of 

the poorest nations. 



<p> But in Congress, where labor 

unions and others have argued 

against further opening of American 

markets at a time of record trade 

deficits, there is enormous resistance to removing tariffs or quotas 

that protect American industries 

from low-cost manufacturing 

abroad. 



<p> For example, the Africa trade bill, 

which passed the Senate last November but never passed the House, now 

includes requirements that African 

nations  hoping to export more clothing to the United States duty free buy 

American fabrics. Few of the countries could afford to do so, making 

the market opening relatively worthless to African weavers or small 

manufacturers. (Africa's trade with 

the United States is comparatively 

small. The entire continent, excluding South Africa, exports about $13 

billion in goods to the United States 

each year, slightly more than  Japan 

exports here in a month.)



<p> But without such trade restrictions, members of Congress from 

textile-producing states say they 

would have to vote against the Africa 

bill. And the World Bank and I.M.F. 

proposals would have essentially undercut the bill's protections for 

American companies, committing 

the United States, Europe and Japan 

to unrestricted import of clothing, 

footwear or other goods from the 

most indebted nations.



<p> Administration officials said that 

any such end run around Congress 

would inflame many members, especially Democrats, thus threatening 

the passage of the Africa bill and 

China's entry into the World Trade 

Organization, two main elements of 

Mr. Clinton's agenda for his last year 

in office. 



<p> Documents being prepared for discussion at next week's Washington 

meetings are implicitly critical of 

how little the world's wealthy nations 

have done to keep the divide between 

rich and poor from increasing.



<p> A draft of one such paper, provided 

to The New York Times by the World 

Bank, notes that during the Seattle 

meetings, the head of the bank, 

James D. Wolfensohn, and the recently retired head of the I.M.F., 

Michel Camdessus, called on major 

nations to spur imports from the 

poorest nations. The paper describes 

the strategy as a way to reverse the 

declining trend in foreign aid flows to 

these countries.



<p>The paper refers to the critical 

importance of matching debt relief 

with efforts to encourage exports 

that earn hard currency.



<p>But diplomats involved in the 

drafting of the reports say that the 

wording was toned down at the insistence of the United States and, to a 

lesser degree, France and Japan. 

They all have a huge sensitivity to 

opening their markets, particularly 

for agricultural goods, and particularly in election years, one senior 

World Bank official said. Instead of 

strongly recommending market 

openings, the report now simply 

notes that ministers may wish to 

comment on the subject.
