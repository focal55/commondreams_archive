Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader blitzed 

through Northern California yesterday buoyed by polls that indicated 

he could cost Democrat Al Gore as many as 37 electoral votes.	 



<P>  ``If I was worried about that, I wouldn't have run,'' Nader said 

in an interview with The Chronicle last night as he rode from a 

fund-raiser to his rally in Davis. ``I want to defeat him. I want to 

defeat (George W.) Bush. I want to take more votes than I can 

possibly dream of.''	 

</P>

<P>  Nader has amassed enough support in five critical states -- 

Minnesota, Maine, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington -- to effect 

races where the Bush-Gore matchup is a statistical dead heat, 

pollsters note. And even where his support is not as strong, in a 

handful of other battleground states such as Florida and 

Pennsylvania, the former consumer advocate now also has strong 

potential to affect Gore's fortunes.

</font>``This seems to be a race where there are going to be anywhere 

from a dozen to 20 states that could be decided on four points or 

less,'' said Gore pollster Paul Maslin. ``And in nearly all of those 

states, Nader could make the difference and could cost Gore a 

victory.''

<P>  News of a Nader surge came as the candidate hopscotched across 

California this weekend, drawing a standing room only crowd of 7,000 

cheering supporters to a rally at the Henry J. Kaiser Center in 

Oakland on Saturday. Yesterday, he hit campaign events in Walnut 

Creek and Davis, and will be in Palo Alto tonight.	 

</P>

<P>  But with just over two weeks before election day, Nader's final 

push has increased the possibility of his campaign, once considered a 

mere political asterisk, swinging the outcome of the battle between 

Bush and Gore.	 

</P>

<P> In Oakland, Nader outright rejected the pleas of a dozen former 

followers calling themselves ``Nader's Raiders for Gore'' who 

released a letter Friday calling on him to reconsider his candidacy 

now that the election has become the closest since 1960 -- when John 

F. Kennedy won by one vote per precinct.	 

</P>

<P>  ``It is now clear that you might well give the White House to 

Bush,'' wrote Nader's former colleagues, who said they worked with 

him between 1969 and 1984. ``As a result, you would set back 

significantly the social progress to which you have devoted your 

entire, astonishing career . . . ''	 

</P>

<P>  In the interview, Nader said his focus is not on the other two 

candidates but on the step-by-step process of creating a third party.	 

</P>

<P>  ``We're building a party,'' he said. ``You don't build it in a 

day. You go to a certain stage on Nov. 7th, with millions of votes, 

then you become a watchdog with the only message that these two 

parties understand. You say we got millions of votes on this round, 

and you guys either shape up with these reforms that the American 

people want, or you're going to lose even more votes to Green Party 

candidates in the next election.''	 

</P>

<P>  Nader also denied accusations by the ``Nader's Raiders'' that he 

assured them he would never campaign in states where he would damage 

a chance for a Gore win.	 

</P>

<P>  ``I never said that,'' Nader said. ``Why would anybody ever run 

for president if they were worried about taking votes away from all 

the other candidates? That's what you do in a presidential run.''	 

</P>

<P>  Field Poll director Mark DiCamillo said yesterday that Nader's 

recent boosts are due to ``a decline for Gore in the last two 

weeks.''	 

</P>

<P>  ``It doesn't look as if Gore rallied the troops,'' DiCamillo said 

of apparent voter sentiment after fact, some of his supporters pulled 

away from him.''	 

</P>

<P>   Still unclear, said Gore pollster Maslin, is how many current 

likely Nader voters would have ever been in Gore's camp.	 

</P>

<P>  ``A good half of Nader's vote . . . is going nowhere else,'' he 

said, but the other half ``could slip back to Gore if they felt the 

need. If they don't, it will hurt Gore.''	 

</P>

<P>   Nader followers at this weekend's energetic Oakland rally, like 

John Vance -- selling popular bumper stickers emblazoned with the 

slogan, ``George W. Bush: Serial Killer'' -- said that progressives 

aren't at all nervous about the possibility of Nader's candidacy 

affecting the major two party candidates.	 

</P>

<P> ``If George Bush is elected, more people will get active in the 

protest movement,'' he said. ``You can count on it.'' 	 

</P>

<P>  Such talk both concerns and infuriates Democrats.	 

</P>

<P>  ``Nader wants to become the No. 1 adversary of the Republican 

Party. . . and he's become a politician who is committed to setting 

back progressive causes for decades for his own gain,'' said state 

Democratic Party campaign chairman Bob Mulholland. 	 

</P>

<P>  But the bottom line is now ``a triple threat,'' for Gore, said 

Maslin. ``(Republicans) have more money, they have more enthusiasm 

and energy in their base, and they don't have a third party drag. So 

it's obviously cause for concern right now.''

NADER COUNTRY<br>

Battleground states where significant support for Nader is most 

likely to make a difference:

poll, and Bush leads Gore by three points, 44-41.

Bush, 37 percent for Gore, with 11 percent for ``other.'' Pollsters 

say a significant number are for Nader. 	 

</P>

<P>   -- New Mexico (5 votes): The race is in a dead heat for Bush and 

Gore with Nader at 5 percent.
