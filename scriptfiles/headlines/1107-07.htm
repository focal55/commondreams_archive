<p>Cigarette giant British American Tobacco has withdrawn from Burma, bowing to moral pressure from the Government and human rights campaigners yesterday.

<p>The Burmese factory of the cigarette company, which is chaired by former Conservative MP Kenneth Clarke, is run in partnership with the country's military dictatorship and profits the generals that control its brutal regime.

<p>BAT yesterday said it had sold its stake in Rothmans of Myanmar, a joint venture between BAT and the state dictatorship that has been in power since 1962, to a Singapore-based investment company. The move was met with "delight" from Mike O'Brien, the Foreign Office minister, who in July delivered an unprecedented ultimatum to BAT to end its investment in the country.

<p>"I am delighted that BAT, has responded to the Government's request that they leave the country," Mr O'Brien said. "It was inappropriate for a British company that cares about its corporate social responsibility to be participating in a joint venture with the business arm of Burma's military dictatorship."

<p>The Government has had a long-standing policy not to encourage trade, investment or tourism in Burma, where the regime is guilty of multiple human rights abuses. Freedom of speech, the press, assembly and association are severely limited in the country. Citizens are arbitrarily detained and there are substantial reports of extra-judicial killings, rape, and torture.

<p>The Government's campaign stepped up after Aung San Suu Kyi - the democratically elected leader of Burma who has been denied power by the dictatorship since 1990 - was arrested in May. She was, until recently, held in prison and remains under house arrest.

<p>Despite meeting the Government's demands, BAT was yesterday unrepentant about its 10-year investment in Burma. "We continue to believe that it is not the best way forward for businesses to withdraw unilaterally from countries whose human rights records have been criticized," a BAT statement said. "The sale follows the exceptional formal request by the British Government in July and we are leaving our role in Rothmans with regret."

<p>BAT yesterday said that businesses "can contribute in developing countries by operating to internationally recognized standards." Some workers in the BAT factory, however, earn only 17p a day, alleges Burma Campaign UK, which has been lobbying against BAT for the past 12 months. This compares to 60p a day for workers in the Burmese plant of Triumph International, the underwear manufacturer that recently withdrew from the country.

<p>The cigarette company has consistently defended its position in the country on the grounds that it provides jobs to the region. Yesterday BAT claimed that, because the business has been sold as a going concern, the 500 jobs at the factory had been secured.

<p>BAT was the largest British company with an investment in Burma, following a number of withdrawals this year. Premier Oil, travel company Kuoni and advertising giant WPP have all ended operations in Burma following Government scrutiny.

<p>"This is a huge victory," said John Jackson, director of the Burma Campaign UK. "They had to be dragged out kicking and screaming, but at least they are out. If a company like BAT can be forced out of Burma, any company can be. This will deter any British companies thinking of doing business in Burma. British boardrooms know investing in Burma is a PR disaster."

<p>Burma Campaign UK says it will target travel companies that promote tourism to the region and retailers that source produce from Burma.
