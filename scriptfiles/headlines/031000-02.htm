<p>Pollutants that waft from major industries are stifling

precipitation in many regions of the world, in some cases eliminating

almost all rain and snow produced by clouds, according to a new,

multinational study by atmospheric scientists published today.

<p>For decades, scientists have debated whether urban air pollution can

alter a region's rainfall. The new study, for the first time, seems to

provide direct evidence that tiny particles in industrial pollution cause

physical changes in clouds that prevent water from condensing into

raindrops and snowflakes,

<p>Daniel Rosenfeld, an atmospheric scientist at Hebrew University of

Jerusalem, said his research "shows unambiguously that air pollution can

shut off precipitation completely from certain types of clouds." The

results, reported in the journal Science, "might indicate that human

activity may be altering clouds and natural precipitation on a global

scale," he said.

<p>Because numerous factors can influence precipitation, documenting

pollution's effect on overall rainfall levels remains difficult. But

Rosenfeld said he has shown that weather changes can spread hundreds of

miles downwind of a large industry's plume of pollution.

<p>The scientist tracked pollutants from a coal-burning power plant in

remote Australia, factories in Turkey and a smelter in Canada.

<p>Many questions remain about how pollution affects rain and snow around

the globe, especially because some previous studies have indicated that

it might have the opposite effect of increasing rainfall. But Owen Toon,

a University of Colorado scientist, wrote in an accompanying article in

Science that the pollution plumes in the study will "serve as a Rosetta

stone for the potential impact" in more urbanized and industrialized

areas, where pollution sources are ubiquitous.

<p>In the study, satellite images were used for the first time to

simultaneously track pollution and measure the precipitation and

structure of clouds over large expanses of sky. In the past, scientists

used airplanes to probe individual clouds.

<p>Rosenfeld reported that it is a physical process, rather than a

chemical one, that blocks formation of rain and snow. Industrial plants

spew particles, formed by fuel combustion, that are much smaller than the

water droplets normally found in clouds.

<p>The small pollution particles inhibit the cloud's water droplets from

coalescing into larger drops to create rain. Smaller water droplets are

also slower to freeze, reducing the ice particles in clouds.

<p>In types of clouds that are short-lived, the lack of larger droplets

reduces or even eliminates precipitation, the report says.

<p>"Since the 1970s, people have been looking for the smoking gun to back

up this theory, and it sounds like he may have found it," said Stephen E.

Schwartz, an atmospheric scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory in

New York. "It sounds like [Rosenfeld] has a nice, clean case."

<p>Experts do not know what, if any, impact pollution is having on rain

and snow in the United States or other urbanized countries, where most

clouds are polluted to some degree. If there is an impact, it could have

serious consequences in Southern California, where the air contains high

levels of particulate pollution, and water derived from rain and snow is

scarce.

<p>In the Los Angeles area, the types of clouds likely to be altered by

pollution are ones of "modest depth," Rosenfeld said, "that come from the

west in typical winter days characterized by intermittent, moderate rain

showers."

<p>Rosenfeld said he cannot speculate on what his findings may mean for

areas like California, where there are no large smelters or coal-burning

plants. But he said: "It does not take a very large level of pollution,

by health standards, to affect the clouds to producing smaller droplets."

<p>The tiny size of the particles in the pollution seems to be the most

important factor in inhibiting rain and snow. Most of the fine particles

in the Los Angeles region's air come from trucks and cars, not heavy

industries.

<p>The most striking plumes of pollution in the study were in southern

Australia, home to the world's largest lead smelter, mineral-processing

plants and a large coal-burning power plant. The pollutants there were

easy to track because the area has fairly pristine, blue skies. Rosenfeld

found that polluted clouds were producing hardly any raindrops and ice

crystals, while unpolluted clouds did produce them.

<p>Scientists have long speculated about the impact of urban and

industrial air pollution on rainfall and snow patterns. Some had thought

particle pollution inhibits precipitation, similar to what happens with

smoke from forest fires. But some scientists recently have reported the

opposite--increased rainfall--downwind of some paper mills and over some

urban areas.

<p>Barbara Finlayson-Pitts, an atmospheric chemist at UC Irvine, was

surprised by Rosenfeld's findings. She said nearly all evidence recently

has indicated that pollution from ships and other sources could increase

precipitation.

<p>The new study differs, though, because it actually tracked pollutants

and studied clouds over large areas.

<p>If pollution is actually stifling rainfall, why have scientists

studying specific areas been unable to document any correlations between

urban pollution and overall precipitation? Rosenfeld said it may be

because urban areas are inflicting other changes in clouds, too, that

could offset the effects of pollution. For example, a power plant

generates heat that could make clouds grow larger in the immediate area

than they would naturally.

<p>"There are a lot of subtleties responsible for whether we get rain or

not," Schwartz said.

<p>Rosenfeld said the rain-reducing effects of pollutants are often

strongest many miles downwind of industries, so it has been difficult to

pinpoint a cause and effect.

<p>"At least now," with the new satellite images, he said, "we have

evidence that pollution can suppress precipitation." The next step, he

said, is quantifying how big of an effect the pollution is having.

<p>Environmental regulators, especially in California, have recently

begun focusing on cleaning up particle pollution, which in the Los

Angeles Basin comes largely from diesel vehicles. The push for new

regulations, which has been controversial because of the high cost, has

been driven by concerns about lung disease and public health, not

weather.
