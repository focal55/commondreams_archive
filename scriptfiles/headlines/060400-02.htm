With a deft piece of pre-summit manoeuvring, Vladimir Putin has put Bill Clinton in a tricky position over US missile defence plans.

<p>

The Russian president has put forward a new and intriguing plan to contain rogue states ahead of today's meeting with his American counterpart, one that will make a lot of sense to opponents of Washington's current nuclear defence scheme. 

<p>

It shows that Mr Putin will provide a more complex and more formidable challenge to the US than his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin.

<p>

The US wants to use interceptors and radar to block missile attacks from countries such as Iran and North Korea. 

<p>

The plan for a National Missile Defence is a long way short of Star Wars, the 1980s plan to defend the US. But it has antagonised Russia and China, which fear it would upset the delicate international balance of nuclear forces, as well as Europe, which is concerned that America could retreat behind its own security blanket.

<p>

Mr Putin's new idea is bold and creative. In an interview with NBC, he suggested shooting down missiles immediately after launch rather than intercepting them before they land. That would help defend all states, including Europe and Russia, he said.

<p>

"There are new threats arising that we must address but our proposal is to answer them together," said Mr Putin.

<p>

Noting that the new threats come from countries with only long-range ground-based missiles, he said the best way to target them was at launch. "They don't have nuclear submarines and they don't have planes with atomic weapons on board, so we could put up these umbrellas above potential areas of threat," he said.

<p>

"We could jointly with this umbrella protect all of Europe. We have these possibilities both technically, and politically. We would like to propose them and we would like to discuss that issue with President Clinton."

<p>

The US reacted cautiously, but the Russian iniative is very much at odds with the complex (and many believe unworkable) plan under development by Washington. 

<p>

Missile defence is accepted by both US political parties, and President Clinton is expected to push for its deployment later this year.

<p>

"We'll talk about it in Russia,'' said Mr Clinton, who arrived in Moscow yesterday afternoon ahead of today's summit. "It won't be long now." 

<p>

America wants Russia to agree to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty so that missile defence can go ahead.

<p>

Mr Putin indicated some flexibility on this point. "We believe that is an important foundation agreement in this area. And we think that... considering both each other's interests and the changing world, we can by combining our efforts in this area, find a solution without destroying the ABM treaty," he said.

<p>

By showing room for manoeuvre, coming up with a creative idea and indicating concern for broader European worries, Mr Putin has shown considerable skill.

<p>

His approach will be contrasted favourably by many Europeans with the increasingly inflexible, arrogant approach of the US.

<p>

The American president has been warned about the US missile plans by Chancellor Gerhard Schr&ouml;der. Speaking on Friday, the German leader said that the defence scheme "could have effects well beyond the USA".
