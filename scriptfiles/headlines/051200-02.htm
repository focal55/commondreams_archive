ATLANTA  -        Ford Motor Co., which depends on sport utility 

vehicles for much of its profit, acknowledged yesterday that they cause 

serious safety and environmental problems.

<P>  In its first ``corporate citizenship report,'' issued at the company's 

annual shareholders' meeting in Georgia's capital, Ford Motor said SUVs 

contribute more than cars to global warming, emit more smog-causing 

pollution and endanger other motorists. The automaker said it will keep 

building them because they are so profitable, but will seek technological 

solutions and look for alternatives to the big vehicles.	 

</P>

<P>  Ford Motor's voluntary admission that it faces a ``dilemma'' because its 

most profitable products are not socially responsible has few parallels, 

according to Business for Social Responsibility, a corporate group in San 

Francisco.	 

</P>

<P>  In an interview, William C. Ford Jr., the company's 

</P>

<P>43-year-old chairman and a great-grandson of Henry Ford, depicted the company's statements as a combination 

of altruism and long-term business planning. He said he worries that 

automakers could wind up with reputations like those of big tobacco 

companies if they ignore sport utilities' problems.	 

</P>

<P>  Yet Ford and Jacques Nasser, Ford Motor's chief executive, said they had 

no plans to stop making sport utilities, including the immense Ford 

Excursion, which weighs as much as two Jeep Grand Cherokees and gets just 10 

miles to the gallon in the city and 13 on the highway.	 

</P>

<P>  ``If we didn't provide that vehicle, someone else would, and they 

wouldn't provide it as responsibly as we do,'' Ford said.	 

</P>

<P>  Nasser cautioned that while customers consistently say in market surveys 

that they want more environmentally responsible products, they are unwilling 

to pay more for them or to sacrifice features on their sport utilities.	 

</P>

<P>  SUVs are three times as likely as cars to kill the other driver in a 

crash, but the death rate for sport utility occupants is just as high as for 

car occupants because of sport utilities' tendency to roll over and their 

lack of crumple zones. Although current regulations allow large sport 

utilities to emit up to 5.5 times as much smog-causing pollution a mile as 

cars, President Clinton announced rules in December that will require sport 

utilities to meet the same standards as cars by 2009.	 

</P>

<P>  For the last two years, Ford Motor has voluntarily built its sport 

utilities to emit far less pollution than allowed by law. Ford has also 

voluntarily installed bars below the bumpers of the Excursion to reduce the 

risk that it will override cars during collisions, even though there are no 

federal regulations requiring this.	 

</P>

<P>  With sport utilities accounting for a fifth of Ford's sales -- up from 5 

percent in 1990 -- and the bulk of its profit, the automaker's financial 

stability could be affected if the sport utility market slumped, warns 

Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency.	 

</P>

<P>   Although Ford does not release profit margins by model, financial 

analysts say the company earns $10,000 to $15,000 per vehicle on Ford 

Expeditions and Lincoln Navigators and as much as $18,000 on each Ford 

Excursion. The factory in Wayne, Mich., that builds the Expedition and 

Navigator is the world's most profitable in any industry, generating roughly 

$3 billion a year in pretax profit.	 

</P>

<P>  Yet yesterday's report clearly expressed the company's concern that the 

big vehicles have inherent problems. ``Sustainability concerns associated 

with SUVs raise issues relative to Ford's corporate citizenship 

commitment,'' the report said, later adding: ``We believe that the steps 

Ford has taken to date are only a beginning in addressing the issues raised 

by these products.'' Ford's goal, the report added, is to find solutions 

that satisfy customers and maintain the company's market dominance while 

``meeting our environmental, social and economic objectives.''	 

</P>

<P>  In a question-and-answer section of yesterday's report, Ford said it 

might be difficult to persuade Wall Street that it is worthwhile for Ford 

Motor to take big steps to be perceived as a progressive, environmentally 

friendly company.	 

</P>

<P>  ``Analysts are focused on the next quarter's report, and at most, your 

next year's report,'' he said. ``And the kinds of issues we've been 

discussing today have payoffs 5, 10, 20, 50 years down the line. I do 

believe that I'm building a stronger Ford Motor Co. for my children and 

grandchildren. But that's not a theme that resonates very well with most 

analysts.''	 

</P>

<P>  Ford's comments yesterday confirm a shift in his position on SUVs. An 

ardent fly fisherman who bought his own fly-fishing rod company, he has been 

active in environmental causes since his days at prep school and then 

Princeton.	 

</P>

<P>  But he was also one of the company board's most enthusiastic supporters 

of the decision to introduce the Ford Expedition full-size sport utility 

vehicle in 1996.
