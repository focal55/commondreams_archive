JERUSALEM (October 30, 2000 7:11 a.m. EST ) - Israel plans to take the offensive against Palestinian gunmen and deploy special army units trained in guerrilla warfare, the deputy defense minister said Monday, as embattled Prime Minister Ehud Barak launched a fight in parliament for his political survival. 

<P> The death toll in more than a month of Israeli-Palestinian 

fighting rose to 141 on Monday after the body of a 20-year-old 

Palestinian was discovered in a West Bank olive grove that was the 

scene of clashes the night before. The man's twin brother was 

killed by Israeli fire in the same incident, Palestinian doctors said. 

<P> In the Gaza Strip, a roadside bomb went off near an Israeli 

military convoy, close to the border with Egypt. An Israeli officer 

was lightly injured, the army said. 

<P> Israel's deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, announced Monday 

that the army is changing its tactics in dealing with Palestinian 

gunmen who have been shooting at Jewish settlements and army 

outposts in the West Bank and Gaza, usually at night. 

<P> Sneh said troops would no longer only respond to Palestinian 

fire, but take the initiative.

<P> "Now we are saying that instead of 

following a method which is somewhat mechanical, we will use a 

method which uses our advantages ... small units, units 

well-trained in guerrilla warfare," Sneh told Israel army radio. 

<P> Israel's response to gunfire has included tank shells and 

missiles shot from helicopter gunships. On Sunday, the army sent 

tanks and armored personnel carriers to secure free movement of 

Jewish settlers on a key road cutting through Gaza, site of violent 

Palestinian protests. The tanks were soon shooting from mounted machine-guns in response to fire from Palestinian police. 

<P> Heavy gunbattles erupted overnight in several locations, 

including the West Bank resort town of Jericho, once a tranquil 

Judean Desert oasis. Bullets shattered the glass facade of the 

Oasis Casino, once a magnet for Israeli visitors. 

<P> For the second time this month, the army sealed Jericho, barring 

Palestinians from entering or leaving the town. 

<P> Israel's parliament, meanwhile, returned from a three-month 

summer recess Monday, heightening Barak's worries about his 

political survival. Barak, who controls only 30 seats in the 

120-member parliament, has been courting the leader of the hawkish 

opposition, Ariel Sharon, whose visit to a disputed Jerusalem 

shrine last month has been cited by the Palestinians as the trigger 

for the current violence. 

<P> However, Barak and Sharon remained at odds Monday over the terms 

of their cooperation. Sharon wants the right to veto negotiations 

with the Palestinians. "If he (Barak) agrees to abandon, to leave the mistaken path, we will go with him," Sharon said. 

<P> But Barak has balked at Sharon's demands. "Sharon wants to 

push us to the termination of the peace process," complained Sneh, 

who is close to Barak. 

<P> Political commentators said it was unlikely that Sharon's Likud would 

join Barak's coalition. Despite his failure to woo Sharon, Barak 

appeared in no immediate danger of being toppled. The 

ultra-Orthodox Shas party, citing a national emergency, said it 

would not vote against the government for the next month. 

<P> Without Shas, which controls 17 seats in parliament, a drive by 

the opposition to topple Barak would lose its momentum. Shas is a 

former member of Barak's coalition, but defected in the summer to 

protest concessions to the Palestinians. 

<P> With Barak's apparent failure to bring Sharon into his 

government, the way remained open for an eventual resumption of 

peace talks. Both sides have said they are interested in returning 

to negotiations, though with conditions attached. 

<P> Israel has said it would not negotiate under the threat of 

violence, and the Palestinians have said Israel must withdraw its 

troops from the edges of Palestinian towns. 

<P> President Clinton has been trying to revive Israeli-Palestinian 

negotiations, and has invited Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser 

Arafat to Washington for separate talks, though no date has been 

set. 

<P> Arafat on Monday held talks with Egyptian President Hosni 

Mubarak, a key Mideast mediator, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik.
