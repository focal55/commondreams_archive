BRATTLEBORO, Vt.<wbr>--<wbr>Mindful of a law banning booze on municipal property, Annette Cappy

will stop short of serving champagne. But to the town clerk in this

southern Vermont village, opening her office just after midnight this

morning--the minute that civil unions between same-sex couples become

legal here--seems like the right thing to do.

<p>"This office has been known to stay open for 24 hours on the first day

of hunting season," Cappy said. "I figure if we did it for people who

want to shoot animals, I can do it for two people in love."

<p>Sure enough, as the nation's most sweeping gay rights legislation

takes effect today, scores of couples from around Vermont, and some from

outside the state, will descend on town halls to plunk down $20 for a

license giving them everything heterosexual couples have--except the word

"marriage." Much of the state is celebrating, but some opponents of what

amounts to gay marriage are less than overjoyed. Though no one could

predict just how many civil union licenses would be issued today, some

who sought them laughed about Vermont's new argot.

<p>"David and I are saying we're being unionized," said John Castaldo,

who can now legally refer to his companion of eight years, David Myette,

as his spouse. The couple lives in Waterbury, where Castaldo, 51, works

for a granite consortium and Myette, 52, handles financial aid for a

small college.

<p>With a 9 a.m. appointment to get their civil union license from the

town clerk in tiny Williston, 57-year-old Lynn Goyette said she and

Eileen Blackwood, 41, would continue to call each other what for 13 years

they always have. "Hon."

<p>Perhaps predictably, a clever strain of commercialism is finding its

way into the weekend's celebrations. Jewelers from around the state

pushed "civil union rings." Bakers made sure to have lots of same-sex

wedding figures on hand to stick on top of cakes. A boutique brewery

(owned by lesbians) issued a new golden amber, Gay Pride Ale. Brewery

partners Liz Trott and Janice Moran marketed their elixir with the

slogan, "The beer to come out for."

<p>300 Benefits Extended to Same-Sex Couples

</b>

<p>Vermont's groundbreaking law extends more than 300 benefits normally

associated with marriage to gay and lesbian couples. To couples who form

a civil union, inheritance rights are now automatic, as are the authority

to make medical decisions for an incapacitated partner, the right to take

control of a partner's body upon death, the right to transfer property

from one partner to another without tax consequences and the right to be

treated as an economic unit for tax purposes. Conversely, a civil union

must be dissolved in a court proceeding similar to divorce.

<p>"It's a huge step," said Blackwood, a lawyer. Three years ago, after

10 years together, she and Goyette, a mental health counselor, held a

giant, weeklong celebration to affirm their commitment among family and

friends. They wear rings because, Goyette said, "we're ring people." But

both see marriage as a patriarchal institution--so much so that when the

law passed, Blackwood called Goyette to crow, "Guess what, we don't have

to get married!"

<p>Still, the pair saw civil union status as such a significant civil

rights victory that they wanted to be among the first to sign up. "In

this case," said Blackwood, "the personal is definitely political."

<p>Though the benefits of the bill passed in April after sometimes

agonizing debate do not apply outside Vermont, some couples nonetheless

trekked here from other states and places. Cappy had appointments for

couples from New York, New Jersey, North Carolina and Washington, D.C.

<p>"It's by far the greatest thing that's happened to gay people in the

United States," said John Campbell, who is driving to Vermont from

Edison, N.J., for a civil union ceremony with Richard Harrison, his

partner of 13 years.

<p>Campbell, a retired VA Hospital administrator, is 70 ("you would ask")

and HBO executive Harrison is 45. "But he was the aggressor," Campbell

insisted. "He went after a dirty old man like me and he got me." Long ago

they drew up living wills, put all their possessions in both names and

began wearing matching rings. So to some extent, they conceded, their

vows in Vermont before a justice of the peace will be symbolic only.

<p>"We're just celebrating the fact that a state is recognizing a

relationship like ours," Campbell said. "If it was marriage, we'd be

coming home and throwing a big reception. But it's not, so we won't be

doing that. We're just so excited that this is happening."

<p>Not everyone shares this enthusiasm. The town clerks in half a dozen

or so Vermont hamlets resigned rather than distribute civil union

licenses. "It's a moral issue with me," explained Helen O'Donnell, as she

resigned the clerkship of Tunbridge. "I don't want my name on a document

supporting that."

<p>A group of 15 state legislators promised to renew their efforts after

they lost a court battle to overturn the law. Groups with names like

Vermont Speaks, Vermonters Taking a Stand and Vermonters for Traditional

Marriage have sprouted in direct opposition of the law. Gov. Howard Dean,

a Democrat who changed his mind after initial opposition, last week wrote

the state's Catholic bishop, urging him to make sure that "hatred and

intolerance will have no place" in the debate.

<b><br>

<p>Milestone Comes Amid Court Defeat

</b>

<p>Vermont's breakthrough in civil rights for gays and lesbians takes

effect, moreover, in the same week when they suffered a bitter defeat as

the U.S. Supreme Court approved banning gays from leadership positions in

the Boy Scouts.

<p>But Bill Lippert, the state's only openly gay legislator, said the

progress in Vermont is irrevocable. "Despite all the threats by all the

opponents we will never go back," said Lippert, who helped draft the

legislation.

<p>"The significance goes well beyond the couples who are adult right

now," he said. "For the young gay and lesbian people, they now get to

grow up with the image of the choice and the possibility of forming

loving, deeply committed relationships that can be affirmed with all the

legal protections and rights that any other couple can have, at least in

the state of Vermont."

<p>Castaldo said one reason they were delaying their ceremony until

August is that Myette's 26-year-old son from a long-ago marriage would be

home from Japan to stand up for his father. An Episcopal priest will

administer their vows at their home, with splendid mountain views all

around. After eight years together, Castaldo said he and Myette will

trade rings and probably wear suits for the ceremony, then change into

shorts for a grand old barbecue.

<p>"Why do it?" asked Castaldo. "I think we want to take our relationship

up one level. We both realize we want to be able to do this commitment

for ourselves spiritually, but I think a lot has to do with legal

protection. Our biggest fear is that if one of us is sick, we would be

denied access."

<p>The same concerns prompted Holly Puterbaugh, 54, and Lois Farnham, 55,

to join the lawsuit three years ago that helped lead to the new law. The

pair adopted and raised a daughter, now 19. Their fireplace is a small

shrine to the concept of family, a word spelled out in wooden blocks,

lest there be any confusion. They have lived together almost 28 years.

<p>Puterbaugh, a mathematics instructor at the University of Vermont, and

Farnham, a school nurse supervisor, invited hundreds of people to their

civil union celebration today in South Burlington. Later in the summer,

they will honeymoon in Nova Scotia.

<p>Hours before the big day, they were still pinching themselves in happy

disbelief. For years it had seemed that the state-sanctioned

relationship--"legitimization," in Puterbaugh's words--would remain

elusive. So for their celebration, they chose a song, "The Impossible

Dream," to reflect their feelings.

<p>Was the Green Mountain state setting the stage for the rest of the

country? Advocates are optimistic that several other states, including

Hawaii and New Hampshire, may consider similar measures. "I hope so,"

said Farnham. "I hope so."
