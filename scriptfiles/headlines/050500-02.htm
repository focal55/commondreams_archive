LONDON, May 4 - Voters here went to the polls today to pick the first citywide mayor in the capital's history, and all signs suggested that they would give the new post to a self-styled "proud socialist" who considers the traditional family to be "unnatural" and who declared last month that "international capitalism has killed many more people than Adolf Hitler."

<p>

No matter what groups he has offended during the lively mayoral campaign, however, Ken Livingstone--known to every Londoner as "Red Ken"--was evidently headed for victory, according to BBC exit polls tonight that suggested he had a commanding lead over Conservative candidate Steve Norris.</p>

<p>

One reason for Livingstone's appeal is the candidate himself: He's a witty, self-deprecating man in a scruffy trench coat who spins out his populist slogans in the cockney accent of a real son of London's East End. The other big factor is the long list of Livingstone's enemies--starting with the nation's most powerful politician, Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p>

<p>

Blair, who pulled his left-leaning Labor Party forcefully toward the center in the 1990s to win control of the national government, devised a complicated nominating process that resulted in the selection of his hand-picked candidate over Livingstone. So Livingstone, 54, ran for mayor as an independent, and was expelled from the party. "Voting for Ken has become a way for ordinary people to stand up to Tony and his establishment friends," said political analyst Jonathan Freedland.</p>

<p>

Blair recently blasted Livingstone as a "chat show candidate" who is "more about personality than policy." But that description could apply to the entire campaign--or, for that matter, to the job of mayor.</p>

<p>

London, a city of 7 million, is divided into 33 separate jurisdictions, each with its own elected council and ceremonial "lord mayor." In today's election, the voters were choosing, for the first time, a mayor for the entire city and a 25-member citywide council. The new mayor and council will be high in visibility, but low in authority.</p>

<p>

Most city functions--police, education, taxation, urban planning--will remain the preserve of Britain's national government. London's new mayor will have some authority over funding mass transit, but the main responsibility will be "to speak up for London at home and abroad," according to the legislation that created the post.</p>

<p>

"The mayor is going to be a new type of figure in British politics," said Prof. Tony Travers of the London School of Economics. "This is a job where personality matters much more than party. We haven't really had politics like that before."</p>

<p>

And Livingstone is clearly a candidate who can provide personality. "Ken Livingstone is a regular cockney cheeky chappie," he said last week as he barnstormed the city atop a bright purple campaign bus. "He's no stooge for the party machines."</p>
