PRAGUE, Czech Republic<wbr> - <wbr>Organizers of protests aimed at the joint meeting of the

International Monetary Fund and the World Bank here later this month say

they want the demonstrations to be peaceful. But Prague authorities are

gearing up for potential chaos.

<p>"You simply cannot, in a nonviolent way, block the arrival of the

cars, block the arrival of the delegates and interrupt the opening of the

meeting," said Lt. Col. Ladislav Briza of the Czech national police, who

predicted that 20,000 protesters will show up. "There's bound to be some

contact--if not with the delegates, then with the police encircling the

no-entry zone."

Among the activists already in Prague is Hilary Keever, 24, an

American who took part in the demonstrations against the World Trade

Organization in Seattle last year. She's working on the Web site of the

protesters' umbrella organization, INPEG (the Czech initials for the

Initiative Against Economic Globalization).

<p>Keever said she believes that the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank are

catering to corporations and "are more interested in [poor] countries

having export economies" than in "building up the country in a

sustainable way."

<p>She said she hopes that the Prague protests will promote "a better

world where there's less division between rich and poor, and cancellation

of debt for the poorest nations. We're immensely interested in making

sure people don't die from starvation--basic things like this."

<p>Officials of these organizations vigorously dispute the charge that

they fail to help the world's poor, although they admit to some

shortcomings in past policies and say they have already made appropriate

changes.

<p>Czech President Vaclav Havel, himself a former anti-Communist

dissident, is seeking to bridge the gap between the protesters and their

targets by inviting representatives of both sides to a panel discussion

at Prague Castle on Sept. 23, three days before the start of the main

IMF-World Bank meeting.

<p>"President Havel's primary aim is to create an atmosphere for a

cultivated dialogue," the presidential office said.

<p>But the protesters' plans--which are expected to include efforts to

keep delegates from reaching their meeting hall Sept. 26 and stronger

efforts to block them from getting out again--have triggered feverish

preparations to cope with large-scale disruptions and potential violence.

<p>Classes have been canceled for the week of Sept. 25, with parents

urged to send their children out of town. Hospitals have been designated

for protesters and police officers who might be injured. Special police

training has included practice in how to cope with protesters throwing

Molotov cocktails.

<p>Police have imposed tough checks to keep potentially violent

demonstrators out of the country.

<p>More than 5,000 police officers and civilian police employees will be

brought to the capital to supplement the city's regular police force of

about 6,100, Briza said. The army will provide 1,400 soldiers to

reinforce regional police left understaffed by the transfers to Prague,

and 200 soldiers will be in the capital to move heavy equipment such as

trucks or blocking devices to reinforce a cordon around the delegates'

meeting hall, he said.

<p>City authorities, concerned that masses of protesters might sleep in

parks, have granted permission to a tent-manufacturing firm to run a camp

for protesters at Prague's huge Strahov sports arena, charging $36 per

stay.

<p>"We are preparing tents for 1,500 people, and the rest will be

sleeping in their own tents," said Tomas Doubek, 39, an employee of the

company, who said he proposed the tent city partly as a way to promote

dialogue rather than violent confrontation.

<p>"We think there's a great chance that if the people can eat and sleep

in peace, they won't be so nervous and irritable and will have a greater

chance to express their opinions in a peaceful manner," Doubek said.
