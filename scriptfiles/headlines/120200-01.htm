BARRANCABERMEJA, Colombia (AP) - Hard-eyed men with Uzis stood

guard as Sen. Paul Wellstone stepped out of a helicopter and into a

bulletproof car and drove to a meeting with human rights activists.

Hours earlier, police said they discovered a bomb along the airport

road.

<p>U.S. and Colombian authorities Friday downplayed the possibility

that Wellstone and U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson, who accompanied

the Minnesota Democrat, were the intended targets of the bomb.

Their visit marked the first time a U.S. lawmaker or ambassador had

come to the deadliest town in all the Americas - a sweltering

cluster of cinderblock homes on the banks of the muddy Magdalena

River.

<p>There was heavy security for the U.S. officials during their

three-hour visit Thursday. But Barrancabermeja's 195,000 residents

have no such protection: this year alone, 470 of them have been

slain in politically motivated attacks, human rights workers say.

Massacres are commonplace, and the killers are rarely caught.

<p>Wellstone said he made the perilous journey to show support for

the human rights activists, who face immense risk.

<p>``I don't know whether I was targeted, but I certainly know that

the human rights activists are targeted,'' Wellstone told an

airport news conference on his return to Minneapolis on Friday.

<p>For Wellstone, a former civil rights activist and college

professor, his two-day visit to Colombia also was aimed at making a

stand against Plan Colombia, a drug-eradication effort being funded

by $1.3 billion from Washington. Under the plan, dozens of

U.S.-donated combat helicopters will ferry U.S.-trained Colombian

troops into cocaine-producing plantations to seize them from

insurgents.

<p>But while the military is being strengthened, Wellstone says

there is no firm plan to provide coca farmers with alternative

livelihoods. He fears they will then be driven into the ranks of

leftist guerrillas or the rival right-wing paramilitary group, the

United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC.

<p>Moreover, Wellstone is concerned that President Clinton 

authorized delivery of the aid even though the Colombian government

has not met all the human rights conditions set by Congress. Among

outstanding concerns is that the Colombian military has not severed

its links to the AUC. The paramilitaries, responsible for numerous

massacres of suspected guerrilla sympathizers, remain allied with

the army in the field in anti-guerrilla operations. Many AUC gunmen

are former government soldiers.

<p>``If we continue to waive the (human rights) provisions of the

aid package, then the message we are sending to the paramilitaries

and the military is that human rights is not important to us,''

Wellstone told The Associated Press as he flew to Barrancabermeja.

<p>Wellstone said he asked President Andres Pastrana on Wednesday

for the government to bring paramilitary leaders to trial and

protect human rights workers. Human rights workers whom Wellstone

met with said the AUC was responsible for most of the killings in

Barrancabermeja, 155 miles north of the capital, Bogota.

<p>There were questions, meanwhile, about who was the intended

target of the bomb, and its location. Barrancabermeja's police

commander said the bomb was found on the road from the airport to

the city. However, local journalists who witnessed the device being

dismantled said it was found in a neighborhood far from the

highway. It was not immediately possible to reconcile the two

reports.

<p>The White House said it did not view Wellstone and Patterson as

targets and State Department officials said it wasn't unusual for

such devices to be found in Barrancabermeja. Colombian police said

first that it appeared to be an assassination attempt, and then

later said it did not. Police said a man they arrested in

connection with the case, whom they identified as a member of the

rebel National Liberation Army, was not telling them who the

intended target was. Many residents of Barrancabermeja knew of the planned visit by

the U.S. delegation. But security forces had kept confidential

plans to transfer the party from the airport to the town by

helicopter.

<p>Earlier Thursday, Wellstone and Patterson flew aboard a Black

Hawk combat helicopter to observe a raid by heavily armed Colombian

national police on a plantation near the village of Taraza, 220

miles northwest of Bogota.

<p>Huddled on the mountainside, 32 coca harvesters - itinerant

workers who pull the leaves off the bushes and work in a

rudimentary processing lab for $4 to $5 per day - watched as police

torched the lab. It was quickly enveloped in flames, sending a

plume of black smoke over the jungle-covered mountains and a blast

of intense heat that could be felt 100 yards away.

<p>Jorge Perez, a 24-year-old father of two, took a deep drag off

his cigarette and shook his head.

<p>``Now we'll be without work,'' Perez said. ``Working the coca

fields is the only way to make money around here.''
