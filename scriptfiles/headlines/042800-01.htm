WASHINGTON  - A coalition of more than 90

environmental groups from Canada, Mexico and the United States are

demanding their governments immediately suspend secret meetings

they say aim to change the environmental side agreements of the

North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

<P>

According to documents released by the US Environmental Protection

Agency, the three governments have been meeting for the past 10

months with the goal of revising procedures under the trade

agreement that allow citizens to submit a petition if they feel

environmental laws are not being enforced because of trade

pressures. 

<P>

Such a procedure is ''one of the only mechanisms ever designed to

create international rights for individuals and non-profit groups

to counterbalance the rights and advantages granted to private

business interests within the context of free trade agreements,''

said groups.  

<P>

The coalition includes World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Centro Mexicano

de Derecho Ambiental, Friends of the Earth, and the Canadian

Environmental Law Association. 

<P>

During the heated debate over the passage of NAFTA, these groups

pressed hard for the measure to help ensure that increased trade

in the region would not lead to the weakening of the enforcement

of environmental regulations in the face of economic pressures and

trade. 

<P>

''The credibility and legitimacy of the Commission for

Environmental Co-operation (CEC) as a public institution are

threatened by these secret discussions,'' said a statement

released by the coalition. The Montreal-based Commission is the

inter-governmental body set up under NAFTA to hear citizen

petitions. 

<P>

Groups are demanding to know why the proposed revisions have been

negotiated in secret. In the past all revisions were held in broad

consultation with organisations in the three nations.  

<P>

In the shadow of the protests in Seattle against the World Trade

Organisation, groups warn that if trade officials continue to meet

in secret, it will ''deeply weaken'' the public's trust in the

capacity of countries to balance trade and the environment. 

<P>

It ''raises serious questions regarding the level of commitment

the NAFTA governments have made to the participation of civil

society in trade agreements,'' said Jake Caldwell, trade and

environment co-ordinator at the National Wildlife Federation. 

<P>

Government officials denied that the meetings were secret, saying

that there was a public announcement that minor procedural matters

would be discussed.  

<P>

But environmentalists said that information received from the EPA

that illustrated the US position on the proposed revisions reveals

that the closed-door negotiations actually sought to change core

elements of the procedure for submitting petitions. 

<P>

One revision proposed that citizens group introducing a petition

would have to prove that specific harm was done to the

environment.  

<P>

Placing the burden of prove on the group submitting the petition

was hotly debated when the side agreement was first drafted, said

Steve Porter, an attorney with the Washington-based Center for

International Environmental Law (CIEL). Porter said the proposal

would cause local communities to pay for expensive laboratory

studies or legal fees to make their case. 

<P>

''This will limit public participation because it will discourage

NGOs from going ahead with this mechanism,'' added Gustavo Alanis

with the Centro Mexico de Derecho Ambiental (CEMDA). 

<P>

Another concern is that the negotiators discussed an exception to

the submission process that allows for ''prosecutorial judgement''

or discretion on behalf of the government on how it allocates its

enforcement resources. 

<P>

Porter feared this could ''effectively gut'' the process because

governments could easily dismiss charges that they were not

adequately enforcing its environmental laws. 

<P>

''Our concern is that this loophole will become so big that it

swallows the whole process,'' said Porter. 

<P>

Environmentalists said that several citizen petitions are pending

without resolution for an unacceptably long time.  

<P>

''It is time to end these unacceptable delays,'' said David

Schorr, director of WWF's sustainable trade campaign. 

<P>

One of the most recent of the 23 submitted petitions was filed

last year by environmental groups in all three nations and accused

the US government of deliberately flouting international and

domestic laws that prohibit the killing of migratory birds.  

<P>

The submitted petition alleged that the United States refuses to

enforce the Migratory Bird Treaty Act as it relates to loggers,

logging companies and logging contractors who destroy bird

habitat. 

<P>

In other petitions, Mexican environmental groups have accused

their government of violating the General Law on Ecological

Balance and Environmental Protection by improperly treating

hazardous waste from an abandoned lead smelter in the border town

of Tijuana, Mexico. 

<P>

Canadian organisations submitted a petition that charges that

their government is not enforcing its fisheries laws and is

failing to protect fish and their habitats from the environmental

impacts of the mining industry.  

<P>

They also accuse the Canadian government of failing to ensure the

protection of fish in British Columbia's rivers from damage caused

by hydro-electric dams.
