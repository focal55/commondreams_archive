Five decades after racial segregation was abolished in schools in the United States, there are accusations that schools are becoming more racially divided than ever.

<P>

Professor Gary Orfield of Harvard University has told the National Education Association that "re-segregation" was a growing trend.

<P>Research into patterns of school enrolment showed that black, Hispanic and white pupils are increasingly likely to be attending separate schools.

<P>

"The rise of segregation is a peril to opportunity in this society," said Professor Orfield, who called for greater efforts for racial integration.

<P>

In particular, Hispanic youngsters were found to be unlikely to be attending mixed schools. 

<P>

"Latinos experience more segregation than blacks in the deep south,'' said Professor Orfield.

<P>

Detailing the current extent of voluntary segregation in US schools, research from Harvard-based civil rights project shows that 75% of Hispanic young people attend schools in which they are a large majority.

<P>

Among black pupils, 69% were found to be attending schools in which black pupils were a majority. And among white pupils, a majority were in schools with over 80% white pupils.

<P>

In 1954, a Supreme Court ruling saw the beginning of a programme of "desegregation", in which it was intended that all public schools would teach pupils of all races.

<P>

But Professor Orfield says that since the 1960s a pattern has emerged of schools tending to serve narrower racial communities.

<P>

This has been caused by changes in the local community - such as the drift of white families from the cities to the suburbs - rather than any changes in school policy.
