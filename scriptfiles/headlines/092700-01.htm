UNITED NATIONS  - The 10-year-old UN embargo on Iraq,

which has devastated that country's economy and caused the deaths

of hundreds of children, is threatening to unravel. 

<P>

France and Russia, two veto-wielding permanent members of the

Security Council, have challenged the embargo arguing that it does

not apply to civilian flights carrying humanitarian aid.

</TABLE></font>Both Russian and French planes have, over the weekend, flown to

Iraq carrying not only doctors and medical supplies but also

business executives and soccer players. But the United States and

Britain, also permanent members of the Council, insist that these

flights are a violation of the embargo which was imposed on Iraq

just after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990. 

<P>

China, the fifth veto-wielding member of the Council, has

expressed its strong opposition to the continued sanctions on

Iraq, but has not given any indication of ferrying relief supplies

to Baghdad. 

<P>

India, which has signed an economic co-operation agreement with

Iraq, has indicated it will probably follow the French and the

Russians with its own humanitarian flight into Baghdad. Jordan and

Syria may be next in line. 

<P>

The United States and Britain maintain that all flights into Iraq

have to be authorised by the UN Sanctions Committee which has, on

previous occasions, approved civilian flights, including flights

out of Baghdad for the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.  

<P>

According to a news report from Baghdad, the Russians informed the

committee of its proposed flight but did not seek permission to

land in Iraq. The government of France, on the other hand, also

notified the committee but did not wait for approval. 

<P>

UN spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters that the United States

and Britain had asked for a delay in the departure of the flight

from Paris ''pending more information on the exact humanitarian

nature of the flight.'' But the plane departed Paris without

having received the committee's approval, Eckhard added. 

<P>

Britain and the United States interpret this as a clear violation

of the embargo. 

<P>

Addressing reporters at the United Nations two weeks ago, US

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright pointed out that it was very

hard to figure out what ''humanitarian'' means these days. ''The

United States disagreed with those who wished to fly into Iraq,''

she warned. 

<P>

Early this year, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the

humanitarian crisis in Iraq - where hundreds of children have been

dying of ill-health and malnutrition - posed ''a serious moral

dilemma for the United Nations.'' 

<P>

''The UN has always been on the side of the vulnerable and the

weak, and has always sought to relieve suffering,'' he told the

Security Council, ''Yet we are accused of causing suffering to an

entire population.''  

<P>

Annan said the United Nations was in danger of losing the argument

or the propaganda war - ''if we haven't already lost it'' - about

who is responsible for this situation. ''Is it (Iraqi President)

Saddam Hussein or the United Nations?'' he asked. 

<P>

The Secretary-General said he was particularly concerned about the

situation of Iraqi children whose suffering and, in all too many

cases, untimely deaths, were documented in a report prepared by

the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Iraqi Health Ministry last

year. ''We cannot in all conscience ignore such reports, and

assume that they are wrong,'' he told the Council. 

<P>

As a result of the human suffering in Iraq, the world body decided

to set up an ''oil for food'' programme about three years ago. 

<P>

Under this programme, Iraq is permitted to export limited

quantities of petroleum in order to finance food, medicine and

relief supplies - all of which were intended to alleviate the

impact of sanctions on the Iraqi people. But the United States has

said that even this programme is being abused by the Iraqi

government. 

<P>

Albright told reporters that the Iraqis will be pumping between 16

billion and 20 billion dollars'worth of oil this year. ''They were

also importing 12,000 cases per month of scotch whisky,'' she

charged. 

<P>

She said she was not sure if this was food or medicine, but it was

proof that there was plenty of money for President Saddam Hussein

to provide for his people. ''The elite was living very well,'' she

added. 

<P>

Albright said the United States would not agree to lift sanctions

until Iraq was relieved of all its weapons of mass destruction and

deprived of the military capability to produce such weapons in the

future. 

<P>

''Saddam Hussein was not invented. He had crossed an international

boundary, invaded another country, raped and pillaged and helped

destroy the way that country operated,'' she added. 

<P>

''He had lied about the fact that he had weapons of mass

destruction. He had prevented the United Nations (arms) inspectors

from entering Iraq. He had refused to abide by the will of the

international community. This was not an issue that was based on

her tenure. It was one that was American policy,'' Albright

asserted. 

<P>

Speaking on behalf of the 15-member European Union (EU), French

Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine told a UN news conference early

this month that France continued to believe that the UN embargo on

Iraq should be lifted. 

<P>

But action on this, he pointed out, should be taken within the

framework of Security Council resolutions which ensured the

security of countries neighbouring Iraq. 

<P>

''France believed that the sanctions had become primitive,

outdated and economically absurd,'' he added. 

<P>

However, that was not a view shared by all 15 countries of the EU,

and it appeared that Iraq was still not prepared to accept the

provisions of UN resolutions, he added.
