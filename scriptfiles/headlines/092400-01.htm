SEATTLE<wbr> - <wbr>Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate, drew more than

8,000 paying supporters to a rally here Saturday night, a turnout that

far exceeds daily crowds drawn by the major party candidates but that

seems to be doing little to shore up Nader's position in voter polls.

</font></font>The event was the third in a series of Nader "super rallies" that have

been drawing some of the largest crowds of the presidential campaign.

Nader drew 10,000 in Portland, Ore., last month, and Friday night in

Minneapolis he spoke to an estimated 12,000--the largest rally of the

2000 race outside of the national conventions, his aides said.

<p>"Nader is the only candidate speaking to issues I care about, and he's

the only one with any credibility," said Mary Cavanaugh of Poulsbo,

Wash., as she waited for the speech. "If we don't get big money out of

the system, we don't have a democracy."

<p>Saturday's rally in Key Arena, a Seattle sports auditorium, took on

the air of a progressive revival show with comments by Nader, a video-fed

speech by running mate Winona LaDuke and an appearance by populist social

critic Jim Hightower, the former Texas agriculture commissioner. It also

included a brief performance by Eddie Vedder, lead singer for the rock

band Pearl Jam.

<p>"This is a great turnout," Nader said. "This crowd is bigger than my

whole hometown in Connecticut. We are atttracting more people than Bush

and Gore. They have to pay people to come out and see them."

<p>Nader's campaign touts the events as a rally, but they also serve as

fund-raisers. Nader's staff declined to say how much money has been

raised at the events, but attendees pay from $7 to $10 to get in.

<p>Additional rallies are planned in October for Boston and Chicago.

<p>Even without an entry fee, aides for the major party

nominees--Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush--say they have

not drawn crowds to a rally that are near the size of Nader's recent

events.

<p>Jano Cabrera, a Gore spokesman in Nashville, said the vice president's

largest post-convention crowd was 8,000 at a Labor Day rally in

Pittsburgh, followed by 5,000 in Moline, Ill. Bush officials have said

his largest post-convention crowds came during his train trip through the

Midwest, which they claimed drew 5,000 to 7,000 people.

<p>On Saturday, rally-goers said they were drawn both by their support

for Nader and their opposition to the major parties.

<p>"Voting for Bush or Gore is like throwing my vote away," said Frank

Jackson, 23, of Tacoma. "I want to get the ball rolling for an

alternative party."

<p>The crowd Saturday was enthusiastic and largely under age 50. An

undercurrent to the event was the demand that Nader and Reform Party

candidate Pat Buchanan be included in the upcoming debates between Gore

and Bush.

<p>"It is very important that Nader participate in the debates," said

Bill Morris, 48, of Issaquah, Wash. "Without him, you have two people who

are a lot alike talking about things they agree on."

<p>At a news conference before the event, Nader focused on local issues

that dovetail into his broader positions. He registered his support for a

moratorium on logging in national forests and for breaching dams on the

Snake River that have threatened salmon habitats.

<p>Nader also called for genetic testing and labeling of food in the wake

of the recall of Kraft Food's Taco Bell Home Originals taco shells that

were found to contain genetically altered corn not approved for human

consumption.

<p>Scott Royder, Washington state coordinator for Nader, said the

campaign is striving to reach "the people who are so fed up that they

don't even vote."

<p>Nationally, his poll numbers have hovered around 3%. But if there is

Nader country, it is in the Northwest.

<p>In the 1996 presidential election, Nader received less than 1% of the

vote nationally but picked up 4% of the vote in Oregon and 2.6% in

Washington. Recent local polls have shown him running as high as 8% in

Oregon and 6% in Washington.
