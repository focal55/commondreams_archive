A quarter of the world's fish catch now comes from pirate boats, flying flags of convenience and flouting international law to hunt down valuable but endangered species such as tuna.

<P>Pirate fishing has doubled in the last 10 years, threatening to drive some fish to extinction. Fearing the collapse of world fisheries, the UN is to crack down on the illegal business at a meeting in Rome in October to agree international controls.

<P>The UN refers to the practice as IUU fishing - illegal, unregulated and unreported. Draft rules due to be agreed by 180 countries would close all ports to IUU fishermen to prevent them refuelling, taking on fresh crews or landing catches. The rules would also demand the closure of companies that own and control the illegal ships.

<P>Pirate ships are regularly registered in countries such as Panama, Honduras, Belize and   Cyprus to avoid fishing regulations but are owned by companies in Europe, the United States and Japan.

<P>These boats, often large factory-style trawlers roam the Atlantic and Southern Ocean catching tuna and the Patagonian toothfish. Toothfish, sold as Antarctic or Southern ocean sea bass in Britain, is known as white gold to the pirate fishermen because of its high value.

<P>In 1997, according to UN estimates, the illegal catch of Patagonian toothfish was around 100,000 tonnes with a value of more than &#163;300m. Illegal fishing is expected to cause extinction of the toothfish in two to three years.

<P>Although an international fishing agreement is in operation in the Antarctic to try to save the toothfish, the commission for the conservation of Antarctic marine resources has no method of enforcing its rules, and illegal vessels outnumber legal ones three to one.

<P>One boat suspected of carrying illegally-caught bigeye tuna worth up to &#163;1m is being   held in the Japanese port of Shimizu while officials investigate the origins of the catch. Greenpeace tracked the Japanese owned and crewed freezer vessel flying the Panamanian flag from the Atlantic where it was filmed loading the tuna from two other vessels, one flying the Belize flag and the second a Cambodia flag.

<P>All three were acting illegally under international law, because in the Atlantic only countries that are members of the international commission for the conservation of Atlantic tunas can legally fish.

<P>In 1999, the governments of Japan and the US tabled evidence identifying 345 flag-of-convenience vessels fishing for tuna in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. They flew   flags from 17 countries, notably Honduras (103), Belize (83), Equatorial Guinea (51) and St Vincent and the Grenadines (50). Most are owned and managed by Taiwanese enterprises.

<P>Simon Reddy of Greenpeace said: "Ultimately, it is the lure of big money paid for high-quality tuna, especially on the Japanese market, that provides the incentive for the activities of the pirate fleet.

<P>"In recent years, the wholesale price paid at landing for top sashimi-quality tuna has reached more than &#163;70 a pound, with some of the largest, high quality individual tuna fetching up to &#163;30,000 each."
