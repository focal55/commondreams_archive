<p>A biotech company that set off a wild race when it announced it

would beat a publicly funded effort to crack the human genetic code made

an audacious business proposal in recent closed-door meetings: In return

for sharing its findings, the firm wanted exclusive rights to the code

for up to five years.

<p>Although public officials ultimately rejected the proposal as a bald

grab for power and profits, a letter detailing their objections suggests

that they were willing to grant the company, Maryland-based Celera

Genomics, some exclusive rights for up to a year.

<p>If Celera had managed to strike the deal it had sought, it would have

been well-positioned to establish sweeping--some say troubling--influence

over an entirely new generation of drugs and medical treatments expected

to emerge from cracking the code.

<p>"While establishing a monopoly on commercial uses of the human genome

sequence may be in  Celera's business interest, it is not in the best

interests of science or the general public," said the letter rejecting

Celera's proposal.

<p>The public side had entered into talks with Celera because it was

under pressure from the scientific community to finish the decoding

process as quickly as possible. Cooperation was seen as the best route to

this goal.

<p>The letter, signed by Dr. Francis S. Collins, head of the National

Human Genome Research Institute; Dr. Harold Varmus, the recently departed

head of the National Institutes of Health; and two other representatives

of the public effort was sent to the company last week. The Times

obtained a copy Sunday after it was released in Britain by the Wellcome

Trust, a partner in the public effort.

<p>Tony L. White, chairman and chief executive of PE Corp., the parent

company of Celera Genomics, reacted angrily to the letter's release,

saying it was a breach of trust that would probably doom prospects for

any further discussion of a joint effort.

<p>"I don't want to talk to these people anymore," White said in a

telephone interview. "With a collaboration this big . . . these things

involve an enormous amount of trust. Sending that letter to the press is

slimy."

<p>White took particular exception to the use of the word "monopoly," but

did not challenge the letter's description of the company's negotiating

position.

<p>"If we could do something good for science, fine," he said, "but if

you're just going to give something to our competitors, we weren't going

to do it."

<p>Both the negotiations and their breakdown illustrate the extraordinary

crosscurrents now building as corporate and publicly funded scientists

rush to decipher the genetic code, a first draft of which is expected

sometime this spring.

<p>Cracking the code--the biochemical instructions carried in a person's

cells that determine heredity, direct growth and cause many diseases--is

considered one of the biggest prizes in all of science, a feat compared

in importance to smashing the atom or putting a man on the moon.

<p>The public drive, known as the Human Genome Project, began in 1990 as

a 15-year, $3-billion effort funded largely by the U.S. government and

the Wellcome Trust, one of the world's largest charities, to methodically

produce a complete spelling out of the code.The private effort started only two years ago, when White joined

forces with former NIH scientist J. Craig Venter to form Celera. The pair

shook up the scientific world by announcing they would finish the

decoding job far faster and cheaper than their public counterparts.

<p>The secret of their success: a machine, developed at Caltech in the

1980s, that could chop the code into short pieces and "read" the

constituent parts of each piece. Then a supercomputer could figure out

the pieces' original order.

<p>According to people familiar with the negotiations between the two

sides, scientific leaders including Varmus, a Nobel Prize winner and then

still head of NIH, concluded last fall that Celera's techniques were

proving so effective that the publicly funded effort had to consider

cooperating with the firm.

<p>The sticking point was over how quickly deciphered portions of the

code would be released. Leaders of the publicly funded effort wanted to

continue their practice of immediate release with no strings attached.

Celera wanted limits on release to rival commercial users.

<p>The public side's bargainers arrived at a crucial Dec. 29 meeting at

Dulles International Airport thinking they had the outline of an

agreement in hand.

<p>"Humankind will be better served if we can find a viable way to

combine forces to produce a better product in a more timely fashion," the

public side's document said. It added that the different deciphering

techniques used by the public and private researchers complemented each

other and provided "much opportunity for cross-checking."

<p>The major elements of the deal envisioned by the public side's

negotiators included granting Celera exclusive rights over the merged

public and private data for six to 12 months and arranging for the two

sides jointly to write a scientific paper announcing completion of the

code's deciphering.

<p>"I thought we were carrying in the basis for a compromise," said Dr.

Robert H. Waterston, director of the publicly funded sequencing center at

Washington University in St. Louis.

<p>But according to both sides, the bargaining quickly broke down.

<p>White said he rejected the offer of six to 12 months of exclusivity.

"That's pretty meaningless, isn't it?" he said in an interview Sunday.

"The fact that we don't want to produce [data] and give it to the world

for free seems to offend them."

<p>Collins, the head of the U.S. genome research institute, countered, "I

think it became pretty clear there was no basis for a collaboration."

<p>According to an account in the public side's rejection letter that was

generally confirmed by White, Celera bargainers said they needed five

years of exclusive rights to give commercial users the data produced by

merging the two sides' efforts. They said this had to include not only

the data existing at the time of the merger but also any improvements

made subsequently by the public researchers.

<p>And the company's bargainers said they wanted to use their own

Internet site, not the government's, to make the decoded sequence of

genetic information available to noncommercial users such as academic

scientists.

<p>Besides distribution rights, Celera said it also wanted to control a

number of commercial uses of the combined data, including manufacture of

so-called DNA chips--miniature devices that would allow researchers to

test thousands of genes at a time.

<p>Such chips could prove important, for example, in determining the

proper drug to use for an individual heart patient, or in discovering

what combination of genes might cause high blood pressure.

<p>The Celera bargainers suggested that if no agreement was reached, the

company was prepared to use the combined data to prepare a scientific

paper on the code, a move that the public-side representatives blasted as

"a breach of scientific ethics."

<p>The two sides were unable to bridge their differences in conversations

since the Dec. 29 session and were clearly still at loggerheads Sunday.

<p>In a suggestion of how substantial the gulf remained, White argued

that as a business matter, the talks' failure "is not bad for us. All it

will do . . . is show we stood up for our shareholders. That isn't bad."

<p>Even without a deal, the company and a handful of other biotech firms

like it seem poised to profit. Celera, which was founded only two years

ago, raised nearly $1 billion in a recent stock offering, and its shares

have rocketed in price in the last 12 months from about $7 to $235.

<p>Meanwhile, the publicly funded effort to decipher the genetic code

will continue, though it appears destined to be far up the track when

Celera crosses the finish line.
