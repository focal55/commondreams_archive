WASHINGTON  - Rare U.S. animals and wildlife could

be threatened by transgenic fish and plants being developed in

laboratories unless the federal government provides safeguards,

a senior Interior Department official said on Thursday.

<p>William Brown, a science adviser to Interior Secretary Bruce

Babbitt, said the department was concerned that some new

genetically altered organisms could inadvertently harm the

environment, much like invasive plants.

<p>For example, the less than 200 remaining Atlantic salmon

living in Maine rivers could be quickly wiped out if transgenic

fish grown in nearby aquaculture farms escape their pens, Brown

said.

<p>A similar risk is posed by developers of transgenic aquarium

fish, which are engineered to be bigger, stronger and more

colorful than conventional varieties.

<p>``Maybe the situation can be managed just fine,'' Brown told

a National Academy of Sciences committee studying biotech food

and environmental issues. ``But I'm worried that some of these

species are falling between the cracks of current regulations.''

<p>He urged the committee to take a close look at how federal

safeguards can be developed for organisms that might be a new

threat to endangered species.

<p>U.S. regulations for genetically modified organisms are

administered by the Food and Drug Administration, the

Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Agriculture

Department. The FDA handles food safety and labelling, the EPA

monitors crops engineered to repel pests, and the USDA oversees

field testing of transgenic crops.

<p>The Interior Department, which has taken little part in

federal biotech policies, administers public lands as well as

protecting endangered species.

<p>Brown said some rare plants could be at risk if transgenic

crops growing nearby inadvertently developed a generation of

''super weeds.'' Likewise, pollen from fields of Bt corn --

engineered to resist the destructive European corn borer --

could affect some butterfly species that are already dwindling

in numbers, he said.

<p>The new National Academy of Sciences panel, made up of 18

physicians, academics, researchers and consumer experts, held

its first meeting on Thursday to begin mapping the key

scientific issues that need to be analyzed.

<p>The USDA has already asked the new committee to review its

regulation of genetically modified crops and suggest what

improvements could be made.

<p>At its meeting, the panel also heard from several federal

agencies that have little-known biotech projects underway.

<p>The Energy Department has a $100 million project for

microbial research and gene-mapping, and the Commerce

Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology

develops DNA diagnostics used by crime labs.
