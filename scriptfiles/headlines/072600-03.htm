Leading consumer and environmental groups are fuming because the 



Clinton administration has appointed a former Monsanto Corp. lobbyist 



to represent U.S. consumers on a transatlantic committee set up to 



avoid a trade war over genetically engineered foods.	 





<P>  U.S. farmers have planted millions of acres of corn and other 



crops that have been genetically engineered to resist pests, and the 



growers want to export such produce freely. But in Europe, where 



genetically altered crops have been dubbed Frankenfoods, governments 



have imposed labeling rules and safety tests that have restricted 



U.S. imports.	 



</P>

<P> Friction between the United States and Europe over the foods issue 



torpedoed last year's World Trade Organization (WTO) talks in Seattle 



and now threaten to erupt into a transatlantic trade war.	 



</P>

<P>  In a last-ditch effort to settle their differences, U.S. and 



European leaders agreed in May to create a 20-person Biotechnology 



Consultative Forum, representing pro and con interests on both sides 



of the Atlantic.	 



</P>

<P>   In a letter appointing the U.S. members of this advisory forum, 



Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asked them to suggest a 



compromise on labeling, safety testing and other regulatory issues, 



and to present it to the next U.S.-



European economic summit in December.	 



</P>

<P> To build support for this compromise effort, the State Department 



asked environmental and consumer opponents of bioengineered foods to 



nominate their representatives to the biotech powwow.	 



</P>

<P>  But this gesture backfired when the State Department ignored the 



nomination of consumer representative Michael Hansen -- a scientist 



with Consumers Union -- and instead gave the post to Carol Tucker 



Foreman, a Capitol insider who recently took over food issues for the 



Consumer Federation of America after 18 years as a lobbyist.	 



</P>

<P>  What angered critics most is that during her lobbying days, 



Foreman helped Monsanto -- the firm most closely identified with 



genetically engineered foods -- win approval for bovine growth 



hormone, a chemical that stimulates milk production.	 



</P>

<P>  ``We think it's a big mistake to appoint a person to represent 



consumers who's been so closely tied to the biotech industry,'' said 



Dan Seligman, the Sierra Club's representative on trade issues. 	 



</P>

<P>   A U.S. government official, who wanted to remain anonymous, said 



the State Department is aware of the flap created by Foreman's 



appointment but believes the committee -- which includes Norman 



Borlaug, the father of the ``green revolution'' -- represents ``a 



broad range of civil society.''	 



</P>

<P>  Foreman, 62, was on vacation, and associates at the Consumer 



Federation of America said she could not be reached for comment.	 



</P>

<P> But federation Executive Director Stephen Brobeck called it 



``absurd'' to suggest that Foreman, who has worked on Capitol Hill 



for 40 years, would be beholden to 



Monsanto because she did some ``modest consulting'' for the company 



five years ago.	 



</P>

<P>  ``I would challenge anyone to identify any statement or action 



since she's returned to CFA that did not serve the public interest,'' 



Brobeck said. ``People in this town move between the private, public 



and nonprofit sector all the time.''	 



</P>

<P>  Foreman's career exemplifies Capitol Hill's revolving door.	 



</P>

<P>  An Arkansas native, Foreman came to Washington in 1961 as a Senate 



staffer, became executive director of the Consumer Federation of 



America in the early 1970s and was appointed an assistant secretary 



in the U.S. Department of Agriculture during the Carter 



administration.	 



</P>

<P>  In her government role, Foreman earned praise and criticism from 



consumer colleagues. Foreman helped persuade Congress to eliminate a 



co-payment requirement that had kept millions of people from getting 



food stamps. But she also relaxed poultry inspection rules that 



favored big chicken farmers like Arkansas' Tyson Foods.	 



</P>

<P> But what really irked critics is what Foreman did after she left 



USDA in 1981 to form her own lobbying firm. In addition to helping 



Monsanto get USDA approval for bovine growth hormone, she also 



lobbied for Olestra, Procter & Gamble's fat substitute, and consulted 



with tobacco giant Philip Morris.	 



</P>

<P> Critics concede that Foreman's corporate involvements never damaged 



her Democratic Party credentials and marvel at how her Arkansas roots 



</P>

<P>--her brother is Jim Guy Tucker, the former Arkansas governor and 



Whitewater figure -- enhanced her access in the Clinton 



administration.	 



</P>

<P>  ``It didn't surprise me at all when the White House nominated her 



to this international committee,'' said John Stauber, co-founder of 



the Center for Media and Democracy, a Madison, Wis., nonprofit that 



tracks lobbyists.	 



</P>

<P> ``She's trusted and tight with the Democratic Party, she isn't 



threatening to industry and she has managed to retain consumer 



credentials,'' Stauber said. ``Who better to try to smooth over these 



differences (between Europe and the United States) and make the world 



safe for the export of genetically engineered foods?''	 



</P>

<P> A source close to the transatlantic commission said Foreman was 



chosen because she is a pragmatic dealmaker who is more interested in 



compromise than confrontation.	 



</P>

<P>  Some of Foreman's critics also seem to prefer that the 



transatlantic compromise effort fail. Lori Wallach, a trade 



specialist with Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group in 



Washington, D.C., said if U.S.-European differences over genetically 



engineered foods spark a trade war, it could topple the entire WTO 



framework which, in her view, favors corporate profits over worker 



and consumer interests.	 



</P>

<P>   Meanwhile, those who want the commission to achieve a compromise 



are running out of time. The first meeting of the transatlantic forum 



probably won't occur until September because many of the European 



members are on vacation.	 



</P>

<P>  ``My hope for the forum is to bring the United States around to 



regulatory approval and labeling policies that are more consistent 



with the European policies,'' said Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist with 



Environmental Defense, a nonprofit advocacy group. Goldburg was 



appointed by the State Department to fill the environmental slot on 



the transatlantic committee.	 



</P>

<P>  ``But we have an incredibly broad charge and a limited amount of 



time,'' she said.
