<p>KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia<wbr>--<wbr>As Serbs sang nationalist songs and cheered on their side of this

divided Kosovo city, NATO troops battled a surging crowd of about 70,000

ethnic Albanians with tear gas Monday to prevent a potential blood bath.

<p>Ethnic Albanian protesters had marched about 25 miles from Pristina,

the provincial capital, to press demands for an end to the division of

Kosovska Mitrovica, which they see as part of an attempt to partition

Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.

<p>For more than three hours, British and Canadian soldiers, often bent

over and choking in pain from clouds of tear gas fired by French

gendarmes, struggled to hold their front line on a bridge over the Ibar

River, which separates the Serbs from the ethnic Albanians.

<p>Both Serbian and ethnic Albanian extremists have been blamed for

stirring up unrest in Kosovska Mitrovica, and while violence has dropped

sharply in the rest of Kosovo, the city symbolizes one of the main

failures of the NATO-led peacekeeping mission.

<p>Eleven months after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization launched

its airstrikes to end Serbian repression of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian

majority, the mission seems as far as ever from building a multiethnic

democracy in the province.

<p>The latest violence has left NATO troops in the bizarre, and

dangerous, position of defending an iron wall dividing a strategic town

that the peacekeepers' commanders repeatedly have promised to unite.

<p>Violence erupted Monday when ethnic Albanians from Kosovo's central

Drenica region, the birthplace of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army,

broke through a cordon of NATO armored vehicles and barbed wire.

<p>They tried to storm across the bridge to confront about 4,000 waiting

Serbs but were repeatedly driven back with volleys of tear gas.

Peacekeepers wrestled several ethnic Albanian protesters to the ground

and arrested them.

<p>But the rest of the marchers only regrouped, and several dozen managed

to swarm on top of at least one NATO armored vehicle. Some of the

protesters carried U.S. and U.N. flags in addition to the red-and-black

Albanian flag. Peacekeepers estimated the crowd at about 70,000.

<p>Trouble continued after the 6 p.m. nightly curfew, but the crowd

eventually dispersed.

<p>As the marchers approached the city earlier Monday, Agim Ceku, former

head of the now-disbanded KLA guerrilla force, met with NATO commanders

in Kosovska Mitrovica.

<p>Ceku now commands the Kosovo Protection Corps, which NATO set up as a

civilian force to deal with natural disasters, rescues and other civil

defense in Kosovo. But when NATO called on Ceku to help calm the crowd

Monday, he seemed to have a much more important, political role.

<p>The marchers came to Kosovska Mitrovica to help speed up the process

of finding a solution to the ethnic division and "also as a message to

the whole international community that the division is unacceptable,"

Ceku told reporters as he walked next to British and French officers.

<p>Serbian forces committed widespread atrocities against Kosovo's ethnic

Albanian majority and drove hundreds of thousands from Kosovo during 11

weeks of NATO airstrikes. When the ethnic Albanians returned, Serbs and

other minorities were attacked and driven from their homes.

<p>Many of the estimated 9,000 Serbs living in the northern part of

Kosovska Mitrovica came from other parts of Kosovo because they didn't

feel safe in their home villages and towns.

<p>On Feb. 2, two elderly Serbs died when an antitank rocket was fired at

a bus clearly marked with the acronym of the Office of the U.N. High

Commission for Refugees and guarded by two French armored vehicles.

<p>No one has been arrested in the attack, which occurred on a foggy

stretch of road in a mainly ethnic Albanian region of Kosovo. When Serbs

sought revenge in Kosovska Mitrovica, nine people died and scores were

injured.

<p>More than 1,000 ethnic Albanians fled the mainly Serbian northern

district of Kosovska Mitrovica. Many of them said Serbs had ordered them

to leave. But the United Nations says at least 2,000 ethnic Albanians

still live under NATO protection in the northern sector.

<p>&#160;In southern Kosovska Mitrovica, where about 9,000 ethnic Albanians

live, there are just seven Serbs left, and they are holed up in an

Orthodox church guarded by French troops.

<p>As violence flared on the main bridge across the Ibar on Monday, about

350 U.S. troops from the 82nd Airborne Division guarded the entrance to a

secondary bridge and did not come under attack.

<p>But at least one U.S. soldier on duty in the southern sector had two

swollen black eyes and dried blood on the bridge of his broken nose,

wounds suffered when Serbs hurled rocks and bottles at American troops

searching for illegal weapons Sunday.

<p>The French commander in Kosovska Mitrovica, Gen. Pierre de Saqui de

Sannes, ordered the U.S. reinforcements to withdraw from the mainly

Serbian district before the weapons search was complete.

<p>By the end of Sunday, NATO troops had confiscated 10 AK-47 assault

rifles, 10 older rifles, one Uzi submachine gun, one heavy machine gun,

seven boxes of plastic explosives and a hand grenade from northern

Kosovska Mitrovica.

<p>The troops reported taking a single handgun from an ethnic Albanian in

the southern sector. On Feb. 15, NATO peacekeepers found 10 rocket

launchers, 180 grenades and thousands of bullets in an Albanian ambulance

abandoned near a NATO roadblock south of the city, leaving little doubt

that Kosovo is still awash in illegal weapons on both sides of the ethnic

divide.

<p>&#160;In the swirl of tear gas Monday, NATO leaflets floated down from

helicopters flying low overhead, to deliver a message in Albanian: "Keep

cool in this situation, so you remain trustworthy cooperators. Be aware:

violence doesn't serve anyone."
