More than two weeks after a hellish New Mexico wildfire burned 400

homes and closed the Los Alamos National Laboratory, concern is mounting

over whether erosion caused by the fire will unleash toxic and

radiological contaminants into the Rio Grande.

<p>Jim Danneskiold, a lab spokesman, said Friday that emergency teams of

hydrologists, soil scientists and other experts this week began assessing

the threat from dozens of the lab's 626 known "potential release" sites,

many dating back to World War II and the early Cold War.

<p>So far, he said, they have identified about a half-dozen former dumps

that might release low-level nuclear and chemical waste into streams and

rivers once the region's annual "monsoon" rains begin in July. The fire

burned off the grasses and brush that has held the contaminated soil in

check.

<p>"There definitely will be movement of contaminated sediments off lab

property," Danneskiold said. "It's a question of when, not if, the flood

waters come through."

<p>Overall, the Cerro Grande fire inflicted considerably more damage at

the nation's chief nuclear weapons design and development facility than

officials initially acknowledged.

<p>The blaze devoured about 40 trailers, sheds, warehouses and other

nonpermanent buildings, caused millions of dollars in smoke and heat

damage to lasers and other sensitive equipment, and delayed an array of

secret, defense-related research and other work, officials said.

<p>One scientist developing polymers lost his computer hard drive and all

his backup data disks--eight years of work--when his office-trailer was

destroyed. Also destroyed were several wooden buildings from the

Manhattan Project, including one containing blackboards still covered

with chalk notes used to construct the first atom bomb.

<p>Energy Department and lab officials said that the fire did not

jeopardize the lab's main mission: guaranteeing the safety and

reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile. Federal and state agencies

have not detected any release of radiation from the lab, although local

background radiation readings have increased because of the fire.

<p>Thousands of physicists, engineers and other lab workers began

returning to the battered facility this week for the first time since the

lab closed on May 8. But several research and testing sites, where the

fire was most intense, will remain closed for an indefinite period.

<p>In addition, about 270 lab workers who lost their homes or other

property have been given liberal leave to arrange their personal affairs.

In all, 400 Los Alamos families were made homeless by the blaze.

<p>In Washington, President Clinton said that his administration is

"committed to ensuring that all those who have been affected by the fire

. . . are fully compensated for their losses."

<p>Clinton said in a statement that the White House is working with the

congressional delegation from New Mexico to write legislation to provide

for federal compensation. "We are committed to working with the Congress

to ensure that this matter is addressed as promptly as possible," he

added.

<p>Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt separately released a report from an

independent review board that sharply criticized National Park Service

personnel for igniting the blaze that accidentally led to disaster.

<p>Park Service crews at Bandelier National Monument set a "prescribed

burn" on May 4 in an attempt to clear underbrush and prevent a wider

fire. Instead, the blaze roared out of control.

<p>Babbitt said that he would extend a moratorium on prescribed burns by

the Park Service indefinitely. Other federal agencies may resume the

fire-control tactic when the monthlong ban expires on June 12.

<p>The New Mexico fire has devoured 47,650 acres so far, including parts

of the Los Alamos lab, the Santa Fe National Forest, the San Ildefonso

Pueblo and Santa Clara Pueblo. Although the inferno is now mostly under

control, high winds continue to bedevil firefighters and the blaze flared

up again Thursday night near the lab.

<p>The fire's long-term danger is only now coming into focus. An

interagency task force called the Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation

team this week began assessing the threat from erosion on the now-bare

hills and canyons surrounding the town of Los Alamos, which adjoins the

lab.

<p>Ken Palmrose, a spokesman for the group, said that computer models

project erosion "that could be 100 times normal" this summer from heavy

rains and lack of ground cover.

<p>He said that 85 crew members already have begun raking charred

topsoil, planting trees and contouring slopes to reduce runoff. He said

the challenge was so immense that "we're considering things larger than

anything in our manual," including damming canyons or building large

sediment pools.

<p>Indeed, three helicopters and a plane are on standby to begin aerial

reseeding of severely burned areas with native species of grass. About 18

truckloads of seed--720,000 pounds in all--were expected to arrive

Friday.

<p>But Greg Mello, who heads an independent watchdog organization called

the Los Alamos Study Group in Santa Fe, said that officials are moving

far too slowly to clear up the witches' brew of toxic contaminants in the

lab's disused dumps.

<p>"Huge flood flows are expected from the burned watersheds this year,"

he warned. "Contaminated sediment will move downstream."
