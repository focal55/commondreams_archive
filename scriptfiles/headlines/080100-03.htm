BEIJING --        A kilogram of heroin sealed Ding Aguo's doom.	 



<P>  On June 22, the 31-year-old woman was executed by firing squad in Beijing 

along with six other people convicted of drug trafficking. The next day, 11 

drug dealers in the southwestern city of Chengdu were rounded up and paraded 

before a stadium of spectators, then led away to be shot.	 

</P>

<P>  Within a single week, authorities put to death at least 48 people as part 

of an aggressive national anti-drug campaign. More than a dozen others were 

executed for committing violent crimes.	 

</P>

<P>  China executes more people every year than the rest of the world 

combined, for crimes ranging from murder to embezzlement or antiques theft.	 

</P>

<P>  The country's frequent application of the death penalty has drawn fire 

from a host of Western countries. France and Germany regularly raise the 

issue in talks with Beijing. Australia, Britain and Canada make it part of 

their human-rights dialogues with China.	 

</P>

<P>  The only major Western power not protesting China's use of the death 

penalty is a fellow executioner: the United States. Support of capital 

punishment yokes Beijing and Washington, its usual human-rights nemesis, in 

an awkward solidarity over a practice most industrialized nations condemn.	 

</P>

<P>  ``The U.S. is not exactly in a position to talk about the issue'' with 

China, Catherine Baber, a researcher with Amnesty International, noted 

dryly.	 

</P>

<P>  The sheer number of executions in China is staggering.	 

</P>

<P>  Since 1990, at least 18,008 people have been put to death. Last year 

alone, Amnesty International logged 1,077 executions -- an average of nearly 

three a day -- while the rest of the world's countries that practice capital 

punishment together racked up 736. Ninety-

eight of those executions were in the United States.	 

</P>

<P>  Experts believe that the number of executions in China is even higher 

than estimated because the government does not publicize all executions and 

has deemed the exact count a ``state secret.''	 

</P>

<P>  ``The (real) figures,'' Baber said, ``would be mind-boggling.''	 

</P>

<P>  Judges in China hand down death sentences not only for violent crimes 

such as murder and rape but for offenses considered far less egregious 

elsewhere.	 

</P>

<P>  Bribe-taking, tax evasion and credit-card fraud on a big scale can all 

command the death penalty. So can stealing ``cultural relics,'' as three 

thieves discovered earlier this year after pilfering a set of ancient 

murals.	 

</P>

<P>  Political separatists in restive western Xinjiang province have been put 

to death, as was a drunken driver who hit a pedestrian, sped off and left 

his victim to die. Pimping and forcible prostitution, in extreme cases, can 

earn an offender the ultimate punishment.	 

</P>

<P>  The high number of executions dovetails with a significant broadening of 

China's definition of capital crime during the past two decades.	 

</P>

<P>  In 1979, there were 28 types of offenses, including 

``counterrevolutionary'' activity, that merited being put to death. But by 

1995, in response to a rising crime rate in China's new go-go society, the 

list had risen to 74 and incorporated an increasing number of nonviolent 

offenses, especially economic ones.	 

</P>

<P>  The following year produced China's bloodiest execution record in the 

past two decades. As part of the communist regime's fierce ``Strike Hard'' 

crackdown on crime, more than 4,000 people were believed to have been 

executed in 1996 -- an average of 11 executions every day.	 

</P>

<P>  Yet the United States has largely stayed silent on China's use of the 

death penalty, despite Washington's insistence that human rights remain a 

core element of its relations with Beijing. Officially, the United States, 

as a prominent practitioner of capital punishment, does not weigh in on 

other nations' right to mete out the death penalty.	 

</P>

<P>  In fact, Chinese officials often justify their use of capital punishment 

by citing its practice in the United States.	 

</P>

<P>  ``It's nice (for Beijing) to be able to point to the United States and 

say, `They're just as bad,''' said a European diplomat who participates in 

discussions with China on human rights.	 

</P>

<P>  Public support for the death penalty remains high in China. Executions 

for economic crimes are extremely popular, particularly as the poor watch a 

swelling elite enrich itself through shady practices or misuse of public 

funds.	 

</P>

<P>  Ancient proverbs reinforce the need for retribution and for heavy 

punishment to deter others. ``Take a life, owe a life,'' one maxim goes. 

Another advises: ``Kill the monkey to scare the chickens.''	 

</P>

<P>  Politics also plays a role. Few Chinese were surprised in 1998 when 

former Politburo member Chen Xitong was sentenced to a mere 16 years in 

prison for his part in a $2.2 billion corruption scandal. By contrast, the 

less-well-connected deputy governor of Jiangxi province, Hu Changqing, was 

ordered put to death in March this year for crimes of corruption involving 

$843,000.	 

</P>

<P>  Executions in China are mostly by gunshot, sometimes to the back of the 

head at point-blank range. At least one province is experimenting with 

lethal injection.	 

</P>

<P>  But there is growing demand among many Chinese scholars for the communist 

regime to rein in capital punishment. Academics point out that a reduction 

of the death penalty's scope is necessary to bring China in line with the 

U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Beijing has signed but 

not yet ratified.	 

</P>

<P>  ``More and more people think that minor crimes, such as property crimes, 

cannot be compared with the value of a human life,'' scholar Hu said.	 

</P>

<P>  Advocates of limiting the death penalty -- outright abolition is 

politically impossible for now, they say -- take heart from a few promising 

changes in the past few years.	 

</P>

<P>  Beijing has eliminated the death penalty for criminals younger than 18. 

Lesser infractions, such as petty theft and mild forms of hooliganism, were 

struck from the list of capital offenses in 1997. Now 68 capital crimes 

remain on the books.	 

</p>

`WOMEN AND MONEY'

<P>A Beijing court handed down a death sentence yesterday to Cheng Kejie, who 

with his mistress amassed $4.9 million from graft. He is the highest-

level politician executed in a long campaign intended to assuage public 

disgust over corruption and abuse of power.	 

<P>  The 66-year-old former deputy chairman of the national legislature was 

convicted of accepting the bribes while he headed the poor southern region 

of Guangxi, the official Xinhua News Agency said.	 

</P>

<P>  He was expelled from the party and dismissed from his legislative post in 

April. A party spokesman blamed his downfall on the ``temptations of women 

and money.''	 

</P>

<P>  Cheng was caught in a widening investigation into smuggling, kickbacks 

and other corruption in Guangxi, whose coast is a haven for smugglers. Cheng 

headed Guangxi's government from 1990 to 1998 and was its deputy Communist 

Party secretary.
