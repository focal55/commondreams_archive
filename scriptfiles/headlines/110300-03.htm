<p>From a 1999 profile of Bush Communications Director Karen Hughes in The New Republic<br>

<b>The Woman Behind George W.'s Iron Bubble.

The Enforcer</b> by Michelle Cotter<br>

<p><i>...Other times Hughes simply shuts down the conversation. Just after the governor's reelection in 1998, Slater (Wayne Slater of The Dallas Morning News) pressed Bush about whether he had ever been arrested. "He said, `After 1968? No.' I said, `What about before 1968?' He said, `Well ...' and at that moment Karen stepped in and said, `Wait a minute, I've not heard this.' She clearly wasn't prepared for whatever it was he was about to say, and he shut up." Slater argued that it was better for the governor to deal with any revelations sooner rather than later, and Bush agreed to get back to him on the matter. "To this day I have no idea what he was going to say," says Slater. "After she got to him, he shut up."
