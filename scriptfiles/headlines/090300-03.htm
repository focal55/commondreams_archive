For years, Monsanto, the agrichemical giant, has regularly popped up on the

Forbes and Fortune lists of the most respected American companies. Their

image's carefully cultivated with a sophisticated public relations campaign,

portraying the St. Louis-based firm as the small farmer's friend and a

dedicated leader in the fight to end global hunger. &quot;Doing well by doing

good&quot; is the company motto, spread across glossy magazine ads and discreetly

placed television spots.<BR>

<BR>

But Monsanto's reputation in the international community is distinctly less

favorable. Last year, the European Union (EU) moved to block imports of the

company's genetically engineered products, such as soybeans and bovine

growth hormone (rBGH). And in the developing world, Monsanto has been

fiercely attacked for decimating native ecologies by introducing so-called

test-tube crops and dousing them with heavy doses of pesticides and

fertilizers, all with the backing of the U.S. government.<BR>

<BR>

In recent months, Monsanto has come under fire for pushing so-called

&quot;Terminator&quot; seeds in India and Africa. The Terminator is a genetic

technology that sterilizes natural seeds in plants, forcing farmers to

depend on Monsanto's patented, genetically engineered crops. The company

also promotes its Round-Up Ready seeds as &quot;insect resistant.&quot; But, in fact,

the patented seeds are genetically designed to survive heavy doses of toxic

pesticides.<BR>

<BR>

The financial stakes are high. The haul from Monsanto's Round-Up Ready

soybeans, potatoes and corn, and its Terminator seeds could mean tens of

billions of dollars. &quot;Monsanto is the most perfect example of what is

so evil about the corporate mentality,&quot; says Patty Clary, head of

Californians for Alternatives to Toxins, an Arcata-based group that monitors

the use of pesticides. &quot;They developed these genetically engineered crops

with the sole objective of forcing farmers to use Round-Up.&quot;<BR>

<BR>

Monsanto always has been able to count on the aid of the U.S. government to

sedulously promote its products. With the ceaseless encouragement of the

Department of Agriculture, American farmers have planted more than 50

million acres of Monsanto's genetically engineered crops over the past four

years. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also played along,

acceding to the company's demand that genetically engineered crops not be

labeled as such.<BR>

<BR>

When faced with the almost certain prospect that the EU would ban the import

of Monsanto's genetically engineered corn in 1998, the company unleashed an

unprecedented lobbying effort, flying a group of critics to the United

States, where they visited corporate headquarters. Then the writers were

taken to Washington, where they were given a tour of the White House,

including a rare

visit to the Oval Office.<BR>

<BR>

Top Clinton aides--including U.S. Trade Rep. Charlene Barshevsky, Secretary

of State Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman and

Secretary of Commerce William Daley--also have lobbied their European

counterparts on Monsanto's behalf. Even Bill Clinton and Al Gore got in on

the act, engaging in some last minute arm-twisting of Irish Prime Minister

Bertie Ahren and French President Lionel Jospin. Both the French and the

Irish caved in to the pressure.<BR>

<BR>

This spring, Monsanto's genetically engineered corn will be planted in

Europe for the first time. <b>Toby Moffett</b>, the former liberal congressman from

Connecticut and now a Monsanto political strategist, smugly bragged about

the victory to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: &quot;I'm 54 years old and I've been

in a lot of coalitions in my life, but this is one of the most breathtaking

I've seen.&quot;<BR>

<BR>

How can Monsanto's extraordinary leverage be explained? Political

influence often comes down to the judicious application of campaign cash.

Monsanto--a $7.5 billion company--has poured nearly $200,000 a year into the

coffers of candidates for federal office and the two major parties. This is

a relatively paltry amount compared to the millions pumped into the system

by big oil or

even by its chemical rivals, DuPont, ICI and Dow. Instead, Monsanto has

realized the efficacy of a well-financed lobbying strategy.<BR>

<BR>

In 1997, the chemical giant invested $4 million for lobbying Congress and

the White House on issues ranging from the federal tax code and agricultural

subsidies to hazardous waste laws and food safety regulations. To protect

its tax loopholes, Monsanto retains the services of David Bockorny, a former

legislative affairs specialist in the Reagan White House, and Catherine

Porter,

former chief trade and tax counsel to Sen. John Chaffee, the powerful Rhode

Island Republican.<BR>

<BR>

On the troublesome matter of patents--a huge issue in the genetic

engineering field--Monsanto has recruited the help of Dennis DeConcini, the

former Arizona Democratic senator. DeConcini's firm, Parry &amp; Romani, has

carved out a specialty in the field of agricultural and pharmaceutical

trademarks, and the libelous practice of staking property rights to native

seed stocks. Similar work is done for Monsanto by Timmons and Company, a

Democratic lobby shop that includes Ellen Boyle, former press secretary to

Tip O'Neill; William Cable former deputy assistant for legislative affairs

to Jimmy Carter; and John S. Orlando, who served as chief of staff to John

Dingell, the senior Democrat in the House.<BR>

<BR>

Perhaps no American company has so zealously exploited Washington's

revolving door as Monsanto, which has seized on ex-Clinton aides and federal

bureaucrats to advance its interests. Consider the case of Michael Taylor:

After graduating from law school in 1976, Taylor went to work for the FDA,

rising through the ranks. He left the Federal government for a post in the

high-powered

Washington law firm of King and Spaulding to become their FDA specialist.

During his tenure there, Taylor represented Monsanto's efforts to gain FDA

approval for rBGH. Taylor left the firm in 1991 to rejoin the FDA, this

time as deputy commissioner for policy. In that position, he wrote the

guidelines on the use and marketing of rBGH, which turned out to be very

favorable for Monsanto. The FDA guidelines exempted milk producers from

labeling dairy products from cows that had been treated with rBGH. Now

Taylor has resumed to Monsanto, working on what the company calls &quot;long

range planning.&quot;<BR>

<BR>

During his days at King and Spaulding, Taylor also authored more than a

dozen articles critical of the Delaney Clause, a 1958 federal law

prohibiting the introduction of known carcinogens into processed foods,

which had long been opposed by Monsanto and other chemical and pesticide

companies. When Taylor rejoined the federal government, he continued

advocating that Delaney should be overturned.<BR>

<BR>

In the fight to bring down Delaney, Monsanto also secured the services of

the Duberstein Group, the lobbying firm of Ken Duberstein, former chief of

staff under George Bush and a close friend of Gen. Colin Powell.

Duberstein's outfit is a sterling example of the bipartisan nature of

lobbying, since its roster of lobbyists includes former Reagan and Bush

administration officials, an adviser to former Vice President Walter

Mondale, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House

Democratic Whip David Bonior's former chief legislative aide.<BR>

<BR>

Monsanto's lobbying apparatus even has penetrated the ranks of a nonprofit

consumer group, the Safe Food Campaign, which advocates tougher food

inspection standards. The group was founded by Carol Tucker Foreman, who

served as an assistant secretary of agriculture in the Carter

administration.<BR>

<BR>

Ironically, Foreman also represents the Beef Council, Procter and Gamble and

Monsanto. Foreman used her close ties with the Clinton administration to

get Virginia Weldon, Monsanto's former public relations chief, appointed to

Clinton's Committee of Scientific Advisors and Gore's Sustainable

Development Roundtable--entities that recommended the Delaney Clause be

replaced with more flexible legislation.<BR>

<BR>

But the company may have secured its biggest coup in 1997, when it brought

onto its board Mickey Kantor, the former secretary of commerce and one of

Bill Clinton's closest advisers. Kantor joined two other Washington

insiders on the Monsanto board--William Ruckleshaus, former director of the

EPA, and Gwendolyn King, former head of the Social Security Administration.<BR>

<BR>

Monsanto compensates its directors handsomely: Kantor receives nearly

$100,000 a year. But that relatively small investment brings Monsanto

lucrative returns. It was Kantor who opened the doors to the White House

and pushed the administration to pressure the EU over Monsanto's genetically

engineered grain.<BR>

<BR>

Kantor's new law firm, Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt, watches out for the company's

interests in matters of international trade, food safety and product

labeling. Prior to Kantor's arrival at the firm in 1997, one of Mayer,

Brown &amp; Platt's top lobbyists was Daley, whom Clinton tapped to fill

Kantor's spot in the cabinet. In that capacity, he has led the charge for

Monsanto on several continents.<BR>

<BR>

When you've got friends like this,&quot; says Michael Colby of the Vermont-based

Food &amp; Water, which has battled Monsanto on rBGH and pesticides for a

decade, &quot;you don't have to concern yourself with your enemies.&quot;
