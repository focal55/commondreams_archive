GENEVA  - A U.N. human rights body called on

Friday for the lifting of 10-year-old sanctions on Iraq, saying

they had ``condemned an innocent people to hunger, disease,

ignorance and even death.''

<p>The United Nations Sub-Commission on the Promotion and

Protection of Human Rights also adopted a separate resolution

urging states to reconsider their support for economic

sanctions in general if they failed to bring about the desired

changes in policy.

</TABLE>The sub-commission, composed of 26 human rights experts

named by their respective governments to serve in a personal

capacity, adopted the two resolutions without a vote on the

final day of their annual three-week meeting in Geneva.

<p>It was the fourth year in a row that the body dealt with

the controversial issue of Iraqi sanctions.

<p>This week's debate became heated after Belgian's member

called the sanctions ``unequivocally illegal'' which had caused a

humanitarian disaster ``comparable to the worst catastrophes of

the past decades.''

<p>The resolution proposed by Morocco's representative urged

all governments, including that of Iraq's President Saddam

Hussein, to alleviate the Iraqi people's suffering by

facilitating the delivery of food and medical supplies.

<p>Iraq has been under an international economic and trade

embargo since its August 1990 invasion of oil-rich Kuwait.

<p><font size=+1><b><font size="2">Oil-For-Food Deal Not Meeting All Needs -- Report</font></b></font>

<p>The text said statistics issued by the U.N. oil-for-food

program, which since December 1996 has allowed Iraq to sell

limited quantities of oil to buy food, medicine and other

essentials, showed the deal was meeting ``only part of the vital

needs of the population.''

<p>It noted with concern that ``the standard of living,

nutrition and health of the population were continuing to

deteriorate and that all economic activities were seriously

affected, particularly in the areas of drinking water supply,

electricity and agriculture.''

<p>The Iraq resolution invoked the 1949 Geneva Conventions

which it said ``prohibit the starving of civilian populations

and the destruction of what is indispensable to their

survival.''

<p>In the second resolution, put forward by Norway's member,

the Sub-Commission urged states to reconsider their support for

sanctions ``even when legitimate goals pursued have not yet been

achieved, if, after a reasonable period, the measures have not

brought about the desired changes in policy.''

<p>It urged states to seek ``prompt termination of all aspects

of sanctions regimes that adversely affect human rights.''

<p>On Thursday, the United States hit out angrily at the

Belgian's report. George Moose, U.S. Ambassador to the United

Nations in Geneva, told the forum that his claim that the

sanctions were illegal was ``incorrect, biased and

inflammatory.''

<p>``The United States has worked hard to ensure that the

welfare of the Iraqi people is protected, in stark contrast to

the appalling behavior of an Iraqi regime which has shown

itself to be completely insensitive to the suffering of its own

people,'' Moose told the Sub-Commission.

<p>The United States strongly opposes any lifting of the

sanctions which have now entered their 11th year, and maintains

that Saddam is responsible for the suffering of his people.
