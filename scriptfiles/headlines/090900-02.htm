The hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica is bigger than ever, US scientists announced yesterday. Nasa has measured the area of thinning ozone as covering an area three times the size of the US.

<P>Ozone in the stratosphere forms a natural shield to filter harmful ultraviolet light. But for more than 15 years there has been alarm at dramatic thinning over Antarctica and more recently the Arctic.

<font size="1">The largest ozone hole ever seen has opened up over Antartica, a sign that ozone-depleting gases churned out years ago are just now coming to their peak, NASA scientists reported September 8, 2000. Seen in this image released by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the hole appears as a giant blue blob which spreads over about 11 million square miles (28.3 milion square kilometers).

A worldwide agreement reached more than 10 years ago banned the long-lived chemicals responsible for ozone destruction. But because of their longevity they are expected to go on damaging the ozone layer for decades. The polar regions are particularly at risk because the chemical reaction which destroys ozone is helped by their weather conditions.

<P>The holes appear each spring - in March in the north and September in the south. Nasa reports that the hole over Antarctica had reached a   record size of about 11m square miles by September 3.

<P>Scientists say the hole has stopped growing this year in area but the levels of ozone within are continuing to fall. The lowest readings are usually at the end of September or early October.

<P>Lower levels of ozone are linked to increases in skin cancer and cataracts. There is also fear that ultraviolet radiation could harm plants and microbes. Ozone is an unstable form of oxygen actually created by ultraviolet light. It breaks down and forms again but the presence of chlorine-based CFC chemicals from, among other things, old-style aerosols is interfering with the process.

<P>"These observations reinforce concerns about the frailty of earth's ozone layer. Although production of ozone-destroying gases has been curtailed under international agreements, concentrations of the gases in the stratosphere are only now reaching their peak. Due to their long persistence in the atmosphere, it will be many decades before the   ozone hole is no longer an annual occurrence," said Michael Kurylo, manager of the upper atmosphere research programme at Nasa.

<P>Most atmospheric ozone is found between six miles and 18 miles above the earth's surface.

<P>Scientists continuing to investigate this enormous hole are somewhat surprised by its size. "Variations in the size of the ozone hole and of ozone depletion accompanying it from one year to the next are not unexpected," said Jack Kaye at Nasa. "At this point we can only wait to see how the ozone hole will evolve in the coming few months."

<P>Although Nasa satellites began searching for signs of ozone destruction 20 years ago, the hole was discovered by British scientists taking balloon measurements in the Antarctic in 1985.

<P>Brian Gardiner, one of the three British discoverers of the ozone hole, said yesterday: "It is the start of the springtime depletion. We are watching it and the bottom line is it is not getting any better."
