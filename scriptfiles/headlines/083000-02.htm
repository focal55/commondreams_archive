The next weapon in the arsenal of the war against drugs may well be

biological.

<p>Scientists have discovered three microscopic fungi that will cause

marijuana plants, opium poppies and coca bushes to turn yellow, drop

their leaves and wither.

<p>While opponents believe that use of such fungi could cause an

environmental disaster, supporters see it as a benevolent alternative to

fumigation, which defoliates all plants--including food crops--underneath

the fine mist sprayed by planes.

<p>As President Clinton visits Colombia today to formally initiate a

controversial $1.3-billion anti-narcotics aid package, the potential use

of fungi is becoming an important part of the debate over the most

effective way to halt drug production and trafficking. Colombia is the

world's leading producer of cocaine.

<p>"It was a godsend," said a U.S. official who saw the effects of an

anti-coca fungus in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley at the beginning of the

1990s. The fungus wiped out 30% of the coca crop, and the leaves that

survived had lower levels of alkaloid, the active ingredient in cocaine,

says the official, whose life has been threatened because of his

anti-drug work.

<p>The fungus strangles plants by blocking their vascular systems, much

like cutting off a person's blood supply.

<p>But ecologists worry: What happens afterward?

<p>"It could have an impact on other vegetation when it finishes off the

coca," said a Colombian government biologist. "This is a living organism

that will transform itself in order to survive. Field tests are a risk

for Colombia and the entire Amazon basin."

<p>With that argument, Colombia--like Florida, which is a significant

marijuana producer--has refused to permit field testing of anti-drug

fungi. But laboratory testing continues in controlled environments as far

flung as Uzbekistan and Hawaii.

<p>Biologists are concerned that the Colombian government, recipient of

two-thirds of the funds in the U.S. anti-drug aid package, will not be

able to resist pressure to test the anti-coca fungus outside the

laboratory. "We say 'no,' but then it turns out to be 'yes,' " warned

agronomist Pedro Leon Gomez.

<p>The anti-coca and anti-marijuana fungi are cousins in a family that is

the plant world's equivalent of the Jesse James gang. Members of the

Fusarium oxysporum clan have ravaged cotton in Australia, muskmelon in

California, beans in Spain and even carnations and banana trees in

Colombia.

<p>However, each fungus is choosy about its victim, experience indicates,

generally preferring to attack only one species of plant. The fungus that

destroyed the carnations here did not bother other flowers, and the

strangled banana trees were replaced by another variety, an effective but

expensive solution.

<p>But scientists are still experimenting to figure out how adaptable

each fungus can be in different soils and climates.

<p>Since the fungus lives in the soil, it goes about its deadly work

despite rain or wind, a major advantage over pesticides.

<p>The drawbacks of other eradication methods may be one of the factors

that will make biological methods more tempting. During the past two

years that U.S. Defense Department contractors have been spraying

pesticides on Colombian coca fields, production has actually risen by

half.

<p>Nor have efforts to persuade coca farmers to grow other crops been

particularly successful.

<p>"Gains in establishing alternative crops were modest in the extreme

and worse yet when it came to eradication of drug crops," according to an

Inter-American Development Bank, or IDB, evaluation of projects in

Colombia from 1991 to 1996.

<p>There are few indications of a major improvement in the past four

years, despite the availability of a $90-million IDB credit for such

projects. Only $28.5 million of that money has been used, according to

Colombian officials, because the credit requires matching funds and the

government here has not provided enough.

<p>Still, a Colombian government biologist wary of the fungus insisted:

"This should only be considered if it were the last option available.

Have we tried all the other options?"

<p>The fungus could undermine a potentially viable option that has not

yet been tried, warns agronomist Leon Gomez. Oil palms are among the few

cash crops that will grow in the same climate as coca.

<p>Although hardly as profitable as illegal crops, palm oil does have a

guaranteed market, says the Cornell-educated Leon Gomez, who heads the

oil palm industry's research institute here. The institute's main project

for the past decade--$8 million worth of research--has been to find a way

to protect palm trees from a soil fungus.

<p>Referring to Fusarium oxysporum, he said, "This fungus is much more

aggressive than the one we are trying to manage now."

<p>In fact, among the fungus family's best-known victims was the palm oil

industry in Nigeria and Zaire.

<p>Leon Gomez says he could not in good conscience recommend that oil

palm farmers plant in a zone that was known to have been infested with

even a distant relative of that fungus. "The risk is just too high," he

said.

<p>Florida officials came to the same conclusion about the anti-marijuana

cousin, prohibiting its use there last year. Their main concern was that

the fungus might mutate and attack other crops.

<p>As work on the anti-marijuana and anti-coca fungi has stopped short of

field testing--U.S. and U.N. officials insist that a naturally occurring

strain is at work in Peru--research on an anti-poppy fungus from a

different family has begun to catch up.

<p>The Institute of Genetics at Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan in

Central Asia, has tested Pleospora papaveracea on 150 plants closely

related to the opium poppy, from which heroin is derived, and has not yet

found another that the fungus harmed.

<p>"The basic science is done or close to being done," said Howard Stead,

chief of the scientific section at the U.N. International Drug Control

Program, which sponsors the research.

<p>Native to Uzbekistan, the fungus "has different rates of

effectiveness, depending on variables such as climatic conditions," he

said.

<p>The fungus still needs to be tested in areas where illicit crops grow,

he says.

<p>Both Colombia and the United States use biological controls against

pests that attack commercial crops, he says.

<p>"We're talking about similar technologies, whether they are opium

poppies or coca bushes or weeds," he said. "When you are killing coca

bushes, there are interest groups that want to protect the coca bushes,

so questions are raised."

<p>However, one of the Colombian biologists says experiences with

biological controls are exactly what have prompted his government's

objections to introducing a fungus.

<p>"We introduced one ant to control another ant, and now the [new] ant

is a worse problem," he said, citing one example. "They ate the first

ants, and now they eat everything those ants ate.

<p>"The fungus would not know why we brought it here or when it had

finished its job," he added. "We are trying to turn responsibility for a

problem of [drug] consumption into a biological problem. Since we as

humans cannot solve this problem, we want a fungus to solve it for us."
