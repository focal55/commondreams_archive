<p>A coalition of over 450 women's and

human

rights groups world-wide, led by Catholics For a Free Choice

(CFFC), have

launched a campaign calling for a review of the Holy See's status

at the

United Nations. 

<P>

At a press conference Tuesday, Frances Kissling, President of

CFFC, said

that, "to grant state status and special privileges to this

religion [Roman

Catholicism] over all others is simply unfair." No other religion

is

recognised as a state in the United Nations, although all do

participate as

non-governmental organisations (NGOs), she added. 

<P>

Of the NGOs participating in the campaign are some of the United

Nations's

largest and most active - including the International Planned

Parenthood

Federation, Equality Now, the Sierra Club, the American Humanist

Association, the Feminist Majority - and hundreds of others from

more than

40 countries. 

<P>

The high-profile opposition of the Vatican to family planning,

safe abortion

and condoms for AIDS prevention seems to have served to alert

supporters of

the campaign -- formally called the "See Change" Campaign - to the

question

of the legal statehood of the Holy See and the implication of this

to the

privileged role it plays at the United Nations. 

<P>

Anika Rahman, Director of International Programmes at the Center

For

Reproductive Law and Policy, told reporters Tuesday that the Holy

See's

status at the United Nations, "is as if the Soviet Union's

Politburo had had

the right to Non-Member State Observer status at the UN." 

<P>

Speaking not as a Roman Catholic but an Evangelical Christian,

Peter C.

Smith of the International Right to Life Federation said he does

not

recognise "the authority of NGOs to request the removal of any

delegation

from the UN." 

<P>

He went on to laud the unique role of the Holy See as an

intermediary or

mediator between delegations here, saying that "the Holy See

represents

neither rich nor poor, East nor West, North nor South." 

<P>

"At the UN, the Roman Catholic Church is uniquely positioned to

influence

international policy and deliberations on a wide range of issues,

including

international economic development and women's status," Rahman

said. 

<P>

However, the CFFC has always held the position that having no

women, girls

or even male child as citizens, the Vatican has no basis to form

opinions on

issues relating to women or family. 

<P>

Additionally, the Holy See has neither signed nor ratified the

Convention on

the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women

(CEDAW), called

the international 'Bill of Rights of Women', ratified by 165 of

the 188

member states have ratified it. In fact the Holy See has not

signed or

ratified any women's rights treaty at all, according to CFFC. 

<P>

The church has also dealt harshly with women who disagree with it

on issues

of sexuality, going so far as to silence Brazilian nun and

theologian Ivone

Gebara, according to CFFC. Women are also absent from senior

positions

within dioceses and on the pontifical councils that advise the

Pope on

issues of family and sexuality. 

<P>

According to CFFC, the Pope is quoted as saying of women who had

been raped

in Bosnia that they "should accept the enemy" and make him "flesh

of their

flesh" rather than take emergency contraception. Furthermore, in

many

African countries where women are increasingly vulnerable to

HIV/AIDS, the

Holy See has consistently attempted to block or undermine safe sex

programmes. 

<P>

Bene Madunagu, executive board chair of the Girls' Power

Initiative (GPI) in

Nigeria, noted the devastating impact of the Catholic hierarchy's

opposition

to the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa. 

<P>

"Faced with the devastation that AIDS is causing in countries

across Africa,

the Holy See has coldly reiterated its ban on the use of condoms

to prevent

the spread of AIDS. The Church leadership continues to pose

serious

obstacles to AIDS prevention at both an international and local

level,"

Madunagu said. 

<P>

As an example attesting to the "hypocrisy and double standard of

the

Vatican," Amparo Claro, director of the Latin American and

Caribbean Women's

Health Network, said that "on the surface they posture and seem to

defend

women, but in reality they are working to deny access to

reproductive health

services." 

<P>

At the current session of the Commission on the Status of Women

(CSW), the

Vatican opposed the use of the word "services" putting it in

brackets

signifying opposition. By bracketing "services", the Vatican

effectively

blocked a consensus resolution that women do require health and

reproductive

services. 

<P>

In fact it is "precisely the poorest women," whom Roman

Catholicism claims

to represent, "that are in the most dire need of these types of

programmes,"

Rahman said. "If the Holy See were acting as it properly should as

the Roman

Catholic Church, it would indeed roundly condemn China by name for

sponsoring legal abortion, family planning and the one child

policy. 

<P>

But when the Holy See acts as a government and is busy in

diplomatic circles

trying to get recognised as a state by China, it mutes its

opposition to

these Chinese policies," Kissling said. She was surprised that no

nations

have spoken out in favour of the "See Change" Campaign. However,

it is

significant to note that no countries have spoken out in

opposition to it as

well. 

<P>

A trio of Republicans in the US Congress have introduced a

resolution

warning the United Nations not to downgrade the status of the

Vatican,

cautioning that any diminution of the Vatican's rights would

"further damage

relations between the United States and the UN." 

<P>

It should come as no surprise however, that Republican members of

Congress

should attempt to assuage the current charges of anti-Catholicism

against

Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush by attempting to

pass a

resolution lauding the exploits of the Holy See at the United

Nations. 

<P>

All the same, no "observer" has ever been downgraded in the

history of the

global body. Such a change would require approval of the Secretary

General,

the President of the 188-member General Assembly and a majority

vote by

member states. 

<P>

"All of which seems unlikely," said UN spokesperson Farhan Haq who

compares

change in the Holy See's status to, "Taiwan's annual ill-fated

attempts to

win UN membership."
