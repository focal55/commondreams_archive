One night recently, in the conservative textile town of Greensboro,

N.C., the City Council, by an 8-1 vote, passed a resolution urging a

moratorium on executions in the state, whose death row is the fifth

largest in the nation.

<p>The move was the latest in a series of similar declarations in places

as widespread as Atlanta, Baltimore, Philadelphia and San Francisco--31

cities in all--that are harbingers of a growing movement for reexamining

capital punishment in the United States.

<p>After years of solid public support for executions, "I think that

people have decided to take a second look, both at their own opinions and

at the application of the death penalty," said Bob Carpenter, a

Republican pollster in Virginia whose firm has been polling on the issue.

<p>As recently as four years ago, foes of the death penalty--many of whom

had fought against capital punishment for a generation--seemed to be

pursuing a totally lost cause.

<p>Even now, a majority of people nationwide support capital punishment,

according to numerous opinion polls. But the surveys also show that the

majority has shrunk and support for a moratorium has grown. Revelations

of wrongful convictions around the country, combined with the advent of

DNA technology, a nationwide decline in crime rates and some artful

organizing with strong input from the American Bar Assn., religious

groups and foundations all appear to have contributed to the change.

<p>Unlike earlier efforts against capital punishment, the current drive

focuses on reform, not abolition. As a result, the movement has gained

significant new allies--most notably Illinois Gov. George Ryan. The

Republican governor supports capital punishment, but in February imposed

a moratorium in his state.

<p>Ryan acted after 13 men were freed from death row in Illinois because

judges had concluded that they were wrongfully convicted. Anthony Porter,

the 13th, was just hours from execution when a group of Northwestern

University journalism students produced evidence that another man had

committed the murder.

<p>The moratorium was needed "because I have grave concerns about our

state's shameful record of convicting innocent people and putting them on

death row," Ryan said.

<p>Greensboro Councilwoman Nancy Vaughn, also a Republican, is another

unlikely ally of the moratorium movement.

<p>"The death penalty is just," she said after voting to endorse a

moratorium earlier this month. "However, I have very deep concerns about

the equitability, the equality and the efficiency" of how the penalty is

imposed.

<b><br>

<p>Moratorium Called 'a Moral Dodge'

</b>

<p>So far, death penalty supporters have not mounted organized opposition

to the moratorium movement, although some of them are speaking out

against it.

<p>"The thing about the moratorium I find offensive is, it's a moral

dodge," said Josh Marquis, the district attorney of Clatsop County in

Oregon and a member of the National District Attorneys Assn.

<p>"For opponents of the death penalty, no moratorium will be long

enough," he said.

<p>The moratorium movement, he asserted, had improperly lumped several

issues--"innocence, DNA, poor lawyers, jailhouse snitches"--into one in

an attempt to "change the debate from whether it is right to kill people

to 'surely you are not in favor of killing an innocent person.' "

<p>Indeed, at least some longtime crusaders against capital punishment

worry about precisely that emphasis. The focus on innocence will

dissipate over time as people realize that many condemned inmates are

guilty, they fear.

<p>Still, most are happy to have new support.

<p>"My view is that this is like any other political movement: The only

way you can achieve ultimate success is by broadening the number of

people involved," said Atlanta attorney Stephen Bright, who has handled

appeals in capital cases for two decades.

<p>"I've been crying in the wilderness for 20 years about poor defense

lawyers, racism, executions of the mentally ill. Now people are paying

attention. That's good," Bright said.

<p>Although the moratorium effort is gathering strength, it is too early

to say how much effect it will have.

<p>Nationwide, the pace of executions has slowed somewhat in 2000. Last

year, 98 people were executed in the United States; so far this year, 70

have been.

<p>In Maryland, Gov. Parris Glendening has set aside $225,000 for a study

of whether blacks in the state are more likely to be executed. Studies of

whether the death penalty is being administered fairly have also been

launched in Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska and North Carolina.

<p>Even in the state that has executed by far the most people--Texas--the

moratorium drive is gaining some surprising adherents.

<p>Sam D. Millsap Jr., a former district attorney from San Antonio, for

example, recently endorsed the idea. He was "no longer convinced our

legal system guarantees the protection of the innocent in capital murder

cases," Millsap wrote in the San Antonio Express News.

<p>Still, other than Ryan in Illinois, no governor has declared a

moratorium, and moratorium supporters have had several defeats. Last

year, the Nebraska Legislature enacted a moratorium, but Republican Gov.

Mike Johanns vetoed it. In New Hampshire, a state that has not had an

execution in 60 years, both houses of the Legislature voted to abolish

the death penalty, but Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen vetoed the bill.

<p>In Oregon, death penalty foes, led by former U.S. Sen. Mark Hatfield,

a Republican, failed this year to get an initiative on the state ballot

seeking abolition of capital punishment. A bill seeking a moratorium in

Pennsylvania did not get out of committee in the Legislature, nor has an

effort in Congress to impose a moratorium at the federal level.

<b><br>

<p>Momentum Began in 1998

</b>

<p>But the grass-roots effort for a moratorium seems to be gaining

strength. Much of that effort began with a conference at Northwestern

University's Law School in November 1998 on wrongful convictions and the

death penalty.

<p>In a dramatic presentation, 29 people who had been freed from death

row took the stage individually, gave their names, described the crimes

they had been wrongfully convicted of, stated the lengths of their

incarcerations and, in a mantra-like refrain, said that if the

authorities had had their way, "I'd be dead today."

<p>"All of a sudden, the fallibility of the criminal justice system was

raised to the forefront," said Gerald Kogan, a former Florida Supreme

Court justice who prosecuted capital cases but is now a vocal critic of

how the death penalty is applied.

<p>The Northwestern conference generated considerable media coverage and

spawned investigations that revealed more problems in how the death

penalty was being administered around the country.

<p>During the same period, the Roderick McArthur Foundation increased its

support of anti-death-penalty groups and the creation of new ones with

appealing names such as the Justice Project and the National Committee to

Prevent Wrongful Executions.

<b><br>

<p>President Carter Endorses Cause

</b>

<p>The American Bar Assn., which first called for a moratorium in

February 1997, has also played a major role in publicizing the issue. The

group held a conference Thursday at the Carter Center in Atlanta that

featured leaders of the movement, including Ryan and former First Lady

Rosalynn Carter.

<p>ABA president Martha Barnett issued a statement urging governors in

all 38 states with the death penalty to declare a moratorium.

Simultaneously, Jimmy Carter, who signed Georgia's current death penalty

law when he was governor in 1973, issued a statement saying he supported

a moratorium, stressing that he has become "increasingly concerned about

extremely distorted and abusive executions of poor, minority, and

mentality deficient accused persons in America."

<p>Even activists concede that ultimate success may be a long way off,

but they vow to press ahead.

<p>"Awareness of the unfairness with which the death penalty is imposed

has become part of the consciousness of our country," said Eleanor

Kinnaird, a Democratic state senator in North Carolina who represents

Carrboro, the first city in that state to endorse a moratorium.

<p>"I hope we will get a prohibition on executing the mentally retarded

through here next year," Kinnaird said, adding that she does not expect

to see the death penalty actually ended in her state any time soon. "You

have to plant a seed and keep nurturing it. I would like abolition, but a

moratorium would be a good start."
