Yesterday I received from Ralph Nader a letter addressed to concerned

environmental voters, but distributed also through the Nader press list.

The

letter attacked Vice-President Gore, but went beyond that attack to

criticize

those environmentalists who are endorsing Gore for adopting a "servile

mentality."  While the letter raised, legitimately, a number of valid

issues

on

which Nader and Gore differ, it also contained a number of inaccurate

and

utterly unfair attacks.



<p>Additionally, Green Party spokespeople have begun attacking the Sierra

Club,

and

other environmentalists who are supporting the Gore-Lieberman ticket, in

increasing harsh terms, terms that go far beyond anything that we have

said

or

would in any conceivable world want to say about our differences with

the

Nader

candidacy.



<p>I have responded to this attack, and my response is attached.  I would

appreciate it if folks could distribute this as widely as possible to

environmentalists outside the Club.  We will get it out to the entire

Club

leadership list on email.

<p>

<p>Dear Ralph:



<p>Yesterday you sent me(and many other environmentalists) a long

letter

defending your candidacy and attacking "the servile mentality" of those

of

us in

the environmental community who are supporting Vice-President Gore.



<p>I've worked alongside you as a colleague for thirty years.



<p>Neither the letter nor the tactics you are increasingly adopting in

your

candidacy are worthy of the Ralph Nader I knew.



<p>The heart of your letter is the argument that "the threat to our

planet

articulated by Bush and his ilk" can now be dismissed.  But you offer no

evidence for this crucial assertion. Based on the polls today Bush is an

even

bet to become the next President, with both a Republican Senate and a

Republican

House to accompany him.



<p>You have referred to the likely results of a Bush election as being

a

"cold

shower" for the Democratic party.  You have made clear that you will

consider it

a victory if the net result of your campaign is a Bush presidency.



<p>But what will your "cold shower" mean for real people and real

places?



<p>What will it mean for tens of millions of asthmatic children when

Bush

applies to the nation the "voluntary" approach he's using in Texas to

clean

up

the air. And what about his stated opposition to enforcing environmental

standards against corporations?



<p>What will it mean for Americans vulnerable to water pollution when

Bush

allows water quality standards to be degraded to meet the needs of paper

mills

and refineries as he has consistently done in Texas, most recently at

Lake

Sam

Rayburn? And what if he eliminates federal financial support for both

drinking

water and water pollution, as his budget calls for and his record in

Texas

(46th

in spending on drinking water) suggests?



<p>What will it mean for communities of color and poverty located near

toxic

waste sites, when Bush applies his Texas approach of lower standards and

lower

polluter liability to toxic waste clean-up?



<p>What will a Bush election mean to the Gwich'in people of the

Arctic,

when

the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is turned over the oil companies and

the

calving grounds of the Porcupine Caribou herd on which they depend are

destroyed

and despoiled?



<p>What will it mean for the fishing families of the Pacific Northwest

when

Bush amends the Endangered Species Act to make extinction for the

endangered

salmon a legally acceptable option?  If he refuses to remove the dams on

the

Snake River or reduce timber cutting levels to preserve salmon?



<p>What will it mean for millions of rural Americans whose livelihood,

health

and communities are being destroyed by unregulated factory feeding

operations,

if Bush weakens the Clean Water Act? When he appoints Supreme Court

justices

who

complete the task of shutting down access to federal courts for citizens

trying

to enforce environmental laws?



<p>What will it mean for the wildlife that depend upon our National

Forests

when Bush undoes the Clinton-Gore Administration reforms, reverses their

roadless area protection policy, and restores the timber industry to the

mastery

of the forests and the Forest Service that it enjoyed under his father?

If

he

doubles, or triples, the cut on those Forests?



<p>What will it mean for millions of people in Bangladesh and other

low-lying

countries when an American refusal to confront the problem of global

warming

unleashes the floods and typhoons of a rising ocean upon them?



<p>Your letter addresses none of these real consequences of a Bush

victory.

Nor has your campaign.  Instead, you indulge yourself in the language of

academic discourse when you claim:





<p>"Bush's "old school" allegiance to plunder and extermination as

humanity's

appropriate relationship to our world speaks a language effectively

discounted

by the great tradition of naturalists from John Muir to David Brower.

Bush's

blatant anti-environmentalism will lose corporate favor as it loses

popular

support. It is a language of politics fading rapidly, and without a

future."





<p>Candidate Bush may well be speaking a fading language.  So was

candidate

Reagan in 1980 when he ranted that trees caused air pollution. It is

power,

however, not language, that determines policy.  President Bush would be

vested

with the powers of the government of the United States, and he is an

even

more

devoted servant of environmental counter-revolution than Reagan ever

was.



<p>Because your letter is couched in this language, so divorced from

the

real

world consequences of your candidacy, and the real world choices that

face

Americans, it is difficult to respond to all of its selective

misrepresentations

and inaccuracies.  A few samples, however, may show you why I am so

disappointed

in the turn your candidacy has taken:



<p>You claim that "Earth in the Balance" was "an advertisement for his

calculated strategy and availability as an environmental poseur."  Can

you

offer

a single piece of evidence to support this quite astonishing statement?



<p>You claim that the Clinton Administration stood up to the oil

industry

on

the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge only because "focus groups have

shown

him he

cannot give" it up.In fact, most polls show that the public is somewhat

split on

this issue, and there are certainly no focus groups I know of showing

that

it is

a third-rail which no President can cross at his peril. Can you cite

your

evidence?



<p>You lament that the Administration has "set aside lands not in

National

Parks, but rather in National Monuments...."  You are surely aware that

a

President cannot legally create national parks, which require an act or

Congress; nor can you be under the misapprehension that this Congress

with

Don

Young as the head of the House Resources Committee and Frank Murkowski

as

his

counterpart in the Senate would have designated these areas as parks

however

long a battle Clinton and Gore might have fought. No, you simply took a

cheap

shot, and ignored the facts.



<p>You have also broken your word to your followers who signed the

petitions

that got you on the ballot in many states. You pledged you would not

campaign as

a spoiler and would avoid the swing states.  Your recent campaign

rhetoric

and

campaign schedule make it clear that you have broken this pledge. Your

response:

you are a political candidate, and a political candidate wants to take

every

vote he can. Very well -- you admit you are a candidate -- admit that

you

are,

like your opponents, a flawed one.



<p>Irresponsible as I find your strategy, I accept that you genuinely

believe

in it.  Please accept that I, and the overwhelming majority of the

environmental

movement in this country, genuinely believe that your strategy is

flawed,

dangerous and reckless.  Until you can answer how you will protect the

people

and places who will be put in harm's way, or destroyed, by a Bush

presidency,

you have no right to slander those who disagree with you as "servile."



<p>You have called upon us to vote our hopes, not our fears.  I find

it

easy

to do so. My hope is that by electing the best environmental President

in

American history, Al Gore, we can move forward.  My fear is that you,

blinded by

your anger at flaws of the Clinton-Gore Administration, may be

instrumental

in

electing the worst.



<p>Sincerely yours,





<p>Carl Pope<br>

Executive Director<br>

The Sierra Club
