PRAGUE - Kentucky 

Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut have 

already ordered replacement glass. 

So has Tesco, a British supermarket 

chain, and it is thinking of shutting 

down for the duration. McDonald's 

talks hopefully of its local ownership 

and wants to keep its outlets open.



<p> The Interior Ministry will have 

11,000 police officers on duty, with 

several thousand troops in reserve. 

Schools and theaters will close. The 

ministry has even opened a Web site, 

warning young people: "The police 

will have a lot of work on their hands, 

so they cannot be too tolerant of 

various childish pranks." It adds, 

"Do not provoke the police."



<p> It advises older people to stock up 

on food and medicine, and to "relax 

and trust the authorities."



<p> One might think that these are 

preparations for the battle in Central 

Europe that NATO war-gamed for so 

many years. But it is only the annual 

autumn meeting of the International 

Monetary Fund and the World Bank, 

a conference that the Czech Republic 

eagerly sought in 1993 as a millennial 

symbol of the country's return to 

capitalism and the West.



<p> The 10-day meeting, which is expected at attract up to 18,000 officials 

and delegates, opens on Sept. 19. The 

Communists' old Palace of Culture 

has been renovated for the meeting 

at a cost of $60 million and renamed 

the Congress Center.



<p> But since Prague sought this honor, the monetary fund and the World 

Bank have become targets of rage 

against globalization and indifferent 

capitalism. The fund in particular 

has for some the same negative connotations that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has for far-right groups in the United States.



<p> Already, on various Web sites critical of the fund and its policies, like 

www.destroyimf.org -- "a Web resource for all those mobilizing to end 

the poverty and injustice inflicted by 

global capitalism" -- there is the 

cry: "Turn Prague into Seattle!" 

There, late last November, 40,000 

demonstrators paralyzed the city, 

damaged businesses, clashed with 

the police and tied up a meeting of 

the World Trade Organization.



<p> Organizers and Czech officials expect 20,000 to 50,000 protesters -- 

some peaceful, some not -- to come 

here. The protests will certainly be 

the largest here since 1989, and perhaps the largest invasion of foreigners since the Soviets dropped by with 

their tanks in 1968.



<p> President Vaclav Havel has tried 

to satisfy and perhaps co-opt some of 

the more well-mannered groups by 

offering to meet with them at Prague 

Castle. 



<p> The government has offered designated areas for protest and arranged 

for a private company, FAM, to 

equip the old Strahov sports stadium 

with tents, portable lavatories and 

food so the protesters will have a 

relatively clean and safe place to 

stay.



<p> The tent city will open on Sept. 21, 

and anyone may stay there for the 

duration for $37, said Tomas Doubek 

of FAM. There will be private security guards but no policemen, unless 

there is significant trouble.



<p> But the conservative party of former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 

objected to the arrangements, saying they looked as if the Czechs "are 

collaborating with extremists," Mr. 

Doubek said. 



<p> "Some legislators said, 'Let the 

protesters get a doctorate in finance, 

learn two foreign languages, work in 

a bank for a few years, and then they 

will be qualified to discuss I.M.F. 

issues,' " he said. "Surprisingly, nobody laughed at this stupidity."



<p> Alice Dvorska, an organizer with 

the Czech umbrella group Initiative 

against Economic Globalization, 

says she is worried about how the 

Czech police, with a history of aggressive crowd control, will behave. 



<p> In May 1998 the police were taken 

by surprise by protests against the 

automobile industry and globalization. The police beat some protesters 

and some bystanders as well.



<p> "We're afraid of violence on the 

part of the police," Ms. Dvorska said. 

"The Interior Ministry is purposely 

demonizing us. If you look at protests 

around the world, it is always the 

police who cause most of the violence."



<p> Chelsea Mozen is a 25-year-old 

American who quit a job in Washington to help organize the initiative's 

program of nonviolent demonstrations, dance and street theater intended to educate citizens. 



<p> "It's not our main aim to shut the 

meeting down, although we think the 

I.M.F. and World Bank should be 

dissolved," Ms. Mozen said. "We 

want a grass-roots display of our 

disagreement."



<p> But she says the police have been 

monitoring the group and its planning, including a meeting outside 

Prague last month. "We're definitely 

under surveillance," she said.



<p> On Aug. 2 the group handed out 

fliers and performed a bit of street 

theater in Old Town Square, holding 

a symbolic soccer match between 

multinational corporations and representatives of the world's poor. The 

corporations won by bribing the referee, who represented the I.M.F. and 

the World Bank.



<p> Chuck Reinhardt, a high school 

teacher from New York,  played the 

part of McDonald's during the 

match. "The World Bank is not accountable," he said. "They give out 

loans but don't bear responsibility 

for what is being done with the money, and most people around the world 

get no benefits from it at all."



<p> Ragnhild Eide Skogseth, 18, a Norwegian student who played Shell Oil, 

said the fund and the bank "always 

say they want to help the poor, but 

the results are always the opposite." 



<p> The Czech police have been training for the meeting and have worked 

with the American police and with 

the F.B.I., which has opened an office 

in Prague, mostly to monitor organized crime. 



<p> The F.B.I. trained 24 Czech police 

officers in crowd control in the United States, said an Interior Ministry 

spokesman, Stanislav Gross, and the 

police have paid particular attention 

to the way the Washington, D.C., police handled the spring meeting of 

the fund and the bank in April. Hundreds of protesters were arrested 

there, but there was much less violence than in Seattle.



<p> Still, for the designers of the Web 

site, the meeting "will be protected 

by a Czech police operation run by 

the F.B.I." It says, "The challenge to 

the workers' movement is to shut 

down that summit with the biggest 

international demo Europe has ever 

seen."



<p> One problem for the police is the 

location of the old Palace of Culture. 

The main access from the city center, where most delegates will stay, 

is by a bridge over a valley that could 

be blocked by protest. 



<p> The two closest hotels, the Corinthia Forum and the Panorama, are 

on the right side of the bridge, but 

because they have Libyan ownership, an American embargo would 

bar Americans from staying there.



<p> Horst K&#0246;hler, the fund's executive 

director, says he has "full confidence" in Prague's ability to handle 

the meeting. Emphasizing a need for 

"internal reform," he said the fund 

was "open for discussions and dialogue."



<p> "We're not hiding" from the protesters, he said.



<p> Mr. Havel emphasizes the symbolism of Prague as the host of the post-Communist world's first annual 

meeting of the fund and bank. He 

said he would try to have discussions 

with the demonstrators as well as 

the bankers. 



<p> The media attention given to security issues "pains me," he said. "It 

seems as if we are preparing for civil 

war. We should take this more positively."
