UNITED NATIONS  - Heads of state, religious leaders

and civil society will meet in New York within the next two weeks

in a forum designed to air concerns and devise strategies to deal

with globalisation. 

<P>

Forum 2000 is to be hosted by The State of the World Forum, a non-

profit organisation working for sustainable globalisation. It will

bring together the different viewpoints on globalisation ''for the

first time ever, in a global town hall meeting,'' President of the

State of the World Forum, Jim Garrison, told IPS. 

<P>

The meeting is timed to coincide with the United Nations (UN)

Millennium Summit (Sep. 6-8), convened by UN Secretary-General

Kofi Annan to adopt a global vision for the 21st Century. More

than 150 heads of government will attend the Millennium Summit.  

<P>

''Unlike recent international meetings in Seattle, Davos and

Washington, D.C. - where dissenting views were heard only on the

streets - this meeting will bring all of globalisation's varied

stakeholders to the same table to discuss issues of mutual

concern,'' Nils Hoffman, Press Co-ordinator, said of Forum 2000. 

<P>

''Institutions governing globalisation are all limited to

representatives of sovereign states, but in reality globalisation

affects everyone. As a minimum we need to create a mechanism for

the stakeholders to meet across the table. My instinct, from the

experience of democracy, is how these types of matters can be

solved through diverse discussions,'' Garrison said. 

<P>

''We are taking the creative leadership to break through the

dialectic,'' he added. 

<P>

Former Soviet President and Founding Member of The State of the

World Forum, Mikhail Gorbachev, will chair the initial stages of

Forum 2000 in New York, Sep. 4 - 10. 

<P>

It will include the co-chairs Thabo Mbeki, President of South

Africa, Yasuhiro Nakasone, Prime Minister of Japan (1982-87),

Jehan Sadat, First Lady of Egypt (1970-81), Jean-Bertrand

Aristide, President of Haiti (1991-1996) and Nobel Peace Prize

Laureate, Desmond Tutu. 

<P>

Over 1,000 people from more than 80 countries are expected to

participate. The participants are representing all of

globalisation's key issue areas, from science and technology to

business and spirituality. They include AOL Chairman Steve Case

and consumer advocate Ralph Nader. 

<P>

Over 35 heads of state have been invited to attend the Forum.

Twelve have accepted the invitation. They include heads of

government from South Africa, New Zealand, Senegal, Colombia,

Gambia and Cost Rica. Foreign Ministers from Thailand, Indonesia

and Turkey have said they will attend. 

<P>

A release has been issued in advance of Forum 2000 to brief

participants for a post-Seattle (World Trade Organisation meeting)

dialogue on globalisation. 

<P>

''It is aimed at convincing people that globalisation has really

replaced the Cold War as the organising framework for human

affairs,'' Garrison said. 

<P>

The State of the World Forum analysed trends and projections

compiled by the United Nations and other agencies in economic

development, international trade, communications, culture, labour,

environment, health, human development and religion. The report

concludes that globalisation will change the world as radically in

the 21st Century as democratisation changed it in the 20th

Century. 

<P>

''Globalisation has become a powerful force to be reckoned with.

It has as much power to change lives as the move from monarchy

toward democracy that took place in the 20th Century,'' Garrison

concluded. 

<P>

As a result of globalisation, the report states, the percentage of

people with access to telephones, television, the Internet and

radio is at its highest level ever, empowering many with

information they never had access to before. 

<P>

''Globalisation comes down to much more than just communications

and economics.  We must look at it in terms of workers' rights,

the environment, culture, health, ethics and development as

well,'' Garrison said. 

<P>

In 1900, no country had voting rights for all adults. Today, 70

percent of countries have universal adult franchise. 

<P>

In the developing world, where 80 percent of the world's

population resides, the lack of access to modern communications

systems has contributed to much slower economic growth and the

largest ever income gap between developed and developing nations.

The average GNP per capita in high-income countries is now 25,510

dollars, while it is only 520 dollars on average in all low-income

countries. 

<P>

The report also notes that developing countries that have

attracted jobs from overseas due to low labour rates also have

poor protections for workers. Workers lack pension benefits and

health insurance and some employers force long work hours or

dangerous conditions without ample safety precautions, according

to the report. 

<P>

There is an increasing number of health problems that have only

plagued the development world are now found in the developing

world, the report concludes. 

<P>

In 1990, the most important global health risks were lower

respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases and conditions arising

during perinatal periods.  By 2020, major global health threats

are expected to match those in the United States and other

industrial countries, such as heart disease, major depression,

traffic accidents and cerebrovascular disease, it says. 

<P>

Telecommunications is also considered a key indicator of global

inequality. The average industrial country has 251 fax machines

per 10,000 residents, while the average developing country has

only five per 10,000.  A person in an industrialised country

spends an average of 43 minutes on international calls per year,

while a person in the developing world spends only three minutes,

it is reported. 

<P>

The State of the World Forum is planning to hold a meeting similar

to Forum 2000 in Prague, Czech Republic, from Sep. 26 to 28. This

second forum will coincide with the annual meetings of the

International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, also being

held in Prague. 

<P>

''We need to add a third ingredient to a potentially polarised and

violent situation. Anti-globalisation protestors are gaining more

and more public support and there is no receptivity to this on

behalf of the IMF or World Bank,'' Garrison explained.
