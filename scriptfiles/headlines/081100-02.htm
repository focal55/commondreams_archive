Ralph Nader, whose campaign for consumer protections began long

before his Green Party presidential bid, accused his Democratic and

Republican competition Thursday of unfairly shielding corporations from

consumer lawsuits and damage awards.

<p>Nader promised to vigorously promote consumer rights in his

third-party campaign, including a patient's right to sue an HMO.

</TABLE></font></font></font></font></font>In a position paper to be issued this morning, Nader faulted nearly

every elected official and legislature in the United States for limiting

the liability of negligent corporations, and he faulted several major

industries for taking advantage of such protections.

<p>Nader dismissed the tort reform efforts that Republican presidential

candidate George W. Bush has promoted as Texas' governor, calling it tort

"deform."

<p>"Bush is the worst of the worst on this," Nader said. "You couldn't

have anybody worse. He brags about it, he boasts about it, it's one of

his top 10 issues."

<p>Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan defended Bush's record, which has included

legislation to cap punitive damages awarded in lawsuits. Bush has said

that lawyers, not victims, profit unduly from such suits.

<p>"The governor realizes that ultimately consumers are the ones that pay

for frivolous and junk lawsuits in the form of higher prices for goods

and services and higher insurance premiums," Sullivan said. "His view is

that the system must have more balance and fairness built into it, and

that balance and fairness is for plaintiffs, for consumers and for

employers alike."

<p>According to Nader, who dismissed the costs to consumers of liability

suits as minimal, the Democrats have been no more supportive of

consumers. He singled out President Clinton for signing legislation

limiting lawsuits and Vice President Al Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph

I. Lieberman of Connecticut, for his "passion to limit the liability of

predatory corporations toward their injured or defrauded victims."

<p>"He's got an obsession to immunize corporations," Nader said.

<p>Lieberman spokesman Dan Gerstein countered that the senator has "a

consumer protection and environmental protection record that is second to

none." He credited Lieberman for a range of accomplishments, from

controlling cable television rates to holding oil firms liable for

spills.

<p>"Ralph Nader's picking on one of his friends rather than doing what he

does so well: challenging the polluters and corporations who take

advantage of consumers," Gerstein said.

<p>Nader, who for four decades has led public campaigns against corporate

abuse, has also taken up rising California utility rates as an issue,

citing the deregulation of utilities as the cause. He accused

California's Legislature of bowing to utility and power companies by

easing regulations on them in exchange for political donations.

<p>Nader released a letter Thursday calling on Gore and Bush to support

mandates for energy efficiency and renewable energy. He said he will

focus on California's utility rates when he campaigns in the state Aug.

20-27.
