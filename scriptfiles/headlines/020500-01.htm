<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TULSA, Okla. - A state commission recommended yesterday that reparations be paid for one of the nation's deadliest racial clashes: a little-known, 1921 rampage by a white Tulsa mob that killed as many as 300 people, most of them black. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The 11-member panel called for direct payments to survivors and victims' descendants, scholarships, and a tax-checkoff program to fund economic development in Tulsa's mostly black Greenwood area and a memorial to the dead. 

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This way we will be helping people first, which is what we are supposed to be doing,&quot; said Jim Loyd, a member of the Tulsa Race Riot Commission. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The panel gave no specifics on how much the package would cost and offered no details on such things as who would get the scholarships. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The recommendation is subject to approval by the Legislature, which created the commission. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Genevieve Elizabeth Tillman Jackson, an 84-year-old black woman who survived the riot, said after the vote that she never thought she would see the day. 

</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's great,&quot; she said. &quot;I think the survivors should be helped, and the children of survivors.&quot;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

About a half-dozen of the 80 known riot survivors watched yesterday as the commission heard personal accounts, newspaper stories and a subcommittee recommendation before approving the payment of reparations. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Ten of the 11 members voted in favor of the memorial and the scholarship after one commissioner left the meeting early. The vote was 9-1 on the direct payments and the tax checkoff. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The riot broke out May 31, 1921, when a white lynch mob clashed with blacks who were protecting a black man accused of assaulting a white elevator operator. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Over two days, white mobs set fire to homes, businesses and churches in Greenwood, a thriving black business district known at the time as the Black Wall Street of America. When the smoke cleared, the area lay in ruins.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Many blacks left and never returned. The National Guard rounded up thousands of others and held them at the fairgrounds, convention hall and a baseball stadium. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The commission, which included a survivor, historians, lawmakers and community members, held meetings for two years and agreed that it might be impossible to get a complete, accurate account of what happened. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

There is uncertainty over such things as how many died, whether a Tulsa cemetery holds mass graves, and what role the National Guard played. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Yesterday, some in the crowd shouted and others let out a low &quot;no, no, no&quot; when Democratic State Rep. Abe Deutschendorf recalled a riot survivor's account that the National Guard saved his life. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

For decades, the city ignored the riot. It was only in 1996 that Tulsa recognized its anniversary. The next year, the Legislature created the commission when Tulsa lawmakers raised the issue of restitution. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

In 1994, Florida set the precedent in reparations by paying up to $150,000 each to nine survivors of a 1923 attack on blacks in Rosewood, Fla. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

In Arkansas, historians and residents will hold a conference next week to discuss a major race riot in 1919 at Elaine, Ark. The death toll has been put at anywhere from 20 to 200.
