Anyone who thinks the world has heard

the end of U.S. arguments for a National Missile Defense (NMD)

because President Clinton said on Friday he would leave the

issue to his successor should think again.

<p>His announcement reflected a realization that months of

trying to persuade Russia to amend a Soviet-era pact not to

build a system to shoot down each other's missiles had failed --

but only for this administration, analysts said.

President Clinton has decided to leave to his successor the tough decision on beginning deployment of a national defense against ballistic missile attack, two senior administration officials said.

</TABLE></font></font>``In essence, what he has done is bought time to discuss with

the allies and with the Russians and the Chinese how one ought

to proceed, and that's significant,'' said Ivo Daalder, senior

fellow at the Brookings Institution.

<p>``On the other hand, it would be a mistake to believe that

this is the end of the NMD saga. The proverbial can has been

kicked down the road,'' he said.

<p>He said he expected whoever took over from Clinton in

January to ``proceed with a vigorous development and possible

deployment'' of NMD, a system to shoot down missiles. Its

creation was prompted by concerns about programs in North Korea,

Iran and Iraq.

<p>Democratic candidate Vice-President Al Gore  said he would

try to build a consensus abroad on a limited system to shield

U.S. territory -- though like Clinton, he said failure to do so

would not stop him if the threat required it.

<p>This would mean getting Russian agreement to update the

U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty of 1972, which is seen

as the cornerstone of arms accords.

<p>It was designed to stop precisely this kind of system being

built for fear it would encourage the other side to build more

missiles to overcome the shield.

<p>Clinton and Gore argue their NMD is not aimed against Russia

and that it is necessary because of the new threats emerging in

other countries in the post-Soviet era.

<p>Republican contender George W. Bush , who favors a much

broader land- and sea-based system, said he welcomed the

opportunity to act where Clinton and Gore had failed to lead by

''developing and deploying effective missile defenses to protect

all 50 states and our friends and allies.''

<p><font size=+1><b><font size="2">Europeans Relieved, Russia And China Cautious</font></b></font>

<p>European allies were clearly relieved at Clinton's decision

after months of worrying about what might happen if Clinton

decided to go ahead with the shield without Moscow's consent.

<p>NATO called it ``prudent.'' Germany said it was ``wise.''

<p>Analysts said Clinton opened the door to months of talks

with Moscow and Beijing, which have always been vociferously

against NMD for fear it would neutralize their defenses.

<p>Russia's Interfax news agency quoted a senior Russian

defense ministry official as saying his announcement showed

''elements of a constructive approach.''

Press Counselor Zhang Yuanyuan at the Chinese embassy welcomed

the chance for Washington to ``listen to the views from other

countries, including from U.S. allies in Europe, to arrive at a

wise decision and not deploy NMD.''

<p>Russia and China tapped into European fears that it could

destabilize the delicate balance of arms control agreements to

push their argument against NMD.

<p>``But they would be mistaken to believe that they have won''

in their campaign to stop NMD altogether, Daalder said.

<p>In the short-term, the Clinton announcement should take the

heat out of bilateral meetings at the United Nations Millennium

Summit in New York next week, where he is due to meet Russian

President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday and is likely to see

Chinese President Jiang Zemin.

<p>The issue will also be the theme of discussions between

Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Russian Deputy

Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov in New York on Monday.

<p>It will also feature in Secretary of State Madeleine

Albright's meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,

also at the U.N., on Tuesday.
