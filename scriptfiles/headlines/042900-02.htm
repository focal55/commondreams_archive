<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->You would think that 10 years after the end of the Cold 

          War, the United States would be doing everything it could to get Russia 

          to reduce its bloated, aging, and dangerous arsenal of approximately 

          6,000 deployed strategic nuclear warheads. 

        <p>You would be wrong.

        

<p>In fact, as revealed here for the first time, in documents 

          obtained exclusively by the <i>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</i>, 

          U.S. negotiators have sought to allay Russian fears about a possible 

          U.S. national missile defense (NMD) system by <a href="#firststrike">ruling 

          out any future reductions</a> in strategic nuclear warheads below the 

          1,500-2,000 level and encouraging Russia to maintain its nuclear forces 

          on constant alert. 

        <p>At the meeting earlier this year in Geneva where the 

          documents below were presented to Russia, Russian negotiators countered 

          with an offer to slash the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads 

          held by each side (from the START II level of 3,000-3,500 to 1,500). 

          The United States rejected the offer but provided no public justification 

          for why it required more warheads.



        <p>That the United States is asking Russia to forsake deep 

          reductions in nuclear weapons for the indefinite future is bad enough. 

          This news is certain to anger many delegates to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 

          Treaty (NPT) review conference, currently taking place at the United 

          Nations, who have been highly critical about the lack of progress in 

          arms control and disarmament since 1995, when the United States renewed 

          its promise under Article VI of the treaty to "pursue negotiations in 

          good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear 

          arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament."



        <p>Worse yet, the United States is encouraging Russia to 

          continue to maintain its strategic nuclear forces on hair-trigger alert, 

          ready to fire within minutes of receiving a launch order. As a consequence 

          of the breakup of the Soviet Union and the continuing economic difficulties 

          in Russia, Russia's early-warning network is a shambles. So many satellites 

          and radars are inoperative or only partially functional that for as 

          much as 12 hours a day, Russia has no means of detecting an ICBM launch 

          from the United States. As for attacks from U.S. Trident submarines, 

          each of which can carry up to 192 warheads, Russia essentially has no 

          detection capability at all. Combining decaying and inoperative early 

          warning systems with a "launch on warning" posture for thousands of 

          nuclear weapons is a recipe for nuclear disaster.



        <p> 

        Russia's continuous high-alert posture has already led 

          to one major scare. <a href="http://www.sciam.com/1197issue/1197vonhippel.html">On 

          January 25, 1995</a>, Russian radar technicians detected a routine scientific 

          rocket launch from Norway but misinterpreted it as a Trident missile 

          from a U.S. submarine. President Boris Yeltsin hurriedly convened a 

          threat assessment conference with his senior advisers and for about 

          eight minutes they deliberated whether to launch a counterattack before 

          the incoming missile arrived. Fortunately, Russian military officers 

          were able to determine--with only two or three minutes to spare--that 

          the rocket was in fact heading away from Russian territory and therefore 

          posed no threat.

        <p> 

        Although the Clinton administration's rationale for 

          a limited NMD system centers around "rogue states" like North Korea, 

          only Russia has the capability today and into the indefinite future 

          to deliver a significant number of extremely powerful nuclear weapons 

          to targets in the United States in 30 minutes or less. While the risk 

          of deliberate nuclear war is far lower than in years past, the risk 

          of accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons is rising, in no 

          small part because of Russia's increasing reliance on nuclear weapons 

          even as its early-warning systems (its eyes and ears) fall into disrepair. 

         

        <p>But the Clinton administration has chosen to ignore 

          this very real and growing danger and is instead expending significant 

          time and political capital seeking to modify the ABM Treaty to allow 

          the deployment of a not-yet-fully tested limited missile defense system 

          against a threat which has yet to fully materialize. It is outrageous 

          that the United States would not only pursue this path but actually 

          exacerbate the danger by encouraging Russia to continue to deploy thousands 

          of nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert.

        <p><b>About the Documents </b>

        <p>These documents were presented to Russian officials 

          by U.S. negotiators during meetings in Geneva on January 19-21, 2000. 

          John Holum, senior adviser for arms control and international security 

          affairs at the State Department, headed the U.S. delegation. Yuri Kapralov, 

          head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's arms control department, led 

          the Russian delegation. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs translated 

          the English-language documents into Russian. A trusted source recently 

          obtained a copy of the translated documents and provided them to the 

          <i>Bulletin</i>. The documents were subsequently translated back into 

          English and have been reviewed by both Russian and English language 

          speakers for accuracy.

        <p>The first three documents appear to be talking points 

          for the U.S. delegation, most likely presented to the Russians by John 

          Holum. The U.S. delegation also presented its Russian counterparts with 

          a proposed protocol and annex to the ABM Treaty that would modify the 

          treaty and allow the legal deployment of the first phase of the planned 

          U.S. national missile defense system.

        

<p>The documents discuss SHF (Super High Frequency ) radars, 

          which are also known as X-band radars. Their frequency band is 3 to 

          30 gigahertz, which includes the X-band (8-12 gigahertz).

        PROTOCOL: TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION</font></b></font> 

        <p> 

        <li><font size="2">President Clinton is counting on making the decision 

          to deploy the national missile defense (NMD) system no earlier than 

          mid-2000. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">The US NMD system would not be directed against Russia 

          and would not weaken Russia's strategic deterrent potential. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">We recognize that this system contravenes the current 

          provisions of the ABM Treaty. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">We are ready to work with Russia to achieve confidence 

          in the capabilities of a limited NMD system to counter extremist rogue 

          states and to develop revisions to the ABM treaty. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">You have our draft Protocol to the Treaty, which would 

          permit the creation of a limited NMD system. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">We have decided to present the Treaty amendments we 

          propose in the form of a new "Protocol" prepared on the model of the 

          1974 Protocol. The Protocol would contain only those corrections to 

          the Treaty that are necessary to permit the initial Phase I of the deployment 

          of the limited NMD system. The rest of the Treaty would remain unchanged. 

          </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Allow me to present the provisions of our draft Protocol. 

          </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">The preamble outlines the changes in the strategic 

          situation and the necessity of adapting the Treaty to them to permit 

          deployment of a limited national missile defense system and at the same 

          time affirms our commitment to the Treaty. Specifically, the Preamble 

          states that the limited NMD system "will neither threaten nor allow 

          a threat to the strategic deterrent forces of either Party." </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Article I specifies the deployment of the limited NMD 

          system as an alternative to the deployment of ABM systems permitted 

          under the current provisions of the ABM Treaty. Thus, the ban on the 

          development of national missile defense systems and the ban on the development 

          of the basis for such a system contained in Article I of the Treaty 

          will not apply to the limited missile defense system. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Article II specifies that the development of this alternative 

          system be permitted within the limits of one ABM system deployment region 

          in which it deploys no more than 100 ABM launchers and 100 ABM interceptor 

          missiles with a radius of no more than 150 km--in full compliance with 

          Article III of the Treaty. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Article II also specifies that existing long-range 

          radar may be enabled for use as ABM radar to support this limited NMD 

          system and that each Party may deploy one additional ABM radar each 

          at any site within its national territory. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Article III specifies that if a limited NMD system 

          is deployed in accordance with the provisions of the Protocol, existing, 

          operational ABM launchers deployed in accordance with Article III of 

          the Treaty must be dismantled or destroyed; no dismantling or destruction 

          of existing ABM radars is required. According to this provision, existing 

          launchers deployed at Grand Forks which are not operational do not have 

          to be dismantled. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Article IV contains a reference to the Annex, which 

          is aimed at building confidence and assuring compliance with the Protocol 

          and which is an integral part of the Protocol. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Later we will provide you with more detailed information 

          about the Annex we have proposed. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Article V specifies that all rights and duties of the 

          Parties stated in the Treaty shall remain in force with respect to the 

          amendments introduced by the Protocol. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Article VI contains a requirement according to which, 

          at the demand of one Party, the Parties shall begin further negotiations 

          no sooner than March 1, 2001 to bring the Treaty into agreement with 

          future changes in the strategic situation. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Article VII specifies that the Protocol shall enter 

          into force after the exchange of ratification instruments, which shall 

          take place after approval of the Protocol by the procedure called for 

          by the constitution of each Party. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Finally, we would once again like to emphasize that 

          the Protocol will contain only those amendments to the Treaty that are 

          necessary to reflect the structure of the limited national missile defense. 

          </font>

          <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><a name="ANCHOR2"></a>ANNEX 

          ON VERIFICATION: TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION</font></b><br>

          <br>

        <li><font size="2">As I already explained during our previous consultations, 

          the US is ready to discuss several measures to build confidence and 

          increase transparency, as well as to advance proposals aimed at strengthening 

          verification under the Treaty with measures to be taken on the basis 

          of mutuality and to promote additional confidence that none of the limitations 

          specified in the amended ABM treaty is being violated. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Article IV of the proposed Protocol pertains to the 

          Annex containing provisions on verification, the goal of which is to 

          "build confidence and assure compliance with the provisions of the Treaty." 

          </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">In our approach we have been guided insofar as possible 

          by the goal of adapting certain fundamental aspects of inspection procedures 

          specified in the START and other arms control agreements, keeping in 

          mind the specific lessons we have learned from joint fulfillment of 

          these treaties. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">In developing specific monitoring measures, the USA 

          has tried to achieve a balance between the necessary operational burden 

          created by these measures and the real, tangible verification results 

          that they should produce. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">As we know, the ABM treaty now limits the number of 

          deployed ABM launchers and ABM interceptor missiles for each side to 

          100, and our planned initial national missile defense system does not 

          exceed these quantities. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">It is relatively easy to observe permanent ground-based 

          ABM launcher silos using national technical means of verification. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">We, however, believe that steps to be taken on the 

          basis of mutuality aimed at strengthening the observation of the number 

          and location of each party's non-deployed ABM interceptor missiles could 

          build the mutual confidence of the parties that the deployment of a 

          limited NMD system will not reduce the other party's strategic deterrent 

          potential. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Our approach is based on the following four fundamental 

          elements: </font> 

          <ul>

            <li><font size="2"> information exchange with annual updating sufficient 

              to give a comprehensive picture of key elements in the system (among 

              other things, the number and location of ABM interceptor missiles, 

              both deployed and non-deployed);</font></li>

            <li><font size="2"> notification of key events, in preparation and 

              past, pertaining to the ABM system to assist in observation of compliance 

              with the provisions of the Protocol;</font></li>

            <li><font size="2"> inspections to verify raw data and short-notice 

              inspections to ensure safeguards of the accuracy attained within 

              the bounds of the exchange of information and notifications to be 

              provided by each Party; and</font></li>

            <li><font size="2"> a mechanism for resolving matters of concern related 

              to compliance, such as visits with special access rights within 

              the bounds of the START. Using this mechanism, for example, one 

              Party can request a visit to facilities inaccessible under other 

              circumstances to verify the presence or absence of ABM interceptor 

              missiles.</font></li>

          </ul>

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">These measures are aimed at increasing the transparency 

          and predictability of our respective actions related to the ABM Treaty, 

          as well as confidence that any system intended to provide limited national 

          defense will not jeopardize the strategic deterrent of the other Party. 

          </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">By mutual agreement, the information exchanges, notifications 

          and inspections specified in the Annex will not be required until the 

          United States' first installation of an ABM interceptor at an ABM launcher 

          within the ABM system deployment region. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">As a result, the Russian Federation will not unilaterally 

          bear the burden of providing the proposed notifications and verification 

          measures. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Naturally, either Party may on a voluntary basis provide 

          any information or notifications according to the provisions of Sections 

          I and II of the Annex before the provision of such information or notification 

          becomes mandatory. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">The United States, for example, is prepared to consider 

          the matter of providing certain information and notifications on a voluntary 

          basis, if necessary, even before its first installation of an ABM interceptor 

          in an ABM launcher within the ABM system deployment region. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Allow me to present the US proposal in each of these 

          four areas in more detail as they are discussed in the proposed Annex 

          on Verification. </font> 

          <p> <font size="2"><u>Information Exchange</u></font> </p>

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">The key provision on reporting in the Protocol we propose 

          remains, of course, a quantitative maximum number of ABM launchers (just 

          as in Articles III and IV of the 1972 ABM Treaty). </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">The US approach requires declaring the total number 

          of ABM interceptor missiles transported from their respective final 

          assembly facilities. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">With respect to ABM deployment regions and other facilities 

          subject to inspection, launch position diagrams are to be provided. 

          </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Demonstrations and information exchanges will be carried 

          out with respect to all "types" of ABM interceptor missiles and ABM 

          launchers. </font> 

          <p> <font size="2"><u>Notifications</u></font> </p>

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">The US approach to developing the control regime for 

          the revised ABM Treaty calls for several notifications of measures in 

          progress and completed. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Notifications will, for example, be provided on flight 

          tests within the bounds of national missile defense, on the first installation 

          of an ABM interceptor missile on an ABM launcher in the ABM system deployment 

          region, on movement between facilities, dismantling or elimination, 

          and construction of new ABM-related facilities. </font> 

          <p> <font size="2"><u>Inspections</u></font></p>

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">The US approach includes certain types of onsite inspections, 

          both to verify raw data and a quota for short-notice inspections to 

          be performed to confirm the accuracy of the information provided on 

          ABM interceptor and ABM launcher numbers and locations within the ABM 

          system deployment region. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">The US approach assumes that after the first US ABM

          <p><font size="2">The US national missile defense system will threaten 

            Russia's strategic deterrent potential and thereby disrupt strategic 

            stability.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2"> Response: The US national missile defense system, 

            which will be limited and intended to defend against several dozen 

            long-range missiles launched by rogue states, will be incapable of 

            threatening Russia's strategic deterrent at the level of START-II 

            or START-III (or later).</font> </p>

          <p><font size="2"> For more than 30 years the classic argument in favor 

            of strategic stability and against the deployment of a large-scale 

            strategic missile defense system has been based on concerns that one 

            side might have the ability to make a surprise disarming first strike 

            against the enemy and then deploy a broad strategic missile defense 

            system to knock out the enemy's combat resources which had survived 

            the first strike and were being launched against the assailant. We 

            have clearly stated that the US missile defense system to be developed 

            by the US Government is a very limited strategic missile defense system 

            intended to protect against a threat from some rogue state, which 

            may, at most, use a few dozen warheads accompanied by advanced defense 

            penetration aids. We also proposed steps to ensure Russia's confidence 

            that the US system is in fact limited and deployed within the bounds 

            of the agreed-upon terms of the amended ABM treaty. This classic argument 

            is, therefore, simply inapplicable to defense, where capabilities 

            are just as limited as they would have been in connection with proposals 

            on the US NMD system. Nor could the system be upgraded to alter this 

            reality, except over the long term, which would create conditions 

            for considerable advance warning. </font></p>

        <li><font size="2">Both the United States of America and the Russian Federation 

          now possess and, as before, will possess under the terms of any possible 

          future arms reduction agreements, large, diversified, viable arsenals 

          of strategic offensive weapons consisting of various types of ICBMs, 

          submarine-launched ballistic missiles and heavy bombers. Specifically, 

          Russia's proposal for START-III would make it possible to have 1,500-2,000 

          warheads and even according to highly conservative hypotheses, Russia 

          and the United States could deploy more than 1,000 ICBMs and submarine-launched 

          ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads over the next decade and thereafter. 

          </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">These strategic offensive forces give each side the 

          certain ability to carry out an annihilating counterattack on the other 

          side regardless of the conditions under which the war began. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Forces of this size can easily penetrate a limited 

          NMD system of the type that the United States is now developing. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Russia now keeps its strategic arsenal on constant 

          alert and apparently will do so even at START-III levels. Russian forces 

          under START-III could make an annihilating counterattack even under 

          conditions of a surprise disarming first strike by the USA in combination 

          with a limited US NMD system. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">As a result of this Russian response initiated from 

          nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines at sea, land-based mobile 

          missiles, silo-based ICBMs and bombers that would survive the first 

          strike, a minimum of a few hundred warheads could be delivered. Moreover, 

          Russian forces have sophisticated decoy systems and other defense penetration 

          aids, and this means that it would not have to count on simply exhausting 

          defensive resources to overcome them. Furthermore, the surviving Russian 

          forces would be so large and sophisticated that they could carry out 

          an assault to enhance the offensive, which no rogue state would be capable 

          of. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that any enemy would 

          ever contemplate a first strike, since it would have to assume that 

          Russian ICBMs and submarine-launched ballistic missiles/nuclear-powered 

          ballistic missile submarines in port would be launched after tactical 

          warning, which would neutralize the effectiveness of the assault. In 

          this case Russia's response to an assault would obviously be to send 

          about a thousand warheads, together with two to three times more decoys, 

          accompanied by other advanced defense penetration aids. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">If an attempt at a disarming strike were made after 

          a period of increased international tension or conflict using conventional 

          weapons, Russia's counterattack would be considerable after the US repulsed 

          the first strike as a result of explicit steps that the Russian armed 

          forces would have taken to increase combat readiness by dispatching 

          an additional number of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines 

          out to sea, by field deployment of a large number of mobile missiles 

          and by putting bombers on takeoff alert. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">The planned American strategic nuclear forces deployed 

          under the START-III ceilings would also be able to be on constant alert 

          or on crisis alert to deliver many hundreds of warheads in response 

          to any assailant. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Both the United States and the Russian Federation therefore 

          have solid capabilities to respond to a strike from any assailant with 

          a large number of retaliatory weapons. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Furthermore, the tremendous risks associated with initiating 

          a nuclear war under any circumstances make these theoretical calculations 

          largely irrelevant. Obviously, neither side could ever contemplate such 

          an assault. </font>

          effective single layer with exo-atmospheric capability to intercept 

          several dozen single-warhead missiles accompanied by sophisticated defense

          interceptor missiles. Ultimately, when a second deployment position 

          is added, there will be 200 or so interceptor missiles. This will be 

          enough to knock out several dozen warheads accompanied by advanced defense 

          penetration aids, but inadequate to counter a larger Russian counterstrike.

          national technical means of verification. In fact, our experience to 

          date indicates that the speed with which the US could build interceptor 

          missiles, not radars, is a key factor preventing rapid expansion. In 

          any case, in view of the openness of budgetary processes in the US, 

          this hypothetical increase in the number of interceptor missiles would 

          be known several years before the expanded forces would first be deployed.

          limited NMD system to counter missile threats by rogue states. It is 

          intended to intercept long-range missiles launched from North Korea 

          or from the Near East/Persian Gulf region midway toward the United States. 

          </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Consequently, advanced early warning radars, as well 

          as ABM tracking radars associated with the proposed system should detect 

          approaching warheads and track them in flight in space above the upper 

          levels of the Northern Hemisphere, as shown on the attached diagrams. 

          </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">As a result, the architecture of our US NMD requires

          AFB in Massachusetts be upgraded to provide the necessary warning and 

          tracking of missiles from rogue states. </font>

          any long-range missiles headed toward the United States that might have 

          been launched from any country in the Northern Hemisphere. It is the 

          case that the system has to track the approach route for minimum-energy 

          attack trajectories of ballistic missiles launched from North Korea 

          and the Persian Gulf/Near East. This is not a sign of our intent to 

          focus the US limited NMD system on possible attacks by Russia and China.

        <li><font size="2">The existing five early warning radars, which we intend

          missile defense system tasks. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">In view of their technical characteristics (their operating 

          frequency in particular), even after these radars are upgraded, they 

          will not be able to provide sufficiently accurate information on tracking 

          (distinguishing between warheads and defense penetration aids) to achieve 

          effective defense against attack by more than a dozen warheads accompanied 

          by the simplest defense penetration aids. </font>

          many decoys and defense penetration aids. Authoritative written Russian 

          sources claim that the Russian Government understands that the capabilities 

          of its defense penetration aids are extremely high. These same written 

          sources, supplemented by the statements of senior Russian military personnel 

          and defense industry representatives, clearly present the idea that 

          the Russian Government anticipates that its defense penetration aids

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">This approach clearly differs from the use of the interceptor 

          missiles with nuclear warheads in the Russian system deployed around 

          Moscow, which could destroy several warheads with one interceptor missile.

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">In the American hit-to-kill system at least one interceptor 

          missile has to be launched against each warhead and "authentic object." 

          By this we mean a decoy or its likeness, which are frequently accompanied 

          by aids to overcome defense (active and passive jamming, etc.) which 

          cannot be distinguished from warheads. To achieve high certainty that 

          no warhead is overcoming the defense system, one has to launch a multitude 

          of interceptor missiles against each warhead or authentic decoy combined 

          with additional defense penetration aids. </font>

          of a large area, a limited strategic missile defense system consisting 

          of 100 non-nuclear interceptor missiles will be able in the best case 

          to destroy 20-25 warheads on impact with comparatively primitive defense 

          penetration aids. Two hundred interceptor missiles could destroy 40-50 

          warheads. We do not think that reducing Russia's ability to counterattack 

          by 20-50 warheads would substantially affect Russia's strategic deterrent, 

          even at START-III levels. </font>

          be launched from a large number of deployment sites. Quite to the contrary, 

          it was developed to defend against an ICBM attack from a comparatively

          exchange put forth by our Presidents in September 1998. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Wide access to information contained in launch notifications 

          and universal launch monitoring would be an important tool in building 

          trust. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">We agree that the principle of broad international 

          participation is important to the success of launch notifications, and 

          we can support the voluntary participation of any state provided that 

          this participation does not legitimize the missile programs of rogue 

          states. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Broad international participation in early warning 

          or early detection information exchange or the establishment of an international 

          monitoring center for this purpose will go beyond the framework of our 

          concept in this area, but we are ready to study this idea in the future. 

          </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">It is important that we gradually move toward bilateral 

          agreements and understandings before we expand our efforts to involve 

          others. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">We are completely convinced that the first step in 

          establishing any international system should be the signing of the agreements 

          on exchanging missile launch information and notification of planned 

          launches which we have been working on together. We hope that these 

          discussions can be renewed in early February. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2"> As soon as we reach an understanding on the agreement 

          on notification of scheduled launches, we will be ready to discuss a 

          diplomatic strategy to achieve broad international participation in 

          this effort. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Previously we also informed you that we are ready to 

          discuss the possibility of including, where necessary and reasonable, 

          individual members of the "Big Eight" in the Joint Warning Center as 

          a first step in carrying out President Yeltsin's initiative set forth 

          at the Big Eight meeting in Cologne. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">We have many questions about the second proposed element 

          of the GMS, namely guarantees of the security of any state participating 

          in the GMS. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2"><u>Safeguarding</u> the security of states that halt 

          their missile programs is unfeasible. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">We must, however, better understand what Russia thinks 

          about this before further continuing discussion of this element. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">The third element of the GMS pertains to incentives, 

          including aid to national space programs for states that turn away from 

          possessing missile systems. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">We agree that in certain cases incentives can play 

          an important role as part of an overall approach to a specific country 

          in countering missile technology proliferation. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">In our approaches to North Korea with regard to both 

          issues of the proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies, we 

          have found that positive incentives can be effective, at least in deterring 

          proliferation activities. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">One-size-fits-all approaches to incentives would, however, 

          be counterproductive in countering missile technology proliferation, 

          and it is not clear that this can be done on a multilateral basis (in 

          contrast to a bilateral basis)--we would welcome your assessments. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">We are especially concerned about offering aid within 

          the framework of national space programs. It is difficult to "aid" space 

          efforts, especially a space launch, without promoting the proliferation 

          of missile technologies. These technologies overlap much more than do 

          technologies for the development of nuclear reactors for peaceful civilian 

          use and those for a nuclear weapons development program. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">While we are not ready to provide aid to national programs 

          for the development of booster rockets, other space-related incentives 

          might be considered, such as providing rocket-launching services at 

          favorable prices for key countries. This might be an appropriate topic 

          for discussion at a Big Eight meeting. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">And finally, as regards the consultation mechanism, 

          we are in favor of holding regular consultations among countries involved 

          in this matter. We do not believe that broad multilateral discussions 

          will be productive at this time. These issues should be discussed within 

          the framework of the MTCR [Missile Technology Control Regime] (and groups 

          of MTCR partners) before they are moved outside this framework. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">Discussions within the framework of MTCR partners, 

          the Big Eight, and Russian-American bilateral discussions are possible 

          ways to study these ideas in depth. We would not want GMS proposals 

          to diminish the effectiveness of existing forums. </font> 

          <p> <font size="2"><b><u>Other Proposals on Cooperation</u></b></font></p>

          <b><u> 

          <p> 

          </u></b> 

        <li><font size="2">Your additional proposals on cooperation were based 

          on ideas that the USA put forth at our discussions of the ABM Treaty, 

          for example, exchanging information on missile system proliferation, 

          joint actions toward computer modeling and renewing and continuing our 

          TMD [theater missile defense] testing programs. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">We welcome your interest in these areas of possible 

          cooperation that we proposed during our discussion of the ABM Treaty. 

          We will be ready to study your ideas in detail in future meetings. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">It is not clear from Russia's statement whether you 

          are proposing that additional aspects of cooperation will be effected 

          on a bilateral basis or with multilateral involvement. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">From our side, we would like to study whether multilateral 

          participation is logical in each individual case. We previously stated 

          our desire to discuss with Russia the possibility of including individual 

          Big Eight countries in the TMD testing program as a first step in implementing 

          the initiative put forth by President Yeltsin in Cologne. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">There is one Russian proposal pertaining to additional 

          cooperation that raises some concern, namely the proposal to carry out 

          confidence-building measures agreed to in the context of demarcation 

          agreements on ABMs and theater ABMs on a bilateral basis. We do not 

          believe that this will be proper. </font> 

          <p> <font size="2"><b><u>Approach to Cooperation</u></b></font></p>

          <b><u> 

          <p> 

          </u></b> 

        <li><font size="2">We fully concur with point 5 of your draft statement 

          that cooperation in countering missile and missile technology proliferation 

          "should be long term and established in phases." </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">In general we believe that we should build a firm foundation 

          for cooperation, first on a bilateral basis and later by involving Big 

          Eight states and other states participating in the MTCR as necessary. 

          </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">We are convinced that steps toward starting negotiations 

          on an international agreement on GMS at a meeting in Moscow at the beginning 

          of this year, as you suggest, will be premature. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">This meeting is not only premature because of the many 

          bilateral issues requiring our analysis, but also because both our sides 

          agreed at the plenary meeting on the MTCR in Noordwijk in October of 

          last year to continue discussion of approaches to the global threat 

          of missile technology proliferation at a special meeting of MTCR partners 

          in Paris in March. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">To be honest, we were disappointed by the fact that 

          Russia has moved away from the understanding on MTCR and invited non-partners 

          to the conference it has proposed. </font> 

          <p> <font size="2"><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></font></p>

        <li><font size="2">The draft Protocol introduces into the ABM Treaty only 

          those amendments that are necessary to deploy phase 1 of the defensive 

          system against ballistic missile attack. </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">If the threat created by ballistic missiles in countries 

          such as North Korea and Iran will grow, as we think it will, it will 

          be necessary to deploy more anti-missile missiles, more radars and another 

          deployment region later. </font> 

          <p>

          systems that will be more effective than those allowed by the Protocol. 

          </font> 

          <p> 

        <li><font size="2">This defensive system will nevertheless be limited

          exercise our right, in accordance with the Protocol, to request further
