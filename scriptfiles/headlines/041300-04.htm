<p>Wednesday starts, like every day, with a high-level strategy

session at 8 a.m., followed by a larger staff meeting at 9. By 10, the

word is out to dozens of team captains crowding the halls at union

headquarters--who's marching where, who's picketing which buildings.

<p>Twenty buses are assigned points to pick up strikers for the

candlelight vigil at Pershing Square. Candles? Check. Matches? Don't

worry, says logistics coordinator Triana Silton. We have enough smokers

to take care of that. A hearty laugh. Then, the signature sign-off: "Se

puede?" Silton calls out. Can we do it? "Si, se puede," they shout back.

And in a flash, the janitors are off.

<p>For 10 days, the chanting, red-shirt-clad strikers have been a nagging

presence, inserting themselves into the consciousness of workaday Los

Angeles as they march across town or cluster outside the gates of office

towers.

<p>The union calls it a rolling strike, building day by day, pulling in

the San Fernando Valley, Pasadena, Long Beach, Ventura and, today, Los

Angeles International Airport. No one knows where it will go next--not

even the organizers.

<p>Decisions are made on the run: The cardinal says he'll celebrate a

Mass, and 1,000 people holding white carnations appear at Arco Plaza the

next morning. Prominent building owners resist union overtures, and

within hours tent camps are sprouting in front of their headquarters,

with volunteers to staff them around the clock.

<p>The organization of the janitors strike is a sight to behold, and

unions across the country are sending representatives to take it in.

Organizers from the Longshoremen's Union in San Francisco, the United

Farm Workers in Delano, Calif., and janitors' locals in Washington,

Fresno and Seattle are among those sitting in on Wednesday morning's

meeting, to learn as well as to lend a hand.

<p>"I've never seen anything like it," says Randy Parraz, an AFL-CIO

field representative from San Francisco. "The members have complete

ownership of this strike."

<p>Although it remains unclear whether the janitors will win anything

close to their demand of a $1-an-hour raise in each of the next three

years, they have achieved two early goals: They have pulled Mayor Richard

Riordan, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony and many state and local lawmakers into

their camp, and they have persuaded at least some prominent building

owners to become informally involved in negotiations.

<p>What made that happen, more than anything else, was the members'

consistent show of strength.

<p>From the unlikeliest of candidates--people who work at night, alone,

isolated in the office towers they clean and the immigrant neighborhoods

they call home--the Service Employees International Union has assembled a

focused and committed army that can turn on a dime.

<p>It didn't happen overnight. SEIU Local 1877 has been working for three

years to identify leaders from the ranks, train them and build their

confidence.

<p>In weekend classes, union officials explained the janitorial industry

and the commercial real estate market, and compared union wages and

strategies in other cities.

<p>When the five-year master contract covering 8,500 Los Angeles janitors

expired March 31, thousands of members were ready to go.

<p>"This didn't just happen," Silton said. "We've been building toward

this for years."

<p>Wednesday morning, the preparation shows. Hallways inside the union

building on 7th Street are lined with organizational charts. From these

charts, one can see at a glance how many protesters picketed Monday in

Santa Monica and when the last meeting was held with members in

Hollywood.

<p>The chart is split into a dozen geographic areas, with each community

assigned to a PEGA--Poderoso Equipo Geografico de Accion, or Powerful

Geographic Action Team. Each PEGA has a leader, who in turn keeps a list

of shop stewards responsible for all workers in their building.

<p>It's 9 a.m., and Silton is still huddled in a meeting with local

President Mike Garcia and a few other key organizers, plotting the day's

strategy. When they appear, dozens of staff members and volunteers file

into a meeting room.

<p>First, reports from the field: All four encampments are still

standing, despite early attempts by police to tear them down. All were

staffed through the night.

<p>Garcia gives an update: A lot is happening behind the scenes. Phone

calls are being made. The mayor is very much with them. "We're very

close," he says. "But it could still go wrong, so we have to continue the

pressure in the streets."

<p>The theme for the day, Silton tells the group in Spanish, is community

support. Each PEGA will stay in its own area and do a small march around

local offices at noon. Then everyone regroups at 5 to be picked up by

buses for the vigil at Pershing Square.

<p>The meeting wraps up at 10, and after a closing chant, the janitors

and staff are on their way.

<p>Cesar Oliva, a janitor for 10 years and now an internal organizer for

the union, hurries to his van.

<p>At the gates of Paramount Studios, he screeches to the curb. There, a

dozen strikers in red shirts cluster in the shade. They'd been at the

site until 11 the night before and returned at 10:30 that morning.

<p>Only about 60% of the janitors at Paramount have joined the strike,

and those who continue to work inside can be clearly seen through the

gates. "Why do we have to put up with this?" asks an agitated Walter

Martinez. "Can't we stop them from going in there? We have to do

something about them."

<p>Oliva warns him. "You have to keep control of yourself. We're winning

this strike. We don't want to lose it on some caprice."

<p>"I'll keep an eye on him," says fellow striker Aurelia Rivera, a

single mother of three who has worked at Paramount for seven years and

earns $6.90 an hour. "Walter, remember what we're fighting for."

<p>Oliva dashes back to his van and races up U.S. 101 to Warner Center,

where about 80 strikers are gathered in the shade of a tree. It's nearly

noon, and the march should be starting. He grabs a bullhorn.

<p>"Listo?" Oliva shouts. Ready? "Si," the 80 strikers shout back. And

the march sets out toward the gleaming office buildings where many have

spent years working the night shift.

<p>"Que queremos?" Oliva shouts through the bullhorn. What do we want?

"Justice," they answer, some pushing strollers, some holding the hands of

their young children. "When?" Oliva asks.

<p>They answer at once, "Now."

<p>At nightfall, 12 hours after the strategy session that started the

day, about 2,000 strikers gather at Pershing Square. They hold candles

aloft, wave placards and chant for their cause.

<p>Members of other unions are here too, in support, as the crowd listens

to speeches.

<p>"I've been a janitor 10 years, and I work through the night sweeping,

mopping, vacuuming, dusting, taking out the trash, cleaning desks," Dora

Posada says. "The small raise we are asking for may not seem like a lot,

but for all of our families, it will make a big difference in our lives."
