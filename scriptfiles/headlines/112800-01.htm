An environmental saga that transfixed the world took an ugly turn 

yesterday when it was revealed that Luna, a 1,000-year-old redwood that was 

home for two years to tree-sitter Julia Butterfly Hill, has suffered a deep 

chain-saw cut that could prove fatal.

<P>  No suspect for the act of vandalism has been identified, but authorities 

say an investigation is continuing.

</P>

<P>  The giant Humboldt County tree was protected under an agreement reached 

with Pacific Lumber Co. last year when Hill ended her protest. The company 

agreed to preserve Luna and a 200-foot buffer zone in exchange for a $50,000 

payment from Hill and her legion of supporters.

</P>

<P>  In a statement issued yesterday by the Circle of Life Foundation, an 

organization Hill helped establish, she condemned the "vicious attack" on Luna.

</P>

<P>  "I feel this . . . as surely as if the chain saw was going through me," she 

said. "Words cannot express the deep sorrow I'm feeling, but I am as committed 

as ever to do everything in my power to protect Luna and the remaining ancient 

forests."

</P>

<P>  Reached by phone yesterday at her grandfather's house in Fairhope, Ala., 

Hill said she was too over whelmed to elaborate. "I just don't really feel 

like talking," said Hill haltingly. "I'm just trying to work through what is 

going on."

</P>

<P>  The gash to the 200-foot-tall redwood was discovered Saturday by one of 

Hill's supporters. Observers at the scene said the cut measured 32 inches deep 

and 19 feet around the base, somewhat less than half the circumference of the 

tree.

</P>

<P>  Fresh sawdust at the scene and the precise placement of the cut indicates 

that the vandalism occurred within the last week by someone adept at sawing 

large trees, authorities said.

</P>

<P>  A timber faller who examined Luna yesterday said no logger in the course of 

his work would climb a tree that had endured such a cut, because the tree 

could fall at any time -- particularly in a high wind.

</P>

<P>  It remains unclear whether anything can be done to save the redwood.

<p><b>INTERNATIONAL MEDIA ATTENTION</b></p>

<P>  Hill climbed Luna in 1997 as a protest to the logging of ancient redwood 

trees by Pacific Lumber, a timber company owned by Texas financier Charles 

Hurwitz. She stayed in the tree for two years, drawing international media 

attention from her treetop perch.

</P>

<P>  By the time Hill descended on Dec. 10, 1999, she had become a global cause 

celebre -- and had essentially forced an agreement with Pacific Lumber that 

permanently protected the tree and a buffer zone.

</P>

<P>  The pact seemed to signal a truce in the North Coast's ferocious timber 

wars. And to a certain degree, at least, that detente was holding yesterday, 

with representatives of Pacific Lumber expressing sorrow and anger at the 

vandalism.

</P>

<P>  "This is absolutely terrible," said Mary Bullwinkel, a Pacific Lumber 

spokeswoman. "We want to see whoever is responsible fully prosecuted. We just 

hope the investigation will find the guilty party."

</P>

<P>  Speaking by cell phone yesterday from Luna's base, Herb Schwartz, an 

attorney for Sanctuary Forest, a nonprofit group that oversees the tree and 

its buffer zone, said he was dispirited by the attack.

<p><b>EVERYONE 'VERY SICKENED'</b></p>

<P>  "I'm normally an optimist," said Schwartz, ''but I have this very sinking 

feeling. It's like when something you don't want to happen happens anyway, and 

you just feel like you're losing control.

</P>

<P>  "It's like you're saying 'My God, how can I stop it?' But you can't stop it.

</P>

<P>I'm up here with representatives from Pacific Lumber and the Humboldt County 

Sheriff's Department, and everyone is very sickened."

</P>

<P>  Schwartz said that he hoped Luna could be saved, but that no answers would 

be forthcoming until professional arborists were consulted.

</P>

<P>  "The cut won't necessarily kill the tree outright," said Schwartz, "but it 

makes it really vulnerable to toppling, particularly in a big windstorm."

</P>

<P>  The ridge that Luna sits on is southwest of the community of Scotia, an 

area that frequently receives heavy winds, particularly during winter storms. 

In a book Hill wrote about her tree-sitting experience, she described almost 

being blown out of Luna's canopy by gale-force gusts.

</P>

<P>  There is no evidence that timber industry workers are responsible for the 

act, authorities emphasized. But lingering local resentment over the Luna 

accord and an earlier pact that protected the nearby Headwaters Forest, a 7,

500-acre grove of ancient redwoods, has engendered suspicion among some 

environmentalists.

<p><b>BIG CHAIN SAWS INDICATED</b></p>

<P>  "It takes big chain saws and containers of gas and oil to do something like 

this, and it isn't easy to get up there," said Sharon Duggan, an attorney who 

helped negotiate the agreement that protected Luna. "Loggers know that.

</P>

<P>  "The question comes down to who did it. I'm not saying Pacific Lumber or 

their agents did it, but there are a lot of questions left to be answered. 

There's a lot of concern that the agreement might have been breached. Pacific 

Lumber controls access to Luna -- their lands surround it."

</P>

<P>  Pacific Lumber doesn't own Luna or the adjacent buffer zone and is 

therefore not directly responsible for the tree, Bullwinkel observed. "Also, 

people trespass our lands constantly," she said. "We can't stop them all."

</P>

<P>  At this point, said Schwartz, a meticulous investigation is essential.

</P>

<P>  "It's complete speculation right now trying to ascertain if the (guilty 

party) was a professional or an amateur," he said. "I couldn't say, and the 

professional logger who is up here with us couldn't say. That's a 

determination we're still trying to make."

<P>
