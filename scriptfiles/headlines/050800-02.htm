WASHINGTON - A growing number of arms control and national security specialists

are concerned that the unilateral deployment of a national missile

defense system would carry political and security costs so great that

they would leave the United States more rather than less vulnerable to

external attack.

<p>Unless accompanied by a concerted global diplomatic offensive and the

successful renegotiation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with

Russia, these experts fear, deployment would seriously damage relations

with Moscow and Beijing and strain ties with America's European allies.

<p>Some arms control specialists contend that recently disclosed details

of the Clinton administration's efforts to renegotiate the ABM Treaty

indicate that, even if Washington reaches agreement with Moscow,

America's security still could be sharply diminished.

<p>Those details, published by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, reveal

that the United States has encouraged Russia to keep its entire strategic

nuclear force of about 3,000 missiles on hair-trigger alert as a way to

reduce Moscow's anxiety about a U.S. missile defense system. The U.S.

system, however, would be designed to counter no more than a small

fraction of Russia's arsenal.

<p>"Deployment will make the country less secure, not more secure," said

Joseph Cirincioni, a respected arms control specialist with the

Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "The

[political and security] costs of deploying a missile defense system

unilaterally are extremely heavy and have to be paid for upfront, while

the possible military benefits require the better part of a decade to

appear. It's like a balloon mortgage. The big payment occurs immediately

when you worsen relationships and existing security arrangements."

<p>For politicians of both parties--eager to demonstrate their

determination to defend America against new threats--it hardly seems to

matter that scientists and arms control specialists remain deeply divided

on the fundamental question of whether such a system might actually work.

<p>Some leading scientists are convinced that the administration's

envisioned first-phase system, which would consist of as many as 100

land-based missile interceptors deployed in Alaska, cannot work.

<p>"The proposed . . . system will not work against the threats it is

designed to face," said Cornell University physicist Kurt Gottfried, who

also heads the Union of Concerned Scientists, an activist group whose

causes include nuclear nonproliferation.

<p>An alternative, Republican-backed concept that would rely on

high-speed interceptors carried aboard naval ships is still years away

from being ready for deployment, many scientists say.

<p>Other specialists, particularly those allied with the Republican

right, express confidence in the viability of missile defense technology.

They insist that the missile threat to America's homeland is real and

consider delayed development nothing short of criminal negligence.

<p>Clinton, Congress at Odds on Deployment

</b>

<p>"The technology is ready," said Baker Spring, a research fellow at the

Washington-based Heritage Foundation, a crucible of conservative

Republican ideas. "If critics are saying we have to have a perfect

defense or otherwise it's not worth doing, then it will never be

deployed. If we're looking for the point where you can say, 'Yes, we can

do it,' well, we've passed that point."

<p>The next test of the administration's preferred system, which would

intercept incoming missiles in mid-flight, is scheduled for late next

month. Two such tests have already been conducted; only one succeeded.

<p>A second success would place added pressure on President Clinton to

approve deployment. He is committed to making a decision sometime in the

fall.

<p>Congressional Republicans, fearing that Clinton might be too

accommodating with the Russians and negotiate ABM treaty changes that

would limit future deployments, have vowed to reject any compromise he

might strike with Moscow during his final months in office. For them, the

choice is clear: Either radically alter the ABM treaty if Moscow agrees

to do so or be prepared to scrap it altogether if Russia balks, and push

forward with as robust a system as America needs.

<p>At a recent lunch with a group of reporters in Washington, Condoleezza

Rice, senior foreign policy advisor to presumptive Republican

presidential nominee George W. Bush, delivered what amounted to a simple

response to the global hand wringing over U.S. intentions: Get over it.

<p>"It's a new world," she said. "The ABM treaty is an artifact of 1972.

It's getting time to think differently about this."

<p>She said that Clinton is responsible for much of the international

resistance to missile defense development because the administration has

failed to consult properly with allies and has confused Russia and China

with inconsistent, sometimes conflicting messages. Rice said that a Bush

administration would undertake a strong diplomatic effort to build

greater understanding for missile defense but made it clear that no

amount of resistance would deter its eventual deployment.

<p>Concerns that a national missile defense system actually could reduce

the nation's overall security are based largely on possible

countermeasures that might be taken by other major powers.

<p>At risk with Russia, those who express these concerns say, is not just

the prospect of thousands of missiles on high alert but also the

continuation of large and successful joint U.S.-Russia programs to

contain nuclear proliferation.

<p><b>

<b>

<p>Pact With Russia Worries U.S. Allies

</b>

<p>One such program pays for efforts to properly store, guard and

eventually destroy Russian stockpiles of weapon-grade nuclear material

left over from the Cold War--enough to build about 40,000 new weapons.

Another program subsidizes jobs for Russian nuclear scientists so they

will not sell their talents to such countries as Iran or Iraq.

<p>Analysts see deployment triggering an equally unsettling set of

problems with China, which is arguably more affected by a limited missile

defense than Russia because it has so few long-range missiles of its own.

They say that Beijing probably would feel compelled to quickly expand its

arsenal of about 20 long-range missiles and possibly upgrade them with

multiple warheads.

<p>They point to the likelihood that Moscow and Beijing would develop

relatively cheap countermeasures, such as decoys, that they could then

sell to the very countries America is most worried about, such as Iraq or

North Korea.

<p>There is also concern among America's allies, already shaken by the

narrow domestic considerations that dominated the U.S. Senate last

October when the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was voted down.

For them, Clinton's missile defense initiative, together with strident

rhetoric from congressional Republicans calling for immediate abrogation

of the ABM treaty, constitute the latest example of what they see as a

tendency to dismiss the interests of loyal friends and the broader global

community without proper consultation.

<p>But the real worry among Europeans is that an America protected by a

missile defense system would effectively be the first step in the gradual

uncoupling of their half-century transatlantic alliance with the United

States.

<p>"If the decision [on deployment] is taken without agreement with

Russia and without help from European leaders, it will be very badly

taken," Javier Solana, the European Union's de facto foreign minister,

told a group of American reporters here last week.

<p>In the 17 years since President Reagan first stunned the country with

his famous "Star Wars" vision, support for deployment of a national

missile defense system has spread from the hard Cold War fringes of the

Republican right to the political mainstream.

<p>In the intervening years, it has become an idea embraced by Democrats

and Republicans alike. Last year, Congress passed legislation declaring

missile defense deployment a national goal. And as the presidential

campaign gathers steam, one of the few national security debates to

emerge so far is not if, but how a protective umbrella can be developed

to shield the United States against a limited nuclear missile attack by a

small, fringe state such as North Korea.
