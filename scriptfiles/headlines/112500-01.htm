THE HAGUE  - A bitter wrangle between the European

Union and the United States over how to curb greenhouse gas

emissions brought a U.N. climate conference to an ignominious end

on Saturday.

<p>``We have not reached agreement,'' conference chairman Jan

Pronk told the final session of the talks in The Hague aimed at

clinching the world's first agreement on concrete steps to curb

the gases blamed for global warming and climate change.

<p>``I am very disappointed. We have not lived up to the

expectations of the outside world,'' said Pronk, who is also Dutch

Environment Minister.

</TABLE></font></font></font></font></font>He asked delegates in the last few hours of the talks to map

out ways of pursuing climate negotiations in coming weeks and

months, saying they could not go away totally empty-handed.

<p>Pronk did not give detailed reasons for the breakdown. But

delegates said a compromise deal hatched by EU member Britain and

Washington had been rejected by the rest of the 15-nation EU, of

which France currently holds the presidency.

<p>British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott earlier stormed

out of the talks saying major players had been unable to make the

compromises required to clinch a deal by a 1600 GMT deadline on

practical steps to stop climate change.

<p>``There isn't a deal. That's unfortunate,'' he told reporters

as he strode out. ``We came so close. We couldn't get an

agreement. I'm gutted (devastated).''

<p><font size=+1><b>Protesters Furious</b></font>

<p>Environmentalists said failure meant victory for polluters

and a disaster for efforts to clean up the planet's atmosphere

and protect poorer nations from devastating storms and floods.

<p>The G77 group of developing countries said the failure

condemned them to more environmental turmoil.

<p>``We will continue to be the victims of the adverse impacts of

climate change,'' said G77 spokesman Sani Daura of Nigeria. He

blamed the breakdown on what he called selfishness and lack of

political will among rich nations.

<p>``You've sunk the world,'' shouted furious protesters gathering

outside the conference after Prescott's departure.

<p>``The world will pay the price in tears,'' said the Friends of

the Earth  group. ``We will not forgive or forget those who wrecked

the talks and put our planet further in danger.''

<p>The conference had tried to agree steps to implement an

accord reached in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 calling for a five

percent average cut in developed nations' 1990 levels of

emissions by 2010.

<p>Scientists say gases like carbon dioxide threaten potentially

disastrous effects on weather, sea levels and the spread of

diseases like malaria and dengue fever.

<p>The dispute between the U.S. and the EU centered on a U.S.

plan to allow developed nations to count carbon dioxide soaked up

by forests, so-called carbon sinks, against emissions reduction

targets set in Kyoto in 1997.

<p><font size=+1><b>U.S. Plan ``Fraudulent''</b></font>

<p>Washington, backed by a so-called umbrella group of

Australia, Canada and Japan, says it cannot reach its target

without such methods. Opponents say the plan is fraudulent

because it would mean only minimal cuts by the world's biggest

polluter, the United States.

<p>Poor nations say the U.S. position violated the ``polluter

pays'' principle, and argue that climate change is the product of

a century of U.S. and European industrialization fuelled by oil

and coal.

<p>However many business leaders and U.S. oil companies fear the

costs of stopping the earth from heating up could have equally

damaging effects on economic growth and jobs.

<p>``This meeting will be remembered as the moment when

governments abandoned the promise of global cooperation to

protect Planet Earth,'' said Greenpeace.

<p>``It's a tragedy that they didn't give it one more push,'' said

Alden Meyer of the U.S. Union of Concerned Scientists.
