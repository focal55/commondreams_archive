<p>MEXICO CITY  - A coalition of

international  education

activists launched its Global Action Plan for Educationö Monday,

in an  effort

to secure the basic right to quality education for millions of the

world's

children. 

<P>

Led by the Brussels-based Education International (EI), a non-

governmental

organisation (NGO) of teachers unions, the coalition seeks to get

every  child

into primary school by 2015 through its initiative. <P>

The coalition, the Global Campaign for Education (GCE), had

scheduled press

conferences Monday in five cities -- Washington D.C., Sao Paulo,

Brussels,

Durban and New Delhi -- to identify those it hoped to win

endorsements from

for

its plan. <P>

Government leaders will top that list, states the GCE. It aspires

to put

pressureö on them to agree on its global plan before it is taken

up at the

forthcoming World Education Forum, to be held in Dakar, Senegal,

from Apr.

26-28. <P>

The urgency of the GCE's efforts stems from what it sees as the

failure o f

the

world's leaders to achieve the promised education for all,ö made

10 years  ago

at the World Conference on Education for All, held in Jomtien,

Thailand. <P>

A dismal catalogue of facts buttresses GCE's argument. Currently,

over 125

million children, two-thirds of them girls, are out of school.

Furthermore,

millions more drop out of school in the early grades, most of them

before

becoming literate. <P>

According to the GCE's estimates, if the current trend continues,

there

will be

57 million primary school age children out of school in 2015 in

Africa.  These

children will account for about three-quarters of all children in

the world

denied the right to education.ö <P>

In addition, studies conducted by the GCE reveal that the quality

of public

education is abysmal across much of the developing world.ö And

the  present

number of illiterate adults reflects this reality  close to 880

million,  more

than what it was in 1990.  <P>

To rectify this situation, the GCE's plan calls for national

education

policies

that guarantee at least eight years of free access to education

for  children,

whether through formal schooling or through equivalent quality

non-formal

programmes within the public system.ö <P>

To achieve success, furthermore, the plan stresses that education

policies

should pay attention to the following priorities:

7 Improved learning conditions, including properly equipped

classrooms, a

supply

of quality textbooks and fair and regular salaries for teachers.

7 Relevant, realistic and regular curricula.

7 Better student readiness, through early childhood development

programmes.

7 Effective measurement of progress, including monitoring of

indicators of

education quality.

7 Long-term financial stability.

7 Equity in education policy and spending, and the removal of

policies

(such as

cost sharing) which pose a barrier to the education of poor

children, girls

and

women.  

<P>

Such an initiative, states the plan, will require governments to

make a

concerted effort to mobilise political and financial resources.  

<P>

According to current estimates, the global cost of meeting the

GCE's target

works out to eight billion dollars a year. And to facilitate such

an

investment, the plan spells out the manner in which the financial

burden

should

be borne. 

<P>

Developing countries, for instance, are expected to mobilise half

of this

amount through increased resource mobilisation and the

redistribution of

wasteful public spending, such as military expenditure.

<P>

That can be achieved, argues the GCE, if governments give a higher

priority  to

education and strive to increase the total amount of resources

invested to  at

least six percent of a country's gross national product (GNP). 

<P>

As Elie Jouen of EI points out, It is time that  governments and

the

international financial institutions recognise education is a

fundamental

human

right and that provision of quality education for children, young

people and

adults is a core responsibility of the state. 

<P>

The international community, states the plan, will have to

mobilise funds to

meet the remaining half of this global education budget, for which

three  areas

have been identified. <P>

In the GCE's view, increased development assistance will have to

be the  major

contributor, by allocating at least eight percent of aid budgets

to basic

education, which will be a four-fold increase from the current

amount,

estimated at two percent of aid budgets. Through such a measure,

the GCE

expects to raise around three billion dollars of the annual

amount.  

<P>

The plan also intends using the current debt relief initiatives to

Heavily

Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) to its advantage. What it proposes

is for a

significant slice of debt relief flows to be directed towards

basic  education.

Further, it also recommends that debt swap arrangements could be

developed to

finance education initiatives in middle-income countries. 

<P>

Private capital, according to the plan, will serve as the final

resource.

Here,

the GCE has funding from NGOs, foundations and other private

sources in  mind. 

<P>

Given the dire conditions in Africa, the plan makes a special

appeal for the

continent, under its section, A Compact for Africa.

<P>

Sub-Saharan Africa faces particularly severe challenges in

education,ö  the

plan declared. It is now the only part of the developing world in

which  the

number of children out of school is increasing.

<P>

Failure to take cognisance of such needs, admits the GCE, will

only further

delay the provision of the right to education that has already

been denied  to

so many children. Without a concerted international effort, basic

education

for all will continue to elude us beyond 2015, with grave

consequences for  the

world's poorest and most vulnerable people.
