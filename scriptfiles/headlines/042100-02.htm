Dorothy Abbott was listening to public radio in Memphis yesterday when she heard that a woman roaring around Neah Bay on a Jet Ski had been rammed by a Coast Guard boat protecting Makah whale hunters.

"I thought, `Oh, that must be Erin,' " Abbott, 55, said of her daughter. "She is one passionate and committed person."

<P>

     And Erin Abbott it was.

<P>

     The 24-year-old animal-rights activist had to be airlifted to Olympic Medical Center in Port Angeles yesterday after she was injured by the Coast Guard boat, which was trying to push her out of a federally mandated 500-yard exclusion zone around the whaling canoe.

<P>

     Since 1998, when the Makahs decided to revive their tribe's tradition of hunting gray whales, the Coast Guard has been charged with enforcing the federal government's decision that such a hunt is legitimate.

<P>

      That task has put the Coast Guard in the position of defending whaling protesters and Makah whalers from each other, and from themselves.

<P>

     "I just want to be a voice for the animals," said Erin Abbott, 24, from her hospital room yesterday, sedated by painkillers and under police guard.

<P>

     "They ran over me. I wasn't expecting to get run over by a boat. I expected to try and protect a whale that's trying to migrate to its summer resting spot."

<P>

     Abbott reported suffering a broken shoulder and some fractured ribs, and said she was being kept overnight in the hospital because of fears that her lungs might collapse.

<P>

     The Coast Guard arrested Abbott, who could be charged in federal court for violating the exclusionary zone. She could face a fine and six years in jail. 

<P>

     A native of Tampa, Fla., Abbott has lived in Seattle for about a year and is a member of the animal-rights group Ocean Defense International.

<P>

     "Nothing gives us the right to take their lives just because they can't communicate in words like you and I do," Abbott said. "Whales are defenseless creatures. They bleed just like you and I do."

<P>



<P>

     Abbott's mother Dorothy, a former civil-rights activist and writer,  said she was proud of her daughter.  

<P>

     Erin Abbott graduated from the University of South Florida with a major in childhood education. She protested at the World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle. 

<P>

     And she believes it is unnatural for humans to kill animals.

<P>

      "It's natural for, say, a cheetah to kill a gazelle. But humans can survive just fine without any animal resources. We can go to a grocery store whereas a cheetah can't," Erin Abbott said.

<P>

     Staring down death while fighting for the rights of others seems to run in the Abbott family.

<P>

     Dorothy Abbott recalls a frightening incident back in her days as an employee of the juvenile-court system in Jackson, Miss.

<P>

     It was 1964. She said she had a report about a child being abused. She went to a house to investigate and was greeted with a gun. She retreated but said she eventually got the child out of the abusive household.

<P>

     And she's glad her daughter has proved just as daring.<P align="center">© 2000 Seattle Times.
