The Pentagon has classified as secret an antimissile critic's letter to 

the White House, and the censored 

expert is crying foul.



<p>      The critic, Theodore A. Postol, professor of science and national security studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, first wrote the 

White House on May 11 to report 

what he described as a major flaw in 

the Pentagon's antimissile plan and 

efforts to cover it up.



<p>      Yesterday, Dr. Postol wrote the 

White House again, this time to say 

that the Pentagon had classified his 

letter secret  and to condemn what he 

said was probably a bid to curb the 

high-stakes dispute. The antimissile 

system under consideration is estimated to cost as much as $60 billion. 



<p>      In his latest letter, Dr. Postol said 

the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, which ordered 

the imposition of secrecy, "is most 

likely attempting to illegally use the 

security and classification system to 

hide waste, fraud, and abuse."



<p>      If secrets were inadvertantly released in his earlier letter, he added, 

it was because his analysis was 

based on Pentagon documents that 

the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization had improperly declassified.



<p>      In his letter, which he made available to The New York Times, Dr. 

Postol asked John D. Podesta, the 

White House chief of staff, to alert 

his colleagues of the "claimed status" of the May 11 letter and to 

"refer this matter to the Department 

of Defense inspector general for immediate investigation."



<p>      Yesterday, the White House referred requests for comment to the 

Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.



<p>      Lt. Col. Richard Lehner of the Air 

Force, a spokesman for the organization, said that no one was accusing 

Dr. Postol of releasing secrets but 

that the antimissile office was taking 

steps to classify the letter and its 

appended reports.



<p>      Colonel Lehner said that one of the 

reports Dr. Postol had sent to the 

White House apparently contained 

three or four charts of secret data 

that declassification officers had 

failed to delete.



<p>      "If even one word is classified, 

then the whole thing is classified 

until the secret part is removed," the 

colonel said, describing  the usual 

federal policy concerning secret documents.



<p>      Still, the Pentagon's move to classify is unlikely to have much practical effect because the letter  has circulated widely throughout the administration, Congress and the 

world, with hundreds, if not thousands, of electronic copies speeding 

across the Internet.



<p>  It even appears on the Web site of 

the Institute of Physics and Technology in Moscow.



<p>      Dr. Postol's May 11 letter was 

three pages long and had four reports attached to it that were meant 

to back up his technical claims. 



<p>      His criticism of the proposed antimissile system centers on the most 

technically difficult part of the system's goal -- enabling a speeding 

interceptor to distinguish incoming 

weapons from clouds of decoys.



<p>  Dr. Postol contended that a pivotal 

flight test in June 1997 showed that 

the objective  was impossible to 

achieve, and that the Pentagon then 

conspired to hide this surprising discovery.



<p>      His accusations are based partly 

on antimissile criticism by Nira 

Schwartz, a former senior engineer 

at the TRW Corporation, a top military contractor.



<p>  In a lawsuit against the company, 

Dr. Schwartz said that TRW had 

faked results of antimissile tests and 

evaluations of computer programs 

for the interceptor's sensor and fired 

her when she protested. The company has denied her accusations.



<p>      Through her litigation with TRW 

as well as an inquiry by the Pentagon's Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Dr. Schwartz obtained 

many antimissile reports and data, 

some of which she shared with Dr. 

Postol. 



<p>      Such documents and data from 

them presumably lie at the heart of 

any Pentagon concerns about leaked 

secrets.
