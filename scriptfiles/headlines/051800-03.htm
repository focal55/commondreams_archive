LONDON  - France called Thursday for the

destruction of rapeseed crops contaminated by genetically

modified material as environmentalist fury swept across Europe

over how farmers had been sold ``Frankenstein seed.''

<p>The controversy erupted when the Advanta company, which

imported the seed from Canada, disclosed that farmers in

Britain, France, Germany and Sweden were unwittingly growing

oilseed rape contaminated with genetically modified (GM)

material.<p>Environmental pressure groups warned the contamination could

spread to other crops through wind-blown pollination and said

there was a risk to public health. They demanded compensation

for farmers.<p>France's Environment Minister Dominique Voynet called for

the destruction of about 1,500 acres of rapeseed grown from

seeds contaminated by GM material and demanded an inquiry into

how GM seeds had been mixed with normal ones.<p>``Dominique Voynet calls for ... the identification of plots

where these seeds were planted in order to destroy the rapeseed

in question, accompanied of course by compensation for the

affected farmers,'' the Environment Ministry said in a

statement.<p><font size=+1><b>Italian Fraud Probe</b></font><p>Italian Farm Minister Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio said he was

ordering anti-fraud checks.<p>``I have asked the anti-fraud inspectorate to verify whether

transgenic seeds have been sold to (Italian) farmers without

their knowledge,'' Pecoraro Scanio told Reuters.<p>British officials, conscious of growing public opposition to

GM foods, rushed to minimize the problem and offer health

assurances.<p>``We believe there is no threat to the environment because

the GM variety is sterile and it is difficult to see how it

could cross-pollinate with other plants,'' Agriculture Minister

Nick Browne told parliament.<p>In Stockholm, the Agriculture Department said 14 tons of

seeds imported into Sweden in 1999 from Canada contained 0.4

percent of genetically modified rapeseed.<p>Germany said it would not destroy up to 740 acres of

rapeseed being grown from seeds contaminated by GM material.<p>``Our experts say there are no rules that would compel us by

law to destroy it,'' an Agriculture Ministry spokeswoman told

Reuters.<p>Advanta spokesman David Buckeridge said the areas sown with

GM-contaminated seed were small and that there was no risk to

health. He also said that no laws had been broken.<p><font size=+1><b>Environmentalists Unconvinced</b></font><p>Environmentalists were not convinced.<p>``These trials have now gone beyond farce,'' said Peter

Riley, of Friends of the Earth, a leading environmental group.<p>``The only sensible course of action must be for the

government to order the abandonment of these trials before any

more GM pollution is released into the environment.''<p>A clutch of farm-scale government-backed trials of GM crops

are currently operating across Britain. Green activists have

been arrested after trashing the crops in well-publicized

demonstrations.<p>Organic farmers fear their crops will be tainted by GM

material even it is grown some distance from their own farms.<p>Used in foods ranging from chocolate to ice cream, the rape

could be sold to consumers as a GM-free product, despite strict

rules on food labeling and uncertainty about possible hazards

associated with the technology.<p>The Soil Association, the organic farmers' mouthpiece,

demanded action by the British government.<p>``We believe it's the government's responsibility to track

down the 600 farms involved and destroy the crop,'' the group's

director Patrick Holden told Reuters.<p>Environmental group Greenpeace called on the British

government to recall and destroy GM oilseed rape mistakenly

planted in Britain and said Advanta should compensate farmers.<p>``This fiasco will affect farmers, animal feed mills and

honey producers who are faced with a contaminated product that

is both illegal and potentially unsafe,'' the group said.<p>Advanta Seeds UK, part of a 50-50 venture between

Anglo-Swedish group AstraZeneca Plc and the Dutch cooperative

Cosun that imported the seeds to Europe, said it told the

British government about them last month.<p>British farmers sowed about 22,240 acres with the affected

stocks last year, and about 11,610 acres in spring 2000.
