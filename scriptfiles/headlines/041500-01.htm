WASHINGTON<wbr>--<wbr>At the "Welcome Center" of the new crusade for global justice, a

cheerful young woman named Cleo is helping process fresh troops. "Do you

plan on being arrested?" she asks.

<p>After they say yes--and most say yes--she provides cards with lawyers'

phone numbers. The protesters are also handed a schedule of seminars on

popular topics such as sweatshops, bicycle repair, dance, anti-oppression

training and magical activism (taught by Star Hawk, a witch based in

Mendocino, Calif.).

<p>Another topic is on many people's minds as well: a potential

confrontation with police Sunday, when the anti-globalization protesters

attempt to shut down the spring meetings of the World Bank and

International Monetary Fund, which they accuse of neglecting the poor and

harming the environment.

<p>"I expect harsh measures," says Cleo, 18. Declining to give a last

name, she describes herself as a music student from Oklahoma.

<p>It was a novel blend of grass-roots disorder and New Age discipline

that bewildered police during last December's global trade summit in

Seattle. Now the Metropolitan Police of Washington faces the same

challenging combination as a similar coalition of anti-globalization

activists swarms into the capital.

<p>At first glance, the crowd at the Welcome Center seems a throwback to

a 1960s-style countercultural gathering, with its casual dress, vigorous

democratic ethic and ardent belief in a more perfect world.

<p>But on closer inspection, its members represent a very different

movement, one that is notable for taking to the streets with clever

organizational techniques. Beyond that, they are more media savvy than

their 1960s counterparts, as shown Friday when animal rights activists

dumped a truckload of horse manure near the headquarters of the World

Bank, creating a carefully framed image for the cameras.

<p>"You had the manure and truck in the foreground, and World Bank Group

[sign] in the background," explained Bruce Freidrich, vegetarian campaign

coordinator for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

<p>Indeed, the world of globalization protest in the 21st century is a

world of its own. There are "elves" who watch out for personal needs

(such as water for the thirsty), "vibe monitors" who guard against

internal conflicts and "jail solidarity persons" who are responsible for

keeping Social Security numbers and other personal information about

those who end up in the slammer. Decisions are hashed out by the

"spokes-council," an allusion to spokes on a wheel.

<p>Demonstrators scheduled to take the spotlight Sunday include the

"radical cheerleaders," who gained much attention in Seattle for

dispensing with blouses.

<p>There will be puppets, including a giant "structural adjustment

machine" that is a slam on the IMF's demands for "structural adjustment"

(that is, stingy budgets) in the countries that receive its loans.

<p>But the anti-globalization crusade represents something new beyond its

choice of protest paraphernalia. Grizzled veterans of earlier protest

movements are struck by the new crusaders' resourcefulness at organizing

large numbers of nonconformist personalities and drawing attention to

their cause from the establishment media.

<p>"It's a totally different level of sophistication," said Kevin

Danaher, 49, a Vietnam-era draft resister who is one of the organizers in

the anti-globalization crusade. "When you see these young people run

these meetings, I'm awe-struck."

<p>At the same time, acknowledges Danaher, who helped launch a democracy

project in San Francisco known as Global Exchange, the movement's

insistence on democratic decision-making can make "command and control" a

problem.

<p>Star Hawk, the Northern California witch, offered training seminars on

the uses of magic at the "convergence site," which is at the Welcome

Center. Although Star Hawk was not immediately available for an

interview, fans praised her talent at using ancient pagan rituals, such

as the spiral dance, to impart to the disparate group a feeling of unity,

"the sense that we are all part of each other," according to Ilyse Hogue,

one of the protesters.

<p>Hogue, of San Francisco, recalled that she and Star Hawk were arrested

at the World Trade Organization melee in Seattle and landed in the same

cell. The witch, Hogue said, buoyed everyone's spirits in jail by

"recognizing that the Earth has its own energy" and tapping into it to

build human solidarity.

<p>The single biggest event on the protest schedule is a legal rally set

for Sunday on the Ellipse, between the White House and the Washington

Monument, and thousands are expected to join. Far less predictable is the

unscheduled "direct action" that some demonstrators are planning for

Sunday and Monday.

<p>"We're asking that everybody who plans to be a part of the direct

action take the nonviolent direct-action training and the legal

training," noted Garrick Ruiz, 23, a UCLA graduate from Alhambra in

Washington for the protests.

<p>While the crusade represents something new in the landscape of social

protest, the movement is perfectly willing to borrow from the past, often

to powerful effect.

<p>Take the notion of "affinity groups"--five to 15 people who form

individual cells within larger protests. In protest parlance, affinity

groups may work together in "clusters."

<p>The key protest Web site, <a href="http://www.a16.org">http://www.a16.org</a>, suggests that affinity

groups make help available before a protest ("Know where people who are

arrested are likely to be taken"), during a protest ("Bring a first-aid

kit") and after a protest ("Take care of kids, pets, cars, plants etc.

for those in jail").

<p>Activists this week have been frustrated by police work, including

surveillance, that is more aggressive than they experienced in Seattle.

At the convergence site this week, a police helicopter circled watchfully

overhead. A police intelligence unit confiscated 256 4-foot-long pipes

that demonstrators had hoped to use in forming unbreakable human chains.

<p>But if the anti-globalization crusaders were feeling the heat, they

professed confidence in their imminent bid to highlight their concerns

with the World Bank and IMF.

<p>"We're not going to be stopped," said Laura Jones, a spokeswoman with

the Mobilization for Global Justice. "Petty intimidation" tactics are

frustrating, she said. "But it's not going to make a difference in what

we're doing."
