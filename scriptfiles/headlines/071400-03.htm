SAGINAW, MICHIGAN -  The gymnasium was stifling, the questions



even hotter as Al Gore went looking for good campaign-commercial



footage and found, instead, the specter of Green Party candidate



Ralph Nader.



<p>	   At a town-hall meeting in this battleground state, some 200



skeptically undecided voters also forced the vice president to



defend his advocacy of the death penalty, his push for free trade



with China, even his wife's decades-old drive for parental warning



labels on music with obscene lyrics.

</TABLE></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>"Y'all are certainly asking easy questions this evening,'' he



joked halfway through the nearly three-hour forum. A film crew had



outfitted the un-air-conditioned school gymnasium with studio



lights to collect fodder for future campaign or Democratic National



Committee TV commercials.



<p>	   There was praise for the Democratic presidential candidate,



sure, but some voter comment was far from flattering.



<p>	   One woman sternly admonished: "It has felt to me like the



Clinton-Gore administration gave an awful lot of ground back to the



right and I would like to know why I should vote for you and not



Ralph Nader. And don't tell me, 'Because I'll split the vote.



That's not an answer.''



<p>	   The question — plus another woman's counsel, "You ought to be



acknowledging more that there are more than two candidates in this



race.'' — come at a time when polls suggest that Nader is a growing



threat to Gore's support from the left, including in Michigan.



<p>	   Gil Couillard, a special education teacher and union member,



said he could never vote for Bush but was flirting with a vote for



Nader. He said he was impressed with Gore as "very genuine,'' but



didn't want to hear any evidence that Gore improperly handled his



1996 fund raising or he would vote for Nader.



<p>	   "If I ever found out that (Gore) was in somebody's pocket that



would be it,'' he said.



<p>	   While the Gore camp has recently made quiet entreaties to top



Nader backers, Gore avoided speaking his rival's name in answering



questions Thursday.



<p>	   "The economic success that has come with the Clinton-Gore



policies has helped working families far better than slogans, far



more than rhetoric,'' Gore said.



<p>	   In this working-class city 96 miles north of Detroit, where the



national prosperity has not spread so thickly, several voters poked



holes in Gore's proud record of economic success and complained of



high taxes.



<p>	   "We've had more jobs, but they're not as good jobs,'' one woman



said.



<p>	   An autoworker complained that Gore's support for free trade with



China threatened to rob him of his job. Gore said he thought



America and the autoworker were better off if the nation was open



to free trade.



<p>	   He defended his opposition to eliminating taxes on capital



gains, saying that 90 percent of that kind of tax relief benefits



only the small slice of America's wealthiest taxpayers.



<p>	   Questioned about "censorship'' and wife Tipper's 1980s crusade



to warn parents against obscene or violent rock lyrics, Gore



defended her, too — and said the record warning labels now



routinely used only assist good parenting.



<p>	   "I understand the arguments of people who say that can have a



chilling effect on the creative community. But I don't think it's



fair for them to insist upon on open spigot to deprive parents of



the chance to do that,'' Gore said.



<p>	   A retired black minister, who voiced confidence Gore would win



the White House, nonetheless chastised him for supporting the death



penalty and insisted upon hearing Gore's plan for making sure that



convicts on death row "get every access to prove they are innocent



before they are killed.''



<p>	   Gore repeated a position he's had to air several times since the



accuracy of death-penalty convictions and the efficient rate of



executions in Texas under Bush's governorship have been called into



question.



<p>	   Gore said he supports legislation requiring the use of DNA



evidence, when available, in capital cases, and also a moratorium



on executions in states that find a high error rate in convictions.



Illinois, where the governor has already imposed a moratorium, is



the only example Gore gave.



<p>	   Finally, before calling it a night and returning to Washington,



Gore was asked to defend his very style.



<p>	   One woman who indicated she likes Gore's politics said he's been



so low-profile as vice president that she's had to question whether



he is "strong enough to compete.''



<p>	   "Where have you been for the past eight years?'' the woman



asked, as Gore chuckled.



<p>	   He replied that the vice presidency is a "mixed blessing'' that



had forced him to take a back seat in order "to help him be the



best president he can possibly be.''



<p>	   "Is it like the woman behind the man?'' he said. "Well, you



know, actually, I've learned a lot about some of those issues.''
