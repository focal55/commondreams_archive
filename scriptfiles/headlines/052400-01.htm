WASHINGTON, May 23 -- The 

Clinton administration has quietly 

resumed military cooperation with 

Indonesia, senior defense officials 

said today, eight months after cutting off those ties following massacres in East Timor.



<p> The United States broke the freeze 

this month by inviting Indonesian 

military observers to joint exercises 

in Thailand and by completing plans 

this week to hold the first joint exercises between American and Indonesian armed forces in July.



<p> These exercises are a prelude to a 

much larger military-to-military 

program the administration will 

present Congress this month to reward the new, democratically elected Indonesian government for removing some of the senior military 

officers under investigation for the 

East Timor massacres and for imposing civilian control of the military, according to senior administration officials.



<p> Since taking office seven months 

ago, President Abdurrahman Wahid 

has named a civilian minister of defense and removed General Wiranto, 

the powerful chief of the armed 

forces, who is under investigation for 

allowing several army units to orchestrate last year's rampage in 

East Timor, which left hundreds 

dead after the province voted for 

independence from Indonesia.



<p> But some members of Congress 

and human rights groups are critical 

of resuming any relations with the 

military until the current investigations into the massacres and other 

human rights abuses in East Timor 

lead to trials of senior officers.



<p> Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, will propose 

legislation as early as this week to 

prolong the freeze on military relations until the officers are all put on 

trial.



<p> And a group of 29 human rights 

organizations has petitioned Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright 

to prevent any "resumption of military engagement at any level."



<p> "I really do think it is premature 

for the Pentagon to be resuming cooperation when there has been a lack 

of accountability for the senior officers," said Michael Jendrzejczyk of 

Human Rights Watch, which signed 

the letter to Dr. Albright. 



<p> President Clinton suspended all 

military ties with Indonesia in September when General Wiranto failed 

to reign in the local militia as it 

rampaged through East Timor. And 

in its report issued earlier this year, 

the United Nations said its investigation uncovered evidence that special 

forces of the Indonesian army did 

"support the militias in intimidation 

and terror attacks" in East Timor.



<p> To avoid working with those units, 

the Pentagon is renewing its ties first 

with the Indonesia's air force and 

navy. The joint exercises this summer will be held with Indonesian 

marines and will concentrate on humanitarian assistance and disaster 

relief, according to a senior defense 

official.



<p> "What better way than to take 

some first steps towards re-engagement with humanitarian exercises 

and with the  services that don't have 

a cloud over them," said a senior 

official who asked for anonymity.



<p>  After consultations with Congress, 

the administration hopes to begin 

what Dr. Albright described in a letter to the human rights groups as a 

"carefully calibrated" program to 

renew ties with the two militaries.



<p>     "Given where Indonesia was a 

year ago, this government has made 

tremendous progress in asserting civilian control over the military," 

said Adam Schwarz, the author of "A 

Nation in Waiting: Indonesia's 

Search for Stability," (Westview 

Press, 1994).
