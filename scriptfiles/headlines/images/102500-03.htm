Two media watchdog groups have called for protests today at 9 a.m.

at North Hollywood's KPFK-FM (90.7), as well as four other Pacifica

Foundation-owned, listener-supported radio stations nationwide, in

response to what they're calling censorship and intimidation of the

network's highest-profile journalist.

<p>Amy Goodman, award-winning host of "Democracy Now!," said her bosses

are trying to "rein in and exert political control over" her show as part

of the Pacifica board's attempt to steer the network from its progressive

political origins toward the mainstream.

<p>Goodman said last week that management gave her a set of "ground

rules" that she must immediately follow or face "disciplinary actions up

to and including termination," according to a memo released by Fairness

and Accuracy in Reporting, one of the groups organizing today's protests.

Goodman filed a grievance with her union, the American Federation of

Television and Radio Artists, citing gender harassment and censorship.

For now, her hourlong show remains on the air, playing weekdays at 6 a.m.

and repeating at 9 a.m. Co-host Juan Gonzalez, a New York Daily News

columnist, is not involved in the current conflict.

<p>Reacting to Goodman's charges, Stephen Yasko, Pacifica's national

program director, stated, " 'Democracy Now!' is a show we fully support,

and there's certainly no censorship. If people really sat down and

listened to it, there's nothing missing that was there before."

<p>Pacifica officials said that by requiring the high-profile host to get

their approval before speaking to outside groups, and informing them of

show topics a week ahead of time, they're merely trying improve

operations and protect the network's interests.

<p>"For a lot of people, Amy is Pacifica," Yasko said. "Amy is an

ambassador. There is a responsibility to let us know who you're speaking

with, to let us know what's going on. We certainly want to support Amy

and 'Democracy Now!' in every way possible."

<p>Goodman, however, said the "ground rules" are a continuation of

management harassment, which included punishment for having Green Party

presidential candidate Ralph Nader give commentary and analysis from the

floor of the Republican National Convention. Afterward, Pacifica denied

"Democracy Now!" press credentials for the Democratic Convention.

<p>Yasko called Goodman's move "a stunt" and said Pacifica officials were

dismayed that she gave a valuable press credential to Nader, an

opposition candidate who was there to advance his own campaign. However

according to one person associated with the show, Nader was never given a

press credential. And the network still makes "Ralph Nader Crashes the

Party" available on its Web site at <a href="http://www.pacifica.org">http://www.pacifica.org</a>. In fact,

some suggest that this latest conflict puts the future of "Democracy

Now!" in question.

<p>Billing itself as "the exception to the rulers," the show first aired

in February 1996. Two years ago Goodman and correspondent Jeremy Scahill

won the George Polk Award for their piece, "Drilling and Killing: Chevron

and Nigeria's Military Dictatorship"--one of several awards given the

program for reports such as "Massacre: The Story of East Timor" and

coverage of other topics, including the cases of imprisoned journalist

and convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal and Lori Berenson, an American

imprisoned in Peru.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Goodman declined to comment when reached last week at her office at

station WBAI-FM (99.5) in New York. FAIR posted a copy of Goodman's memo

responding to her bosses on its Web site Thursday, insisting she hadn't

provided it. At this point, there is no indication from either side how

quickly Goodman's grievances will be resolved.

<p>The conflict at "Democracy Now!" is the latest in the dispute

involving Pacifica's listeners, staffers and managers. Last year,

Pacifica centralized control of the network with its national board,

which critics said robbed the local stations of their input and violated

the spirit of community-sponsored radio. Hundreds protested Pacifica's

flagship, KPFA-FM (94.1) in Berkeley. Dozens were arrested, and the

foundation posted security guards outside the studio. Popular

commentators were fired for discussing the conflict on their shows, and

one was even detained while on the air.

<p>After a 17-day lockout last summer, during which Pacifica aired

archived shows, the foundation reopened KPFA and allowed staffers to

return. Those who have followed the station's long history of airing

controversial points of view contend the network is shifting from a more

leftist base to make itself more palatable to corporate sponsors. And

some maintain the foundation is even considering selling its valuable

frequencies in New York and Berkeley.

<p>Pacifica officials have denied the charges.

<p>"Pacifica has been a treasure for the progressive community," said

Rachel Coen, communications coordinator at FAIR, which, along with the

nonprofit Media Alliance of San Francisco, is sponsoring protests at

KPFK, KPFA, WBAI and the network's stations in Houston and Washington,

D.C. "It's been very, very painful to see the management of Pacifica

stray from the original vision. I think 'Democracy Now!' really

crystallizes the conflict for a lot of people.

<p>"We wouldn't have taken action in this public and dramatic way if we

didn't think Amy was in danger of losing her job and the public wasn't in

danger of losing 'Democracy Now!' " she added. "This is part of a

last-ditch effort to save Pacifica."

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to the memo Goodman sent her bosses, her show "is being

subjected to a withering assault by Pacifica management. The motivation

is blatantly political. 'Democracy Now!' is a hard-hitting grass-roots

program that is not afraid of tackling controversial issues day after day

in the Pacifica tradition. We are not only being censored for our

critical coverage of the Democrats as well as the Republicans, but for

giving voice to a growing grass-roots movement that fundamentally

challenges the status quo--people fighting sweatshops, police brutality,

prison growth, and corporate globalization."

<p>Goodman said that she was ordered to give Yasko a rundown of the

following week's shows every Friday and that she had to get approval

before speaking to outside groups, which she called "an outrageous

intrusion into my personal life and an illegal attempt to control my

right of free speech."

<p>"I never asked to approve her topics, goodness no," Yasko said of the

first requirement. "We trust Amy and the 'Democracy Now!' staff with the

editorial guidance of the program."

<p>He said the advance notice regarding program topics is for logistical

reasons, such as booking time for a guest at a sister station with a high

audio-quality phone line, rather than having the guest talk from a

static-filled home phone at the last minute. He added that Goodman would

be free to change topics to accommodate breaking news.

<p>"There's no attempt to make Pacifica more mainstream," Yasko said.

"There's an attempt to make Pacifica sound better to the listener. That's

what we're working on."

<p>While some listeners fear the current wrangling imperils Pacifica's

alternative voice, turmoil has long been part of the network's history.

Journalist and World War II conscientious objector Lewis Hill founded

Pacifica and KPFA in 1949 as the country's first community-supported

radio. Four years later, the foundation board and Hill tried to fire each

other.
