UNITED NATIONS  - The 189-member General Assembly,

the highest

policy making body at the United Nations, will hold an emergency

special

session Wednesday to discuss the continuing violence in the West

Bank and

Gaza. 

<P>

The move for a special session has been prompted primarily by US

threats to

block all attempts to take the issue - for a second time in less

than two

weeks

- to the 15-member Security Council. 

<P>

The United States abstained on a resolution adopted by the

Security Council on

Oct. 7 that stressed the importance of establishing a mechanism

''for a speedy

and objective inquiry'' into the violence which has claimed the

lives of over

100 Palestinians over a three-week period. 

<P>

US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said last week that in the

unlikely event that

the Security Council agrees to debate the issue a second time,

Washington will

veto any resolution on the subject. 

<P>

''We have made this abundantly clear to our friends and colleagues

in the

Security Council,'' he warned. 

<P>

The discussion on Israeli-occupied territories - which originated

with the

10th

emergency Special Session of the General Assembly in 1997 - has

continued

through February 1999. Since the sessions have never been

adjourned - to

ensure

that the issue remains on the agenda - they have been resumed on

four

different

occasions.  

<P>

On Wednesday, the emergency Special Session will be resumed for

the fifth time

to discuss once again ''the illegal Israeli actions in Occupied

East Jerusalem

and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory''. 

<P>

A resolution drafted by the Permanent Observer Mission of

Palestine to the

United Nations - and backed by the 114-member Non-Aligned Movement

(NAM) - is

expected to be adopted by an overwhelming majority of member

states, probably

before Friday. 

<P>

The speculation is that the only opposition to the draft

resolution may come

from the United States and Israel. On Tuesday, Holbrooke was

quoted as saying

that the General Assembly was an ineffective body and its

decisions would not

have a bearing on the crisis.  

<P>

But a UN spokesman told IPS that it was surprising that Holbrooke

should have

made those comments particularly at a time when he is pleading

with the same

Assembly to approve a reduction in US assessments for the UN's

regular and

peacekeeping budgets. 

<P>

The draft resolution condemns the ''acts of violence and the

excessive use of

force by the Israeli occupying forces against Palestinian

civilians resulting

in injury and loss of human life''. 

<P>

The Assembly will also demand the immediate cessation of violence

arguing that

Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, including

Jerusalem, ''are

illegal and an obstacle to peace''. 

<P>

The resolution also ''strongly supports the establishment of a

mechanism of

inquiry'' to probe the violence. 

<P>

On Tuesday, at a summit meeting in the Egyptian Red Sea port of

Sharm

el-Sheikh, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian

leader Yasser

Arafat agreed to a cease-fire and the appointment of a commission

to

investigate the violence. But the United States, not the United

Nations, will

play a key role in setting up this proposed commission.  

<P>

Among the participants in the summit were US President Bill

Clinton and

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. 

<P>

Meanwhile, the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) released

Tuesday the

results of a week-long investigation that condemns Israeli police

and security

forces for ''a pattern of using excessive, lethal force in clashes

with

demonstrators over the past two weeks''. 

<P>

In a report released here, HRW called on both the Palestinian and

Israeli

authorities to take urgent steps to stop their own civilians from

using lethal

force against other civilians - an increasingly serious problem. 

<P>

''Civilians should not be dying in this conflict,'' Hanny Megally

of HRW said

Tuesday. ''The Israelis should use lethal force only when it is

strictly

unavoidable to protect lives, and both sides need to rein in

anyone attacking

or endangering civilians.'' 

<P>

Megally said the results of HRW's investigations showed a

compelling need

for a

credible and independent investigation into serious human rights

violations in

these clashes. 

<P>

He said that under the Fourth Geneva Convention, which governs

military

occupations, Palestinians in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and

East Jerusalem,

are internationally protected persons, and signatory states have

an obligation

to respect and ensure respect for rights and guarantees of the

Convention.
