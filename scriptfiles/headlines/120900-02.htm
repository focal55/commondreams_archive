SACRAMENTO, Calif.  - Hoping to ease the state's electricity

crisis, air-quality regulators Friday allowed the restart of

several power plants in southern California that had been shut down

because they had reached air pollution limits.

<p>Later Friday, federal energy regulators lifted price caps on

wholesale California electricity following an emergency request

from the managers of the strapped power grid.

<p>The operators said lifting the caps would give California

greater access to electricity supplies at a time when the power

grid is stressed to capacity.

<p>Gov. Gray Davis suggested the decision would spark new rounds of

price increases and demanded a congressional investigation.

<p>The ruling was ``an outrageous assault on the consumers and

businesses of California by a federal agency answerable to no

one,'' Davis said.

<p>The Folsom-based California Independent System Operator, which

manages the state's power grid, said lifting the price caps was

justified because it has ``become increasingly difficult to manage

these (power) negotiations while at the same time balancing supply

and demand.''

<p>The moves came a day after California encountered an

unprecedented power crunch, with electricity supplies for the

state's 34 million people so perilously low that California only

narrowly avoided blackouts.

<p>The power crunch has been blamed on cold weather in the

Northwest, the shutdown of some generating plants for repairs or

other reasons and the effects of utility deregulation in

California.

<p>On Thursday, during the emergency, power plants capable of

producing 2,400 megawatts were off-line because they had exceeded

their pollution limits. One megawatt is sufficient to power about

1,000 homes.

<p>On Friday, the South Coast Air Quality Management District

agreed to let some of those polluting power plants return to

operation and restore about half of that lost generating capacity.

However, those plants will have to pay daily fines.

<p>``This is an attempt to balance the obvious and immediate need

for power generation with protecting the environment and public

health here in the South Coast Basin,'' said district spokesman Sam

Atwood.

<p>Restarting the over-polluting plants should provide a cushion

for the state, said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the ISO.

<p>In addition, hundreds of companies voluntarily cut consumption

Friday to avoid imposed outages.

<p>``We're still encouraging conservation efforts,'' said Lori

O'Donley, spokeswoman for the ISO. ``We're optimistic that we won't

have to'' impose shutdowns on commercial customers.

<p>Federal energy regulators are working with the state to find

power that can be diverted to California during the crunch, moves

that could include increasing hydroelectric generation out of

state.

<p>The power grid's managers were able to avoid blackouts Thursday

by shutting down the enormous state and federal pumps that push

water from Northern California to central and southern regions.

<p>The phased-in deregulation of California's $20 billion

electrical power industry was supposed to lower prices by creating

greater competition. But demand for electricity has outstripped

supply, in part because of a growing population and a booming

high-tech economy.

<p>Electricity is also in short supply because energy companies

held off building new power plants while deregulation was in the

planning stages. In addition, deregulation has forced utilities to

sell off their power-generating assets, such as dams and plants,

and import electricity from neighboring states, where power demand

is high right now because of a cold snap.
