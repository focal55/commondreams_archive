The Canadian government tried to breathe new life into the west's faltering programme of debt forgiveness yesterday, calling on other creditor countries to support an immediate halt to debt repayments by the world's poorest states. 

<P>Leaders from the Group of Seven main industrial countries promised last June that 24 states would be offered help   in paying off their debts by the end of 2000. But with less than four months to go, only 10 have begun receiving relief under the heavily indebted poor countries programme (HIPC).

</TABLE></font>"At a time of unprecedented prosperity in many industrialised economies, it is unacceptable that the promised debt relief has not been delivered," Paul Martin, the Canadian finance minister, said. "The HIPC process has been too slow. We made a commitment last year to faster action and we must make good on this commitment."  

<P>The delays are one of the issues drawing protesters to the streets of Prague this week for the annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.   

<P>Mr Martin added that an immediate debt moratorium would free resources for heavily indebted poor countries to spend on health and education programmes.  

<P>Britain gave a cautious welcome to the idea, but a treasury source said the Canadian proposal to speed things along would have to be studied in more detail.  

<P>Aid agencies suppored a moratorium, saying it would be a chance for a complete overhaul of the HIPC programme. "Canada's call for a moratorium is indicative of the need to take HIPC back to the drawing board," said Karen Joyner, a spokeswoman for Christian Aid.  

<P>The programme as it stands, she said, "provides too little   debt relief to too few countries too slowly."  

<P>The new managing director of the IMF, Horst K&ouml;hler, has promised to ease the requirements countries must meet to qualify for the debt programme, one of the main causes of delay.  

<P>But aid agencies say the pledge from Mr Kohler has yet to filter through his organisation which they claim is still prescribing detailed reform programmes which countries must achieve before they can receive debt relief.  

<P>The Canadian plan would exclude states such as Liberia and Sudan which it says are "not currently committed to the principles of good governance, including protection of human rights".
