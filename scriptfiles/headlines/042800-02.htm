<p>WASHINGTON - Prodded by the Pentagon, federal authorities are preparing a sea-and-land law 

enforcement operation next week on 

Vieques, a small island off Puerto 

Rico,  to clear demonstrators from a 

Navy bombing range there, government officials said today.



<p> Preparations to move a large 

number of federal special weapons 

and tactics teams to Vieques are 

under way less than a week after 

armed immigration officers stormed 

a house in which the Cuban boy Eli&aacute;n 

Gonz&aacute;lez was staying with his great-uncle in Miami.



<p> As the furor over the Miami operation continues, Attorney General 

Janet Reno has been planning the 

much larger and potentially risky 

operation in Vieques. She has met 

with the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louis J. Freeh, 

whose agents would play a central 

role in the assault, and with Defense 

Secretary William S. Cohen, the officials said.



<p> The Vieques protesters have been 

demonstrating against an agreement reached on Jan. 31 by President Clinton and  Gov. Pedro J. Rosello<B> </B>of Puerto Rico. The deal allowed the Navy to conduct limited 

exercises on Vieques in exchange for 

an American promise to abide by a 

referendum in Puerto Rico on whether to close the range.



<p> The officials said that most days  

50 to 75 protesters are camped on the 

island in the path of aircraft on 

bombing runs. Their ranks are expected to swell as knowledge of a 

pending  operation spreads. Protesters are expected to arrive by boat 

and congregate at entry gates to the 

base.



<p> Today, a Pentagon spokesman, 

Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, said that 

the Pentagon had been consulting 

with other government organizations, but would not discuss the status of the law enforcement operation.



<p>  "We've been in consultation with 

the Puerto Rican government, with 

the Department of Justice, to work 

out a way to clear the range of the 

trespassers," Admiral Quigley said. 

"That process continues, and I am 

just not going to go into any further 

detail on that process at all."



<p> Several civilian federal agencies 

are involved in the law enforcement 

operation, the officials said. Among 

them are the Treasury Department 

and the Transportation Department, 

which has jurisdiction over the Coast 

Guard, which would help block the 

flotillas of demonstrators expected 

to arrive by sea from Puerto Rico.



<p> The officials said that federal authorities are prepared to clear the 

bombing range, but have expressed 

serious reservations about the operation, which is scheduled for next 

week if the White House approves it.



<p>  They said that Pentagon officials 

have been insistent that the Navy 

needed the bombing range for training exercises, even though Justice 

Department officials have said that 

another military-style assault would 

provoke another avalanche of criticism of the Clinton administration.



<p> The officials said they feared that 

neither the F.B.I. nor the federal 

marshals were adequately prepared 

for such a large-scale enforcement 

action so far from the mainland.



<p> The operation would take place 

over a large area in which there 

would be virtually no chance for a 

surprise raid, on beaches and open 

terrain including some areas where 

live munitions are thought to lie.



<p> Moreover, the officials said, they 

feared the law enforcement operation would provoke demonstrations 

in other parts of Puerto Rico, and 

that local authorities were unprepared for large-scale disruptions.



<p> Under the tactical plan, the officials said, marines would arrive 

aboard ships to provide perimeter 

security, but only after the operation, 

and the Puerto Rican police would be 

responsible for crowd control.



<p> When the arrangement between 

the White House and Puerto Rico 

was announced, Mr. Rossello said he 

would help federal efforts to stop 

trespassing at the bombing range, 

but little action has been taken 

against the protesters.



<p> Exercises on Vieques, where the 

Navy maintains a bombing range 

that it  considers essential to the 

training of its Atlantic fleet, were 

suspended last spring after a wayward bomb killed a civilian security 

guard, an accident that  intensified 

longtime protests against the military presence.

 The Pentagon has been putting 

pressure on the Justice Department 

to clear the bombing range of protesters. Earlier this year, an aircraft 

carrier battle group had to conduct 

some training exercises in different 

places, including using a bombing 

range in Scotland. 



<p> The next carrier group, led by the 

George Washington, is headed to sea 

in coming months and the Navy is 

eager to use the range, which officials say offers the ideal location for 

coordinating air-ground-and-sea 

training exercises.
