A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by

critics of agricultural biotechnology who want the government to

require labels on foods made with genetically engineered crops.

<p>The lawsuit challenged the Food and Drug Administration's

8-year-old policy that considers gene-altered crops to be

essentially the same as those produced by conventional breeding

methods and thus not subject to the same regulatory controls as

food additives.

<p>U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, in a ruling Sept.

29, said the biotech critics failed to prove that FDA violated

procedural and environmental laws in establishing the policy or

that the agency should mandate labeling of the foods.

<p>Unless the agency decides biotech ingredients are materially

different from conventional products, it ``lacks a basis upon which

it can legally mandate labeling, regardless of consumer demand,''

she wrote.

<p>Genetically engineered crops, herbicide-resistant soybeans in

particular, became popular with farmers in the late 1990s and are

found in products throughout supermarkets.

<p>The FDA policy was established in 1992 in the last year of the

Bush administration and has been defended vigorously by the Clinton

administration. FDA officials announced this spring that they would

propose mandatory safety reviews of new gene-altered products but

they insist they still believe the foods are safe. Such reviews are

now on a voluntary basis.

<p>The lawsuit was filed in 1998 by several anti-biotech

organizations, including The Center for Food Safety, and a group of

scientists and religious leaders.

<p>They don't plan to appeal the decision and will instead wait to

see what rules FDA proposes for the mandatory reviews, said Andrew

Kimbrell, an attorney who handled the lawsuit. Industry officials

say the FDA rules are unlikely to make much difference in how foods

are brought to market.

<p>``Genetically engineered foods have gone virtually unregulated

in the United States,'' he said Tuesday.

<p>Anti-biotech groups also are likely to challenge the

Environmental Protection Agency as it decides in coming months

whether to renew registrations for several varieties of corn that

have been genetically modified to resist insect pests, Kimbrell

said.

<p>The biotechnology industry has been on the defensive in recent

weeks because of a nationwide recall by Kraft Foods last month of

taco shells that were found to contain a variety gene-altered corn

that hasn't been approved for human consumption.

<p>The decision ``reinforces the integrity of the system, which is

based on sound science, at a time when this system is under

discussion,'' said Michael Phillips, who directs agricultural

issues for the Biotechnology Industry Organization.

<p>The FDA said this week that its own lab confirmed the corn was

in the taco shells and said it planned to test additional products.

<p>The corn, known as StarLink, is the only biotech crop that is

not approved for food use. Aventis CropScience, which developed the

corn variety, has agreed to reimburse the government for buying all

of this year's crop to ensure that it does not get into the food

supply again. EPA allows the corn to be used only for animal feed

because of unresolved questions about whether it could cause

allergic reactions in people.
