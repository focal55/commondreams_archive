ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA  - Japan and Norway moved a

step closer on Wednesday to lifting a 1986 ban on commercial

whaling, after many of their foes on the issue agreed to press

ahead with drafting new whaling rules.

<p>``It's another step forward toward the resumption of

commercial whaling,'' Campaign Whale spokesman Andy Ottaway

said.

<p>However, Japan faced a fresh wave of criticism after it

confirmed it planned to add two new whale species to its

research hunting program, raising the heckles of

conservationists and those who fear that the whale population is

dwindling too quickly.

<p>``We are appalled at the proposal,'' said UK Fisheries

Minister Elliot Morley after 19 member nations supported his

resolution to the 41-member International Whaling Commission

(IWC) to condemn Japan, with 12 against and two abstaining.

<p>``We feel very strongly about this,'' he said, saying the

U.K would pursue the issue at bilateral and multilateral

meetings.

<p>Japan caught more than 500 minke whales in 1999 for what it

says were scientific purposes and plans to add 50 Bryde's whales

and 10 sperm whales to its new research hunting program.

<p>It and Norway, which plans to kill 655 minkes this year, are

pushing also for a resumption of commercial whaling.

<p>Most members the IWC agreed to a 12-month framework to draft

procedural rules under which commercial whaling would take place

if and when the moratorium was lifted.

<p>But, Britain, which supported the compromise, said it

remained adamantly opposed to commercial whaling but had voted

for the deal to safeguard the work of the IWC.

<p>The compromise reached at the IWC annual meeting in Adelaide

was a bid to end a decade of conflict over the rules for any

future resumption of whaling, amid growing concern about the

commission's future role as a regulatory body.

<p>The IWC backed a proposal by 10 so-called moderate nations,

including Sweden, Switzerland, and Ireland, to meet in February

to try to advance agreement on rules for whale-hunting ahead of

the commission's next meeting in London in mid-2001.

<p>The rules of the so-called revised management scheme (RMS)

would not cover quotas, but would spell out inspection and

monitoring procedures for future commercial whaling.

<p>Anti-whaling countries and groups want the rules to also

cover killing methods, domestic market inspections, and wider

environmental issues.

<p>Morley said Britain backed the RMS deal following

allegations that anti-whaling nations were ``deliberately being

obstructive'' but he said it was ``relaxed'' about the move.

<p>``We have not committed ourselves ... apart from agreeing to

a framework to take it forward,'' he told reporters. ``As far as

we're concerned, the procedure agreed today is a framework for

discussion, it doesn't actually fast-track it.''

<p>Environmental groups said they were disappointed with the

decision, warning that the new alignment of moderate nations was

splitting the IWC's anti-whaling block.

<p>But Campaign Whale spokesman Ottaway said Japan and Norway

still faced major hurdles and opposition from staunch

anti-whaling nations.

<p>``What is significant is some traditionally anti-whaling

countries are now looking for a compromise on the whole whaling

issue which has divided the anti-whaling movement,'' Ottaway

said.

<p>``And that is only going to benefit the whalers and not the

whales,'' he said.

<p>The IWC has expressed growing frustration at the deadlock

between whalers, mainly Japan and Norway, and anti-whaling

nations like the United States, Britain and Australia.

<p>Pro-whalers have urged Australia, which opposes outright any

return to commercial whaling, to quit the organization, saying

it is a whaling regulator, not a whale conservation body.
