ROME<wbr> - <wbr>Breaking ranks with its wealthy peers, Italy pledged Friday to

forgive $4 billion to $6 billion in debt owed by 62 impoverished

countries over the next three years under easier terms than those set by

other leading industrial democracies.

<p>The initiative, approved by Parliament without dissent, was meant to

strengthen Italy's proposal at a summit next week for a similar write-off

by its rich European neighbors, plus Japan, Canada and the United States.

<p>Debt relief is the goal of a growing worldwide movement that includes

Pope John Paul II, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and an array of star

entertainers. President Clinton and other leaders endorsed the idea at

their summit a year ago but it has been slow to take effect.

<p>Under the plan, 41 heavily indebted Third World countries designated

by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund are eligible for about

$100 billion in debt relief. To qualify, they must adopt free-market

reforms prescribed by those agencies, such as privatizing state property

and maximizing exports of marketable commodities.

<p>Annan complained in a letter this week that just five debtor countries

in Africa and South America had qualified for relief and that the

reduction of their financial obligations, an average of 35% each, was not

enough to pull them out of poverty. He called for "urgent action" to ease

the conditions.

<p>Italy became the first of the group to support him with action.

Instead of insisting on free-market reforms, the new Italian law offers

debt relief to poor countries that agree only to respect civil liberties,

renounce war as a means of resolving conflict, and use their freed-up

resources on health, education and reducing poverty.

<p>"This is a seismic shift," said Jamie Drummond, spokesman in London

for Jubilee 2000, a worldwide debt relief advocacy group that includes

labor unions, religious groups and economists. Until now, he said,

international debt relief policy "was made by a cartel, and now the

Italians are breaking the cartel."

<p>While Britain has been calling for a similar change of conditions,

Drummond added, Italy's "is the first piece of [debt relief] legislation

by a major creditor that makes humanitarian considerations paramount."

<p>Italy will write off all development and commercial debt owed it by 34

countries on the IMF and World Bank list and about two-thirds of the

debts owed by 28 other poor Third World nations, the Foreign Ministry

said.

<p>By obliging Italy to write off at least $4 billion in debt by

mid-2003, the law appears to accelerate a process that until now has been

moving at a snail's pace.

<p>A Foreign Ministry statement Friday called the government-sponsored

law, passed late Thursday, "an essential contribution to a broader

strategy in the struggle against poverty, in which the international

community should assume a heavier burden."

<p>Prime Minister Giuliano Amato will take that message to the summit in

Okinawa, Japan, hoping to sway the United States, Britain and Germany,

whose leaders have been particularly eager to show leadership on the

issue, Italian officials said.

<p>Amato's predecessor, Massimo D'Alema, began pushing the initiative in

January after opera singer Luciano Pavarotti and rock star Jovanotti used

Italy's biggest music festival to popularize the debt relief cause. On

stage in San Remo before 17 million TV viewers, Jovanotti chanted in rap

cadence: "Cancel the debt! One billion people on the planet live on less

than a dollar a day."

<p>Parliament also was influenced by the pope's calls for debt relief

during this Roman Catholic Holy Year, which is dedicated to forgiveness

and redemption. And the center-left government is seeking reengagement in

the world after a sharp decline in foreign assistance during the 1990s.

<p>The law includes as much as $2 billion in aid that will be combined

with partial debt relief to some countries.

<p>"This is one of the only foreign policy issues that united our

Parliament this year," Sen. Tana de Zulueta said. Debt relief terms being

offered, she said, "proved so restrictive that most countries were unable

to benefit. We were failing in our intent to allow the development of

those countries."
