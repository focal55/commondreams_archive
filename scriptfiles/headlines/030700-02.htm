<p>The U.S. Agriculture Department on

Tuesday was expected to release its new proposals to regulate

the booming organic food industry, easing concerns among organic

farmers and sellers, and potentially defusing some trade

conflicts with Europe.

<p>In late 1997, the U.S. Agriculture Department first proposed

national guidelines for labeling and marketing organic food and

clothing but was deluged with a record 300,000 comments -- most

of them negative.

<p>Environmentalists, farmers, consumers, the entire Vermont

Legislature and celebrities, including musician Willie Nelson,

wrote, mostly in opposition to the regulations as drafted.

<p>Critics objected to putting the ``organic'' label on foods

grown from genetically modified seeds, treated by

disease-killing irradiation and fertilized by sewage sludge

recycled by municipal waste plants.

<p>Agriculture Department officials spent the last two years

reviewing the letters and have rewritten guidelines to finally

govern what exactly can be labeled as ``organic.''

<p>Department officials have said this time around,

biotechnology, sewage sludge and irradiation will not be

considered organic.

<p>``I do believe that USDA really has tried to incorporate

what they received as comments,'' Katherine DiMatteo, head of

the Organic Trade Association, said earlier this year as details

of the government proposals emerged.

<p>In addition to trying to satisfy the industry and the

growing number of American consumers who shop for organic foods,

the rules are also seen as a way to potentially defuse some

trade conflicts with Europe.

<p>When European governments banned some of the same

controversial farming practices that would be banned by the

proposed organic rules, the U.S. government objected, calling

them unfair to trade, and imposed retaliatory trade sanctions.

<p>The U.S. organic industry sold more than $4 billion worth of

products, from food to clothing, in 1998. It is estimated that

organic sales grew by more than 20 percent in 1999 and will

increase by another 20 percent this year.

<p>But the industry said it needed standards to maintain the

surge in organic sales. Currently, organic standards vary among

state and private sector certifiers. For example, an orange

labeled ``organic'' in one state may be raised completely

differently than an ``organic'' orange from another state.

<p>The industry has said that without guidelines, there is

nothing to back up the claim that a product is organic, raising

questions among consumers about whether an organic label really

means anything -- and whether it is worth paying more for food

designated as such.

<p>But some farmers expressed concern that the new guidelines

will impose a costly system on organic producers, many of whom

are small farmers who sell close to home.

<p>``I am concerned that the charges connected with this new

system will be so high that small farmers won't be able to

afford it,'' said Elizabeth Henderson, an organic vegetable

farmer in Wayne County, New York.

<p>Organic industry representatives say that this time they are

confident their voices have been heard, largely after the

Agriculture Department hired someone who had been critical of

the initial USDA proposal to head up the task of rewriting the

government organic standards.

<p>Kathleen Merrigan was hired by the USDA in June from the

Henry Wallace Institute for Alternative Agriculture. After the

initial rules came out, Merrigan wrote a 100-page, single-spaced

response to the USDA on behalf of the Institute, most of it

pointing out flaws in the agency's proposals.

<p>And, when Congress passed a bill a decade ago that ordered

the Agriculture Department to create rules for organic food and

clothing that would be enforced nationwide, Merrigan was working

for Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, who was head of the

Senate Agriculture Committee. Merrigan drafted the legislation

for the organic rules.

<p>Rep. Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon, who led the

legislation's passage in the House said on Monday he was happy

the USDA had finally completed its second draft.

<p>``I'm pleased to see that the USDA is finally working on a

better deal for the consumers,'' he said.
