UNITED NATIONS  - U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan

said on Monday the threat of nuclear war ``remains a very real,

and very terrifying possibility'' at the beginning of the 21st

century.

<p>Without mentioning Washington by name, he also cautioned

against plans to develop a ``star wars''-type National Missile

Defense (NMD), saying this could lead to a new arms race.<p>Annan was welcoming delegates at the start of a month-long

conference to review implementation of the key Nuclear

Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).<p>Under the treaty, which entered into force in 1970, the five

original nuclear powers -- the United States, Russia, Britain,

China and France -- are permitted to retain their nuclear

weapons in exchange for a pledge to move toward nuclear

disarmament.<p>The other 182 parties to the treaty have renounced any

ambitions to acquire nuclear weapons, while being assured access

to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.<p>But their resentment at what they regard as the big powers'

foot-dragging on disarmament will be highlighted during the

conference, held every five years.<p>Another focus is likely to be the four countries that have

so far refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

They are India and Pakistan, which carried out tit-for-tat

underground tests in 1998; Cuba; and Israel, certain to be

targeted by Arab states as possessing nuclear weapons.

<p>Annan said the tests carried out by India and Pakistan were

''a serious setback against the global norms against nuclear

testing and nuclear proliferation.''<p>Welcoming what he called ``an unmistakable record of

achievement and hard-won progress'' in the disarmament field,

Annan said this was ``no time for complacency when it comes to

the threat of nuclear war.''<p>``Nuclear conflict remains a very real, and very terrifying

possibility at the beginning of the 21st century. This is the

stark reality confronting you today,'' Annan said.<p>Apparently alluding to weapons searches in Iraq after the

Gulf war, he added: ``We need look no further than the discovery

of clandestine nuclear-weapons development programs to realize

the magnitude of this (non-proliferation) challenge.''<p>Annan said the most recent challenge in the area of nuclear

disarmament was ``the growing pressure to deploy national

missile defenses.''<p>``This pressure is jeopardizing the ABM (anti-ballistic

missile) Treaty ... and could well lead to a new arms race,

setbacks for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, and

create new incentives for missile proliferation,'' he said.<p>``It is my hope that all states will take great care to

weigh these dangers and challenges before embarking on a process

which may well reduce, rather than enhance, global security,''

Annan said.

<p><font size=+1><b><font size="3">Russia, China Warn On Changes In Abm Treaty</font></b></font>

<p>Russia and China have repeatedly said any tampering with the

1972 ABM treaty would destroy the entire edifice of nuclear

disarmament. The treaty is based on the theory that anti-missile

systems would only tempt the other side to build more missiles

to overwhelm the defenses.<p>Washington is to decide this summer whether to move ahead

with a limited defense against missiles launched by what it

regards as ``rogue states'' or terrorists.<p>Annan said that, on the positive side, former nuclear rivals

were ``now cooperating to reduce threats posed by their

weapons;'' nuclear safeguards had been strengthened; and

membership in nuclear-weapon-free zones in several parts of the

world had grown.<p>A Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty had been negotiated, Annan

said, though it was not yet in force, and this month the Russian

Parliament had ratified the START II (Strategic Arms Reduction)

Treaty and the test ban treaty.<p>START II, reducing nuclear warheads from 6,000 to no more

than 3,500 on each side by 2007, was ratified by the U.S. Senate

in 1996. But the Senate's rejection last October of the test ban

treaty, against the wishes of President Clinton, is certain to

provide ammunition for Washington's critics during the

conference.<p>Citing ``major challenges in fulfilling the disarmament

aims'' of the non-proliferation treaty, Annan said: ``Some

35,000 nuclear weapons remain in the arsenals of the nuclear

powers, with thousands still deployed on hair-trigger alert.''<p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, among the first

speakers on Monday afternoon, intends to defend the extent of

U.S. disarmament since the end of the Cold War.
