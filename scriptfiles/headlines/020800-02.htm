<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- An Israeli shopping list for new weapons from the United States includes cruise missiles, advanced surveillance systems and other highly restricted weapons that critics say far exceeds Israel's needs and could set off a new Mideast arms race.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

   The request, which forms a crucial part of the negotiating process over a new Mideast agreement, is likely to generate a heated round of bargaining between the United States and Israel.</font>

</p>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



   One Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called the request a ``wish list,'' and a top aide to a Senate Democrat, who also asked not to be identified, predicted the Israelis would bargain vigorously with the Americans. ``The bazaar is open,'' he said.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



   The request involves both forbidden armaments and the money with which to buy them. Typically, the United States agrees to sell certain weapons systems to Israel, then provides aid to enable the purchases.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak says Israel needs the highly restricted software codes, cruise missiles, smart bombs and other sophisticated systems to safeguard its security if it returns the strategic Golan Heights to Syria, which Damascus has demanded in exchange for any peace agreement.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



   Other critics of the request voice concerns that Israel's world-class arms industry might repackage or even resell U.S. technology, or even provoke a new Mideast arms race.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



  ``You trigger an arms race unwittingly,'' warned Sami Haijjar, director for Middle East studies at the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pa. ``You cannot expect to arm to the teeth one nation in the region and expect all others to accept it willingly.''</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



   U.S. officials declined to discuss the request in detail, merely reiterating Washington's commitment to maintaining Israel's military edge over its adversaries.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



      Pro-Israel lobbyists are telling U.S. lawmakers that Barak needs a much closer military relationship with the United States, almost akin to membership in NATO, in order to risk making peace with Syria.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



        Other analysts, however, charge that Israel is using the peace talks as a pretext to upgrade its arsenal.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



   Sources familiar with Israel's request say it is divided into three ``baskets.'' The first seeks roughly $10 billion for surveillance systems, including spy satellite technology and ground-based early warning networks. The second requests $3.5 billion for ``deterrence,'' including Tomahawk cruise missiles and precision-guided munitions. And the third basket asks for $3.5 billion for trucks, helicopters and other equipment. The costs of stationing U.S. peacekeepers in the Golan Heights and relocating Jewish settlers there are not included in the proposal, which would be added to the $2 billion in U.S. security aid Israel receives each year.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">



    The Clinton administration must now determine which transfers are essential, which might destabilize the region and which are too sensitive to share. ``If Israel wants every bit of American technology, the answer should be no,'' said Anthony Cordesman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ``If I were Israel, I'd ask for it. But even when your best friend asks for something that doesn't mean you deliver it.''</font>
