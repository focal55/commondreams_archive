KOKOMO, Miss. - Led by Jesse L. Jackson, nearly 1,000 people today braved stinging fire ants and a blistering sun to march along a country road in southern Mississippi and call for justice in the mysterious death of 17-year-old Raynard Johnson. 



<p>"Stop the lynching now!" they chanted. "Stop killing our children! Don't hesitate--investigate."

</font></font></font></font></font>The march ended hours later at what Jackson called "the hanging tree"--the small pecan tree on the front lawn of the Johnson family home where the popular youth was found hanging on the night of June 16.<P>

Two autopsies, including one requested by the family, have found the death consistent with suicide. There were no defensive wounds, such as broken fingernails or bruises. But from the beginning, the teenager's family, neighbors and friends have insisted he was brutally ambushed and murdered by someone who opposed his friendships with young white women.<P>

"This is a wake-up call," said Jackson at today's rally as the marchers cheered in agreement. "We speak of a new Mississippi, and I see blacks and whites here today. In some sense, this is not just a fight about black and white. This is a fight about wrong and right."<P>

Three state, local and federal agencies, including the FBI, are investigating Raynard Johnson's death. Claiborne "Buddy" McDonald, the Marion County district attorney, said investigators have interviewed more than 20 people with knowledge of the case, and authorities will decide their next step once they determine "what's found to be fact."<P>

The case--involving an honor-roll student with many black and white friends who had shown no outward signs of depression--has brought national attention to this rural community deep in the Pine Belt of Mississippi, about a two-hour drive from New Orleans. It also has conjured up the ghosts of Mississippi's violent past during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s.<P>

At Jackson's side today and at a church rally Friday night in the county seat of Columbia was Mamie Mobley, the now white-haired mother of Emmett Till, who stands as a martyr of the movement. Jackson has frequently compared the Johnson case to that of Till, who was 14 when he was murdered in 1955 after reportedly wolf-whistling at a young white woman tending a country store. The two white defendants in the case were acquitted.<P>

"Believe me, there has not been one week free of pain since then," said Mobley, who accompanied Raynard's mother, Maria Johnson. "I am here because I need to be here. We've got to see what we can do to get the other mothers to stand up and say, 'This is enough.' "<P>

People in the crowd today, mopping their sweaty brows and pouring bottled water over their heads in the 100-degree heat, were predominantly black. Two busloads of sympathizers traveled from New Orleans to show their support. Some marchers said they knew the Johnson family and their youngest child well; others said they had heard or read about questions surrounding the death and felt compelled to join in the rally.<P>

</TABLE></font></font></font></font></font></font>"I've never been to something like this in my life," said Jed Steffee, 37, a farmer from Folsom, La., who is white. "There were just too many things that sounded suspicious by nature. I moved down here from Chicago 10 years ago, and I have a feel for the way things still are."<P>

Jackson and the youth's family have repeatedly emphasized that certain aspects of the case do not add up. In the days preceding young Johnson's death, he and his brother, Roger, 21, had heard that relatives of two young white women they were friendly with were angry about the relationships. The Johnsons and their neighbors were awakened on the last two nights of Raynard's life by the frantic barking of their hunting dogs, as if someone was lurking in the nearby woods.<P>

On the Friday night he died, Raynard had been watching a basketball game at home with a cousin when he mentioned he was going outside to clean out his car. His father, Jerry, arrived less than a half-hour later and found the youth dead. No one recognized the braided-leather belt that was looped around his neck.<P>

The two young women in question did not attend Raynard's funeral and have not talked to the news media.<P>

But one of the marchers, Endy Varnado, 35, a black cook who lives in nearby Foxworth, said she knew the two white teenagers well and that they had dropped by her home often a few months ago, "chasing after" her 17-year-old son, a friend of Raynard's.<P>

"What finally stopped them was I said, 'It's cool. You sit around here all day, so we'll come around and eat roast beef at your house,' " Varnado said. "They're boy-crazy. They just wanted to go with black guys."<P>

Roy Magee, a 26-year-old truck driver from Columbia, said he fears there may have been an attempt at "a cover-up" by local law enforcement. An uncle of one of the young women reportedly is a former jailer.<P>

"I think we can get to the bottom of this," said Magee, who is black. "I know we can--if we stick together."<P>

NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, at a news conference in Baltimore marking the opening of the group's annual convention, called for more answers in the case.<P>

"It is a tragic situation that cries out for thorough and accurate investigation. Clearly something happened here that was unusual and peculiar," he said. "This ghost of Mississippi is still with us after all these years," Mfume said.
