<p>New Orleans -         Adopting a significant change in policy, the 

American labor movement called for blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants 

yesterday and an end to most sanctions against employers who hire them.	 

</P>

<P>  In past decades, labor unions often saw immigrant workers as the enemy, 

accusing them of depressing wages and breaking strikes. But the executive 

council of the AFL-CIO adopted a more sympathetic approach, contending that 

too often, U.S. immigration rules have enabled employers to exploit illegal 

immigrants.	 

</P><P>  The new policy comes as business groups are pushing for similar 

legislative changes to help industry cope with a shortage of workers.	 

</P><P>  Immigrants make up an ever-larger part of the nation's workforce, and 

labor leaders are stepping up attempts to unionize hundreds of thousands of 

immigrants who work in farming, hotels, construction, meat packing and many 

other industries. Labor leaders complain that unscrupulous employers often 

fight off unionization drives by threatening to fire illegal immigrant 

</P><P>employees who support unions and by calling immigration 

officials to deport them.	 

</P><P>  ``The present system doesn't work and is used as a weapon against 

workers,'' said John Wilhelm, chairman of the federation's Committee on 

Immigration Policy and president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant 

Employees Union. ``The only reason a lot of employers want to hire a large 

number of illegal aliens is so they can exploit them.''	 

</P><P>  Labor leaders said they hope their new policy will help persuade Congress 

to pass an amnesty law that would enable immigrant workers to stand up for 

their rights.	 

</P><P>  ``I think the AFL-CIO's decision is going to be a shot heard 'round 

Washington,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of the National 

Immigration Forum, an immigrants' advocacy group.	 

</P><P>  ``You have a variety of employer groups saying, `We need more immigrant 

workers and we want our workers to be legal,' and you have the AFL-CIO 

saying, `We want more immigrant workers to be legal and we're willing to 

talk to employers about their legitimate needs.' You have the makings of a 

business-labor compact that could draw new immigration policies for the next 

decade,'' Sharry said.	 

</P><P>  The labor federation's resolution calls for blanket amnesty for the 

estimated 6 million illegal immigrants in the United States.	 

</P><P>  Yesterday's action came after union officials in California, the state 

with the most illegal immigrants, urged AFL-CIO officials to support an 

amnesty, telling them that many illegal workers face low wages and lives of 

misery because of the way immigration rules enable unscrupulous employers to 

exploit them.	 

</P><P>  Some advocacy groups criticized labor's change on immigration. Dan Stein, 

executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which 

has taken a hard line against increased immigration, said the call for 

amnesty, coming after an amnesty granted in 1986, would encourage more 

illegal immigration.	 

</P><P>  Also at the meeting, AFL-CIO officials outlined an ambitious campaign 

yesterday to persuade Congress to oppose President Clinton's drive to 

normalize trade relations with China.	 

</P><P>  The officials buttressed their case by issuing the results of a poll that 

found most Americans opposed to normal trade with Beijing.	 

</P><P>  The administration's trade accord with China, if approved by Congress, 

would remove trade barriers against the Chinese and ease their entry into 

the World Trade Organization.
