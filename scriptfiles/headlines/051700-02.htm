Three prominent former Pentagon officials who served in Democratic administrations are breaking ranks with President Clinton on the issue of missile defense, urging him to shelve his current proposal as expensive, unworkable and unnecessarily alienating to the Russians.<P>

As an alternative, the former officials are embracing an idea most forcefully promoted in the past by conservative Republicans: the development of ships with advanced interceptor missiles that could be parked off the coast of North Korea or other rogue states. That system, they said, would be less costly and less risky.<P>

Writing in the summer issue of the journal Foreign Policy, John Deutch and John P. White, both of whom served as deputy secretaries of defense under Clinton, and Harold Brown, who was Jimmy Carter's defense secretary, warned the president against moving forward too quickly with his missile shield.<P>

Under a hurry-up schedule, Clinton is due to decide in the fall whether to proceed with construction of a system made up of a powerful targeting radar and 100 interceptor missiles based in Alaska. Testing would continue even as the system is put together. The timing was dictated by intelligence estimates projecting that North Korea would be able to fire a missile at the United States by 2005.<P>

Echoing concerns raised by Pentagon officials and defense experts, the former officials said: "We conclude that the development and testing of the [National Missile Defense] system is not mature enough for the United States to make a confident deployment decision this year."<P>

Critics and defenders of the system agree it faces vast technical difficulties because it would attempt to intercept warheads high in space, where they can easily be disguised among decoys. The former officials said it would be "cheaper and technically less risky" to build a ship-based system that would fire at the "boost phase" when a warhead is still attached to a big, flaming rocket that provides an easier target. Such a system could be developed quickly from existing weapons, they said.<P>

Finally, Deutch, Brown and White argue that a naval system aimed specifically at North Korea might be easier for the Russian government to accept than the Alaska-based system, which Moscow has rejected as a threat to its own nuclear deterrent and a blatant violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.<P>

The former officials contend that the limited system they propose "arguably would not violate the ABM Treaty." Failure to reach an understanding with Russia over the treaty, the officials said, "would worsen bilateral relations just as Russia's progress toward democratization and a market economy is especially fragile."<P>

The article will be published in June, but a copy was made available in advance by Foreign Policy, a publication of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.<P>

"With these voices speaking out, you have people from across the political spectrum urging the administration to reconsider its proposal and look at some version of a sea-based alternative," said Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "Eventually that could have an impact."
