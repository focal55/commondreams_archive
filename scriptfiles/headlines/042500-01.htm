The chairman of Nike, Phil Knight, 

will  not make  a planned $30 million 

contribution to help his alma mater, 

the University of Oregon, renovate 

its athletic stadium because the 

university joined a factory monitoring group other than the one he 

supports, a senior Nike official said 

yesterday.



<p> Mr. Knight, a billionaire who heads 

the world's largest footwear company, has given about $30 million to the 

university over the last decade, but 

company officials said he was disturbed that the university joined the 

Workers Rights Consortium, a student-backed  monitoring group.



<p> Nike, which has faced  criticism 

over working conditions in its overseas factories, has often faulted the 

consortium for being unfriendly to 

apparel and footwear manufacturers. Nike is an enthusiastic member 

of another monitoring group, the 

Fair Labor Association, a White 

House-backed organization that, unlike the Workers Rights Consortium, 

has apparel companies on its board.



<p> In a statement, Nike said: "The 

University of Oregon, despite its 

unique relationship with Nike and 

Phil, is free to align itself with the 

Workers Rights Consortium. However, it does not mean that we are 

required to support those efforts 

with which we have fundamental disagreements."



<p> The University of Oregon, based in 

Eugene, has been developing plans to 

renovate and expand Autzen Stadium, a project that is expected to 

cost $80 million. University officials 

said they still 

hoped to  talk 

with Mr. Knight 

to see whether 

he might reconsider  his decision.



<p>  Randy Newnham, a university senior  and a 

coordinator of 

the Survival 

Center, which  supports social justice 

and human rights, criticized Mr. 

Knight's decision. 



<p> "It's kind of amusing, considering 

that he's upset that we joined some 

labor-monitoring body," Mr. Newnham said. "He keeps claiming that 

his company is socially responsible 

and they don't use sweatshop labor. 

If that's the case, why is he so upset 

that we joined this monitoring 

group? It kind of implies that something isn't quite up to par."



<p>  Over the last six months, student 

groups at dozens of campuses have 

held sit-ins and demonstrations to 

pressure their universities to join the 

Workers Rights Consortium, instead 

of the Fair Labor Association. The 

consortium, set up by students with 

the backing of several labor unions, 

now has 45 universities as members. 

It  monitors overseas factories that 

make hats, T-shirts and other apparel that are made under license and 

carry a university's logo.



<p> The students assert that the Fair 

Labor Association is dominated by 

corporations and will not be vigorous 

in its monitoring. Its  members include several consumer groups, human rights groups and 130 colleges.



<p>  Nike officials criticize the consortium's  makeup and its requirement 

for surprise monitoring visits. 



<p>  "We object to the Workers Rights 

Consortium because it does not provide a seat on the table for companies," said Vada Manager, a Nike 

spokesman.   

<p> "Another issue is it has 

a 'gotcha' monitoring system, which 

in our minds is not a serious way to 

achieve the common goal that we all 

want to achieve, which is to eradicate sweatshop conditions."



<p>     To  pressure  Nike, United Students Against Sweatshops, the umbrella group backing the consortium, 

the Union of Needletrades, Industrial 

and Textile Employees and other 

groups issued a report yesterday 

that criticized Nike for using  sweatshops. The report faults Nike for 

doing  much of its production in China, where independent unions are 

prohibited and where, the report 

said, workers are paid at most $1.50 

for a pair of shoes that sells for $100.



<p> Nike officials assert that the company has made great strides in improving its factories,  that they do 

more monitoring than most companies and that their  factories usually 

pay more than other factories in the 

regions where they are situated.



<p> Last month, Nike said it was ending its agreement to supply Brown 

University's hockey teams  after 

Brown joined the consortium. Brown 

officials said Nike's move resulted 

from miscommunication. 



<p> Nicholas Reville, a Brown junior 

active in United Students Against 

Sweatshops, said Nike and Mr. 

Knight moved against Brown and the 

University of Oregon, to warn other 

universities against join the Workers 

Rights Consortium.
