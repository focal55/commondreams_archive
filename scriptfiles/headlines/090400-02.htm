<p>DETROIT - After the last 

huge recall of Firestone tires in 1978, 

when tread separation problems resulted in hundreds of crashes and 

dozens of deaths, Congress and regulators made a series of proposals to 

tighten federal tire standards. But 

the standards were not revised, and 

many of the same problems, including some that the proposals were 

designed to address, have arisen 

again in the 14.4 million Firestone 

tires being recalled now.



<p> A Congressional report on the 1978 

recall of 14.5 million Firestone 500 

tires pointed out that the steel-belted 

radial tires had easily passed the 

government's tests -- devised in the 

late 1960's for biased-ply tires, an 

earlier technology -- but still failed 

in large numbers on the road.



<p>  Carter administration officials imposed one new requirement on the 

auto industry in 1980 and began 

drafting new tire regulations, government documents from that period 

show.



<p> But all the moves to tighten tire 

regulation were stopped after Ronald Reagan became president and 

sought to reduce the regulatory burden on the then-beleaguered American auto industry. The only new rule, 

involving the disclosure of tires' capacity to carry weight, was rescinded. Also canceled were plans for 

more stringent tests and for mandatory devices to warn motorists when 

their tires became underinflated.



<p>  Some of the regulatory initiatives 

abandoned in 1981 are likely to come 

up again this week, as Congressional 

committees hold hearings into the 

current recall.



<p> The National Highway Traffic 

Safety Administration has received 

more than 1,400 complaints about 

Firestone ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires, the bulk involving tires 

installed on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. The complaints and data 

supplied to the agency by Firestone 

attribute 88 deaths to the tires. Firestone has recalled all ATX and ATX 

II tires of the P235/75R15 size, which 

were made from 1990 to 1996, and has 

recalled Wilderness tires of the same 

size made since 1996 at its factory in 

Decatur, Ill.



<p> The safety agency is also reviewing whether many more Firestone 

tires may need to be recalled. On 

Friday, it issued a consumer advisory suggesting that motorists replace 

another 1.4 million tires that Firestone has refused to recall.



<p> Firestone estimates that 6.5 million of the 14.4 million tires covered 

in the current recall are on the road, 

and fewer than half those covered by 

the advisory.



<p> Two provisions dropped in the early 1980's clearly would have made 

the current episode easier for consumers.   

<p>One would have required 

that identification numbers be printed on exterior rather than interior 

sidewalls, making it simpler for consumers to determine if their tires 

were included in a recall or advisory. 

Another, enacted before the 1978 recall, required that independent tire 

dealers keep track of buyers' addresses, so that those customers 

could be contacted during a recall.



<p>  The year before the huge recall of 

1978, Firestone had recalled 400,000 

similar tires made in Decatur. The 

company insisted then, as it does 

now, that the problem was confined 

to that plant, but company documents obtained by regulators in 1978 

showed that Firestone knew of a 

design defect affecting tires from 

other factories as well.



<p> The 1978 recall and the current one 

are the two largest, by a wide margin, since tire regulation began in the 

1960's. The earlier recall produced 

more than 14,000 complaints to regulators, but those complaints cited 

just 41 deaths. Firestone 500s were 

car tires, and few cars rolled over 

when their tires failed. The current 

recall involves far fewer complaints 

but more deaths, most of which have 

occurred when Explorers and other 

sport utility vehicles rolled over after the tires lost treads.



<p> Even before the recall, House and 

Senate conferees were scheduled to 

decide in the next several weeks 

whether to let regulators proceed 

with plans to provide consumers 

with information on vehicles' tendency to roll over. One of the hearings 

this week will be held by Senator 

Richard C. Shelby, an Alabama Republican who has led efforts to block 

the release of the information. Senator Shelby, who has been traveling in 

Africa for the past month, has declined interview requests.



<p> Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice 

president for safety and the environment, said in a recent news conference that Ford would favor any new 

tire regulations that improved safety. Ford opposes regulators' plans to 

rate vehicles' tendency to roll over, 

contending that the proposal does not 

measure this tendency accurately 

enough. Regulators have defended 

their plan, pointing out that automakers have opposed attempts to 

measure rollover propensity.



<p> The government tests tires for endurance by running them for 34 

hours at 50 miles per hour, and for 

speed by running them for 90 minutes at 70 to 85 miles per hour.



<p>   Stephen R. Kratzke, the associate 

administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 

said regulators were considering 

more stringent tests. Any new rules 

would probably not be limited to tires 

for sport utility vehicles and other 

light trucks, he said, but would also 

extend to car tires.



<p>   In response to disclosures that 

Ford subsidiaries overseas began replacing the tires last year, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said 

today on the ABC program "This 

Week" that the Clinton administration also wanted legislation requiring 

manufacturers to report recalls 

abroad.



<p> Firestone officials declined to 

comment on whether they felt new 

tire regulations were needed. But 

Chuck Sinclair, a spokesman for 

Goodyear, the market-share leader, 

said tonight that the company did 

"see a need for change in the regulations" and had been working on this 

even before the current recall. Automakers say that they already demand better-quality tires than the 

regulations require. 



<p> Although the cause of the problems in 1978 was never publicly determined, Firestone did make 

changes to its tires, and the problems 

stopped. But the episode crippled the 

company financially and contributed 

to its takeover in 1988 by the Bridgestone Corporation.



<p> Firestone recovered from the 1978 

recall by replacing virtually all the 

tires itself, which kept customers 

coming back to its dealers. But Ford 

has insisted that Firestone reimburse customers who buy other 

brands this time.



<p> Back in 1981, as the Reagan administration began reviewing its 

predecessor's regulatory backlog, 

the American auto industry had laid 

off 500,000 workers and was close to 

bankruptcy. Chrysler had just been 

rescued with government loan guarantees.



<p> While high interest rates and high 

gasoline prices were partly responsible, auto executives also blamed the 

high cost of government regulation, 

and President Reagan sought to ease 

this burden.



<p>  One tire regulation proposed at the 

end of the Carter administration, and 

canceled by President Reagan, 

would have required that vehicles 

alert their owners to low tire pressure, either with a light on the dashboard or with a  red button that would 

pop up from the tire's valve.



<p> Inflation has been a big issue in the 

current recall. Firestone has recommended that Explorer tires be inflated to 30 pounds per square inch, after 

acquiescing for a decade to Ford's 

recommendation of 26 pounds.



<p>  Tom Baughman, Ford's director 

of light truck engineering, has acknowledged that Explorer tires could 

suffer damage if the pressure fell 

below 20 pounds, but said that 26 

pounds provided an adequate margin 

of safety.
