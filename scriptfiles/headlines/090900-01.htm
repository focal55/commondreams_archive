Just a week after President Clinton delivered $1.3 billion in aid to Colombian officials for military equipment, counter-drug training and economic assistance, House leaders are considering whether to approve millions of dollars more for anti-drug assistance to the Colombian national police.   

<P>

<P>House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), a strong advocate of anti-drug aid to Latin American countries, said this week he is reviewing a request for an additional $99.5 million to purchase more aircraft, ammunition and other equipment for the Colombian police.</P>

<P>

<P>"We're just looking at the feasibility," Hastert said. "I don't know if we can do it or not and what the need is."</P>

<P>

<P>Congress spent the better part of the year thrashing out an economic and military aid package for Colombia, overcoming strong resistance from critics who fear that U.S. troops will be drawn into Colombia's protracted war against leftist guerrillas and disagreement over whether the military or police should get the bulk of the money.</P>

<P>

<P>Although the administration's original proposal heavily favored the Colombian military, congressional Republicans succeeded in transferring a significant portion of the package, including 14 new helicopters, to the police.</P>

<P>

<P>Now a group of 17 conservative lawmakers, headed by Reps. Dan Burton (R-Ind.) and Benjamin A. Gilman (R-N.Y.), are threatening to reopen the controversy by insisting on new funding for police requests they said were sacrificed during the negotiations. In a letter to Hastert, they have asked for the additional funding as part of a foreign assistance spending bill for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.</P>

<P>

<P>Burton, chairman of the Government Reform Committee, and Gilman, chairman of the International Relations Committee, have long championed the work of the Colombian police against drug producers and traffickers--including widespread aerial fumigation of drug crops--and argued that they should be in the forefront of the U.S. effort in Colombia. Two years ago, they provided funds to purchase six UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters for the police, over administration objections.</P>

<P>

<P>In proposing an expanded effort in Colombia last spring, the administration insisted on the importance of developing a new, anti-drug role for the Colombian military. Since much of the drug cultivation territory there is under the control of guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary groups, eradication efforts were of little long-term value unless backed by armed force that could permanently secure the territory.</P>

<P>

<P>In a letter to Hastert before the August recess, Burton and Gilman praised the police for their "clean human rights record" and "proven track record fighting drugs at the source" and noted they "have been the favored recipient of Congressional assistance."</P>

<P>

<P>The funding they are seeking includes $39 million for three Buffalo transport and supply aircraft with tail ramps, $15 million for an additional Black Hawk utility helicopter, $25 million for a year's supply of .50-caliber ammunition and $5 million for Schweizer SA2-37A/38 intelligence aircraft for counter-narcotics operations. Their request also asks for $10 million for antimissile kits, floor armoring and other defensive weapons for new and existing police Black Hawks.</P>

<P>

<P>The administration has requested a total of $312 million for worldwide anti-narcotics activity in the coming year. Clinton is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders early next week in search of a final compromise on spending and the request for additional aid to Colombia could come up then, according to a House Appropriations Committee aide.</P>
