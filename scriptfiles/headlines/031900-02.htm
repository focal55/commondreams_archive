<p>OTAY MESA, Calif. -- Behind 

five barbed-wire fences, four identification checkpoints, two guard towers and one 50,000-volt electric fence 

sits one of the few remaining solutions to America's tightest labor 

market in 30 years.



<p> Every weekday, some 100 prisoners report for work at one of three 

private companies here at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, a series of  squat buildings hidden 

among the hills at the base of Otay 

Mountain, just five miles from the 

Mexican border. The men, convicted murderers and robbers among 

them, stitch T-shirts, recycle tires 

and make beer and wine vats. 



<p> Other than the workers' uniformly blue outfits and the armed guards 

who occasionally patrol the factory 

floors, the workplace looks quite 

normal. A radio plays the Beatles' 

"Here Comes the Sun" and Queen's 

"We Will Rock You." Hunched over 

sewing machines or welding together stainless steel vats, the men earn 

about $5.75 an hour, the California 

minimum wage. The products end 

up attached to trendy clothing labels 

like No Fear and in upscale pubs.



<p>    With  unemployment  low and a 

record number of Americans  behind 

bars, prison labor is coming to mean 

much more than painting license 

plates. As inmates undertake everything from telemarketing to the 

manufacturing of computer circuit 

boards and furniture, the change 

has caused a growing debate, playing out in state legislatures and in 

two bills before Congress, over the 

role  the nation's two million prisoners should play in its economy.



<p> Across the country, more than 

80,000 inmates now hold traditional 

jobs,  working for governments or 

private companies and earning 25 

cents to $7 an hour. The private 

sector programs, which exist in 36 

states and employ 3,500, have doubled in size since 1995 after years of 

almost no growth. And the federal 

program that employs 21,000 inmates, up 14 percent in the last two 

years, and that has $600 million in 

annual sales, is seeking to expand.



<p> Both supporters and opponents 

agree the debate is at a critical juncture because employment in prisons 

could spread quickly in the coming 

years. On virtually every other question, however -- whether prison labor helps inmates or is cruel to them, 

whether it is an economic benefit or 

a force holding down wages -- the 

two sides differ vehemently.



<p>  Supporters of the employment of 

inmates include law enforcement officials who view the programs as a 

way to reform convicts and business 

groups who see  inexpensive labor. 

Many prisoners want to work,  the 

backers say, and they point to research showing that inmates who 

work are less likely to commit 

crimes when they are released.



<p>  "It's a problem for corrections officers to have prisoners without anything constructive to do," said Edwin 

Meese III, the former United States 

attorney general, who lobbies for expanded inmate labor as chairman of 

the Enterprise Prison Institute, a 

Bethesda, Md., research group financed  by state grants, research 

centers and private companies.



<p> In addition, supporters say, prisoners offer the ultimate in a flexible 

and dependable work force. "If I lay 

them off for a week," said Pierre 

Sleiman, the owner of the T-shirt 

company at Donovan, referring to 

his workers, "I don't have to worry 

about someone else coming and saying, 'Come work for me.' "



<p> To opponents, inmate labor is both 

a potential human rights abuse and a 

threat to workers outside  prison 

walls. Inmates have no bargaining 

power and are easily exploited, the 

critics say. In one California lawsuit, 

for example, two prisoners have 

sued  both their employer and the 

prison, saying they were put in solitary confinement after complaining 

about working conditions.



<p> The opponents also say the programs have stolen jobs from outside 

workers and hold down wages for 

other workers. Inmate labor, said 

Gordon Lafer, a political science professor at the University of Oregon, 

"is a decent-sized problem that is 

poised to explode."



<p> Most of the companies now  in the 

program are small.   

<p> Earlier in the 

1990's, big companies like AT&T and 

Microsoft hired inmates, but most 

backed away after the arrangements 

were exposed. Some big companies, 

like the retailer Target, still use suppliers that employ prisoners.



<p> Prison labor in the United States 

has its roots in the 1800's, when inmates worked for private companies 

without pay. After hundreds died on 

the job because of hazardous conditions, unions and prison reformers 

demanded a halt the practice.



<p> In 1934, however, federal prison 

officials concerned about growing 

unrest in  prisons lobbied  to create a 

work program. Companies got involved again in 1979, when Congress 

passed a law allowing them to hire 

prisoners in some circumstances.



<p> For most of the last two decades, 

the programs remained tiny.   But  the 

tough drug and sentencing laws of 

the 1980's helped increase the  number of Americans behind bars by 80 

percent, to two million, in a decade. 

The unemployment rate, meanwhile, 

was falling. "Now the economy is 

very good, and businesses are looking to the prison system for labor," 

said Noreen Blonien, an assistant 

director of the California Department of Corrections.



<p> Officials at the federal Bureau of 

Prisons hope the same logic will enable them to expand their program, 

the nation's largest, to include private sector jobs like those at Donovan. Representative Bill McCollum, 

a Florida Republican,  has offered a 

bill that would allow the bureau to do 

so, as long as the company hiring 

inmates could show it was not moving existing  jobs behind bars. The 

jobs would also pay more than the 21 

cents to $1.15 an hour that the inmates now in the program earn.



<p> A competing bill, meanwhile, from 

Representative Pete Hoekstra, a 

Michigan Republican,  could  cause 

the federal program to scale back by 

forcing it to compete with private 

companies for the government contracts it now fills. 



<p> "What you end up with, in certain 

cases, is the federal government getting inferior products at higher 

prices," said Mr. Hoekstra,  who has 

the support of both the United States 

Chamber of Commerce and the 

A.F.L.-C.I.O. 



<p> In recent weeks, the lawmakers' 

aides have discussed a combined bill 

that would both force state-run prison operations to compete with private enterprises and allow companies to hire federal inmates. "We're 

very close to a compromise," Mr. 

McCollum said. If they cannot reach 

one, the lawmakers say they will 

offer their bills separately.



<p> Away from Washington, the debate over inmates working for private companies is less hypothetical. 



<p> One business employing inmates is 

C.M.T. Blues, the T-shirt company 

here in the country's southwesternmost corner, and it has been home to 

virtually every argument on both 

sides of the issue.



<p> Five years ago, in nearby Chula 

Vista, Mr. Sleiman was running a 

business that imported clothing, and 

he was considering opening his own 

operation. He was looking to Honduras, he said, where workers earn 

about $1.75 an hour. "In our industry, 

all of the business is going offshore," 

Mr. Sleiman said.   Then he heard 

about California's prison work program. Under it, Mr. Sleiman would 

have to pay the inmates $5.75 an 

hour,  but he could make up some of 

the expense elsewhere.



<p> For C.M.T.'s factory, Mr. Sleiman 

pays less than a fifth of what he 

would elsewhere in rent and electricity.   He also receives a 25 percent 

discount on  workers' compensation 

insurance and  tax credits.   

<p> 



<p> But he soon found out that setting 

up shop in a prison is no panacea. 

Delivery and pickup times must be 

scheduled precisely. Mr. Sleiman 

also trained many of the workers 

from scratch, he said. Then he had to 

convince them to work together. 



<p> "On paper, it looked very good," 

Mr. Sleiman said. In reality, he added, "it has been a tough road."



<p> It has been even tougher for the 

inmates, according to a lawsuit filed 

last summer by two former Donovan 

prisoners. To work at C.M.T., inmates had to go through a 60-day 

"training period" for which they 

were not paid, according to the suit. 

It also says workers were given unrealistic production quotas and were 

told to replace "Made in Honduras" 

labels on some fabric with 'Made in 

the U.S.A." tags. 



<p> After the inmates, Charles Ervin 

and Shearwood Fleming, got in touch 

with a local television show and it 

broadcast their charges, they were 

fired, put in solitary confinement for 

more than 45 days and eventually 

transferred to another prison.



<p> Mr. Sleiman said the length of 

training programs varies and that 

the accusations about quotas and the 

labels were untrue. A California Department of Corrections investigation into the label-switching charge 

was inconclusive, a state spokeswoman said. Prisoners understood 

the conditions of the training program when they applied to work at 

C.M.T., she added.



<p> Whatever the problems, though, 

California prison officials said the 

private sector jobs remain far more 

popular among inmates than washing sheets or even building government furniture. At most state prisons 

where private companies operate, 

there are waiting lists to be hired. 



<p> "When we step through the gates 

and into the shop," said Allen W. 

Smith, 45, a T-shirt worker who is 

serving a 13-year sentence for robbery, "this is a company. This isn't 

prison." Guards still keep watch, but 

the atmosphere differs greatly from 

prison yards, the inmates said.



<p> The private sector jobs also pay at 

least the minimum wage, although 

prisoners in most states keep only a 

fraction of their pay.   

<p>



<p> Compared with other jobs at Donovan, "it's great," said Frank W. 

Owen, 39, who was convicted of a 

1982 murder  and has worked for 

C.M.T. for four years. "I've been able 

to save some money."  



<p> Mr. Owen also said he hoped his 

record at C.M.T. would help him earn 

parole.



<p> Mr. Sleiman, meanwhile, said 

C.M.T. was doing better now that he 

had learned how to operate in a prison. Over the 18 months, he added, he 

plans to triple his work force to 200.
