</font>Nader 

                  has gained a national following from many who haven't voted 

                  before and from disenchanted Democrats. In Friday's speech, 

                  he called for universal health care, a living wage, better labor 

                  laws, cutting corporate welfare, public financing of political 

                  campaigns and cutting military spending.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nader 

                  spent much of the speech slamming Vice President Al Gore's coziness 

                  with big business and conservatism, citing Gore's support for 

                  free trade, welfare reform and a bigger military.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Every 

                  time I hear Al Gore say, 'I'm going to fight for you against 

                  big corporations, big insurance and big oil,' I say, where were 

                  you the last eight years?" he said.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Nader's 

                  impact in the campaign is evident, though possibly not to his 

                  own advantage, as the Rev. Jesse Jackson and comedian Al Franken 

                  said earlier Friday at the IMU. Both said a vote for Nader will 

                  only help Republican candidate George W. Bush.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These 

                  frightened progressives say I'm undermining my own legacy of 

                  reform," Nader said. "What they don't know is that the Democratic 

                  Party has already done it."</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 

                  ignoring Nader for most of the year, the attacks from Gore's 

                  campaign are welcomed by Nader supporters, said UI junior Peter 

                  Reed.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"They're 

                  very scared of us, and they should be," he said.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reed 

                  said he realizes Nader could tilt the race in Bush's favor but 

                  said Nader's campaign is looking at building a long-term political 

                  movement.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm 

                  afraid of Bush, but I'm afraid of Gore, too," he said. "I originally 

                  was going to vote for Socialist Party candidate David McReynolds. 

                  But I decided to compromise and vote for Nader. But there is 

                  a line I will have to draw, and I won't compromise and vote 

                  for Gore."</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 

                  Nader receives 2 percent of the vote in Iowa this year, the 

                  Green Party will have official party status.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Iowa 

                  City resident Phil Ecklund said he could no longer vote for 

                  a lesser of two evils.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The 

                  Republicans and Democrats are too much alike and don't represent 

                  the common man," he said. "My wife countered my vote and voted 

                  for Gore because she said I'm wasting my vote. Realistically, 

                  he hasn't got a ghost of a chance, but I can't see voting for 

                  Gore."</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cedar 

                  Rapids resident Susan Norman said she felt the same way.</font></p>

<p align="left">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I've 

                  been a lifelong Democrat," she said. "This is the first time 

                  I've voted outside of the Democratic Party. It's because Ralph 

                  Nader is a man of his word. The other two guys I don't trust."
