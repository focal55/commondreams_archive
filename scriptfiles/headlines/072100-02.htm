UNITED NATIONS - In an attempt to save trade

liberalization from a backlash, the United Nations announced a

new business partnership to promote decent labor, human rights

and environmental standards abroad.

<p>But no sooner was the list released of the first batch of 44

corporations on Thursday than some advocacy groups, such as

Greenpeace International, <a href="../news2000/0720-09.htm">wrote a letter</a> saying a the United

Nations should have instituted a tighter legal framework to

oversee practices by multinational corporations.

<p>The companies include Nike Inc., which in 1997 and 1998 was

harshly criticized for having its sporting goods made in Asian

sweatshops as well as Royal Dutch/Shell, which came under fire

for practices in Nigeria. Both have sought to improve their

image and practices.

<p>Called the ``Global Compact'' the first meeting of business

representatives, labor unions and human rights and conservation

groups meet next Wednesday with Secretary-General Kofi Annan to

say what they have done and what they intend to do to promote

labor, human rights and environmental standards.

<p>Other corporations include DaimlerChrysler AG, Unilever Plc,

Deutsche Bank AG, BP Amoco Plc, Novartis AG, LM Ericsson as well

as companies in India, Pakistan, Norway, Mexico, South Africa,

Denmark, Thailand and Peru.

<p>The concept was first floated in a January 1999 speech by

Annan at the World Economic Forum, a weeklong annual meeting of

elite business figures at Davos in the Swiss Alps.

<p>Annan warned that market expansion and protection of private

property was moving far faster than rules on social and

environmental rights. This situation would trigger a backlash

and lead to protectionism.

<p>But after protests erupted on precisely these issues, Annan

argued against any social rules in the World Trade Organization,

which would be detrimental to developing nations, and instead

offered one-stop shopping at the United Nations on international

standards for multinational corporations.

<p>Specifically, Annan called for honoring the right to

collective bargaining and making sure hiring and firing policies

did not discriminate on grounds of race, creed, gender or ethnic

origins. He said firms should make sure underage children were

not employed and use environmentally safe technology.

<p>Asked whether the United Nations was giving cover to

corporations that needed to improve their image, John Ruggie, an

adviser to Annan, told a Thursday news conference there was no

material gain in this for any company.

<p>Ruggie said each company was going to post its statements

and practices on a U.N. Web site (<a href="http://www.unglobalcompact.org">http://www.unglobalcompact.org</a>)

where they could be disputed by labor unions, environmental and

human rights organizations included in the compact.

<p>``This transparency this creates is a truly powerful force

and the companies are all well aware of that fact and have taken

it into consideration,'' he said.

<p>``I would be very surprised if one of these companies

attempted to do a snow job on us on this web site. The cost

would be enormous and I think they are well aware of this.''

<p>In addition to issuing statements on what they are doing to

promote good business practices, the companies are encouraged to

initiate or join projects in various nations.

<p>Ruggie gave the example of Ericsson, the Swedish

telecommunications company, which has offered uninterrupted

communications equipment within 24 hours to areas hit by natural

disasters.
