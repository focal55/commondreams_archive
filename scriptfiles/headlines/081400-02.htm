American and British aircraft renewed their bombing of Iraq at the weekend after a six-week lull - killing two people and hitting a railway station and food distribution centre, according to Baghdad.

<P>The strikes came amid verbal attacks by Iraq on what it called "the hireling rulers in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait".

<P>They also followed a double public relations coup in which Saddam Hussein last week welcomed the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez - the first democratically elected head of state to visit Baghdad since the 1991 war - and the president of Indonesia announced that he will shortly travel to Iraq.

</TABLE></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>The first allied raid, on Friday night, struck Samawa, 170 miles south of Baghdad. Iraq said a warehouse containing food and other material imported under the UN's oil-for-food programme was hit. Two people died, 19 were injured and six houses badly damaged, it said.

<P>A second raid on Saturday night hit the railway station in Samawa, causing some injuries, the official Iraqi news agency said.

<P>But the US insisted that allied aircraft had targeted Iraqi command posts and surface-to-air missile sites after Iraq opened fire on planes patrolling the southern no-fly zone.

<P>The Pentagon spokesman Rick Thomas said: "We seek to avoid injuries to civilians and damage to civilian facilities."  

<P>Allied planes have frequently bombed targets in the no-fly zones since Baghdad stepped up its defiance of the western-imposed restrictions in December 1998. Iraq says around 300 civilians have been killed and 900 wounded in these attacks.

<P>America disputes these figures and accuses President Saddam of deliberately placing military sites close to civilian areas.

<P>In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said yesterday that strikes on Iraq were only carried out "in response to direct threats to our aircraft".

<P>But the Iraqi news agency described the strikes as a response to a speech last week in which President Saddam said his Gulf neighbours had "sold their souls" to the US and Israel.

<P>In a protest letter to the UN, the foreign minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf accused the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments of "providing logistical support for the American and British forces, making them contributing partners in the aggression".

<P>Baghdad turned up the rhetoric against its Gulf neighbours after the 10th anniversary of the invasion of Kuwait on August 2. Kuwait responded by putting its armed forces on alert.

<P>Meanwhile, President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia said at the weekend that he would meet President Saddam in the coming weeks. The US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, condemned the decision. But Mr Wahid said: "We are not a lackey of the US. We are free to go anywhere."
