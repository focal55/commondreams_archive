PUEBLO RICO, Colombia - With this mountain village mourning the death of six schoolchildren, President Andres Pastrana ordered an investigation yesterday after an eyewitness said Army troops opened fire on them without provocation.

<P>

<P>The Army maintained  yesterday that the children became caught in combat between leftist rebels and Colombian troops.

<P>

<P>''The Army had no intention to shoot any children,'' said General Jorge Mora, the Army chief.

The shootings Tuesday, in which four children also were wounded,  provoked outrage.  They also undermined the Colombian Army at a time when the United States is helping train and arm the military as part of a $1.3 billion counternarcotics effort in the South American country.

<P>

<P>The US State Department said  yesterday it was appalled by the children's deaths. In Washington, spokesman Philip Reeker called ''on all sides of the conflict to obey international humanitarian law.''

<P>

<P>Amid suspicions that the Army is mounting a coverup, Pastrana vowed to uncover the truth.

<P>

<P>''In the memory of these little ones we need to make sure we know what happened,'' Pastrana, speaking from the capital, Bogota, said in a national radio address. ''It's urgent we arrive at the truth now.''

<P>

<P>A man who said he witnessed the shootings rebutted the Army's contention that the children were killed in cross-fire between government troops and rebels. Hernando Higuita, who was helping his wife, a teacher, lead the children on an outing when the soldiers opened fire, said there were no rebels in the area at the time.

<P>

<P>Yesterday, the bodies of three of the children lay in their families' homes. Three others were in a local chapel. The six were to be buried later in the day.

<P>

<P>Residents of Pueblo Rico, located in a mountainous area,  did not conceal their grief, or their anger at government troops.

<P>

<P>''Where do they get their training?'' shouted Miriam Lopez, whose 12-year-old son David was shot and killed. ''At the zoo?''

<P>

<P>She  said she wanted the government to acknowledge its role in the killings. 

<P>

<P>Her daughter Viviana, 11, survived the shooting. The girl said she and her schoolmates were walking on a path when gunfire erupted.

<P>

<P>She said she did not know who was doing the shooting.

<P>

<P>After the gunfire stopped, government troops emerged from the bushes, she recalled. One took a look at the dead and wounded children and began weeping, she said.

<P>

<P>''What a mistake,'' the soldier  said, according to Viviana.

<P>

<P>''How could they think we were rebels?'' she asked.

<P>

<P>Her brother's body lay in a white coffin in his grandmother's home. The streets of this village were virtually empty as residents tried to console the grieving families.

<P>

<P>Army General Eduardo Herrera said the children were shot after they broke away from the main group of students and ran toward a group of 11 guerrillas of Colombia's second-largest rebel group, the National Liberation Army.

<P>

<P>''Those that were shot were separate from the group,'' he said. Herrera did not acknowledge or deny that the children may have been shot by his troops, but he said the troops would not have opened fire if there had not been rebels in the area.

<P>

<P>''Believe me, the soldiers are able to distinguish a line of 50 children and were not going to fire on them,'' Herrera said.

<P>

<P>Mora added that guerrillas fleeing from the Army had ''mixed in with the children'' in order to protect themselves.

<P>

<P>But Higuita, the eyewitness, said the children were looking for a place to have a picnic when the shooting started.

<P>

<P>''There were no guerrillas in the zone;  there was no fighting. That's totally false,'' Higuita said.
