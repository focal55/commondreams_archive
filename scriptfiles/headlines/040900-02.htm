The world's endangered whales face the biggest threat to their future since the moratorium on whaling was imposed more than a decade ago. Environmental groups are warning that industrial-scale commercial whaling is set to be reintroduced by the back door at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)   being attended by 150 nations in Nairobi this week. 

<P>The warning comes amid international concern that whaling nations have been buying the support of developing nations with aid packages, and trading votes with African countries which want to restart international trade in ivory.  

<P>Trade in the meat of any of the great whales is illegal, but Norway and Japan have put down resolutions at this week's meeting to allow trade in the meat of minke whales and grey whales. The CITES meeting - the first for three years - is billed as one of the most important for endangered animals for decades. South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana want to use the convention to restart international trade in ivory. Cuba is making a bid to restart trade in hawksbill turtles.

<P>Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but whaling has continued for 'scientific purposes'. Last week the Japanese whaling fleet returned from Antarctic waters with a catch of 439 minke whales, up from 389 last year.

<P>This meat can be sold only on local markets. But Japan and Norway now want to open up the lucrative international trade in whale products. Whale sushi is one of the most expensive delicacies in Japanese restaurants, with the meat selling wholesale for several hundred dollars a kilo. Norwegians eat whale steak, and also make whale sausages. However, they do not eat the blubber, but have been storing it in vast warehouses until they can legally export it to Japan.

<P>Japan and Norway put down a similar resolution at the last convention three years ago, and fell only nine votes short of victory. Since   then they have both invested many millions of pounds in intensive lobbying of poorer nations to win their support.  

<P>Chris Stroud, chief executive of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, said: 'This is the most crucial decision since the moratorium on whaling was put in place. It would pre-empt a very rapid return to industrial-scale whaling. The vote is really close - it could go either way'.  

<P>Greenpeace's whale campaigner, Richard Page, said: 'This is the most important political meeting for whales for many, many years. It's absolutely crucial.'  

<P>Norway and Japan argue that there is no scientific reason to continue the ban on minke and the grey whales, since their populations have returned to healthy levels. There are now thought to be about 900,000 minke whales, roughly the same level as before whaling began, and the total grey whale population is steady at around 20,000 - although the population of Asian grey whales has dwindled to around 100.  

<P>However, conservationists argue that restarting the legal trade in whale products gives a huge incentive to increase the scale of 'scientific whaling' and will encourage illegal poaching.  

<P>During the ban there have been repeated incidents of illegal smuggling of whale meat. In 1996 six tonnes of minke whale was discovered being exported to Japan disguised as prawns. Two years ago whale sausages were on open sale at Oslo airport, until the Norwegian government was pressured into clamping down on it.  

<P>DNA tests on meat in Tokyo markets have shown that some of it comes from severely endangered species, such as the Mexican humpback. Many species of the great whales are still on the verge of extinction. The population of blue whales in the Southern hemisphere has   fallen from 220,000 to just 460, while the population of the right whale has dropped from about 100,000 to 7,000.  

<P>Conservationists argue that poachers of endangered species could use the legal international trade as cover. 'If there is legal trade, it makes illegal trade so much easier,' said Page. After the ban on trade in ivory was temporarily lifted three years ago there was a jump in the amount of illegal poaching.  

<P>There is also concern that an international trade in whale meat will undermine the International Whaling Commission's ban on commercial whaling. Stroud said: 'Norway and Japan are trying to restart commercial whaling through the back-door.'  

<P>The Japanese and Norwegian resolutions will be opposed by most developed nations, including the UK. Environment Minister Mi-chael Meacher told  The Observer: 'We're completely opposed to a resumption of whaling. There is no immediate risk of extinction, but if there is a resumption of commercial whaling, it could have a dramatic impact on numbers.'  

<P>However, since their defeat three years ago, both whaling countries have been involved in intense lobbying of developing nations to win their support. Japan has been openly offering aid to countries in Africa and the Caribbean in return for their vote on whaling issues.  

<P>The whaling nations have also been active in cultivating a common cause with the African nations that want to restart the international ivory trade.  

<P>Norway's whaling commissioner, Odd Gunnar Skagestad, told a Norwegian newspaper last week: 'We support the African countries that want to downlist the elephant on scientific grounds. We expect them to support our proposal as well.'
