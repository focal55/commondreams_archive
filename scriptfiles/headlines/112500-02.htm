PARIS - A clutch of anti-globalisation organisations ranging from trade union federations to groups in favour of the Tobin tax on movements of capital are gearing up for a series of protests at next month's European Union summit at Nice, in the south of France. 

<p>The Brussels-based Confederation Europeenne des Syndicats (CES) is expecting 60,000 supporters to turn out to demonstrate at the meeting of EU heads of state and government that will wind up the six-month French presidency. </p>

<p>Bernard Cassen, president of ATTAC (Association pour la taxation des transactions financieres pour l'aide aux citoyens, known as the Tobin tax), said 100,000 protestors -- travelling from all over Europe -- would be "a reasonable objective." </p>

<p>ATTAC, a broadly-based civic group militating for the introduction of a 0.05 percent "Tobin tax" on cross-border financial transactions, named after the US Nobel prize-winning economist James Tobin, is likely to feature prominently at the December 7-8 summit, alongside the 40,000-strong French Peasants Confederation, of which the anti-McDonald's campaigner Jose Bove is a leading member. </p>

<p>Bove, a leading figure in the protests that disrupted last year's World Trade Organisation (WTO) summit in Seattle, is planning to travel to Nice to attend the protests. </p>

<p>The various anti-globalisation groups are organising a massive protest against unemployment and social exclusion, beginning with a series of events throughout France beginning on December 2 and building up during the week.</p>

<p>The umbrella organisation "Article premier", comprising groups such as Amnesty International, Medecins du monde (Doctors of the world) and Action contre la Faim (Action against Hunger) is organising a series of debates in Nice on December 6 focusing on "economic, cultural and social rights." </p>

<p>Protests are being organised in several European cities on the same day.</p>

<p>However there are some differences of objective among the parties involved, with groups such as ATTAC and the Peasants Confederation opposing the European Charter of Fundamental Rights due to be officialised at the Nice summit while the CES favours the charter. </p>

<p>Cassen said Thursday that "the counter-summit at Nice appears to mark an important stage in the history of European construction" for three reasons. </p>

<p>Firstly, he said, "more and more citizens and organisations now realise that when we speak of Europe, it's not about an abstraction but about our daily lives." </p>

<p>Secondly, they realise "that the European Commission shares the same logic as multilateral organisations such as the WTO, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund." </p>

<p>And finally, "we can no longer say 'it's Brussels' fault' as our ministers often say. It's the ministers in Brussels who make the decisions. ... So it's normal for discontented citizens to turn to the real decision-makers, the 15 member countries meeting at the European level." </p>

<p>The various groups who will be at Nice are also opposed to a measure introducing qualified majority voting instead of the unanimity rule in areas relating to services and intellectual property rights. </p>

<p>ATTAC believes the reform would "deny individual governments -- and thus the citizens who can bring pressure to bear on them -- any means of blocking the introduction of certain ultra-free market initiatives by (European foreign trade commissioner) Pascal Lamy."</p>
