<p>A new analysis by government scientists indicates Earth's 

climate is warming at an unprecedented rate, suggesting that the future 

impact of global warming may be more severe and sudden than predicted.	 

</P>

<P>  Such a steep warming rate was not expected to occur until well into the 

21st century, said Tom Karl, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 

Administration climatologist who led the study. The trend probably would 

mean a continuation of the recent three-year string of steamy summers and 

mild winters seen by much of the nation, and perhaps increased flooding of 

low-lying areas.	 

</P>

<P>  ``The next few years are going to be very interesting,'' Karl said. ``It 

could be the beginning of a new increase in temperatures.''	 

</P>

<P>  Historical and geological records show that Earth warms and cools in fits 

and starts, not at a constant rate. During the 1900s, most warming occurred 

between 1910 and 1940 and then after 1970. On average, though, warming 

throughout the century occurred at a rate of just over 1 degree per century.	 

</P>

<P>  In contrast, warming since 1976 occurred at a rate of nearly 4 degrees 

per century. The increase in warming, Karl said, could be evidence for a 

``change point'' -- a period when Earth's climate begins warming at a faster 

rate.	 

</P>

<P>  The analysis, which will be published in the March 1 issue of the journal 

Geophysical Research Letters, already is generating much interest -- and 

some disagreement -- among climatologists.	 

</P>

<P>  The current debate is not over whether the climate is warming. Most 

scientists now agree that Earth has warmed significantly since the 1880s, 

when temperatures were first routinely recorded.	 

</P>

<P>  Earlier this year, a blue-ribbon panel of climate experts commissioned by 

the National Academy of Sciences quashed most lingering doubts by calling 

global warming over the past 100 years ``undoubtedly real.''	 

</P>

<P>  Questions now center over how quickly Earth is warming, what the effects 

of that warming may be and whether the warming is caused largely by human or 

natural causes. The answers are crucial, scientists said, for developing 

effective environmental policies.	 

</P>

<P>  Global warming began receiving renewed attention in 1997, which was the 

hottest year on record -- until 1998.	 

</P>

<P>  ``In 1998, each month we were breaking the previous year's all-time 

global high temperature record,'' Karl said.	 

</P>

<P>  The intense two-year string of warm months prompted Karl and colleagues 

Richard Knight and Bruce Baker to analyze Earth's warming rate.	 

</P>

<P>  The hot spell continued into 1999, the fifth-warmest year on record 

despite the occurrence of a cooling La Nina event.	 

</P>

<P>  Karl cautioned that he cannot be certain that the extremely warm years of 

1997, 1998 and 1999 are evidence of an increased warming trend. But a 

statistical analysis suggests there is only a 5 percent chance that such 

temperatures would not be part of a warming trend, he said.	 

</P>

<P>  Tom Wigley, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric 

Research in Boulder, Colo., said he found the new analysis interesting, but 

questioned whether recent warm years should be attributed to a large shift 

in human-induced global warming. The period between May 1997 and August 

1998, he noted, included El Nino events known to cause warming.	 

</P>

<P>  ``Yes, those months were unusual, but they weren't unusual due to human 

influences,'' he said.	 

</P>

<P>  Karl disagreed, saying that temperatures were far higher than could be 

explained by an El Nino event. And 1999, he said, was the fifth-hottest year 

on record despite being a cool La Nina year.	 

</P>

<P>  Effects of global warming -- from a longer growing season in Alaska to 

thinning of Arctic sea ice and the flooding of some low-lying islands -- 

have already occurred, said Henry Pollack, a University of Michigan 

geologist.	 

</P>

<P>  ``Even if we don't understand the details of what's causing it,'' he 

said, ``we still have to deal with the consequences.''
