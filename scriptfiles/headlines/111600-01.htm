THE HAGUE  - The nuclear power industry's hopes for

a major new role in combating global warming were shaken Tuesday

by the distribution of comments by Vice President Al Gore that he

opposed such a move.

<p>In a letter dated Nov. 3 Gore, who is still awaiting the

result of the presidential election that could put him in the

White House, said nuclear should not be used as a means of

cutting ``greenhouse gases.''

<p>``I have disagreed with those who would classify nuclear

energy as clean or renewable,'' Gore said in a letter to Harvey

Wasserman of the Ohio-based Nuclear Information and Resources

Center.

<p>Gore said proposed U.S. legislation on restructuring the

electricity sector excluded nuclear and large scale hydro

electricity. ``It is my view that climate change policies should

do the same,'' he added.

<p>The comments will be warmly welcomed by environmentalists who

fear world governments meeting at a ``climate summit'' during the

next two weeks might allow nuclear power to be promoted in

developing countries as a way of combating global warming,

because it does not emit the carbon dioxide which comes from

fossil fuels.

<p>Canada and Japan are pushing for such a policy.

<p>The leader of the U.S. delegation at the talks, David

Sandalow, told a news briefing: ``The United States is open to

discussion on this issue.

<p>``We have expressed concerns. We have noted the challenges of

cost, public acceptance, non-proliferation, waste and safety,'' he

said.

<p>Some 180 countries are meeting in The Hague to finalize the

rules on implementing a 1997 United Nations agreement on cutting

six gases believed to contribute to global warming.
