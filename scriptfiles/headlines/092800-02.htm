<p>&nbsp;PRAGUE - As the Czech capital began to deal with the

aftermath of anti-globalisation protests that turned violent, a

public forum critical of IMF and World Bank policies convened in a

church on Wednesday to discuss what had been achieved.  

<P>

Over the course of the four-day 'A Different Message' forum,

sessions were held on debt relief and poverty reduction, the

relationship between trade and development policy, and the social

and environmental aspects of these efforts in the developing world

and the 'transition' economies of eastern Europe.

</TABLE></font>But the violent clashes between radical groups and Czech police

forces that broke out at the official opening of the IMF

(International Monetary Fund) and World Bank annual meetings on

Tuesday - and the presence of representatives from the

international financial institutions p gave the final session a

more charged atmosphere.  

<P>

The sponsors of the 'A Different Message' forum - international

environmental and debt relief campaigners, CEE Bankwatch, Jubilee

2000 and Friends of the Earth - denounced the violence, saying

that such actions ''undermine the efforts to advocate positive

changes within these institutions'', which they say was the

purpose of both the public forum and the peaceful demonstrations

in which an estimated 10,000 people participated.  

<P>

The organisations say they are also looking for constructive

dialogue with the institutions, and IMF and World Bank

representatives joined in Wednesday's panel discussion, which was

moderated by Jessica Woodruffe of the London-based World

Development Movement, co-author of a new report on organised

resistance in the developing world to IMF policies.  

<P>

On the panel were representatives of the forum's organisers -

Andrea Durbin (Friends of the Earth USA), Juergen Kaiser (Jubilee

200, Germany), Tomasz Terlecki (CEE Bankwatch, Poland) and Dennis

Brutus (Jubilee South, South Africa) - alongside Mats Karlsson

(World Bank vice president for external affairs) and Masood Ahmed

(deputy director of the IMF's policy, development and review

department).  

<P>

Under discussion was the legacy of the two institutions, the need

for reform to focus on development that was socially and

environmentally sustainable, and the status of the movement to

cancel the debt of the world's poorest countries, and the effort

to achieve a meaningful dialogue between the institutions and

civil society.  

<P>

Of specific interest to the forum participants was whether the new

Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) required by the Fund and

the Bank of governments wishing to qualify for the ''enhanced''

Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiatives marked a real

change from the Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs), widely

considered a failure by bankers and protesters alike.  

<P>

Brutus, a dissident under South Africa's apartheid regime, whose

comments throughout the session took on a strong tone of moral

condemnation of the institutions, said it was clear to him the

bankers would never really listen or understand the voices of

civil society.  

<P>

''A new initiative is being prepared p the PRSPs. At Jubilee South

we regret this new strategy, which is simply SAPs under another

name,'' he said. ''There is one difference: we (the non-

governmental organisations) are being asked to assist in the

exploitation of the poor.''  

<P>

He portrayed their efforts to hold dialogue as a public relations

exercise and announced he would never again participate in a panel

discussion alongside representatives of the IMF and World Bank.  

<P>

The largest umbrella group of protesters - the Prague-based

Initiative Against the Global Economy (INPEG) which this week

convened its own ''Counter Summit'' p took a similar stand, having

refused to meet with the bankers.  

<P>

Karlsson said they had declined his offer to speak in that format,

but if the protesters would really listen, they would find that

they and the international financial institutions actually shared

a common goal - to alleviate poverty.  

<P>

In recent years the IMF and World Bank have been reaching out to

formally engage civil society, in an effort to become more

transparent, democratic and accountable p something Karlsson gave

repeated examples of Wednesday in defending what he and Ahmed

portrayed as a new era for the institutions.  

<P>

But that effort has been greeted with much scepticism by many

civil society actors, who say that consultation with non-

governmental organisations (NGOs) comes after the agenda has

already been decided.  

<P>

Durbin, who said she had had constructive dialogue with World Bank

officials this week, nonetheless objected to attempts by the Bank,

in the wake of the street protests that had turned violent, to

distinguish between ''constructive and unconstructive'' NGOs.  

<P>

She said this was ''unfair'' and that the heads of the World Bank

and IMF had taken the criticisms of the NGOs and protesters ''too

personally''. The institutions are bigger than the individuals who

now head it, she said, and until they realise that, they will

never understand what civil society is asking is for.  

<P>

Namely, Durbin said, NGOs at a minimum want the institutions'

portfolio to be sustainable, and to carry out social and

environmental impact assessments, so that projects and programmes

do not harm the poor.  

<P>

The concluding session of the public forum, which lasted two

hours, was the first time that most protesters had had a chance to

directly question representatives from the two international

financial institutions.  

<P>

As such, the moderator made a point of giving persons who had not

been accredited to attend the IMF/World Bank meetings most of the

floor time during the question and answer session.  

<P>

Several audience members asked the bankers to explain the

rationale behind the PRSPs and why debt relief seemed to have

stalled; some demanded that the institutions apologise for their

past failures, including lending to undemocratic regimes, and that

they explain why there is a perception that the institutions only

benefit the richest countries and multinational corporations.  

<P>

The CEE Bankwatch Network argued that neo-liberal structural

adjustment programmes of the IMF have failed to foster economic

growth or stem rising levels of poverty and that it has increased

the debt dependency of developing country governments and

prematurely exposed domestic businesses to unfair competition from

multinational enterprises. Women, children and other marginalised

groups have been particularly hurt by these programmes, it said. 

<P>

The Network has called on the IMF to halt the HIPC initiative and

to instead pursue a policy of debt cancellation that benefits the

impoverished, other marginalised groups and the environment in the

short and long terms.  

<P>

Ahmed of the IMF said the PRSPs were ''substantially different''

from past policies, as the measures would be ''explicitly drawn

from a set of priorities set down by countries themselves'' in

conjunction with local partners in civil society and the private

sector.  

<P>

He acknowledged that in some countries the level of debt ''is a

crushing burden - there is no doubt about it'' but that writing

off the debt outright alone would not lift countries out of

poverty. He also said that it was up to the institutions'

shareholders, in particular the G-7 (the world's wealthiest

industrialised countries), to allocate more money to the HIPC

initiative.
