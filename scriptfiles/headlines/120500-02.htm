JOHANNESBURG - More than 100 countries finalising a global convention on toxic chemicals broadly agreed here Tuesday on the need to prohibit the production and use of the so-called "dirty dozen" poisons.

<p>The chemicals have become notorious for lurking in the environment, where they get passed up the food chain to fish, animals and humans.</p>

<p>The session on Tuesday, the second day of a five-day meeting of signatories to the UN's Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) treaty, is considered the most important and was opened with a warning by chairman John Buccini of Canada that it was vital to get to grips with all aspects of the convention.</p>

<p>The Johannesburg meeting is the fifth, and final, round of talks to finalise a legally binding instrument for implementing international action on POPs which can severely harm humans and wildlife.</p>

<p>"There must not be loopholes, we need to make the convention workable," said US delegate Irving Fuller. "This is indeed the essence of the agreement and it is critical we get it right."</p>

<p>Japan led the session, the core of the convention, with a statement, followed by 40 other countries.</p>

<p>The initial 12 POPs -- the dirty dozen -- identified by the treaty are the eight pesticides aldrin, endrin, toxaphene, chloradane, dieldrin, heptachol, mirex and DDT; and the industrial chemicals and unintentional by-products hexachlorobenzene, PCBs, dioxins and furans.</p>

<p>The convention will include mechanisms to ban other dangerous chemicals in future.</p>

<p>Most countries supported the need to "prohibit or take the legal, administrative and other measures necessary to eliminate the production and use of the chemicals."</p>

<p>An introductory phrase that each party would prohibit use of the chemicals "within its capabilites and subject to the availability of technical and financial assistance" was disputed by delegates.</p>

<p>Developed countries like France and the United States argued that delegates should consider removing it since another article dealt with this problem.</p>

<p>But some countries from the developing world like Kenya said it was "necessary for the purposes of implementation."</p>

<p>Greenpeace campaigner Jacob Hartman told AFP: "We respect the need for financial and technical assistance. But if we agree on a funding mechanism and it is covered adequately with due respect to the African position then (this phrase) may not be necessary."</p>

<p>Much discussion on the first day Monday revolved around the need for clear mechanisms for financial and technical assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition to make the POPs convention realisable.</p>

<p>"It may be more constructive to start with a stronger convention which would lead to more meaningful aid," Hartman observed.</p>

<p>The talks have drawn nearly 600 delegates from intergovernmental organisations and non-governmental organisations.</p>
