Despite 

a policy prohibiting military involvement in partisan politics, congressmen and guests at the Republican 

National Convention will have an exclusive viewing of some of the Pentagon's latest hardware, including an 

aircraft that the expected Republican vice-presidential nominee, Dick 

Cheney, tried to kill when he was 

secretary of defense.



<p> Seizing what a spokesman today 

called "a convenient opportunity" to 

display some of its latest equipment, 

the Pentagon asked the armed services to ship -- at taxpayer expense -- 

weapons and other equipment to the 

former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard 

for what amounts to a three-day military trade show, beginning Saturday.



<p> Secretary of Defense William S. 

Cohen, the only Republican in President Clinton's cabinet, approved the 

display after receiving a written request earlier this month from Representative Curt Weldon, a Republican 

from suburban Philadelphia and senior member of the House Armed 

Services Committee.



<p> Mr. Cohen did so, officials said, 

only after the Pentagon was assured 

that the hardware -- and more than 

150 service members accompanying 

it -- would not be used for any political activities.



<p> To emphasize the point, the assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs, John K. Veroneau, sent 

Mr. Weldon a letter outlining certain 

conditions: in short, no photo opportunities.



<p> Even so, the display will be a centerpiece of a series of events organized by Mr. Weldon for about 100 

Republican colleagues and their 

families, who will be staying in old 

Navy billets at the shipyard during 

the convention at the First Union 

Center, less than a mile away. Included in the festivities, closed to the 

public, will be a "block party" fund-raiser by Mr. Weldon on Monday.



<p> "This whole thing is awkward," 

said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, 

a nonprofit group in Washington. 

"All this sexy, multibillion-dollar 

hardware there to impress delegates 

is very smarmy and probably inappropriate. If there isn't a rule 

against this, it seems to me there 

ought to be."



<p> The Pentagon's role has even 

raised hackles among some military 

officers, who complained that, at 

best, it blurs the definition of what 

constitutes political activity. "To say 

this is not a partisan event is borderline absurd," one officer said.



<p> Others at the Pentagon complained that the cost would have to 

come out of their own budgets, at a 

time they face spot shortages of 

money for readiness.



<p> Despite those misgivings, some of 

the services now appear to regard 

the display as a chance to do a little 

lobbying of their own. "There's not a 

lot of enthusiasm for this," another 

official said, "but if they're ordered 

to do it, they want to look good."



<p> Among the aircraft to be displayed 

is the V-22 Osprey, which has 

crashed three times in the past decade. It is a hybrid with rotors that 

swivel so it can take off like a helicopter but cruise like a turboprop 

commuter plane. The Osprey has 

been beset by controversy over cost 

and mission as well as safety, and 

Mr. Cheney  waged a long and unsuccessful battle against it when he was 

in the Bush administration.



<p>  In addition to the V-22, the Marines 

are sending an amphibious vehicle 

and equipment for its chemical- and 

biological-attack response teams. 

The Air Force plans to include an 

unmanned surveillance aircraft 

called the Predator, as well as missiles and bombs and story boards 

promoting its newest fighter, the F-22. 



<p> The Army, not to be outdone, has 

mobilized a virtual armory of equipment, including an Apache attack 

helicopter, its own unmanned aircraft and its troubled theater missile 

defense system.



<p> The Pennsylvania National Guard 

is contributing an M1-A1 tank, an 

armored personnel carrier and two 

more helicopters.



<p> By contrast, the Navy is sending 

only an aging Sea Sprite helicopter 

from a nearby reserve unit, two surveillance vehicles and a small riverine boat. 



<p> Pentagon officials said today that 

it was too soon to put a cost on 

moving all the equipment to Philadelphia, though the Air Force estimated that its share would be at 

least $100,000.



<p> The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, spent much of a news 

conference today defending the display. Mr. Bacon said that the events 

at the shipyard were an opportunity 

to provide what amounted to a briefing to lawmakers -- without mentioning lobbyists and other influential Republicans who might happen 

by -- but maintained that the display 

was not itself partisan. 



<p> "It is something that's contemporaneous with the Republican National Convention," he said. "It's not 

adjacent -- it's not right on the 

grounds where the convention is being held. It's nearby, but not on the 

grounds."



<p> Mr. Bacon also noted that Representative  Robert A. Brady, a Democrat whose district includes the shipyard, supported the request, though 

he did not sign Mr. Weldon's request 

to Secretary Cohen.



<p> Mr. Weldon's spokesman, Pete Peterson, said the congressman saw 

the shipyard, which is in the process 

of being closed and turned over for 

private development, as a convenient and secure location for his colleagues during the convention. Mr. 

Weldon, he said, was also eager to 

promote the shipyard's activities. 



<p> So is Richard A. Goldbach, the 

chairman and chief executive of 

Metro Machines, one of the largest 

military contractors at the shipyard. 

His company is erecting a tent to 

highlight its work, which includes 

ship rebuilding and demolition.



<p>  "It's pure and simple a promotion," Mr. Goldbach said.



<p> So far, there has been no word 

from the Democrats, though Pentagon officials they would certainly 

approve a similar request.
