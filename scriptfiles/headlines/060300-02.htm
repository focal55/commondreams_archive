President Bill Clinton today travels from Germany, a nation openly sceptical about America's plans for a national anti-missile defence shield, to Russia, which is urging the US to develop a joint system or risk a massive nuclear build-up by Moscow.

<p>

Despite his offer to share the new technology with America's allies, Mr Clinton faced stern questions in Berlin yesterday about his proposed National Missile Defence, aimed at protecting the US from missile attacks from rogue states. The issue, which has cast a shadow over the President's visit to Germany, was expected to top the agenda at last night's meeting with Chancellor Gerhard Schr&ouml;der.

<p>

In Lisbon, on the first stage of his week-long European trip, Mr Clinton said he was prepared to make the technology available to "every country that is part of a responsible arms control and non-proliferation regime." But that concession addressed only one of many European objections.

<p>

Not only are Germany and other Nato members in Europe deeply sceptical about the technical feasibility of NMD; what they fear most is that the US plans could unravel key international arms agreements, above all the US-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.

<p>

Yesterday, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who insists a unilateral US scheme would violate the ABM treaty, repeated his call for a shared anti-missile project. "We have such proposals and we intend to discuss them with President Clinton," Mr Putin told an American television network.

<p>

According to reports in Moscow, these could involve shooting enemy missiles on the way up, rather than intercepting them in space with "kill vehicles" fired from launchpads in Alaska, as envisaged by NMD. The Russian scheme would employ bases in Russia, which either borders or is close to Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, the "rogue state" which above all others exercises Washington's imagination.

<p>

In Germany, the prospect of a new nuclear arms race has touched an especially raw nerve. Both Chancellor Schr&ouml;der and his Green Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer cut their teeth in anti-nuclear protests, and Germans are particularly sensitive about living in the crossfire of conflicting nuclear arsenals.

<p>

President Clinton will try to reassure them today in a speech expected to focus on the continuing importance of the transatlantic link.

<p>

There have been difficult talks over a range of subjects. German and US officials were frantically trying to finalise last night the agreement setting up a fund to compensate Nazi-era slave workers, but with no breakthrough in sight.

<p>

Similarly, the emotive problem of child custody continued to cause friction. The German government still insists that it is powerless to help  US parents be reunited with their children in Germany. To solve what it calls a "bureaucratic problem", Germany is proposing to set up a committee.

<p>

But nothing better symbolises the level of misunderstandings between the two countries than the fate of the US embassy in Berlin. America has yet to start work on the building next to the Brandenburg Gate because it cannot get the city authorities to approve the security arrangements. This is another matter that is unlikely to be resolved during Mr Clinton's visit.
