LONDON - The United States is said to be trying to cripple the proposed International Criminal Court, designed to bring tyrants such as Saddam Hussein to justice.

<P>Bill Clinton, the U.S. President, is meeting Gerhard Schroeder, the German Chancellor, in Berlin today to seek his support for changes to the court's procedures that could hobble the new body.

<P>Plans for a tribunal with the power to try war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity were approved in Rome two years ago. It would be modelled on courts that hear cases on the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.

<P>But the United States has opposed its creation, fearing U.S. forces might be indicted for acts such as the bombing of Serbia or recent missile strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan.

<P>In the past two weeks, David Sheffer, a senior U.S. diplomat, has toured London, Paris, Berlin, Brussels and Stockholm seeking support for the U.S. plan.

<P>Washington is pushing hard for crucial alterations to the court's rules of procedure, due to be finalized at a conference in New York in 10 days' time. These would make it impossible for the court to indict alleged criminals from countries that have not signed the treaty setting it up, unless the country consents.

<P>While this would protect U.S. servicemen from being hauled before the court, it would also mean that Russians accused of war crimes in Chechnya, or Chinese accused of atrocities in Tibet, would escape its jurisdiction. Neither country has yet signed the treaty.

<P>With Iraq, Iran, Libya, North Korea and other "rogue states'' also unlikely ever to sign, alleged criminals from some of the worst offenders against human rights could remain beyond the court's reach, frustrating its purpose.

<P>The United States envisages that the United Nations Security Council could vote to give the court jurisdiction over the nationals of a non-signatory. But like Russia, China, Britain and France, it could also veto that.

<P>"Such an exemption for the citizens of one nation or set of nations would destroy the universality necessary for the court to gain broad acceptance and deliver impartial justice,'' Kenneth Roth, director of the New York-based Human Rights Watch, has warned.

<P>So far, 96 countries have signed the ICC treaty. Though only 10 have ratified it so far, another 30 are set to do so by year-end.

<P>Madeleine Albright, the U.S. Secretary of State, has also written to the foreign ministers of all European Union countries "strongly urging'' them to support her country's position.
