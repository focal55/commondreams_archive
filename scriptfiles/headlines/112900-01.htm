SANTIAGO, CHILE - Rural poverty has grown by 10 to 20

percent in a number of Latin American countries in the past three

years, according to a report released Tuesday in the Chilean

capital by Raquel Peña-Montenegro, regional director for Latin

America and the Caribbean of the International Fund for

Agricultural Development (IFAD). 

<P>

   The study reports that more than 90 million Latin American and

Caribbean peasant farmers currently live below the poverty line,

while 47 million live in extreme poverty. 

<P>

   The report was presented at the Catholic University of

Santiago, which hosted an international academic meeting on

''Globalisation and Local Development: Challenges for the Small

Farmer'', running Monday through Wednesday. 

<P>

   More than 300 experts from throughout the world are attending

the gathering, held in the framework of the 16th Symposium of the

International Farming Systems Association and the Fourth Latin

American Farming Systems Research and Extension Symposium. 

<P>

   The report presented by Peña-Montenegro was described as the

most complete study ever carried out on rural poverty in the

region. 

<P>

   The paper gave rise to a book, ''Towards a Region without Rural

Poor'', by Peña-Montenegro, Benjamín Quijandría and Aníbal

Monares. The book, which was also launched Tuesday, details IFAD's

strategy in fighting rural poverty in Latin America and the

Caribbean. 

<P>

   The rural population of Latin America and the Caribbean shrunk

steadily from 1980 to 1997, from a total of 122 million to 111

million, representing an average annual reduction of 0.87 percent. 

<P>

   Despite the positive macroeconomic trends reported in the

region in the first six years of the 1990s, the proportion of

rural poor and indigents remained constant during that period, and

began to swell towards the end of the decade. 

<P>

   Peña-Montenegro pointed out that conceptual and methodological

disparities in measuring poverty in the region have led to

enormous differences in the statistics compiled. 

<P>

   While the Economic Commission for Latin America and the

Caribbean (ECLAC) reported a total of 204 million poor people in

the region in 1997, the World Bank estimated the total of people

living in extreme poverty at 78.2 million in 1998. 

<P>

   Peña-Montenegro pointed out that the World Bank was referring

to those living in absolute poverty, but she also warned that

methodological choices were coloured by ideological visions. 

<P>

   One important consequence of underrating the number of poor is

that the problem gets pushed down on the list of government policy

priorities, while the image projected of progress being made in

the region can lead to the loss of access to international

development aid, she added. 

<P>

   The Rome-based IFAD was founded in 1977 to help the rural poor

in developing countries help themselves. Since its creation, it

has financed 548 projects in 114 countries with a total of 6.8

billion dollars in loans and donations. However, the agency's

efforts fall short without other sources of cooperation, the

regional director underlined. 

<P>

   In the past decade, IFAD has invested more than 600 million

dollars in 50 projects in 23 countries of Latin America and the

Caribbean. Counting the matching funds from governments and other

donors, total financing amounted to one billion dollars. 

<P>

   According to ECLAC, 78.2 million people lived below the poverty

line in rural areas in the region in 1997, while 47 million lived

in extreme poverty. 

<P>

   Peña-Montenegro pointed out that the data collected since then

indicates that rural poverty has grown between 10 and 20 percent

in Central America, Venezuela, Mexico and Brazil, bringing the

regional total to more than 90 million. 

<P>

   Over 90 percent of the rural poor in Latin America and the

Caribbean are concentrated in areas totalling more than nine

million square kilometres in northeastern Brazil, northern Mexico,

northwestern Venezuela, the Pacific coastlines and central areas

of Honduras and Nicaragua, and the northern parts of Peru and

Chile. 

<P>

   The IFAD official noted that there was structural rural poverty

that affected all ethnic minorities, rural women and landless

peasant farmers in the region, as opposed to transitional poverty

that affected small farmers, share-croppers and tenant farmers. 

<P>

   The rural poor are hit hardest by international crises and

natural disasters. Hurricane Mitch, for example, which claimed

thousands of lives in Central America in 1998, considerably

increased the number of poor in that region, Peña-Montenegro

observed. 

<P>

   There are 26 million rural indigenous people in the region, who

suffer from high levels of poverty as a consequence of social and

cultural exclusion, which also marginalises them from access to

credit and other technical and financial resources. 

<P>

   Peña-Montenegro's report also underscores that women are the

sole heads of eight to 10 million households in the region, two to

three million women work as seasonal wage-labourers, while 30 to

40 million women in stable relationships are partially or totally

responsible for their household's farming activities and small

rural industries. 

<P>

   The study maintains that the adoption of neo-liberal policies

in Latin America and the Caribbean has brought about a 40 percent

reduction in investment in rural and farming areas, another factor

that has contributed to the rise in poverty. 

<P>

   Farming, forestry and stockbreeding systems introduced as a

consequence of the liberalisation of trade and access to external

markets have had a heavy impact on the environment, the report

adds. 

<P>

   The study urges that policies focusing on bandaid or

superficial welfare solutions have failed to make inroads against

rural poverty and should be replaced by agricultural development

policies based on productive investment. 

<P>

   It also recommends safeguarding small farmers from ''premature

exposure'' to international markets, in order to mitigate the

negative impacts of globalisation.
