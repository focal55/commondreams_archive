WASHINGTON - The World Bank's funding of projects in

Russia is undermining environmental protection and the rule of

law, charge environmental organisations. 

<P>

Environmental activists have been protesting the Bank's lending to

Russia since President Vladimir Putin acted by decree last May and

abolished two federal environmental protection bodies. 

<P>

Putin placed the responsibilities of the Committee on Ecology and

the Forest Service under the Ministry of Natural Resources, an

agency in charge of resource extraction, not protection. 

<P>

Environmentalists warned that without independent environmental

enforcement agencies, the World Bank cannot guarantee that its

projects will comply with Russia's environmental law. 

<P>

The financial institution angered environmentalists when just five

days after Putin's decree the World Bank approved a 60 million

dollar loan to Russia's Forest Service, which had just been

abolished. 

<P>

''If the World Bank does not have the sense not to lend money to

abolished agencies, the overall veracity of its overall portfolio

in Russia must be questioned,'' said Doug Norlen, policy director

of the California-based Pacific Environment and Resources Center. 

<P>

Following protests from Russian and international environmental

groups, the institution subsequently halted disbursement of the

loan. 

<P>

Environmentalists are increasing their call against lending to

Russia this week since the Bank is expected to discuss loans and

guarantees for Russia's forestry and mining sectors at a board

meeting Sep. 12. 

<P>

Russia's only public interest law organisation, Ecojuris, says

Putin's move is illegal and is suing the government for abolishing

the two agencies. 

<P>

''By approving these projects in the face of, and even in defence

of the illegal abolition of the environmental protection agency,

the World Bank is undermining the rule of law in Russia,'' added

Norlen. 

<P>

On Friday, James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank again

defended the institution's position with Russia. 

<P>

''We said (to Russia) ... Look, you've collapsed the environment

ministry ... and we're prepared to make a loan, but only, only pay

you when you have re-established conditions under which the

environmental conditions can be monitored and supervised and

supported,'' he told reporters. 

<P>

These conditions for receiving the loan, said Wolfensohn, include

public debate.  He said this would involve establishing a way that

the public could comment on projects in Russia via the Internet. 

<P>

The forestry loan, added Wolfensohn, is ''subject to the Russians

doing all these things, and that is a function that the Bank can

perform far more effectively than anybody else because we've tied

it to lending.'' 

<P>

Bank officials are bracing for expected protests later this month

against the institution's overall lending policies when the

institution meets in Prague for its annual meetings. 

<P>

''Approval of projects that harm the environment and undermine the

rule of law just fuels the sort of folly the World Bank is famous

for,'' said Norlen. 

<P>

Outrage over Putin's decree among Russian citizens is growing, he

added. In a recent poll, 87 percent of Russian citizens condemned

Putin's decision.  

<P>

Groups in Russia are currently organising a citizen's referendum

that would allow the entire nation to vote on whether the two

protection bodies should remain. Russian environmentalists said

they have already noticed a negative impact on environmental

protection as a result of Putin's decree. 

<P>

In one case, a regional head of the State Committee on Ecology in

the Russian Far East region of Kamchatka recently abandoned his

support for a UN programme protecting two key salmon watersheds

that are also coveted by the Ministry of Natural Resources for

their gold and gas deposits. 

<P>

Environmentalists with Baikal Wave, a group that aims to protect

Lake Baikal - the world's oldest and deepest lake - said that

since the termination of the agencies, they are not sure how to go

about their previous efforts to monitor the ecology of the lake. 

<P>

Before Putin's decree they received certification from the State

Committee on Ecology that would allow them to monitor pollution,

hunting and fishing near the lake. 

<P>

''Maybe (because of the decree), these certificates will be just a

piece of paper and nothing more,'' says Vyacheslav Kudryavtsev,

who works with Baikal Wave. 

<P>

Putin's decree amounts to more than just another restructuring of

Russian bureaucracy, according to Dmitry Lisitsyn of Sakhalin

Environment Watch, an advocacy group on Sakhalin Island in the

Russian Far East. 

<P>

''The abolished committee on environmental protection was one of

the major achievements of the democratic movement in Russia

following the collapse of the Soviet Union,'' said Lisitsyn. 

<P>

Putin's decree, he said, amounts to a ''wholesale attempt by the

government to turn Russia into a natural resource colony.''
