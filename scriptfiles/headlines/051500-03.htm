GENEVA - May 15 - The United Nations publicly rebuked the

United States Monday over brutality in its prisons and called

for an end to chain gangs and to the use of electro-shock belts

for restraining inmates.<p>The U.N. Committee against Torture said it was concerned

about breaches of the international convention against torture

in the United States, citing the alleged sexual assault of

female prisoners by law enforcement officers and the holding of

minors in adult jails.<p>This is the first time the United States, the world's most

vocal defender of human rights, has been put in the dock before

the Geneva-based body alongside the usual suspects such as

China.<p>``The committee expresses its concern about the number of

cases of police ill-treatment of civilians and ill-treatment in

prisons. Much of this ill-treatment by police and prison guards

seems to be based upon discrimination,'' the report said.<p>The committee's 10 independent experts urged the United

States to abolish the use of electro-shock stun belts and

restraint chairs on uncooperative inmates.<p>``The committee recommends that the state party abolish

electro-shock stun belts and restraint chairs as methods of

restraining those in custody. Their use almost invariably leads

to breaches of...the convention,'' they said.

The report also expressed concern about what it said was the

excessively harsh regime in so-called super-maximum prisons,

including the practice of putting inmates in chain gangs,

especially in public.<p>The U.N. forum's two-day examination of the United States'

record follows the fatal police shootings of unarmed blacks in

New York and Los Angeles.<p>London-based rights group Amnesty International charged in a

46-page report last week that practices in overcrowded U.S.

prisons -- whose total population recently hit two million

inmates -- facilitated torture and other forms of ill-treatment.<p>Amnesty called for a halt to police beatings and the

shooting of unarmed suspects.<p>Washington says torture is prohibited by law in the United

States and categorically denounced as a matter of policy and as

a tool of state authority, but admits its record is not perfect.<p>U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Harold Hongju Koh,

presenting his government's report on its compliance since

ratifying the convention in 1994, said last week that instances

of police abuse, excessive use of force and even brutality, the

death of prisoners in custody, sexual abuse of inmates and jail

overcrowding were causes for concern.<p>The U.S. report was almost five years overdue, the committee

said, and urged Washington to submit its next periodic report by

November 2001.<p>The U.N. body oversees compliance by 119 states that have

ratified the torture pact, but it has no power to impose

sanctions.
