The St. Louis-based company kicked off the campaign in France and the United

Kingdom with a barrage of ads that promote genetic engineering. They present

a gentler, more open Monsanto in contrast to the hard-driving company at the

center of a controversy across Europe.

<P>Monsanto opened a new Internet site that includes some of the news reports

that have been critical of genetic engineering in foods. One story told of

Monsanto's apology to Europeans for "heavy-handed" attempts to promote genetic

altered products. Another reported a new poll showing that 95 percent of Britons

interviewed wanted modified foods labeled.

<P>The efforts speak of the stark difference between attitudes in Europe and the

United States, where people exhibit few concerns about modified food products

like Monsanto's artificial sweetener NutraSweet.

<P> Monsanto makes agricultural products, pharmaceuticals and food ingredients.

Monsanto spun off its chemical business last year, and is being acquired by

American Home Products Corp. for $33.5 billion.

<P>European acceptance is critical to Monsanto and its rivals, as a market for

genetically modified foods as a gateway to the rest of the world. Europe also is

important to U.S. farmers, who are moving steadily to modified soybeans and corn

and have no mechanisms to separate them from nonmodified varieties for export. 

  <P>Part of Europe's cautious, sometimes hostile attitude has to do with European

attentiveness to food and its sources.  There is also a perception that European

governments and scientists failed to protect people from mad cow disease.

<P><b>Toby

Moffett</b>, Monsanto vice president of for international governmental affairs, said

Monsanto recognizes that it failed to pay sufficient attention to public

opinion. 

<P>"We barged in, like someone barging in on someone's private party,"

<b>Moffett</b> said.
