WASHINGTON - Police

detained

hundreds

of

anti-globalization

demonstrators

Monday

and

hurled

tear

gas

and

sprayed

pepper

to

crush

protests

aimed

at

disrupting

the

final

day

of

talks

between

world

financial

leaders.

<p>About

5,000

protesters

massed

behind

police

barricades

a

block

away

from

the

International

Monetary

Fund

(IMF)

and

World

Bank

buildings,

where

world

financial

leaders

started

talks

two

hours

ahead

of

schedule

to

avoid

the

demonstrators.

<p>There

were

repeated

scuffles

between

protesters

and

police

clad

in

riot

gear

and

gas

masks.

Even

the

city's

police

chief,

Charles

Ramsey,

helped

wrestle

a

demonstrator

to

the

ground.

<p>



``There

have

been

a

couple

of

skirmishes,

officers

being

assaulted

during

these

arrests,

but

it's

nothing

we

can't

handle,''

Ramsey

told

reporters.

<p>Chanting

slogans

such

as

``More

World,

less

Bank,''

the

protesters

claim

the

global

lenders'

policies

hurt

the

economies

of

the

poor

countries

they

are

meant

to

help.

<p>Protesters

lined

up

in

driving

rain

behind

police

barricades

just

one

block

from

the

bank

and

IMF

buildings

and

several

blocks

away

from

the

White

House.

President

Clinton

was

out

of

town.

<p>After

a

tense

stand-off

for

about

an

hour,

police

allowed

small

groups

to

cross

the

barrier

and

then

face

arrest.

Police

could

not

provide

an

exact

figure

but

reporters

on

the

scene

estimated

that

hundreds

were

held.

<p>Washington's

Deputy

Police

Chief

Terrance

Gainer,

who

helped

to

negotiate

the

``peaceful

arrests,''

accepted

a

bunch

of

roses

from

protesters

at

the

barricades.

<p>Protesters

told

Reuters

the

group's

``tactical

committee''

had

originally

voted

to

storm

the

barricades

and

break

into

the

building

where

world

financial

leaders

were

meeting,

but

then

decided

to

opt

for

peaceful

arrests

as

a

sign

of

protest.

<p>Movie

stars

Susan

Sarandon

and

Tim

Robbins

joined

the

demonstrators,

who

caused

traffic

chaos

in

the

city

and

led

the

federal

government

to

order

only

emergency

workers

to

report

for

work

in

a

large

area

surrounding

the

IMF

and

World

Bank.

<p>Robbins

said

he

was

very

impressed

by

the

demonstrations.

''I

think

this

is

exciting

because

it

is

such

a

wide

coalition

of

people.

You

haven't

seen

this

kind

of

unity

before.''

<p>Police

sprayed

pepper

frequently

during

the

day

and

Washington

Mayor

Anthony

Williams

said

tear

gas

was

used

once.

<p>He

denied

accusations

from

protesters

that

the

police

used

heavy-handed

tactics.

``The

police

have

shown

great

poise

and

discipline

throughout

this

episode,''

Williams

told

CNN.

<p>Steve

Kretzmann,

a

spokesman

for

the

Mobilization

for

Global

Justice,

said

the

protests

had

been

a

victory

for

the

organizers

but

that

the

police

had

gone

too

far.

<p>``They

(police)

have

militarized

our

capital.

This

kind

of

force

only

strengthens

our

resolve.

We

will

not

back

down,''

Kretzmann

told

a

news

conference.

<p>Ramsey

said

the

tear

gas

incident

had

been

a

mistake

and

the

police

officer

involved

thought

he

was

throwing

a

smoke

grenade.

<p>He

said

World

Bank

delegates

had

been

surrounded

by

about

200

protesters

who

were

dressed

in

black

and

wearing

masks.

''The

officer

got

out,

thought

he

was

throwing

a

smoke

grenade

to

break

up

the

crowd

and

it

actually

was

tear

gas.''

<p>The

World

Bank's

Development

Committee

--

discussing

debt

relief,

trade

and

the

fight

against

AIDS

--

started

its

meetings

with

a

breakfast

at

6:30

a.m.

(1030

GMT),

moving

on

at

7:30

a.m.

(1130

GMT)

to

the

formal

session.

<p>Early

in

the

day,

police

detained

more

than

35

black-clad

protesters

for

``incommoding,''

which

means

blocking

the

sidewalk.

Police

forced

them

onto

their

knees

and

locked

plastic

handcuffs

onto

them.

<p>Closer

to

the

World

Bank's

glitzy

headquarters,

police

detained

another

18-20

people

and

piled

them

onto

a

school

bus

after

again

putting

handcuffs

on

them.

<p>Ramsey

said

a

search

of

bags

carried

by

those

detained

had

disgorged

nails,

gas

masks,

rocks,

sling

shots

and

what

he

called

``home

made

concoctions,''

including

bottles

of

urine.

<p>One

was

marked

``Seattle

special,''

in

reference

to

last

year's

riots

in

the

port

city

that

sank

global

trade

talks.

<p>Ramsey

said

Monday's

protests

were

less

significant

than

those

at

the

weekend

but

he

did

not

have

complete

figures

yet.

<p>Protest

organizers

claimed

they

had

20,000

demonstrators

on

the

streets

of

the

capital

Sunday.

Police

estimated

10,000

protesters

attended

one

demonstration

on

the

grassy

Ellipse

near

the

White

House,

a

good-humored

rally

that

drew

supporters

from

causes

ranging

from

AIDS

to

Third

World

rights.

<p>As

in

the

anti-trade

protests

in

Seattle

last

December,

the

demonstrators

in

Washington

underwent

weeks

of

training

and

appeared

to

be

highly

organized.

But

unlike

Seattle,

District

police

quickly

responded

to

attempts

by

protesters

to

disrupt

the

meetings

here,

keeping

the

crowds

mostly

under

control.

<p>Sharon

Alexander,

a

49-year-old

from

Boulder,

Co.,

said

she

had

taken

part

in

the

Seattle

protests.

``Seattle

was

a

lot

more

fun,''

she

said,

adding

that

Washington

police

seemed

to be more organized.
