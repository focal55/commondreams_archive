STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN - World military expenditure rose 2.1 percent in real terms in 1999 after a

long period of decline, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute

said Wednesday.<P>

   The United States, Russia, China and France accounted for most of the

global increase but countries spending relatively the most on weapons are the

emerging economies, the institute said.<P>

   Arms spending totaled about $780 billion in 1999.<P>

   "While this is almost one-third less than 10 years earlier, it still

represents a significant share of world economic resources: 2.6 percent of

world gross national product," the annual report said.<P>

   Russia's spending rose 24 percent in real terms in 1999 but was still 53

percent lower than in 1992, and most other developed countries have cut

military expenditures by about one-third over the 1990s.<P>

   "The countries with the heaviest economic burden of military expenditure

are generally poor countries involved in armed conflict and/or located in

areas of tension," the report said. Armed conflicts in Africa have led to an

increase in military spending since 1997.<P>

   The amount spent on weapons in Africa is hard to calculate because it can

involve the legal or illegal appropriation of national resources outside a

government's official defense budget. The institute figured the total

international arms trade to be worth between $35 billion and $49 billion.
