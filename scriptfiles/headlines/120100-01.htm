            WASHINGTON - As countries blame each other for last week's collapse 

            of the global talks on climate change, environmental pressure groups 

            are calling on industrialised nations to quickly resume negotiations. 

            <P> While some progress was made to translate an international treaty 

              to reduce heat-trapping greenhouse gases into an enforceable agreement, 

              industrialised nations could not agree on how much credit should 

              be given for using forests and farmland to absorb carbon, the main 

              greenhouse gas. On Saturday in The Hague talks were suspended without 

              resolution. 

            <P> Environmentalists are now urging European and US negotiators to 

              talk frequently between now and the next negotiating session, scheduled 

              for May in Bonn, Germany. 

            <P> ''We hope that the ministers will reconvene, at least informally, 

              as quickly as possible to build on what progress was made in The 

              Hague,'' says Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental 

              Trust, a Washington-based advocacy group. 

            <P> The recent session in the Netherlands was intended to hammer out 

              the details of the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 agreement which requires 

              industrialised countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse 

              gases by an average of five percent below 1990 levels by 2012. 

            <P> The United States, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, initially 

              sought to get halfway to its Kyoto target by getting credit for 

              its vast forests as a carbon dioxide ''sink''. 

            <P> After the European Union rejected this proposal, the United States 

              reduced the credits it wanted for forests and other so-called ''sinks'' 

              by nearly three-fourths. But Frank Loy, the leading US negotiator, 

              says he never received a response to why the deal fell apart. 

            <P> Some conservationists here, while agreeing with the EU's scepticism 

              about relying on sinks to halt climate change, are criticising the 

              European negotiators. Clapp with the National Environmental Trust 

              says they may have missed their best opportunity for a strong treaty. 

            <P> After January, Europe could face the administration headed by 

              Republican governor of Texas, George W. Bush, who is almost certain 

              to push for sinks and market-based mechanisms that environmentalists 

              call ''loopholes''. 

            <P> ''This was a critical window of opportunity,'' says Clapp. ''To 

              let it close was a monumental miscalculation.'' 

            <P> But with more time to negotiate, conservation groups remain optimistic 

              that an agreement is still attainable. 

            <P> ''With an extra day, I believe a package deal could have been 

              reached,'' says Alden Meyer, director of government relations for 

              the Union of Concerned Scientists. 

            <P> Jennifer Morgan, director of the climate change campaign for the 

              World Wildlife Fund, underscores the need for negotiators to meet 

              again soon before the next formal date in May. ''We all believe 

              they need to reconvene in weeks, not months,'' she says. 

            <P> Meyer adds that now, more than ever before, business is more willing 

              to act on reducing emissions. The shift of business is ''nothing 

              short of amazing'', says Meyers. 

            <P> When the Kyoto Protocol was first written up in 1997, powerful 

              US industries launched a multi-million dollar mass media campaign 

              against the agreement, arguing that it would devastate the US economy. 

              Since then, many corporations have changed their tune. Several companies, 

              including British Petroleum (BP)-Amoco, Shell International, and 

              the chemical company DuPont, have teamed with the advocacy group, 

              Environmental Defense, in setting firm targets for reducing their 

              own emissions. BP-Amoco has even set up its own internal carbon 

              emission trading programme. 

            <P> During The Hague conference, the National Environmental Trust 

              released a poll of Fortune 5000 companies that Clapp says illustrates 

              changing opinions on global warming and the Kyoto Protocol. 

            <P> Thirty-four percent of business executives polled said they support 

              ratification of the agreement by the US Senate. The poll, conducted 

              by American Viewpoint, a Republican polling firm based in Washington, 

              also found that 75 percent of Fortune 5000 executives believe that 

              global warming is a serious problem. 

            <P> ''This view accounts for some of the movement we have seen in 

              the business community in the past two years,'' says Clapp. 

            <P> Some business interests who went to The Hague expressed confusion 

              that the climate talks collapsed. ''We came here expecting a decision 

              which would have clarified rules and guidelines,'' Nick Campbell, 

              of the International Chambers of Commerce, told reporters. 

            <P> Besides a shift in the business community, the US Senate - once 

              unanimously opposed to its ratification - has also begun to change, 

              notes Clapp. Three outspoken opponents to the agreement were defeated 

              in the recent elections: Republicans Spencer Abraham of Michigan, 

              John Ashcroft of Missouri and Rod Grams of Minnesota.
