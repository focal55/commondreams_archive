ROCHESTER, NY - For nearly 30 years, U.S. fugitive Allen Richardson lived an exemplary life in West Vancouver, hoping he would be spared a return to the brutal prison system he fled as a young man.

In Circuit Court here yesterday, that hope was dashed when it was ruled that Mr. Richardson's four-year jail term for a minor drug offence in his home state of New York would not be reversed or reduced.

<P>Instead, Judge John Connell ordered Mr. Richardson, now 50, back into custody to continue serving his 1971 prison sentence, imposed for selling $20 worth of LSD to an undercover police officer.</P>

<P>Granting clemency, the judge said in a ruling that left Mr. Richardson's wife, Amalia, in tears, would &#34;send the wrong message.&#34;</P>

<P>The judge agreed that for a man of Mr. Richardson's character, prison would serve no purpose. He also acknowledged that in his own court, a similar offence today would earn no more than a probation term.</P>

<P>&#34;But my role goes beyond what I would do,&#34; the judge said, adding that there was nothing illegal or cruel about the four-year term.</P>

<P>The decision was a harsh blow for the Richardsons, who earlier in the day flew from Toronto to Rochester after negotiating Mr. Richardson's surrender.</P>

<P>U.S. authorities were waiting on the airport tarmac when the small twin-engine Beechcraft touched down. Mr. Richardson was conducted to court in handcuffs.</P>

<P>In a tearful plea, Mrs. Richardson urged the judge to let her husband return to Canada, where he has led a productive, crime-free life for more than 20 years, working as a technician with Triumf, an acclaimed physics laboratory attached to the University of British Columbia.</P>

<P>More than 100 letters from his employer, friends, neighbours and co-workers attesting to the fugitive's good character accompanied the Richardsons' plea for mercy.</P>

<P>The British-born Mrs. Richardson, fighting breast cancer for 12 years, told the court, &#34;He's the only real support I have; without him I would be bereft.&#34;</P>

<P>But the judge was unswayed and he upheld his written ruling last year that the original prison sentence must stand.</P>

<P>Mr. Richardson was to be taken to the Fishkill Reception Facility, an hour's drive north of New York City, to be processed.</P>

<P>From there, his lawyer, Michael Kennedy, said outside the court, he will be transferred to a medium-security prison.</P>

<P>Mr. Kennedy voiced disappointment at the outcome. But he was optimistic his client would be released within a few months, pointing out that although Mr. Richardson has only served six months, his sentence ran from zero to four years, meaning parole eligibility can begin at any time.</P>

<P>In theory, Mr. Richardson could be given additional prison time for the escape. But Mr. Kennedy gave no indication he expected that to happen. &#34;This is the beginning of the end of a saga for Allen Richardson,&#34; he said.</P>

<P>&#34;I'll be surprised if, within a very short period of time, Mr. Richardson is not returned to Canada.&#34;</P>

<P>Mr. Richardson's troubles with the law began in 1971, when he was known as Christopher Perlstein.</P>

<P>In March, 1971, he was handed a prison term of up to four years for selling seven LSD tablets to an undercover agent at the Rochester Institute of Technology, where he was studying photography.</P>

<P>To this day, he and his supporters are certain the sentence was reflective of Mr. Perlstein's reputation as a campus radical active in the struggle against the Vietnam War.</P>

<P>At first, he was incarcerated in the infamous Attica federal prison, a maelstrom of physical and sexual brutality; a few months later he was transferred to a minimum-security forestry camp.</P>

<P>In the meantime, a riot had erupted in Attica, leaving 43 dead.</P>

<P>Told he would be returned to Attica, Mr. Perlstein walked out of the prison camp and fled to Canada with help from the Toronto draft dodgers network. He assumed a new name, moved to Vancouver and began a new life.</P>
