A group of wealthy philanthropists who disagree with the U.S. 

government's drug policy are mounting a national campaign to change it -- 

and they are using California to lead the charge.	 

<P>Proposition 36 -- a November ballot initiative that would send drug 

offenders to treatment instead of prison -- is just one of the steps the 

high-powered group, which includes billionaire George Soros, is using to 

slowly change the nation's drug laws.	 

</P>

<P>``The California proposition is regarded as the high profile anchor of a 

broader campaign to advance our drug policy,'' said Ethan Nadelmann, 

director of the Lindesmith Center, a foundation established to ``broaden the 

drug policy debate.'' Although the center is not directly involved in the 

proposition, it is Soros' creation and Nadelmann is an adviser to the 

campaign.	 

</P>

<P>Starting with California's Proposition 215 -- which legalized medical 

marijuana -- Soros and others have carefully used their money to go directly 

to voters on issues surrounding the nation's drug war.	 

</P>

<P>Nadelmann denies that the campaign is radical or that its ultimate goal is 

drug legalization.	 

</P>

<P>``For too long, drug policy has been based on ignorance, fear, prejudice 

and profit,'' he said. ``We support a policy based on common sense, human 

rights, science and public health.''	 

</p>

<b>FAVORING REHABILITATION

</b>

<P>The practical effect of the group's policy would mean legalized marijuana 

for medical purposes, access to methadone for heroin addicts and 

rehabilitation instead of prison, Nadelmann said.	 

</P>

<P>But opponents of Proposition 36 don't buy that.	 

</P>

<P>``This is not about treatment; it's an effort to legalize drugs,'' said 

Jean Munoz, a spokeswoman for the No on 36 campaign. ``Everybody in our 

coalition believes in treatment, but it has to be effective.''	 

</P>

<P>That coalition includes judges, parole officers, law enforcement groups and 

some health care professionals. 	 

</P>

<P>``Proponents frame the issue around treatment. It's not about treatment; 

it's about the decriminalization of hard-core drugs. It will undermine 

effective treatment programs,'' Munoz said.	 

</P>

<P>Supporters of California's proposition say it focuses on treating drug 

addiction as a health problem instead of a crime. The drug-treatment 

initiative would ban prison time for nonviolent first- and second-time drug 

offenders not charged with the sale, production or manufacturing of drugs.	 

</P>

<P>About 19,700 of the state's 162,000 prisoners are locked up for drug 

crimes, according to the state Department of Corrections.	 

</p>

<b>HIGH RECIDIVISM RATE

</b>

<P>Many drug users return again and again to jails and prisons. Drugs are 

considered to be the leading cause of the state's high recidivism rate among 

prisoners, which reached 67 percent in 1999, according to state documents.	 

</P>

<P>But opponents of the measure, including many law enforcement groups, argue 

that judges should be allowed to decide who are the best risks for probation 

and drug-treatment plans.	 

</P>

<P>``With drug courts there are consequences and accountability,'' said Munoz. 

``There is no money for drug testing in their initiative. There is no 

immediate sanction to compel them to get clean.''	 

</P>

<P>The nonpartisan legislative analyst says that within several years the 

proposition would result in a savings of between $200 million and $250 

million a year for the prison system. 	 

</P>

<P>The state would have to allocate $120 million a year to support the 

treatment programs.	 

</p>

<b>NATURAL PLACE FOR CAMPAIGN</b>

<P>California is a natural place to anchor the campaign, Nadelmann said.	 

</P>

<P>``California is a leader in many respects,'' he said. ``And it has an 

active ballot initiative process, which others don't have.''	 

</P>

<P>Four other states also have ballot initiatives in November on drug 

decriminalization -- Massachusetts, Oregon, Utah and Nevada -- and Soros has 

given nearly $900,000 to those efforts.	 

</P>

<P>The group uses ballot initiatives to go directly to voters, who Nadelmann 

said are more open to change.	 

</P>

<P>``We know a lot of things cannot move forward in legislation,'' he said. 

``There is too much political cowardice and dependence on drug war 

politics.''	 

</P>

<P>Soros and the two other contributors -- Peter Lewis, CEO of the Progressive 

Corp. and John Sperling, CEO of the Apollo Group, gave more than $1 million 

to the Proposition 36 campaign as of June 30.	 

</P>

<P>Other supporters of the measure include San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, 

the California Nurses Association and state Senate President Pro Tem John 

Burton of San Francisco.	 

</P>

<P>These elected leaders, along with others around the country, mean that 

Nadelmann's efforts are also starting to take hold through laws and local 

ordinances. The Hawaiian Legislature was recently the first to pass a 

medical marijuana law, and New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, a Republican, is 

working to make drug abuse problems fall under the health department instead 

of the state police.	 

</P>

<P>Public opinion is starting to sway elected officials, Nadelmann said.	 

</P>

<P>``People are saying enough is enough,'' he said. ``They 

are fed up with the rhetoric. Coercing people is not the way to get them 

better.''	 

<P>

</p>

<b>PROPOSITION 36

</b>

<P> -- What it would do: Proposition 36 will change state law so that most adult 

offenders who use or possess illegal drugs would receive drug treatment 

instead of jail time. State funds would be used to operate the drug 

treatment programs. Excluded from the program would be violent offenders and 

those who have failed treatment two or more times.	 

</P>

<P> -- Who is for it: San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, the California Nurses 

Association, California Labor Federation AFL-CIO, Senate President Pro Tem 

John Burton, D-San Francisco, the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and the 

Oakland City Council.	 

</P>

<P> -- Who is against it: Former Gov. Pete Wilson, Crime Victims United of 

California, California District Attorneys Association, California Peace 

Officers Association, the Betty Ford Center, and actor Martin Sheen.	 

</P>

<P> -- Major contributors: A handful of individuals account for almost all the 

money in this campaign. Financier George Soros, Peter Lewis, CEO of the 

Progressive Corp. and John Sperling, CEO of the Apollo Group, have 

contributed their own money for the ``Yes'' side, raising nearly 10 times as 

much as the ``No'' side, which received contributions from developer A.G. 

Spanos and the California Narcotic Officers Association PAC. 	 

</P>

<P> -- Bottom Line: If approved this measure would radically change the way the 

state handles drug offenses. It goes to the heart of whether drug offenders 

should be treated as though they have an illness, or must have a punishment 

such as prison time to scare them into getting straightened out. The measure 

takes power away from the police and courts, and gives it to treatment 

centers.
