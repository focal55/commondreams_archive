Ancient ice drilled from deep inside a glacier

shows that the past century has been the hottest period in 1,000

years in the high Himalayan Mountains.

<p>Researchers said the new finding is yet another indication the

Earth is warming and supports other studies that show a rapid

melting of mountain ice fields is under way on three continents.

<p>``We think this is alarming,'' says Ellen Mosley-Thompson of

Ohio State University, the co-author of a study appearing Friday in

the journal Science.

</font>Mosley-Thompson is a member of a team, led by Lonnie G. Thompson

of Ohio State, that has analyzed ice cores from some of the most

remote mountains in the world. The new cores, cylindrical specimens

of ice, came from a glacier more than 20,000 feet high in the

Himalayas.

<p>``This is the highest climate record ever retrieved,'' Thompson

said in a statement. ``It clearly shows a serious warming during

the late 20th century, one that was caused, at least in part, by

human activity.''

<p>Herman Zimmerman, director of the National Science Foundation's

earth sciences division, said the new studies ``leave little doubt

that the Earth is warming and that all characteristics of our

climate can change rapidly.''

<p>``This is something that needs to be taken quite seriously by

all the peoples of the world,'' Zimmerman said. The NSF sponsored

the 1997 expedition that extracted the Himalayan ice cores.

<p>Mosley-Thompson said the team has the ice cores record chemical

clues of the climatic conditions that existed when the ice was

deposited.

<p>The most recent core, from the Dasuopu Glacier on the flank of

the 26,293-foot Mt. Xixabangma, included ice that was laid down

more than 12,000 years ago.

<p>An analysis of the Dasuopu ice deposited during the last 1,000

years shows a dramatic trend of warming, Mosley-Thompson said.

<p>``The last century has been warmer than the previous nine

centuries,'' Mosley-Thompson said, while the last decade has been

the warmest period of all.

<p>Other studies, based largely on surface temperature readings,

have found a global average warming of almost one degree over the

last century, but the effect may be even more dramatic in the

world's mountains, she said.

<p>``These high elevation ice fields seem to be warming more

strongly than what you could call the global average,''

Mosley-Thompson said.

<p>She said there has been a significant shrinkage of permanent ice

fields in Asia, South America and Africa that provide a significant

part of the flow in major rivers. Many such rivers are in areas

with monsoon weather patterns, where there usually is little rain

for six months of the year. Ice melt from the rivers has become an

increasingly important source of water for cities and farms,

Mosley-Thompson said.

<p>``For these rivers to continue to flow year-round, they have to

be fed by ice in the high mountains,'' Mosley-Thompson said. If the

ice fields continue to shrink, she said, ``the question then is

where will the river flow come from during the dry season.''

<p>Mosley-Thompson said the mountain warming effect seems to be

worldwide.

<p>``Everywhere we go, we get the same picture'' of shrinking ice

fields and increasing high altitude warming, she said.

<p>In northern Peru, there is a marked shrinkage of ice fields in

the Andes and a dry season reduction in flow of up to 70 percent in

the Rimac River which supplies water to Lima, Mosley-Thompson said.

In Africa, aerial photos taken of Mt. Kilimanjaro and checked

against 1912 maps found a 75 percent loss of ice mass, she said.

<p>There are no records to give a historic comparison for the Mt.

Xixabangma ice fields, but she said that Indian scientists have

found rapid shrinkage of ice fields around nearby Mt. Everest and

tentative findings of a reduced dry season flow in rivers draining

the Tibetan plateau.
