Charging that the war on drugs has been waged disproportionately

against blacks, Human Rights Watch today will release a report showing

that 482 of every 100,000 African American men are in prison for a drug

crime, compared with just 36 of every 100,000 white men.

<p>The study, titled "Punishment and Prejudice," also found that blacks

make up 62% of the nation's imprisoned drug offenders, despite accounting

for just 13% of the population. In half a dozen states, the disparity is

even greater, with blacks comprising 80% to 90% of all drug convicts

behind bars. In every state, they are more likely than white men to be

incarcerated for such crimes--from North Dakota, where the odds are

double, to Illinois, where the ratio is 57 to 1.

<p>"These racial disparities are a national scandal," said Ken Roth,

executive director of the New York-based watchdog organization, which

touted the report as the first state-by-state analysis of its kind.

"Black and white drug offenders get radically different treatment in the

American justice system. This is not only profoundly unfair to blacks, it

also corrodes the American ideal of equal justice for all."

<p>The report, funded by billionaire investor George Soros' Open Society

Institute, adds to the already bleak statistical portrait of inner-city

America, which has served as the drug war's front line. But as with

similar studies, its interpretation--and the appropriate target for

outrage--is a matter of considerable debate.

<p><b>

<b>

<p>Cost of Prison 'Cure' Seen High

</b>

<p>To Human Rights Watch associate counsel Jamie Fellner, who authored

the report, the numbers paint a "devastating picture of the price black

Americans have paid" for the country's failed battle to control illicit

drugs. "While drug abuse and drug trafficking warrant concerted national

efforts," she wrote, "it may be that the human, social and economic cost

of the prison 'cure' is worse than the 'disease' itself."

<p>Conservatives, however, derided those conclusions as "inflammatory,"

arguing that racially distinct outcomes, in and of themselves, are not

evidence of racially biased policies. "There will be inevitably,

inherently, disparities of all sorts in the enforcement of any kind of

law," said Todd Gaziano, a senior fellow in legal studies at the Heritage

Foundation, a conservative think tank. "I'm sure you can find disparity

among racial groups as to whether their ZIP Codes end in odd or even

numbers. It doesn't prove anything."

<p>Because the illegal drug trade tends to flourish in economically

depressed communities, conservatives contend, it may be that blacks

simply commit more drug crimes than whites--or, at least, the kind of

drug crimes that are more likely to result in a prison term. If that is

the case, they say, then inner-city black neighborhoods are the ones that

most benefit from putting drug offenders behind bars.

<p>"Why on Earth are people who claim to be civil rights advocates

defending the predators in these communities?" asked David Horowitz,

president of the Los Angeles-based Center for the Study of Popular

Culture and the author of "Hating Whitey and Other Progressive Causes."

<p>The answer from Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) is that a black

teenager standing on a corner with a baggie of crack should be viewed as

a scapegoat, not a villain. He provides a convenient target for law

enforcement, "but a 19-year-old, low-level drug dealer in South-Central

L.A. is not responsible for the devastation of the community."

<p>Rather, Waters believes outrage--and prison time--should be reserved

for those who allow international traffickers to move their drugs and

money in and out of the U.S. As an example, Waters pointed to a recent

Senate investigation that rebuked Citibank for helping the brother of

former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari transfer tens of

millions of dollars in alleged drug profits out of his country, a case

that resulted in no charges of wrongdoing against the banking

conglomerate.

<p>"Blacks get treated differently," she said.

<p><b>

Situation for Blacks Called Catastrophic</b>

<p>The numbers contained in the Human Rights Watch report, regardless of

politics, describe a catastrophic situation for black America. Relying on

1996 prison admission data from the National Corrections Reporting

Program, the study for the first time calculated per capita incarceration

rates for drug offenders in the 37 states that participated.

<p>Illinois topped the list, with 1,146 of every 100,000 black men

(compared with just 20 of every 100,000 white men) in prison for a drug

offense. Ohio followed, with a rate of 968, then Kentucky, at 869. The

report compared those numbers with the rates for white men and ranked the

states according to the degree of racial disparity. Illinois again led,

with blacks 57 times more likely than whites to be incarcerated for drug

crimes. Wisconsin followed, with a 54-to-1 ratio, then Minnesota, at 39

to 1.

<p>California's per capita rate for black drug offenders--669 of every

100,000--was the nation's seventh highest. But because California's total

black population is smaller than that of many Southern and Northeastern

states, the disparity with whites was among the lowest; even so, African

American drug offenders here are five times more likely than whites to

land in prison.

<p>The report offered no explanation for any state's ranking, and few

states were volunteering an opinion. "I'm reluctant to draw any

conclusions based on a report that's a mystery to me," said a spokesman

for Illinois Gov. George Ryan.

<p>Human Rights Watch, whose stated goal is to make governments around

the world "pay a heavy price in reputation and legitimacy if they violate

the rights of their people," concludes with several policy

recommendations:

<p>* Repeal mandatory minimum sentences;

<p>* Increase the availability of drug treatment;

<p>* Eliminate racial profiling.

<p>"If this were happening to whites," Fellner said, "the policies would

change."
