A scientific panel that waded into the debate over 

genetically engineered foods yesterday drew fire from environmental 

opponents for taking a narrow, pro-industry view of the possible 

human and environmental risks posed by gene-splicing technology.	 

<P>  In a 261-page report issued yesterday, a 12-person National 

Research Council panel said it ``was not aware of any evidence 

suggesting foods on the market today are unsafe to eat as a result of 

genetic modification.''	 

</P>

<P>  Genetic engineering involves the transfer in a laboratory of genes 

from one plant or animal into a crop. Traditional plant breeding 

tries to introduce new genes through pollen transfer, or sexual 

reproduction, from one plant to another.	 

</P>

<P>  The panelists, who spent a year hammering out a consensus report, 

said the Environmental Protection Agency should revise, and then 

implement, a genetic plant review process that it proposed in 1994 

but has not completed.	 

</P>

<P>   The suggested revision involves EPA's proposed exemption of plant 

breeders who use sexual reproduction to introduce alien genes into a 

crop. The panel questioned why the review process focused solely on 

gene-splicing.	 

</P>

<P>  The panel also said the EPA needed to work more closely with the 

Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration, two 

other agencies involved in the review process, to improve safety 

testing and alleviate concerns that genetically modified foods might 

pose health or environmental risks.	 

</P>

<P>  The scientists acknowledged that their report focused on only gene 

modifications that make plants resistant to pests and diseases. It 

did not study other common types of alterations, such as adding genes 

to make plants herbicide-resistant or to improve their vitamin 

content.	 

</P>

<P>  Nor did the report discuss whether genetically modified foods 

should be labeled, a move opponents have demanded to alert people who 

may be afraid of allergic reactions to new genes or who simply do not 

like the technology.	 

</P>

<P>  Even before the report was issued, environmentalists complained 

that the committee was stacked to favor agribusiness. The committee's 

original staff director, for example, is now a lobbyist for the 

Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington, D.C.	 

</P>

<P>  ``Given the conflicts of this study, this is not credible as an 

independent scientific report,'' said Joseph Mendelson, legal 

director of the Center for Food Safety in Washington, D.C. His group 

has filed federal lawsuits challenging the FDA and other regulatory 

agencies.	 

</P>

<P>   Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, and Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., 

co-authors of bills to force the labeling of genetically modified 

foods, also accused the panel of pro-industry ``bias.''	 

</P>

<P>   At the news conference where the report was released, panel 

Chairman Perry Adkisson, an entomologist and chancellor emeritus at 

Texas A&M University, stressed that the report reflects a consensus 

view that included the opinions of Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist with 

Environmental Defense in New York.	 

</P>

<P>  ``Given the extraordinarily strong feelings on all sides . . . it's 

not surprising that our work has come under such strong scrutiny,'' 

he said.	 

</P>

<P>  But while Goldburg acknowledged that ``the committee members 

worked hard to get out a consensus recommendation,'' she declined to 

give the report a ringing endorsement.	 

</P>

<P> ``People should look at the criticisms and look at the report and 

draw their own conclusions,'' she said.	 

</P>
