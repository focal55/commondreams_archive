                CRUZ, CA - March 25 - A progressive activist couple based in Santa 

                Cruz, Thomas and Gunilla Leavitt, have launched a web site in 

                reaction to the pro-war campaign to boycott everything French.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Says Thomas, 

                the site's content editor, "With pro-war forces intent on banning 

                the word 'French' from the American vocabulary, and the pro-war 

                Republican House contingent engaged in ignorant lunacies like 

                renaming French Toast (which was actually invented in New York 

                in 1724 by Joseph French) to 'Freedom Toast', the peace movement 

                needs a convenient and comprehensive way to counter ongoing boycott 

                efforts against France. <a href="http://www.buyfrenchnow.com" target="_new">BuyFrenchNow.com 

                </a>allows them to demonstrate their support for the people and 

                government of France as they resist the rush to war in Iraq. <a href="http://www.buyfrenchnow.com" target="_new">BuyFrenchNow.com</a> 

                offers a comprehensive and constantly expanding array of goods

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There has 

                been a ton of media coverage, pro and con, discussing a boycott 

                of French products, but until now, there has been no way for the 

                average activist to directly and publicly counter the effects 

                of the pro-war boycott of French products. <a href="http://www.buyfrenchnow.com" target="_new">BuyFrenchNow.com</a> 

                intends to meet that need. In support of our effort, we launched 

                a nationwide grassroots publicity campaign, and are already generating 

                widespread attention and publicity for the concept." </font>

                is only the latest in a string of activist web sites conceived 

                and designed by Thomas and Gunilla Leavitt (who has designed over 

                250 commercial, governmental and non-profit web sites since 1994). 

                Last summer, they launched <a href="http://www.savagestupidity.com" target="_new">SavageStupidity.com</a>, 

                a site aimed at exposing the truth about Hate Radio talk show 

                host Michael Savage. <a href="http://www.savagestupidity.com" target="_new">SavageStupidity.com</a> 

                has since generated over 2 million hits and currently receives 

                more than 60,000 unique page views every month (and climbing).
