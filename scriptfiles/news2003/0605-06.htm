- June 5 - Vowing to "tighten the noose" of sanctions around General Than Shwe's military regime in Burma,  powerful U.S. Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and seven other influential U.S. Senators today introduced legislation that will greatly  expand international pressure on Burma. Included in the bill are measures that will ban all U.S. imports from Burma, expand the visa ban to the regime's political arm - the "Union and Solidarity Development Association," and freeze the regime's overseas assets. Representatives Tom Lantos (D-CA)  and Peter King (R-NY)  introduced a companion bill in the House of Representatives which has already received the support of International Relations Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-IL). McConnell is joined by fellow Senators Feinstein (D- CA), John McCain (R-AZ), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Arlen Specter (R-PA), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Jon Kyl (R-AZ), and Rick Santorum (R-PA).

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill comes only days after Than Shwe's regime launched a nationwide crackdown on the democracy movement in Burma that has left dozens dead and many disappeared. The crackdown began Friday with an attack on the motorcade of democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and has continued with daily arrests of democracy activists throughout the country.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his remarks on the Senate floor introducing the legislation, Senator McConnell, visibly furious with the military regime, emphasized that the U.S. "must lead" international support for Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma's democracy movement. Both Senators McConnell and McCain harshly criticized the Japanese government's idle response to the ongoing crackdown

</font>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. is currently one of the largest export markets for Burma's regime. Last year, Burma exported over $300 million to the U.S., while importing only $10 million. Over 80% of U.S. imports from Burma consist of apparel and textiles. In April, a major apparel industry association of several hundred corporate members, the American Apparel and Footwear Association, called for the U.S. to ban apparel, textile, and footwear imports from Burma, citing the regime's atrocious human rights abuses and attacks on democracy. The Association represents approx-imately 80% of wholesale apparel sales of U.S. companies.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are witnessing horrible organized crimes conducted by Burma's military regime," said Aung Din, Director of Policy for the Free Burma Coalition. "This is the time to take action for regime change. The people of Burma can' t wait for more talk - we need action."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. has vowed to raise the issue of the crackdown in Burma with other members of the United Nations Security Council. In today's remarks, Senator McConnell endorsed bringing up the situation in Burma at the Council.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sanctions push follows several strong statements from members of Congress today and yesterday. Senators and Representatives called for the immediate release of Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung San Suu Kyi and other leaders of the National League for Democracy (NLD). All the statements harshly condemned the regime for its new crackdown on the democracy movement.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following are quotes from statements made on the Congress floor and/or entered into the Congressional record today and yesterday:

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY and Majority Whip): "Between the attack and the closure of NLD offices and universities, the SPDC has launched a blitzkrieg on freedom in Burma. .It is past time to hold the SPDC accountable for the many injustices it has inflicted upon the people of Burma. It is time for regime change in Burma."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator John McCain (R-AZ): "American and international policy towards Burma should reflect our conviction that oppression and impunity must come to an end, and that the regime must move towards a negotiated settlement with Aung San Suu Kyi that grants her a leading and irreversible political role culminating in free and fair national elections."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Tom Lantos (D-CA): "The tough sanctions legislation I am introducing ... sends a clear signal that Burma's human rights violators will be punished severely. .The brutal treatment and arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi cannot stand."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Joseph Pitts (R-PA): "The people of Burma have suffered for too long from the SPDC, from campaigns of systematic rape, murder, forced labor, destruction of villages, food sources, and a myriad of other atrocities, including the deaths of many small children."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA): "Today, this Congress needs to be aware of what is going on in Burma, and we must warn the dictators in Burma they will not get away with the dirty deed if they have touched one hair on the head of Aung San Suu Kyi."
