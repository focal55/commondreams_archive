The suit charges that the NYPD knowingly created a hostile climate on the day of the protest by blockading the streets leading to the rally thus creating an &#147;enormous bottleneck of thousands of demonstrators,&#148; an NYPD practice known as &#147;pens.&#148; As a result many protestors found themselves trapped and subsequently attacked and/or arrested by the police department.

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">William Goodman, a partner in the firm said, &#147;The most disturbing thing is that because the Mayor and Police commissioner didn&#146;t agree with the message of the demonstration, they chose to violate the most basic provisions of the Constitution for tens of thousands of New Yorkers.&#148; </font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jonathan Moore, also a partner in the firm, added, &#147;The NYPD, which in the past has stopped and arrested so many New Yorkers merely because of their race, is now doing the same based upon political views.&#148;</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amy Haus a plaintiff in the case was allegedly shoved to the ground and trampled by police horse while trying to attend the rally. When Ms. Haus requested immediate medical attention for her injuries all police officers refused assistance. As a result of the incident she has suffered serious injuries which require surgery. </font></p>
