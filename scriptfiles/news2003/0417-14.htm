                VA - April 17 - <i>The following was released today by Essential 

                Action: </i></font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, Licensed 

                  to Kill, Inc, the world's newest multinational tobacco company, 

                  publicly announced its incorporation with the launch of the 

                  company's website: <a href="http://www.licensedtokill.biz" target="_new">www.licensedtokill.biz</a>. 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Licensed 

                  to Kill, Inc., was officially incorporated in the state of Virginia 

                  on March 19, 2003. The company's purpose, as stated in its articles 

                  of incorporation, is &quot;the manufacture and marketing of 

                  tobacco products in a way that each year kills over 400,000 

                  Americans and 4.5 million other persons worldwide.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The name 

                  &quot;Licensed to Kill&quot; derives from the Latin words 'licere' 

                  and 'caedere,' meaning 'permission to kill.' The name connotes 

                  an enterprise that is fully authorized by the state to aim for 

                  peak performance and constant improvement in killing for profit. 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new 

                  company is banking on its brutal honesty to spare itself from 

                  the multitude of lawsuits currently plaguing other companies 

                  within the industry. Many of these lawsuits have centered on 

                  the tobacco industry's long history of lies and deception about 

                  the deadly nature of the business. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Licensed 

                  to Kill, Inc. thanks the Commonwealth of Virginia's State Corporation 

                  Commission for granting it permission to exist, noting that 

                  the societal restrictions on serial killing luckily do not apply 

                  to corporations. </font></p>
