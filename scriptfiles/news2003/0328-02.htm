                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About Madison 

                Hobley: Madison Hobley is one of a group of former death row inmates 

                called the "Death Row Ten," whose cases were all characterized 

                by police brutality, torture, and coerced confessions under the 

                oversight of former Chicago Police Commander John Burge. Mr. Hobley 

                was wrongfully convicted of starting a fire in his apartment building 

                that killed seven people-- including his own wife and son. He 

                was tortured by Chicago police, who fabricated a confession that 

                was used against him at his trial. Now a free man, he has declared 

                that he is on "a mission to end the death penalty." </font>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About the Speaking 

                Tour: The CEDP Speaking Tour was prompted by the historic events 

                that took place this past January, when Illinois governor George 

                Ryan made national headlines by emptying Illinois's death row, 

                pardoning four inmates and commuting the sentences of all others. 

                This speaking tour presents the opportunity to hear people speak 

                out about a system that is fundamentally flawed; particularly 

                a man whose unique--but hardly exceptional--experience is ironclad 

                evidence of the failings of capital punishment and the criminal 

                justice system as a whole. </font> 

                <p></p>

                The Campaign to End the Death Penalty is a national grassroots 

                organization dedicated to the abolition of Capital Punishment.
