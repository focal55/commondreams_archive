                - February 26 - President George W. Bush is meeting today with 

                members of the Latino Coalition and others supporting the nomination 

                of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. 

                What President Bush will not tell Americans is that, contrary 

                to reports that the Hispanic community is evenly divided over 

                the Estrada nomination, a significant majority of major Hispanic 

                legal, civil rights, and worker rights organizations have joined 

                the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and other national and community 

                leaders in energetically opposing Estrada's confirmation. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is remarkable 

                hypocrisy and dishonesty demonstrated by those who complain that 

                the filibuster against Estrada's nomination is somehow unprecedented 

                or grounded in bigotry when many of the same people participated 

                in or supported filibusters and less public backroom blockades 

                against a number of President Clinton's well-qualified Hispanic 

                judicial nominees, some of whom never even got a hearing, and 

                some who were prevented from getting a vote for as long as four 

                years. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush 

                will probably not acknowledge that 15 former presidents of the 

                National Hispanic Bar Association recently signed a statement 

                opposing Estrada's nomination. They say Estrada's candidacy falls 

                short in the critical areas of having demonstrated a commitment 

                to the concept of equal opportunity and equal justice under the 

                law and the extent to which he has been involved in, supportive 

                of, and responsive to the issues, needs and concerns of Hispanic 

                Americans. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush 

                will most likely not call attention to the editorial published 

                by United Farm Workers Co-Founder Dolores Huerta decrying the 

                role that Estrada's nomination is playing in the larger effort 

                to shift the federal courts to the right. "To my friends who think 

                this is all about politicians fighting among themselves," she 

                wrote, "I ask you to think what would have happened over the last 

                40 years if the federal courts were fighting against workers' 

                rights and womens' rights and civil rights. And then think about 

                how quickly that could become the world we are living in." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush 

                will almost certainly not mention that in addition to the Congressional 

                Hispanic Caucus, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational 

                Fund (MALDEF), and the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education 

                Fund (PRLDEF), groups opposing Estrada's confirmation include 

                United Farm Workers of America, United States Hispanic Leadership 

                Institute, Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, 

                Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, La Raza Lawyers 

                Association of California, Farm Labor Organizing Committee, William 

                C. Velasquez Institute, Coalition of Immokalee Workers, PCUN (Pineros 

                y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste/ Northwest Treeplanters and Farmworkers 

                United), National Farm Worker Ministry, The Farmworker Association 

                of Florida, the California branch of the League of United Latin 

                American Citizens (LULAC) and LULAC of Montgomery County, Maryland. 

                These organizations and leaders have expressed their opposition 

                to Estrada's troubling record on issues facing the Hispanic community 

                such as discrimination and racial profiling, and his unwillingness 

                to discuss his judicial philosophy regarding constitutional law 

                and civil rights principles that are crucial to the protection 

                of individuals' civil rights. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush 

                will probably remain mum about the fact that Estrada's confirmation 

                is being aggressively championed by far-right organizations that 

                are trying to fill the federal courts with judges who embrace 

                the states' rights legal philosophy championed by the Federalist 

                Society of which Estrada is a member and by Supreme Court Justices 

                Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We sincerely 

                hope that Bush will not repeat the offensive suggestions by Republican 

                senators and former White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray that opposition 

                to Estrada's nomination is anti-Hispanic or motivated by bigotry 

                and a desire to deny job opportunities to Hispanic Americans. 

                The widespread opposition to Estrada's confirmation by so many 

                groups and individuals dedicated to promoting equal opportunity 

                and equality under the law makes it clear that that rhetoric is 

                unfair and untrue. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the 

                administration's allies on the Estrada nomination are conservative-leaning 

                business groups like the Latino Coalition and its affiliated Hispanic 

                Business Roundtable, which have been consistent cheerleaders for 

                the Bush administration's economic policies. The Latino Coalition 

                has accused the Senate of "racial profiling" of Hispanic judicial 

                nominations, but we have seen no evidence that the group, which 

                was founded in 1995, spoke out when the Republican-led Senate 

                blocked several well-qualified Hispanic appeals court nominees 

                from even getting a hearing or vote during the Clinton administration, 

                or denounced GOP senators for stalling the nomination of appeals 

                court nominee Richard Paez for four years. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lack of 

                credibility for accusations by the White House and Senate Republicans 

                that Estrada is being treated differently than other nominees 

                extends to other areas in which the facts have been made public 

                but Estrada's proponents keep sticking to the same misleading 

                talking points. Administration officials, for example, refuse 

                to acknowledge that there is ample precedent under both Republican 

                and Democratic administrations for the release of internal Justice 

                Department documents to senators evaluating judicial and other 

                high level nominees. Senator Patrick Leahy recently released documentation 

                for a number of examples in which the Senate has requested, and 

                past Justice Departments have provided, similar memoranda written 

                by Justice Department attorneys. The examples he cited included 

                the nominations of Robert Bork to become Associate Justice of 

                the Supreme Court; William Bradford Reynolds, Assistant Attorney 

                General for the Civil Rights Division, to become Associate Attorney 

                General; Benjamin Civiletti, nominated by President Carter to 

                become Attorney General; Stephen Trott, nominated to become a 

                judge in the Ninth Circuit; and then-Justice William Rehnquist, 

                who was nominated by President Reagan to become Chief Justice.
