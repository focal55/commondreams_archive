                VA - April 15 - Revelations that some New Jersey foster homes 

                are houses of horror for the children forced to live in them are 

                still another indication that New Jersey needs to do more to keep 

                families together, a national child advocacy group said Tuesday. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Richard Wexler, 

                executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection 

                Reform, added that "bad as some foster homes are, the record of 

                orphanages -- often touted as an alternative -- is even worse." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NCCPR was responding 

                to records released in connection with a class-action lawsuit 

                brought by Children's Rights Inc. against the New Jersey Division 

                of Youth and Family Services (DYFS). The records concerned 17 

                examples of severe, sometimes fatal, abuse of New Jersey foster 

                children. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"On one point 

                DYFS is correct," Wexler said. "These cases do not represent the 

                majority of New Jersey foster parents, who do the best they can 

                for the children in their care -- like most parents, period. But 

                the rate of abuse in foster care nationwide is far higher than 

                in the general population, far higher than generally realized 

                -- and far higher than official statistics reveal. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As damning 

                as the abuse itself is the persistent pattern of DYFS turning 

                its back on such abuse. Abuse was ignored in cases with more red 

                flags than a Soviet May Day parade." That problem is common across 

                the country, Wexler said. As a result, official statistics grossly 

                underestimate the rate of abuse in foster care. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wexler noted 

                that revelations of abuse in foster care often lead to calls to 

                put more children in group homes and institutions, "in other words, 

                orphanages." But he said children are even more likely to be abused 

                when they are institutionalized. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"But more important, 

                while good foster parents can turn a child's life around, the 

                scholarly literature is virtually unanimous about institutions: 

                'Good orphanage' is an oxymoron. Institutionalizing children in 

                and of itself causes them harm. Indeed, the evidence is so overwhelming 

                that the federal government now rates child welfare systems in 

                part on their ability to reduce the number of children under age 

                12 who are institutionalized. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wexler said 

                a better alternative is doing more to keep families together in 

                the first place. "Many children are taken from parents who are 

                neither brutally abusive nor hopelessly addicted. Far more often, 

                a parent's poverty is confused with "neglect." Other cases fall 

                on a broad continuum between the extremes, the parents neither 

                all victim nor all villain. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Get these 

                families the help they need so their children can come home, and 

                there will be plenty of room in good foster homes for children 

                in real danger -- and no one will even think of bringing back 

                the orphanage."
