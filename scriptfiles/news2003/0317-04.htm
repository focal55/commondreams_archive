                - March 17 - In a letter addressed to the American people and 

                to President Bush, the Iraqi Dominican Sisters have asked the 

                people of the United States to work for peace, even in this eleventh 

                hour, after the Azores Summit, while news reports project the 

                end of diplomacy. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter 

                uses strong language to call for a peaceful resolution to the 

                conflict. "We presume that as Christians you have hearts full 

                of love and compassion," it reads. "You will pity our Iraqi children, 

                our elderly, and our youth that have no hope in a better future 

                and a decent life." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"President 

                Bush defends the rights of animals," the letter continues. "Have 

                we less value than animals? He claims that he is trying to defend 

                human rights in Iraq. He is willing to build a new Iraq. He tried 

                to convince the people in US and the peoples round the world that 

                he will only bomb the army and the weapons in the country. He 

                promises that he is not going to bring any harm to the civilians. 

                Is he throwing flowers on people?" </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, the 

                Defense Department is planning a massive strike against Baghdad, 

                dubbed "shock and awe," in which thousands of bombs will be dropped 

                in an effort to shock the Iraqi military into surrender. Those 

                bombs will put many of the Dominican Sisters and their neighbors 

                in direct peril. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We have two 

                convents: one at the beginning of the army camp and the other 

                at the end," the letter says. "Will the bombing kill the soldiers 

                or the people? We are living in great fright, panic, and extreme 

                worry." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sisters 

                say they and all of the people of Iraq are also suffering from 

                months of psychological warfare, "since President Bush has started 

                his inhuman threats to initiate another war on our people. The 

                uncertain moments and the hard current times have made us wait 

                for our death in no time." The letter continues, "Everyday we 

                thank God for being alive because we do not know what tomorrow 

                has hidden for us." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter 

                implies that the universities closed their doors on March 15 in 

                preparation for war. "Our university students have waved goodbye 

                to each other...and they are prepared for the war. They have no 

                mood for study. We think they are right because they are disappointed 

                and hope for them seems the most hopeless thing. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The war is 

                not only disastrous and destructive in its direct effects, but 

                also in its lasting effects. The innocent people will not only 

                be the victims of the bombing, but also the prey of contaminated 

                drinking water, polluted environments, depleted uranium, inadequate 

                medical supply, and crippled electric power." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter 

                was sent to the Dominican Sisters in Springfield, Ill., who are 

                part of the effort of the Dominican sisters, brothers, priests, 

                laity, and associates in the United States and around the world 

                who have worked since 1998 to bring to the world's attention the 

                humanitarian consequences of the 1991 Gulf War and twelve years 

                of the most comprehensive economic sanctions ever imposed in the 

                history of the United Nations. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These are 

                the pleas of our sisters," says Sister Mary Jean Traeger, OP, 

                prioress general of the Springfield congregation. "How could we 

                ignore them? I add my voice to the voices of our Iraqi sisters 

                and ask President Bush and the people of the United States to 

                walk away from war and embrace a peaceful solution to this dangerous 

                situation." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>There are 

                about 200 native Iraqi Dominican sisters, brothers, and priests, 

                as well as a large community of Dominican laity in Iraq. </i>
