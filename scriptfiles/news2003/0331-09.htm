                - March 31 - As part of the Bush administration's campaign to 

                roll back the nation's environmental protections, the Pentagon 

                is seeking sweeping, unwarranted exemptions from five major laws 

                safeguarding public health and wildlife. Congress is now considering 

                legislation that, if approved, will grant the Department of Defense 

                (DoD) immunity from the Clean Air Act (CAA), Superfund (CERCLA), 

                Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Marine Mammal Protection 

                Act (MMPA), and Endangered Species Act (ESA). A full analysis 

                of the Pentagon's proposal is available in the NRDC press release 

                archive.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The General 

                  Accounting Office has concluded that (1) the military is at 

                  a high state of readiness and (2) the DoD has failed to demonstrate 

                  that compliance with the nation's environmental laws has significantly 

                  impeded training. However, Pentagon officials continue to blame 

                  these important anti-pollution and wildlife protection statutes 

                  for restricting training and readiness restrictions.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps 

                  sensing the benefit of politicizing this issue as troop training 

                  versus wildlife protection, the Pentagon has targeted the Endangered 

                  Species Act as a particularly burdensome. But when it comes 

                  to purported problems posed by ESA compliance, the Pentagon's 

                  only &quot;evidence&quot; consists of highly misleading and, 

                  in some cases, completely inaccurate anecdotes.</font></p>

                  Says... &quot;At Camp Pendleton, proposed critical habitat under 

                  the Endangered Species Act would cover 57 percent of the base...&quot; 

                  (Congressional testimony of Raymond F. DuBois, Deputy Undersecretary 

                  of Defense, March 13, 2003.)</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Fact 

                  is... This refers to all lands for which critical habitat has 

                  ever been &quot;proposed,&quot; even though the U.S. Fish and 

                  Wildlife Service (USFWS) eventually excluded from its final 

                  designation all but 875 acres of the base's 120,000 acres of 

                  training land. Despite the presence of 18 endangered species, 

                  less than four percent of the base is designated as critical 

                  habitat for any species. It is worth noting that local base 

                  commanders have lauded Camp Pendleton's successful efforts to 

                  protect the endangered snowy plover. The Pentagon recently heralded 

                  the camp in its &quot;We're Saving a Few Good Species&quot; 

                  publicity campaign with a poster declaring that &quot;an elite 

                  military force can train in environmentally sensitive areas 

                  and protect a threatened species at the same time.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pentagon 

                  Says&#133;Critical habitat restrictions would include &quot;all

                  (DuBois' congressional testimony, March 13, 2003.)</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Fact 

                  is... Large-scale amphibious landings are limited on two to 

                  three miles of the 17-mile beach, and only during the five-to 

                  six-month nesting seasons of the endangered Western snowy plover 

                  and California least tern. The biggest limitation on training 

                  is not critical habitat designation but the presence of Interstate 

                  5, the San Onofre Nuclear Generation Plant, a railroad, and 

                  other topographic access limitations. Perhaps in recognition 

                  of these geographic constraints, the FY03 defense authorization 

                  bill provides Camp Pendleton with funding to purchase land near 

                  the base as a buffer from additional development and sprawl.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pentagon 

                  Says... The proposed ESA exemption is narrowly tailored and 

                  will only apply to portions of Camp Pendleton and other military 

                  bases needed for training.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Fact 

                  is&#133;The exemption would apply to land owned by the military 

                  even if used for non-military purposes. In the case of Camp 

                  Pendleton, the exemption would apply to San Onofre State Park, 

                  which is leased to the State of California by the Marine Corps. 

                  San Onofre is the 10th most popular park in California and currently 

                  is home to several endangered and threatened species and their 

                  designated critical habitat. However, because the park is &quot;owned&quot; 

                  by the DoD, the exemption would preclude any designation of 

                  critical habitat on park property.</font></p>

                  500-yard training lane, and only during the birds' five- to 

                  six-month nesting season. The Navy has acknowledged the importance

                  the 1994 designation of critical habitat. The primary reason 

                  was to prevent maneuvers from accidentally going off the fort's 

                  boundary; protecting the desert tortoise was a secondary benefit. 

                  Even so, USFWS permits the Army to &quot;take&quot; or kill 

                  up to 36 tortoises per year, and in 1995, the Army received 

                  permission to lift protection from several key tortoise populations 

                  across thousands of acres.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Fact 

                  is... The loggerhead shrike, which first became imperiled on

                  the bird's habitat, has rebounded from 13 to 106 birds, thanks 

                  to conservation efforts. The use of live ordinance is restricted 

                  from June to October (not during the February-June breeding 

                  season) because of the risk of fire. This could be remedied 

                  by the use of inert ordinance, of which the Marine Corps has 

                  failed to keep an adequate inventory for use in training.</font></p>

                  claims... At Makua Valley there are many training restrictions 

                  based on a Biological Opinion, and a litigation settlement that 

                  allows less than 18 Combined Arms Live-Fire Exercises per year 

                  required by the 25th Light Infantry Division. (U.S. Army talking

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Fact 

                  is... The Makua valley is home to more than 40 endangered plant 

                  and animal species. In 1999 the Army reached a voluntary settlement 

                  with local groups, which allowed for continued training on the 

                  Makua Military Reservation on Oahu. The settlement agreement 

                  was based on a National Environmental Policy Act case, which 

                  has nothing to do with the exemptions currently being sought 

                  by the Pentagon. In any case, under that agreement, the Army 

                  continues to train as necessary. For example, the Army requested 

                  that they be allowed 18 training exercises -- the amount they 

                  determined was necessary for joint training -- and ended up 

                  only conducting 13 exercises. This year the Army requested 9 

                  trainings, and so far has conducted two.</font></p>

                  cannot come closer than 50 feet from certain trees. (U.S. Army

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Fact 

                  is... In the early 1990s, the Army stated it was having trouble 

                  training due to the red-cockaded woodpecker restrictions. The 

                  USFWS asked for a list of additional training activities the 

                  Army would like to carry out within the 200-foot buffer areas 

                  -- all of which were approved in 1996. Since then, the Army 

                  has not made any other requests. It is important to note that 

                  none of the Army installations with red-cockaded woodpeckers 

                  have designated &quot;critical habitat,&quot; which means that 

                  the exemptions sought by the Pentagon would have no effect on 

                  training at these bases. Currently, only 8,000 acres out of 

                  200,000 are affected by habitat protections at Fort Bragg; only 

                  about 1,000 acres are affected out of 100,000 at Fort Polk.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite 

                  recent concerns raised by Pentagon brass, commanders at installations 

                  with red-cockaded woodpeckers have celebrated this success and 

                  highlighted how woodpecker conservation programs establish a 

                  model for balancing training and conservation needs. For example, 

                  Major General David M. Mize, Marine Corps Base Camp Lejuene, 

                  recently stated: &quot;Returning to the old myth that military 

                  training and conservation are mutually exclusive, this notion 

                  has been repeatedly and demonstrably debunked. In the overwhelming 

                  majority of cases, with a good plan along with common sense 

                  and flexibility, military training and the conservation and 

                  recovery of endangered species can very successfully coexist.&quot;

                  in the United States. With just about 30 animals left, it is 

                  one of the most endangered species of large mammals in the world. 

                  The pronghorn's continued existence is threatened by air and 

                  ground maneuvers, including bombing, strafing, artillery fire 

                  and low-level flights. Despite this fact, the Pentagon's proposed 

                  exemptions would not apply here because USFWS has not designated 

                  any of the range as critical habitat for the pronghorn out of 

                  fear that doing so could seriously limit the Air Force's ability 

                  to modify missions on its lands. In return, the Air Force is 

                  cooperating with the Interior Department, the Nature Conservancy, 

                  and the Sonoran Institute on a conservation strategy.</font></p>

                  WA</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pentagon 

                  Says... &quot;Training is limited on 72 percent of Fort Lewis 

                  to protect a bird species that does not even live on the installation. 

                  Seventy two percent, (approximately 63,000 acres) of the installation 

                  is designated critical habitat-for the Northern Spotted Owl, 

                  even though no owls are currently located on the installation.&quot;

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Fact 

                  is... Habitat destruction caused by rampant development and 

                  unsustainable logging has left Fort Lewis with one of the last 

                  intact forest areas in the Puget Sound Basin suitable for endangered 

                  species recovery. Still, USFWS dropped its proposed critical 

                  habitat designation by 84 percent -- from 4.7 million acres 

                  to 58,000 acres. Although endangered spotted owls may not permanently 

                  live on the base, the owls are expected to utilize critical 

                  habitat on Ft. Lewis (at least seasonally).</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As noted 

                  before, critical habitat designation is not a de facto ban on 

                  military activities. In fact, the military has hailed Fort Lewis 

                  as a conservation success story. Gen. James Hill, former Fort 

                  Lewis commander, told a U.S. Senate committee, &quot;I am a 

                  good steward of the environment because of two reasons: It's 

                  the law, and it's the right thing to do.&quot; (&quot;Fragile 

                  species, military might strain to co-exist at Fort Lewis,&quot; 

                  Seattle Times, January 19, 2003) Additionally, Paul Steucke, 

                  chief of the environment and natural resources division at Fort 

                  Lewis, said the base has long been able to find a balance between 

                  environmental protection and military necessity. &quot;I can't 

                  honestly tell you that (troops) can't continue their mission,&quot; 

                  Steucke said. &quot;I don't think the exemptions would change 

                  our management approach.&quot; (&quot;Military doesn't want 

                  to go green. Pentagon pushing for exemption from environmental

                  sea turtles have restricted training at this range, including 

                  the possibility of halting the entire training exercise for 

                  a Carrier Battle Group in the event of observing a single sea 

                  turtle.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Fact 

                  is... As a result of formal consultation under the ESA, the 

                  Navy agreed to institute precautionary conservation measures. 

                  In response, USFWS issued a no-jeopardy Biological Opinion allowing 

                  battle group exercises to go forward without fear of delay due 

                  to ESA. The Navy's conservation measures, such as the relocation 

                  of turtle eggs to a hatchery during amphibious landings, have 

                  resulted in the successful hatching of over 17,000 hawksbill 

                  and leatherneck sea turtle eggs.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ESA is A-OK</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ESA 

                  poses no threat to military readiness because the USFWS frequently 

                  excludes military lands from critical habitat designations. 

                  In the rare cases where critical habitat has been designated, 

                  DoD has never indicated -- nor has it proved -- that this level 

                  of wildlife protection is an obstacle to achieving readiness. 

                  That's because critical habitat does not render land off-limits 

                  to military use; such protection only requires that DoD consult 

                  with the USFWS before undertaking training that might adversely 

                  modify wildlife habitat. As a case-in-point, DoD has never found 

                  it necessary to invoke the existing &quot;national security&quot; 

                  exemption currently provided by the ESA. Clearly, the evidence 

                  shows that the U.S. military has been able to carry out its 

                  training mission while complying with the ESA, as well as the 

                  nation's other environmental laws.</font></p>
