                - March 4 - The East Timor Action Network U.S. (ETAN) today urged 

                the United Nations to support the prosecution of top Indonesian 

                officials accused of committing crimes against humanity in East 

                Timor. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week, 

                in a move ETAN called "vitally important for East Timor's future 

                stability," prosecutors in East Timor filed indictments against 

                high-ranking Indonesian officers. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the Indonesian 

                government quickly dismissed the indictments, ETAN called for 

                international pressure to ensure that those responsible for decades 

                of torture, rape, forced sterilization, deliberate starvation 

                and mass murder face justice. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We urge the 

                UN as well as the Bush administration to press Indonesia to extradite 

                officials charged by prosecutors in East Timor with crimes against 

                humanity and other serious crimes," said John M. Miller, spokesperson 

                for ETAN. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The crimes 

                alleged in the indictments were committed against a UN mission 

                created by the Security Council. They involved assaults on both 

                UN personnel and the East Timorese population," said Miller. Ten 

                East Timorese who worked for the UN in organizing the 1999 independence 

                ballot were among the estimated one-to-two thousand who died.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The UN official 

                spokesperson's only comment on the indictments to date is a request 

                to the media that "that in [the] future you'll say, 'East Timor 

                indicts,' and not 'the United Nations indicts.'" </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Instead of 

                splitting hairs, the UN should be forcefully advocating that those 

                responsible for such serious crimes be brought to justice," responded 

                Miller. "The UN must heed East Timorese victims' cries for justice 

                or risk endangering its own missions." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The nature 

                of the crimes committed, the inability of the new nation of East 

                Timor to seek justice on its own and the violence targeted at 

                the UN all necessitate international involvement," added Miller. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"UN Secretary-General 

                Kofi Annan and the Security Council must establish an international 

                tribunal with sufficient authority and resources to try these 

                and other suspects," Miller said. "The tribunal must also investigate 

                war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed during 

                Indonesia's illegal occupation of East Timor prior to 1999." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week, 

                the Serious Crimes Unit (SCU) in East Timor issued several indictments 

                against senior Indonesian military officials, East Timorese militia 

                leaders and others. The most wide-ranging accuse former commander 

                General Wiranto and other high-ranking Indonesian military officials 

                of crimes against humanity "undertaken as part of a widespread 

                or systematic attack directed against the civilian population 

                of East Timor," according to a statement by the SCU. The indictment 

                further accuses the commanders of "funding, arming, training and 

                directing the militia.... The militia groups acted together with 

                TNI in a planned and systematic campaign which led to crimes against 

                humanity being committed across East Timor during the 1999 period."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The SCU was 

                established by the United Nations Transitional Authority in East 

                Timor (UNTAET) under authority granted by UN Security Council 

                Resolution 1272 to set up a system to administer justice in the 

                territory. The resolution demanded that those responsible for 

                violence be brought to justice. UNTAET also created Special Panels 

                of judges to hear serious crimes cases from 1999. The Serious 

                Crimes Unit now operates as a unit of the newly-independent country's 

                Office of the General. The Secretary-General has regularly reported 

                to the SecurityCouncil on the work of the SCU and Special Panels.
