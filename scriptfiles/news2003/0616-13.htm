</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What was once a whalers' club has become a force for conservation,&quot; said a jubilant Dr. Chris Tuite, Director of Wildlife and Habitat with the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) as the decision was announced.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For many years, the IWC stood by while one species of whale after another was virtually wiped out, but in recent years it has moved increasingly towards protecting whales with decisions including the whaling moratorium in 1986 and the creation of a Southern Ocean whale sanctuary in 1994.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposal agreed on today by IWC member nations has been dubbed the 'Berlin Initiative' and calls for the creation of a conservation committee to meet and organize future protection work on all species of whales and dolphins -- large and small. It will address many threats to whales and dolphins, including entanglement in fishing gear, pollution, and collisions with shipping vessels.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 'Berlin Initiative' was proposed by Australia, Austria, Brazil, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Sweden, U.K., and the U.S.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was carried with 25 countries voting in favor, 20 against, and 1 abstention.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFAW has worked closely with non-whaling countries, particularly Mexico and Germany, the host nation of this meeting, to formalize this move towards conservation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFAW President Fred O'Regan said, &quot;Whales around the world are safer today thanks to this landmark decision. It marks a move from centuries of exploitation to a new century of wildlife conservation.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many people around the world believe that whaling ended with the moratorium in 1986, but in fact it still continues and is increasing. Norway and Japan continue to hunt more than 1,300 whales a year. Iceland has announced its intention to join them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFAW hopes that today's decision will enable stronger action against whaling nations and an end to commercial whaling.</font></p>
