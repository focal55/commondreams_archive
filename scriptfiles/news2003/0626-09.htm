- June 26 - With much of the nation gasping under &quot;code red&quot; smog alerts, the nonprofit Clean Air Trust is calling on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to protect breathers by adopting a more effective smog control strategy. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Trust also urged EPA to publicly disavow a call by smokestack industries for the Bush Administration to grant waivers that would permit polluters to increase pollution this summer. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Trust's comments will be presented tomorrow as EPA holds a hearing on its proposal to adopt a strategy to meet tougher new smog standards set by the Clinton Administration in 1997. The Trust believes the Bush Administration proposal will prolong smog problems unnecessarily. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;EPA's proposal is a prescription for cleanup delay, and an invitation for polluters to game the system. Breathers will suffer the consequences,&quot; said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We believe that EPA's proposal would condemn tens of millions of Americans to continue breathing unhealthful levels of smog for years,&quot; O'Donnell said. &quot;In a purported effort to offer 'flexibility,' EPA is really giving breaks to big polluters.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'Donnell disclosed that already this year at least 35 states and the District of Columbia have experienced unhealthful smog levels above the new eight-hour ozone standard, according to information gathered by Clean Air Trust volunteers based on EPA and state reports. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These include not just states infamous for smog such as California and Texas, but states throughout the nation, from Oklahoma to Ohio, Louisiana to Vermont, and Iowa to Arizona,&quot; O'Donnell noted. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He also assailed a recent call by some smokestack industries for EPA and states to grant &quot;waivers&quot; from pollution control requirements in order to reduce use of natural gas. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The waiver request comes from an industry lobby called the Industrial Energy Consumers of America (IECA), which includes the plastics, cement, paper, food processing, chemical, steel, pharmaceutical and other industries </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among a series of recommendations to the Bush Administration and Congress, the industry lobby urges President Bush to &quot;direct the appropriate federal and state agencies to allow permit holders temporary waivers from the confines of their existing operating permits until the natural gas crisis is over. This includes summer NOx rules to keep the coal fired units running. The waivers should include the operational flexibility necessary to accomplish all of the above.&quot; The suggestion was among those floated in advance of a &quot;summit&quot; on natural gas prices in Washington, D.C. today. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;However the industry lobby tries to spin this, suspending smog controls would mean more dirty air, and more public health damage. It would also show that so-called market systems for pollution cleanup don't always work,&quot; O'Donnell said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Uncontrolled increases in coal burning would also mean more fine-particle soot -- and more premature death. The Bush Administration should immediately reject this proposal to demonstrate that it isn't caving in to the dirty-air lobby.&quot; </font></p>
