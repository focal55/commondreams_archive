- July 21 -  As Americans begin the holiday season, a new website, <a href="http://www.SaveSummer.org" target="_new">SaveSummer.org</a>, highlights a major threat to some favorite summertime destinations. More than 60 percent of America's creeks and streams, and tens of millions of acres of the nation's ponds and wetlands, stand to lose federal protection under a Bush administration proposal to weaken Clean Water Act safeguards. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Many Americans  plan their holidays around visits to favorite swimming holes and fishing spots,&quot; said Joan Mulhern, senior legislative counsel for Earthjustice. &quot;Unfortunately, by next summer, many of these special places may no longer have federal protection from polluters.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In January 2003 the Bush administration announced a proposal that is the first step in an effort to severely limit the ability of the Clean Water Act to protect many of the nation's waters, including many of the special places where Americans spend their summers. Small streams, natural ponds, and wetlands are all at risk of losing federal protections under this proposal. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Limiting the scope of the Clean Water Act's protections would have devastating effects, not only during the summer months, but year-round, too. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Removing essential federal safeguards against pollution and destruction of our waters will: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; remove federal prohibitions against dumping pollution in waters; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; place community water supplies at risk; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; make swimming holes, fishing spots and other recreational waters dirtier; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; harm endangered or threatened wildlife species - 43 percent of which rely on wetlands for survival. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At SaveSummer.org, visitors can learn more about this damaging proposal, and take action to help protect the nation's waters. The website offers information about the dangers posed by the Bush plan; data on what percentage of stream miles is at risk in each state, as well as state comments on the proposal; and names some of the polluting industries that are behind the administration's plan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Visitors to the site can also fax letters asking their Congress members to oppose the Bush administration's proposal, and to support a bill now before Congress that would ensure that the protection of the Clean Water Act continues to cover all our nation's waters-as it was always intended to. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When Congress passed the Clean Water Act 30 years ago - by an overwhelming bi-partisan margin - it clearly said that no industry has the right to pollute the nation's waters, and that every community in the country deserves clean water,&quot; Mulhern said. &quot;The Bush administration is trying to flip the law on its head: under its plan, it seems that every industry deserves to pollute as much as it likes, and that no community has a right to clean water.&quot; </font></p>
