                - March 26 - Public schools have no legal obligation to help an 

                evangelical Christian group promote itself to young school children, 

                Americans United for Separation of Church and State has advised 

                a federal appeals court.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans 

                  United and allied groups filed a joint friend-of-the-court brief 

                  March 25 arguing that a New Jersey public school does not have 

                  to allow the Child Evangelism Fellowship (CEF) to post signs 

                  in schools, participate in a &quot;back-to-school night&quot; 

                  and require teachers to distribute its promotional fliers in 

                  class.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The brief 

                  argues that if these activities are allowed, young children 

                  could easily assume that CEF is a school project that is backed 

                  by teachers and administrators.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When 

                  they see their teachers give them CEF flyers, when they see 

                  the flyers posted on the walls of their school hallways, and 

                  when they see CEF representatives at school-sponsored 'Back-to-School 

                  Nights,' elementary school children will reasonably conclude 

                  that their school endorses CEF&#146;s religious message,&quot; 

                  asserts the brief. &quot;In addition, the use of teachers and 

                  school facilities to invite young children to attend Club meetings 

                  will tend to place coercive pressure on the children to submit 

                  to evangelical indoctrination.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. 

                  Supreme Court in 2001 upheld the right of CEF and other community 

                  groups to use public schools for religious and other types of 

                  meetings at the end of the school day. But AU and the other 

                  organizations argue that schools are not constitutionally required 

                  to promote these organizations to students.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;CEF 

                  is asking public schools to help it find recruits for its fundamentalist 

                  indoctrination program,&quot; said Barry W. Lynn, executive 

                  director of Americans United. &quot;Public schools have no obligation 

                  to help this or any other religious group win new converts.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn added 

                  that given CEF's aggressive proselytism -- its members believe 

                  that children as young as 5 can be converted to fundamentalism 

                  -- public schools have good reason for keep the group at arm's 

                  length.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Little 

                  children shouldn't be bombarded with ads from hard-sell evangelistic 

                  groups in public schools,&quot; said Lynn. &quot;Parents don't 

                  want that, and the Constitution does not allow it.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Continued 

                  Lynn, &quot;Groups like CEF may have the right to rent public 

                  schools after hours, but that doesn't mean public schools must 

                  help them undertake their missionary activities.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The case, 

                  Child Evangelism Fellowship v. Stafford Township School District, 

                  is pending before the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. Joining 

                  AU on the brief are the Anti-Defamation League, People For the 

                  American Way Foundation, the New Jersey Education Association 

                  and the Stafford Township Education Association.</font></p>

                  was written by Alex J. Luchenitser, Americans United's litigation
