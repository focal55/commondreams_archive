- November 17 - Remarks of William H. Meadows:</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 
sponsors of this Energy Bill have been calling it an &quot;Energy Policy&quot;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There 
is no doubt that America would be better off if we had a comprehensive energy 
policy. A true energy policy would chart a new energy future, take us in a new 
direction, and learn from the mistakes in the past to solve the real challenges 
we face today. But make no mistake about it: this bill doesn't qualify as an energy 
policy. Not even close.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It 
doesn't do anything to wean us from our dependence on oil.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It 
doesn't do anything to make cars go further on a gallon of gas.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">And 
it makes oil and gas production &quot;Job Number One&quot; for our most pristine 
and important remaining wild public lands across the Rocky Mountain West, and 
Alaska, even though those lands cannot begin to produce enough to change our dependence 
on foreign oil.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Yes, 
it spares, for now, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from a similar fate. For 
that we are grateful. But we are not fooling ourselves. If the energy conferees 
who cobbled together this grab-bag of party favors for the oil, gas, coal, and 
nuclear industries thought they could get away with it, the Arctic Refuge would 
be in there too.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This 
bill is ample evidence that the kind of closed-door, back-room process that has 
typified this conference invariably leads to legislation that benefits private 
special interests, and thumbs its nose at the public interest.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A 
poll released by Zogby International last week found 55 percent of likely voters, 
once you describe this bill to them, think it would be better if Congress didn't 
pass this bill at all. It's time for Congress to listen to the people, and toss 
this bill to in the recycling bin.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
