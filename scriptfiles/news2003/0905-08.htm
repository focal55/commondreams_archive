- September 5 - On Monday, September 8, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in McConnell v. FEC, the case that reviews the constitutionality of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), also known McCain-Feingold. The League of Women Voters of the United States, a tireless advocate for meaningful campaign finance reform, filed a &quot;friend of the court&quot; brief that asks the Court to uphold the legislation, which the League supported in Congress.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;A reversal of BCRA by the Court would be like throwing gasoline on a fire that is already out of control,&quot; stated Maxwell.  &quot;Without meaningful reform, the corruption that has escalated in recent years will continue to spread,&quot; Maxwell added. &quot;It comes down to this...should our government serve the special interests or the interests of the people?&quot; </font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;BCRA promises to restore  a tarnished campaign system,&quot; stated Maxwell. &quot;BCRA is moderate reform that simply closes the loopholes that have emerged in recent years.  The legislation brings campaigns back to where they were 15 years ago, before they were fueled by huge soft money, special interest contributions from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals,&quot; the League president said. </font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Yes to corruption or no to corruption:  that is the question that the Supreme Court will decide,&quot; according to Maxwell.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The League's brief deals specifically with &quot;sham issue&quot; advertisements -- campaign ads that masquerade as issue advocacy -- and asks the Court to uphold the original definition of electioneering communications in BCRA. &quot;We must have full disclosure on all campaign ads,&quot; Maxwell added, &quot;and that is what the new law will ensure.  Before the new law was passed, unlimited amounts of undisclosed money were being spent by individuals, corporations and other entities on &quot;sham issue&quot; ads, evading the old laws,&quot; said Maxwell.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The League's brief, available at www.lwv.org, cites examples of political operators admitting they used &quot;issue&quot; advertising to avoid restrictions in the campaign finance laws.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan political organization, encourages the informed and active participation of citizens in government, works to increase understanding of major public policy issues, and influences public policy through education and advocacy.</font></p>
