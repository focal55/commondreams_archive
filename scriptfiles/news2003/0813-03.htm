- August 13 - Galvanized to action by George W. Bush's inane and reckless &quot;Bring 'em on&quot; challenge to armed Iraqi's resisting occupation, Military Families Speak Out, Veterans for Peace and other organizations based in the military community will launch <i>Bring Them Home Now</i>, a campaign aimed at ending the U.S. occupation of Iraq and returning troops to their home bases at a press conference on August 14 at Fort Bragg in Fayetteville, N.C.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">US military casualties from the occupation of Iraq have been more than twice the number most Americans have been led to believe because of an extraordinarily high number of accidents, suicides and other non-combat deaths in the ranks that have gone largely unreported in the media. The other underreported cost of the war for US soldiers is the number of American wounded-827, officially, since Operation Iraqi Freedom began. (Unofficial figures are in the thousands.) About half have been injured since Bush's triumphant claim on board the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln at the beginning of May that major combat was over.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mission of the <i>Bring them Home Now</i> campaign is to unite the voices of military families, veterans, and GIs themselves to demanding: an end to the occupation of Iraq and other misguided military adventures and an immediate return of all US troops to their home duty stations. On August 14 at Fort Bragg, Veterans and Military Families will raise concerns about current conditions in Iraq that their loved ones and other troops are facing such as the lack of planning and support troops are receiving, as well as questions about the justifications used to send troops to Iraq in the first place.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO: Military Families and Veterans (See list of speakers below)</font></p>
