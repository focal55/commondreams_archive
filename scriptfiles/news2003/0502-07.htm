- May 2 - The federal district court today upheld some key provisions of the McCain-Feingold law, including the ban on national and state parties using soft money to run ads about federal candidates.  The court also upheld provisions of the law that restrict the use of corporate and labor funding for sham issue ads about federal candidates.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We are pleased that the court recognized the importance &#150; and the constitutionality &#150; of  some key provisions of the campaign finance law,&#148; said Chellie Pingree, president of Common Cause, which spearheaded efforts to pass the law.  &#147;The provisions upheld by the lower court are central to ending the corrupt soft money system.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To the extent that the court struck down other portions of the ban on soft money, Common Cause considers today&#146;s ruling to be disappointing, but ultimately unimportant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;At the end of the day, it&#146;s the Supreme Court that will decide the constitutionality of the soft money ban and other parts of the new reform law,&#148; Pingree said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Based on previous Supreme Court decisions and the record developed in this case, Common Cause is confident that the new law will be upheld as constitutional when the Supreme Court considers it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">History is on our side. In both of the last two times the Supreme Court ruled on campaign finance issues, it reversed lower court decisions that, like today&#146;s case, threw out reform laws. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, the Supreme Court in 2000 reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to uphold the constitutionality of campaign contribution limits.  And in FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee, the Supreme Court in 2001 reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to uphold the constitutionality of limits on coordinated political party spending. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Supreme Court has a history of upholding campaign finance reforms because the Court recognizes the threat to our democracy when Americans lose faith in their government due to real or apparent corruption,&#148; Pingree said. &#147;We&#146;re confident that this will remain true when the McCain-Feingold law now goes to the Court.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What&#146;s more, the evidence presented in this case proved what Congressional sponsors of BCRA have argued for years: the abundance of soft money was corrupting our nation&#146;s elections and had to be eliminated. Polling data introduced in the case showed that 70 percent of Americans believe that Members of Congress sometimes vote based on what large contributors to their parties want, even if it&#146;s not in the best interest of their constituents or the country. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We know that our campaign finance system needs reform,&#148; Pingree said &#147;We believe the Supreme Court will see that and uphold a law passed by a bipartisan coalition of Congress to address these crucial problems.&#148;</font></p>
