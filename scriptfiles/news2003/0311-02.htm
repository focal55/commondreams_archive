                11 - With media attention focused intensely on the U.N. Security 

                Council debate over Iraq, the London-based Observer newspaper 

                broke a major story on March 2: The United States is apparently 

                engaged in a spying campaign against the diplomatic delegations 

                from several Security Council nations. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the 

                timeliness and relevance of the Observer’s scoop, some major news 

                outlets in the United States have taken a pass on the story. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Observer 

                reported (3/2/03) that the surveillance plan "involves interception 

                of the home and office telephones and the emails of U.N. delegates 

                in New York." The paper's report is based on a National Security 

                Agency memo that directs the agency to increase its surveillance 

                of Security Council nations in order to monitor their deliberations 

                over Iraq; a "friendly" intelligence service-- evidently Great 

                Britain-- was asked to participate in this operation. The principal 

                targets the surveillance plan is aimed "against" are Angola, Cameroon, 

                Chile, Bulgaria, Guinea and Pakistan-- nations the Observer dubs 

                the "middle six," whose votes are considered crucial to an upcoming 

                Security Council resolution that would authorize the use of military 

                force. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the wake 

                of the Observer article, reports in the Washington Post and the 

                Los Angeles Times seemed to downplay the importance of the matter. 

                The L.A. Times headlined its March 4 piece "Purported Spy Memo 

                May Add to U.S. Troubles at U.N.," while the subhead read: "'Top 

                secret' document discusses bugging of council members. Forgery 

                or no, some say it's nothing to get worked up about." The lead 

                sentence referred to a "long-standing U.S. practice of spying 

                at the United Nations." The Washington Post's March 4 story, headlined 

                "Spying Report No Shock to U.N.," was similarly unimpressed with 

                the Observer’s findings. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The New York 

                Times has yet to even mention the story, now a full week after 

                it first broke. The Times did, however, find a spying story it 

                deemed worth of coverage (3/10/03): the fact that the White House 

                "has asked more than 60 countries to find and expel several hundred 

                Iraqi diplomats that the C.I.A. and others have identified as 

                suspected intelligence agents." The Times put the article on its 

                front page, although it noted that "it is unclear what proof, 

                if any, the United States [government] is providing to back up 

                its claims that the diplomats are in fact Iraqi intelligence agents." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The network 

                news shows have also not aired any reports about the Observer 

                story either, though that's not to say they weren't initially 

                interested: According to Salon.com (3/4/03), one of the report's 

                authors, Martin Bright, "said that he had agreed to interviews 

                with NBC, CNN, and Fox News Channel-- and that all three had called 

                and canceled." Salon added that the story "has quickly spread 

                throughout the world." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lack of 

                media interest in the U.S. was partly attributed to the sense 

                that spying on diplomats is not noteworthy. The prominent reporting 

                of this story in the rest of the world, as well as follow-up reporting 

                by the Observer, might suggest otherwise: The paper reported on 

                March 9 that the U.N. is conducting a "top-level investigation" 

                of the matter, while Chilean president Ricardo Lagos is demanding 

                an explanation from British prime minister Tony Blair. The Observer 

                also reported that an employee at Britain's Government Communications 

                Headquarters was arrested "on suspicion of contravening the Official 

                Secrets Act" in connection with the leaked document. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why is a story 

                that is having such wide impact around the world being nearly 

                ignored by the U.S. press? With a pending U.N. vote on military 

                force perhaps just days away, it would seem newsworthy that the 

                United States is, in the words of the NSA memo, "mounting a surge" 

                in order to obtain "the whole gamut of information that could 

                give U.S. policymakers an edge in obtaining results favorable 

                to U.S. goals or to head off surprises." For some reason, though, 

                major American media outlets have taken a pass. </font>
