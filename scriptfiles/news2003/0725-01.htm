voted to bar Indonesia from receiving military training via the prestigious IMET program.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Late last night, the House voted to strip a $600,000 appropriation for 
International Military Education and Training (IMET) for fiscal year
(FY) 
2004. The amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill comes as 
the Bush administration has indicated its intention to use a controversial 
FY03 $400,000 appropriation for IMET for Indonesia. Bush administration has 
indicated its intention to use a controversial FY03 $400,000 appropriation 
for IMET for Indonesia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The administration should not defy Congressional intent to bar the 
Indonesian military from IMET,&quot; said Kurt Biddle of the Indonesia Human Rights Network (IHRN).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Instead of considering assistance for the Indonesian military, the 
administration should take concrete action against the Indonesian military for its massive human rights violations in Aceh - including the use of 
U.S.-supplied weapons, its widespread impunity for crimes against humanity 
in East Timor, and its general trampling on the rights of Indonesian, East 
Timorese, and U.S. citizens,&quot; said Karen Orenstein of the East Timor Action 
Network (ETAN).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On July 16, the House passed an amendment to the Foreign Relations 
Authorization Act for FY04-05 (H.R. 1950) barring Indonesia from receiving 
IMET until the President certifies that Indonesia is &quot;taking effective 
measures&quot; to fully investigate and criminally prosecute those responsible 
for the August 31, 2002 attack on in Timika, Papua near the mining 
operations area of the Louisiana-headquartered Freeport-McMoRan. The ambush 
killed three school teachers -- Rick Spier from Colorado, Tom Burgon of 
Oregon and an Indonesian, Bambang Riwanto -- and injured 11 others, including a six-year child. Indonesian police and NGO investigations have 
strongly implicated the Indonesian military (TNI) in the attack.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Representative Joel Hefley (R-CO) sponsored both amendments. 
Representatives Nita Lowey (D-NY), Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), and Greg Walden 
(R-OR) spoke in favor of yesterday's amendment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed its ownban on IMET for 
Indonesia for FY04 last May. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed its 
own ban. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Legislative rules limited last night's amendment to a $600,000 reduction of 
the entire FY04 IMET appropriation. However, the legislative history 
established during debate makes clear the provision's intent to cut all 
funding for IMET for Indonesia for FY04.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The appropriations bill also continues a ban on U.S. government financed sales of military equipment to Indonesia under the Foreign Military 
Financing Program.</font></p>
