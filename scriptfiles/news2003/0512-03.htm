- May 12 - Following is a statement 

of Deborah Dietrich, acting executive director of the Association 

of Maternal and Child Health Programs on tax cuts: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today is an alarming day for women, children and families. The 

tax cuts passed by the Senate Finance Committee mean there will be 

less money for important programs that serve our most vulnerable 

citizens -- low-income, at-risk mothers and children. These 

families rely on public health programs to get basic prenatal care, 

immunize their children and diagnose chronic diseases. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There is no room in today's economy for tax cuts. By increasing 

deficits and undermining the nation's fiscal stability, tax cuts 

threaten important national programs that serve families, like the 

Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, bioterrorism preparedness 

and funding for welfare programs. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With looming cuts in Medicaid, increased costs for welfare 

programs and now tax cuts, state governments are in dire straights. 

They face the worst fiscal crisis since World War II. Many states 

tie their income tax levels to federal levels. Should these tax 

cuts become law, states will experience unplanned drops in their 

revenues, leaving programs vulnerable to emergency cuts throughout 

the year. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"States can't do it alone. They need additional funds now to 

ensure that low-income women receive prenatal care, that hungry 

children are fed and that families of children with special health 

needs have access to health care. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This tax proposal is paid for with fiscally unsound budget 

gimmicks. To include the dividends adjustment and achieve the $350 

billion cut, the Senate and the Bush Administration used some 

pretty creative accounting - talk about fuzzy math. The proposal 

doesn't even take into account the cost of war in Iraq. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Don't be fooled. This tax cut will help wealthy Americans. 

While upper-class businessmen get tax breaks on their capital 

gains, low-income women and children are threatened with cuts to 

public health programs, Medicaid and the State Children's Health 

Insurance Program (SCHIP). 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"During difficult economic times, it's easy to be swept up by 

the fantasy of lower taxes. But it's precisely during these 

difficult times that we have to reach out to those most in need. 

Passing this tax bill now means cuts later to the vital social 

programs that protect our most vulnerable citizens."
