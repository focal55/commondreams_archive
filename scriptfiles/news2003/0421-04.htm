                YORK - April 21 - The United States must invite other nations 

                to cooperate in the inspection of possible weapons of mass destruction 

                (WMD) in Iraq, according to the leading human rights group, the 

                Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR). The group also raised 

                concern that U.S. and British forces might try and fabricate evidence 

                of WMD'S to justify their rational for war, a concern amplified 

                by recent reports that the an American military team has located 

                a scientist who they claim has led them to materials that can 

                be used as the building blocks for illegal weapons. </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;No 

                  significant evidence of weapons of mass destruction has been 

                  discovered despite the fact that this was the major reason the 

                  U.S. gave for attacking Iraq,&quot; said CCR Executive Director 

                  Ron Daniels, adding that if the U.S. had intelligence before 

                  the war about these weapons, it would be reasonable to assume 

                  they would find them quickly.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 

                  search for and verification of weapons of mass destruction must 

                  be independently verified by United Nations weapons inspectors 

                  and their destruction carried in accordance with the Chemical 

                  Weapons Convention of 1993,&quot; Daniels asserted.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CCR President 

                  Michael Ratner said: &quot;While the U.S. acted virtually unilaterally 

                  in attacking Iraq, it is now time to reassert the authority 

                  of international law and global institutions. We cannot permit 

                  the United States to operate in times of peace as they have 

                  in times of war.&quot; Regarding the Iraqi scientist who allegedly 

                  has led U.S. military inspectors to the site of buried weapons, 

                  Ratner added: &quot;The U.S. must turn this man over to the 

                  United Nations and their experts who can make an independent 

                  assessment of him and the information he claims to possess.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Daniels 

                  pointed out that the world has a right to be cynical about U.S. 

                  claims concerning weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He cited, 

                  as an example, a revelation by nuclear inspectors that documents 

                  offered by the United States and Britain as evidence Iraq tried 

                  to buy uranium from Niger between 1999 and 2001 had been forged. 

                  He said the forgeries demonstrated the importance of having 

                  an independent eye review all information on this issue.</font></p>
