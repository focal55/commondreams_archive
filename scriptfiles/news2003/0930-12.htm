- September 30 - The Center for American Progress has released the attached is a one-page document detailing &#147;Intimigate&#148;, the White House&#146;s latest scandal. As the document shows, the White House has developed a pattern of firing, intimidating and defaming anyone who has had the courage to tell the truth about Iraq. In fact, the Iraq policymakers whose influence has grown in the White House are largely those who parsed and distorted intelligence and misled the American people.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><b>INTIMIGATE</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recent story of the Bush Administration leaking classified information in an effort to defame a WMD report is just the latest in a well-established pattern. A look at the historical record shows that the Bush Administration has summarily fired, intimidated and defamed anyone who has had the courage to tell the truth about Iraq. In fact, the Iraq policymakers who have remained in the White House are largely those who parsed and distorted intelligence and misled the American people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;General Anthony Zinni, a retired Marine general who was Bush's Middle East mediator, angered the White House when he told a foreign policy forum in October that Bush had far more pressing foreign policy priorities than Iraq and suggested there could be a prolonged, difficult aftermath to a war. He was not reappointed as Mideast envoy.&#148;<br>

Whatever action may be taken, whether it's a verbal reprimand or something more stringent, is up to the commanders on the scene.&quot;<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the fact that it appears he was probably accurate, &#147;Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz criticized the Army's chief of staff, Gen. Eric Shinseki, after Shinseki told Congress in February that the occupation could require &#145;several hundred thousand troops.&#146; Wolfowitz called Shinseki's estimate &#145;wildly off the mark.&#146;&#148;<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>CIA BLAMED FOR TELLING TRUTH ABOUT BOGUS IRAQ-NUCLEAR CLAIM</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the CIA having made advance objections to the White House about the false Iraq-Nuclear claim, &#147;President Bush and his national security adviser yesterday placed full responsibility on the Central Intelligence Agency for the inclusion in this year's State of the Union address of questionable allegations that Iraq's Saddam Hussein was trying to buy nuclear weapons.&#148;<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to government sources, &#147;Administration officials leaked the name of an undercover CIA officer to a journalist after her husband, former U.S. ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV, publicly challenged President Bush's claim that Iraq had tried to buy uranium ore from Africa. &#145;Clearly, it was meant purely and simply for revenge,&#146; a senior official said of the alleged leak.&#148;<br>
