                - April 1 - NARAL Pro-Choice America President Kate Michelman 

                announced opposition today to the nomination of Carolyn Kuhl, 

                a key player in the Reagan Revolution, based on her career-long 

                work against a woman's right to choose. Michelman also announced 

                NARAL Pro-Choice America will activate its grassroots base to 

                tell the Senate to oppose this radical nomination. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We cannot 

                afford to gamble with our hard-won fundamental rights or to turn 

                back women's progress towards equality. Pro-choice Senators and 

                pro-choice America must stop President Bush from stacking the 

                courts with anti-choice activists like Carolyn Kuhl," said Ms. 

                Michelman. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are convinced 

                that Carolyn Kuhl's record of hostility to freedom of choice will 

                make it impossible for her to fairly and impartially apply the 

                governing legal standard — the 'undue burden' test," said Michelman. 

                "This standard gives judicial activists more power than ever to 

                use their discretion and uphold barriers on a woman's right to 

                choose. Evidence of this activism is clear: appellate judges who 

                were appointed by anti-choice Presidents are voting to uphold 

                restrictions on a woman's right to choose over 70% of the time, 

                while judges appointed by Presidents other than Reagan, Bush I, 

                and Bush II vote to uphold constitutional challenges to restrictions 

                only 17% of the time." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kuhl's anti-choice 

                record is not simply that of an attorney representing clients, 

                but that of an energetic and creative legal activist, who has 

                worked for radical changes in the law to implement a far-right 

                agenda. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Her fervent 

                opposition to abortion and women's rights includes: Advocating 

                overruling Roe v. Wade soon after the Supreme Court had reaffirmed 

                it; </font>

                the "squeal rule" requiring parental notification for young people 

                to obtain prescription contraception at federally-funded family

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Defense of

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opposition 

                to claims of repeated sexual harassment on the job amounting to 

                the creation of "a hostile environment"; </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Urging that 

                public educational institutions be allowed to discriminate against

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Denial of a 

                privacy violation claim for a woman whose breast cancer medical 

                visit was attended by a drug company representative without her 

                consent. Kuhl has advanced such positions as a political appointee 

                at the Department of Justice, in private practice and even as 

                a judge in California's state courts. Her advocacy was sharply 

                out of the mainstream. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected her contentions 

                with respect to abortion, sexual harassment, discrimination in 

                education, and other areas. The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected 

                her position on the squeal rule, and a higher California court 

                reversed her decision on the privacy claim and in other significant 

                cases. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Permitting 

                an anti-choice nominee like Carolyn Kuhl to assume a life-time 

                appointment to the federal bench virtually assures another vote 

                on the courts against a woman's right to choose," said Michelman.
