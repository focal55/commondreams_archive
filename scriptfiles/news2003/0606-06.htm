- June 6 - The compromise privacy protection legislation announced by Governor Davis and Senator Jackie Speier Tuesday was made public Thursday and contains major loopholes and exceptions favoring the state's largest financial institutions.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Informed consent is this heart of the individual's right to privacy and the loopholes in this bill will allow corporations to take their private information through sleight of hand," said Jerry Flanagan of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights (FTCR). "If these loopholes are not closed, a fraud will be perpetrated against the people of California. Californians should not be once again be betrayed by the fine print of legislation as well as financial service products."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- "Explicit prior consent" of the consumer before information is shared is not defined so that financial institutions are left to define the standards -- which need not be in writing, can be induced through discounts over the phone, or can be buried in fine print of credit card applications.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Stronger city and county ordinances protecting residents' financial privacy, would be invalidated, as banks asked a federal judge to do last Friday -- including those in Daily City, San Francisco City and County, and San Mateo County (all the heart of Speier's district).

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Local Bay area laws which would be overturned by the bill allow for less sharing among affiliates, explicit definition of protected information (including social security numbers) and more control over with whom information is shared with.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The "consent" form currently removes the provision for an "opt in" box presented to consumers -- leaving banks can decide the standard.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Allows organizations and businesses to access a consumer's purchasing history.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Allows marketers to retain a consumer's private information.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- There are exemptions for retailers and real estate companies.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Corporations can offer to discounts to induce sharing of information.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights urged the loopholes to be closed by Governor Davis, Senator Speier, and the Assembly Banking Committee, which will consider the bill Monday.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Senator Speier should not sacrifice the stronger privacy protections enacted by her own constituents for a weaker state law. Governor Davis cannot proclaim that he's for protecting personal privacy then give banks and insurers the means to toy with it," said Jamie Court, Executive Director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and consumer Rights.
