Citizens, scientists, children and teenagers who are members of the two international nonprofit organizations have been writing letters to Secretary General Kofi Annan, urging him to take action to save the Pacific Leatherback from immanent extinction.  Paula Palmer, Program Director of Global Response, and Doug Israel, Project Director of Sea Turtle Restoration Project, will head the delegation to deliver hundreds and hundreds of letters.  Also invited are key New York area Global Response adult and teen volunteers, who have organized local letter writing campaigns for Earth Day.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We represent world citizens who are urging the U.N. to place a moratorium on longline fishing,&quot; said Palmer, who will meet May 6 with Andre Tahindro, a Senior Officer with the Ocean Affairs and Law of the U.N.'s Sea Division. &quot;Anyone who reads these sincere letters and thinks for a minute about a world without sea turtles will want to put a stop to slaughter caused by longline fishing,&quot; she said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Each letter is a heartfelt appeal to the U.N., the only institution that can mobilize global cooperation to save the leatherback sea turtle,&quot; said Palmer. Global Response organizes international letter writing campaigns on behalf of communities that are struggling to stop environmental destruction. &quot;This campaign, though, is on behalf of a species - one that captures the imagination of people around the world. How can we not act to save a species that has swum our oceans since before the time of the dinosaurs?&quot; she asked.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an open letter to Mr. Annan published in the New York Times, 400 scientists warned that the plight of the leatherback may foreshadow a host of other extinctions. Longline and gillnet fishing, they say, are to blame.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Longliners set up to 10 billion hooks in our oceans every year in their quest for swordfish and tuna,&quot; says Sea Turtle Restoration Project's Israel. Longliners cast a fishing line up to 60 miles long on the ocean's surface, dangling as many as 3,000 baited hooks at various depths depending on the fish they are targeting. &quot;Unfortunately, longline fishing is driving the leatherback sea turtle to extinction.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Worldwide, the accidental &quot;bycatch&quot; constitutes one quarter of the annual seafood catch and is thrown overboard, usually dead or dying. Approximately 40,000 sea turtles are caught and killed by longline operations each year, and 23 species of seabird are in danger of extinction due to impacts from longline fishing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The leatherback is the world's largest sea turtle, growing up to nine and a half feet long and weighing almost 2,000 pounds. The nesting population of Pacific leatherbacks has plummeted from 91,000 in 1980 to fewer than 5,000 in 2002, a decline of 95 percent.  Pacific beaches in Mexiquillo, Mexico and Playa Grande, Costa Rica that are famed for the annual arrival of thousands of nesting sea turtles, reported just 4 and 58 leatherback arrivals last year, respectively.</font></p>

With offices in California and Costa Rica, STRP has been leading the international fight to protect sea turtle populations worldwide.  The Sea Turtle Restoration Project, founded in 1989, is a project of Turtle Island Restoration Network, a nonprofit environmental organization incorporated in California. In order to achieve our goals, STRP uses a strategic combination of grassroots education and organizing, legal pressure, hands-on conservation, innovative use of the media, research, and policy advocacy.
