Urges Gov. Taft To Grant Clemency To Jerome Campbell</font></div>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

-  

May 2 - The Ohio Adult Parole Board today voted 8-2 to

recommend clemency for Jerome Campbell, who faces a May 14 execution

date, after new DNA evidence cast serious doubt on the state's 

case against him. The vote marked the first time since Ohio resumed

executions in 1999 that the Ohio Parole Board has recommended

clemency for a person on death row.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Campbell's innocence claim is particularly strong, and his

case reflects some of the key problems with the death penalty

system in the United States,&quot; said Steven W. Hawkins, executive

director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty.&quot;The Ohio Parole Board did the right thing and Gov. Taft should

accept its recommendation and commute Campbell's sentence.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

At trial, prosecutors presented a bloodstained shoe belonging to

Campbell, attempting to show that he had tracked the victim's blood from the murder scene. DNA testing later indicated that the blood

was in fact his own. &quot;Campbell has never received a fair review

of his conviction in light of DNA evidence that could exonerate

him,&quot; Hawkins said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The state's case has further crumbled under the weight of questions concerning the reliability of two witnesses who turned out to be

jailhouse informants. At trial, prosecutors falsely stated that

the two men - Ronys Clardy and Angelo Roseman - received no special

consideration for testifying against Campbell. In its report to

Gov. Taft, the Ohio Parole Board wrote that Campbell's attorneys&quot;presented credible evidence for the majority members of thisboard to question any sustained confidence or reliability in the

jury's recommendation.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Hawkins announced that NCADP is encouraging its members and supporters to urge Gov. Taft to grant clemency by visiting the

NCADP's new Action Center. To take action in the Campbell case,

please visit <a href="http://www.ncadp.org" target="_new">www.ncadp.org</a></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Hawkins said that &quot;executive clemency is the proper venue for

preventing gross miscarriages of justice when state and federalcourts cannot or will not act to provide a remedy.&quot; 

 

Since 1976, 107 people have been released from death row in the

United States due to actual innocence, and just this Tuesday,

the Missouri Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Joseph

Amrine, ordering the state to file new charges or release him.&quot;Judges and state leaders from across the nation are beginning

to recognize the countless flaws in the death penalty system,&quot;

said Hawkins. &quot;The fact is, the institution of capital punishment

will always risk the execution of the innocent, and any system that poses that danger is absolutely unacceptable.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty was founded in 1976 and is the only fully-staffed national organization

devoted specifically to abolishing the death penalty. NCADP is

comprised of more than 100 local, state, national and international

affiliates.
