- September 12 - Carolina teacher Elizabeth Ito has 

appealed her firing from Forsyth Technical Community College, which came after 

she made remarks critical of the conduct of the war in Iraq.  Her firing, which 

has been widely criticized by local anti-war activists and free speech 

advocates, is seen as part of a larger crack-down on dissent and academic freedom.  &quot;It is clear that Elizabeth didn't lose her job because she expressed a personal opinion in the classroom,&quot; said Liz Seymour, a member of the Ito Defense 

Coalition.  &quot;She lost her job because of the opinion she expressed.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Friday, March 28, 2003 Elizabeth, a first-year English teacher at Forsyth Tech, spent ten minutes at the beginning of her business writing class voicing 

her concerns about the war in Iraq.  During this time the US military was 

encountering much unanticipated resistance in its push toward Baghdad and the previous night's news had reported that 30,000 more troops were being called up, 

a figure that by the next morning had risen to 120,000.  Elizabeth wrote these 

numbers on the board and asked the students what they would do if the 

government had to start drafting.  After class had ended two students complained to 

Elizabeth's supervisor Susie Keener, Chair of the Department of 

Humanities/Communication, that Elizabeth had criticized the war in class.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following Monday morning Susie Keener and John Slade, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, met with Elizabeth for over two hours to discuss the 

incident. At the end of the meeting Dean Slade asked Elizabeth to promise not 

to raise the topic of the war again in class.  Elizabeth said that she had no 

intention of revisiting the subject but that she was unwilling to bind herself 

to a promise.  Later that week Dean Slade presented Elizabeth with a 

disciplinary letter that concluded with the statement &quot;this matter is resolved.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elizabeth, who had been commended for her teaching in a series of official 

reviews throughout the year did not, in fact, discuss the war again in class.  

Nonetheless, on May 15 she received a certified letter at her home informing her that Forsyth Tech no longer needed her services.  In the weeks following her dismissal Elizabeth's students spoke out on her behalf-even one of the 

students who originally complained to the Forsyth Tech administration told Michelle 

Johnson a reporter for the Winston-Salem Journal, that he did not think 

Elizabeth should have been fired for her remarks.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ito's firing has received widespread press attention in North Carolina 

including articles in the Winston-Salem Journa, the Durham Herald-Sun. the 

Greensboro News &amp; Record, and the Carolina Peacemaker.  A story  was also broadcast on the local NPR affiliate.  &quot;This is not just about me or about my job,&quot; said 

Ito.  &quot;It's about something very disturbing that is happening all over the 

country.  I want people to understand that if it could happen hee it could happen 

anywhere.&quot;</font></p>
