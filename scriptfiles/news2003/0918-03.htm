<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Philadelphia, PA &#151; On September 23, a coalition of peace, social justice and counter-recruitment groups across the country are sponsoring National &#147;Opt-Out&#148; Day to call greater attention to the military recruitment provision of the controversial No Child Left Behind Act that was enacted last year.

</font>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Demonstrations, leafleting and other activities will shed light on the little known fact that parents and their high school aged children have the right to &#147;opt out&#148; of having their private information handed over to military recruiters.   National &#147;Opt-Out&#148; Day also highlights such related issues as recruitment fraud, the true costs of JROTC and its recruitment connections, misinformation about the Delayed Enlistment Program, and the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery in public schools. </font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The No Child Left Behind Act requires school districts to share students&#146; names, addresses, and telephone numbers with military recruiters. School districts were often unable to adequately inform parents or students of the new requirement, consequently many never knew, or discovered after the fact, that they could &#145;opt out&#146; of this provision.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;National &#147;Opt-Out&#148; Day is an opportunity for school boards, principals, parents and students to know exactly what the law indicates,&#148; states Oskar Castro, coordinator of the Philadelphia-based American Friends Service Committee Youth and Militarism program. &#147;At the same time, the event counters an insidious trend to paint the U.S. military as a safe, beneficial and alternative jobs program.&#148;</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Participating organizations include: the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC); Friends Committee on National Legislation, Young Adult Program: Not in Our Name; Pax Christi USA; United For Peace and Justice and Voices in the Wilderness.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information or questions on National &#147;Opt-Out&#148; Day, contact the AFSC National Youth &amp; Militarism Program at 215-241-7046. Parents, and high school students who wish to learn more about how to &#145;opt out&#146; of having personal information given to military recruiters can also visit the AFSC web site at <a href="http://www.afsc.org" target="_new">www.afsc.org</a>.</font></p>
