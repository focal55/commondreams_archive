- May 1 - The National Council on 

Disability (NCD) today released a research study entitled 

"Addressing the Needs of Youth with Disabilities in the Juvenile 

Justice System: The Status of Evidence-Based Research" 

(<a href="http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/juvenile.html" target="_new">http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/juvenile.html</a>). The 

report evaluates the emerging status of key policies and programs 

that affect children and youth with disabilities who have often 

been overlooked by service and research programs. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The issues of delinquency prevention and juvenile justice as 

they relate to children and youth with disabilities are relatively 

new for policymakers, yet they present some of the most complex and 

challenging problems that policymakers must grapple with and 

resolve. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the past several years, NCD has recognized that children 

and youth with disabilities have increasingly become 

overrepresented in the juvenile justice system. A significant 

proportion of youth in the juvenile justice system have education 

related disabilities and are eligible for special education and 

related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education 

Act (IDEA). Factors associated with the disproportionate 

representation of youth with disabilities in juvenile corrections 

are complex-but the available information suggests that school 

failure, poorly developed social skills, and inadequate school and 

community supports greatly increase the risks for arrest and 

incarceration. NCD believes, therefore, that delinquency prevention 

is a critical feature of any service or support system that is used 

to address the needs of all youth, especially youth with 

disabilities and special education needs. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The major recommendations NCD makes are to: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Identify a range of strategies to enforce and promote 

compliance with federal disability law as it relates to children 

and youth with disabilities who are at risk of delinquency. The 

strategies should include those that increase effective programming 

for youth with disabilities in schools and in juvenile justice 

settings. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Increase funding and/or resources to schools and the juvenile 

justice system to ensure that youth with disabilities receive 

appropriate services. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Designate a single federal agency whose sole focus is to 

ensure that the rights and needs of youth with disabilities 

entering or in the juvenile justice system are addressed. The 

Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention 

and the President's Task Force on Disadvantaged Youth may be 

well-suited to provide the direction and leadership to address this 

gap by helping to create a national commission focused explicitly 

on youth with disabilities at risk of entering or already in the 

juvenile justice system. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Conduct research that focuses on establishing the true 

prevalence of youth with disabilities of different types among 

at-risk populations in schools and across all stages of the 

juvenile justice system; the needs/services gap, including 

compliance with disability law; the causes of overrepresentation, 

where it exists, of youth with disabilities in the juvenile justice 

system, especially correctional facilities; and effective systems 

level and program level approaches, including federal laws, for 

addressing the needs of these youth, including particular attention 

to the types of programming most effective for youth from diverse 

racial/ethnic and cultural backgrounds. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Undertake a comprehensive assessment to determine what 

programs and policies are most effective in schools, communities, 

and the juvenile justice system. At the same time, ensure that 

there is a balanced approach to funding diverse programs and 

policies, coupled with evaluation research studies of their 

effectiveness. Such an approach will ensure that a more definitive 

body of knowledge can develop to determine "what works" and for 

whom. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Without a clear understanding of what works, communities can 

become awash in a maze of programs and services that claim 

effectiveness in deterring delinquency yet have no factual 

information or evidence supporting their effectiveness. NCD 

believes that policy makers can use the findings and 

recommendations from this research study to help shape the scope 

and direction of future federal initiatives designed to tackle 

delinquency prevention and juvenile justice. Such initiatives fall 

under the purview of the Department of Education and the Department 

of Justice. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NCD's study findings on the status of, and need for, improved, 

evidence-based research in the area of juvenile justice are 

consistent with those of two other federal level agency research 

endeavors, namely, the President's Mental Health Commission and the 

General Accounting Office (GAO). 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In an April 3, 2003 draft outline of a final report from the 

President's Mental Health Commission Goal No. 4 states: "Adults 

with serious mental illness and children with serious emotional 

disturbance will have ready access to the best treatments, 

services, and supports leading to recovery and cure. Accelerate 

research to enhance prevention of, recovery from and ultimate 

discovery of cures for mental illnesses." Recommendation No. 4 

states: "Evidence-based practice interventions should be tested in 

demonstration projects with oversight by a public-private 

consortium of all stakeholders. The results of those demonstrations 

should form the basis for directing support of financing, 

dissemination and workforce development." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In an April 15, 2003, report Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice, 

officials in the states GAO visited identified practices that they 

believe may reduce the need for some child welfare or juvenile 

justice placements. These practices included finding new ways to 

reduce the cost of or to fund mental health services, improving 

access to mental health services, and expanding the array of 

available services. GAO reported, however, that few of these 

practices have been rigorously evaluated.
