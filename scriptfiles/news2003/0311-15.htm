                VA - March 11 - Drug discount cards offered by pharmacy benefit 

                managers (PBMs) provide significant relief to uninsured senior 

                citizens who are paying the highest prices for their prescription 

                drugs, according to a comprehensive new study released today by 

                Brandeis University. The study, based on actual claims data from 

                pharmacies, found that using a PBM discount card saves senior 

                citizens money - an average of 15 percent off the retail price 

                of medications charged by pharmacies for each prescription filled. 

                These savings are realized at chain and independent pharmacies 

                in both rural and urban states, according to Brandeis, and are 

                in addition to any discounts uninsured seniors may receive from 

                pharmacies. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today's Brandeis 

                study shows conclusively that uninsured senior citizens -- who 

                can least afford the high drug prices charged by retail pharmacies 

                -- benefit from using PBM discount cards. This is true whether 

                they live in rural or urban areas of America," said LaVarne Burton, 

                President of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA). 

                "In addition to these savings revealed in the Brandeis report, 

                PBMs are also able to offer senior citizens improved safety and 

                convenient access to medications." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, 

                the Brandeis study found the average savings achieved through 

                PBM discount cards for generic medications was 26 percent, or 

                $7 for each prescription, and the average discount for brand name 

                drugs was 14 percent, or $11 for each prescription. The overall 

                average discounted price for prescription drugs purchased using 

                a discount card was 15 percent, or $10 dollars for each prescription 

                filled. Burton noted, "Drug discount cards, when offered in conjunction 

                with a partially funded pharmacy benefit, would likely result 

                in even greater cost savings for seniors." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brandeis also 

                found that discount cards save senior citizens who require multiple 

                medications, as most seniors do, hundreds of dollars for a year's 

                supply of drugs. In one profile, Brandeis found that a Medicare 

                participant who has mild heart failure, high cholesterol and osteoporosis 

                and whose doctor prescribes furosemide, Lipitor, Fosamax and hydrocodone 

                as needed for joint pain would be charged $2,542 a year for these 

                medications by her local pharmacy. If that same senior had a discount 

                card the savings would be $525, or 21 percent. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brandeis 

                study is a more comprehensive examination of the savings achieved 

                by PBM discount cards than a December 2001 General Accounting 

                Office report. Whereas the GAO report was based on a survey of 

                prices for 17 common medications, Brandeis examined more than 

                3.5 million claims for 124 commonly used brand and generic drugs 

                submitted for payment by pharmacies participating in eight discount 

                card programs. These claims contained the actual usual-and-customary 

                prices retail pharmacies would have charged senior citizens if 

                they did not have a PBM discount card. As a result of this more 

                comprehensive data, Brandeis found the actual savings resulting 

                from the use of PBM discount cards were more significant than 

                those determined by GAO. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brandeis 

                study's findings are particularly relevant since most proposals 

                to provide a Medicare prescription drug benefit have gaps that 

                would require senior citizens to pay significant out of pocket 

                expenses. This study is further evidence that private-sector innovations 

                such as PBM drug discount cards could help reduce seniors' out 

                of pocket expenditures. </font>
