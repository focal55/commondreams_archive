-  
November 6 - The Senate Judiciary Committee today voted 10-9 in a straight-party line vote to send the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to the Senate floor. Separately, a cloture vote in the full Senate to bring the nomination of Alabama Attorney General William Pryor to the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit was scheduled for later Thursday -- despite the fact that Pryor's first cloture vote failed last July, and neither party predicts a different outcome.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas had the following
statement:</font></p>
<p>	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Janice Rogers Brown and Bill Pryor are perhaps the most extreme of the nominees the Bush Administration has put forward to date.  They are so far out of the mainstream of American legal thought, so out of step with the legal principles that protect our basic rights and freedoms, that they should not be confirmed to these lifetime appointments.</font></p>
<p>	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Republicans and their right-wing allies know they can't defend these judges on the basis of their public records, so they're using bogus and inflammatory charges to stir up their hard-core base.  Oppose Pryor, and you're anti-Catholic.  Oppose Brown, and you're using racist tactics. Oppose Estrada, and you're anti-Hispanic.  Oppose Pickering, and you're anti-Christian. Oppose any nominee, and you're an obstructionist.  It's all a smokescreen meant to draw the debate away from the extreme legal philosophy of these nominees, and attempt to intimidate opponents.</font></p>
<p>	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As to the charge of obstructionism, news reports today confirm that the vacancy rate on the federal bench is the lowest it's been in 13 years. President Bush has had 168 nominees confirmed by the Senate, matching the monthly confirmation rate of Bill Clinton's first three years, and exceeding the confirmation rate of George H. W. Bush's first three years.  Only a handful of nominees have been opposed by courageous senators willing to stand up for the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.</font></p>
