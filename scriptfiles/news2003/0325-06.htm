                - March 25 - Dear President Bush and Prime Minister Blair, </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On February 

                5, 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld made statements 

                to Congress and the press suggesting that the United States may 

                be contemplating the use of chemical "riot control agents" during 

                the Iraq war. Press reports indicate that the US may also be considering 

                the use of chemical incapacitating agents. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Proponents 

                of chemical riot-control agents and chemical incapacitating agents 

                argue that they are non-lethal and humane alternatives to the 

                use of deadly force and will help reduce civilian casualties. 

                In fact, as the Russian theatre hostage crisis demonstrated, chemical 

                incapacitating agents are far from non-lethal. They can be as 

                lethal as many other weapons of war. Civilian lethality in the 

                Russian incident was 15%, comparable to the levels of lethality 

                achieved using military firearms, artillery, and grenades (1). 

                Furthermore, in a complex military setting containing both combatants 

                and civilians, lethality will likely be concentrated among civilian 

                populations who will lack access to the protective gear that the 

                Iraqi army, which has been trained to use chemical weapons, is 

                likely to have. Finally, history shows that chemical agents of 

                any type can end up being used to supplement and enhance lethal 

                force, rather than to reduce it, and that once chemical agents 

                are used, their use can rapidly escalate. </font>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The United 

                States and the United Kingdom are among the 150 States Parties 

                to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). This treaty explicitly 

                prohibits the use of either chemical incapacitating agents or 

                riot control agents for war-fighting purposes. Any military effort 

                to bring Iraq into accord with the international legal norms enshrined 

                by the CWC would be undermined by the use of riot control agents 

                or chemical incapacitants which every other State Party considers 

                banned by the CWC. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The use of 

                banned weapons by the United States or its allies would also significantly 

                undermine the CWC and the very international norms we seek to 

                uphold, and could stimulate the further proliferation of chemical 

                weapons. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the interest 

                of national and global security, the United States and all of 

                its allies must uphold the standards of international behavior 

                that they seek to enforce and must not use chemical incapacitating 

                agents or chemical riot control agents in the war with Iraq. </font>
