                - April 15 - As Horizon Hospice celebrates its 25th anniversary 

                this month, its growth signals the ever-increasing acceptance 

                of hospice in this country and its own success as one of the leading 

                hospices in the region. Established in 1978 by four volunteers 

                with one part-time employee and a single patient, Horizon has 

                grown to an organization with a staff of 55 professionals and 

                100 volunteers, serving 600 -- 700 families each year throughout 

                Chicago. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I am proud 

                to have started something so important to the families of this 

                city. I can tell that our hard work has not gone unnoticed," reflects 

                Ada Addingon, founder and board member of Horizon Hospice. Beyond 

                its impressive growth, Horizon has become a leader with such milestones 

                as being: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- one of the 

                first hospices to take AIDS patients: When the AIDS epidemic struck 

                Chicago in the mid-80s, Horizon stepped forward to help and soon 

                became the provider of choice for patients and families. In the 

                early 90s Horizon contracted with three AIDS residences including 

                Chicago House, a residence for dying AIDS patients; </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- one of the 

                first to accept pediatric cases: When 22 other area hospices refused 

                to care for a child dying of cancer because the case was so complicated 

                and costly, Horizon became one of the first hospice programs to 

                accept pediatric cases; </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, Horizon 

                Hospice's mark of success is illustrated by its ability to help 

                more than 95 percent of its patients remain at home whether it's 

                a private residence (80 percent) or nursing home (15 percent), 

                and 95 percent of patients to be free of pain and other symptoms. 

                "Our success is a direct result of our intense focus on staff 

                in-services and volunteer education," says Horizon Hospice president 

                Michael Preodor, MD. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Horizon is 

                leading the hospice movement in educating not only the professional 

                healthcare community, but also their own staff and volunteer corps 

                with programs that address challenging cases -- from treating 

                a particularly troublesome symptom to responding to the psychosocial 

                needs of a very troubled family. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"While we are 

                strong on the professional side, there is still a lot of work 

                to be done on the patient side. Our biggest challenge is that 

                people don't want to talk about death and they need to communicate 

                their preferences so their families and caregivers can better 

                understand their wishes," added Dr. Preodor. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Horizon Hospice, 

                Chicago's first hospice, was established in 1978 by four volunteers

                dying. Horizon now cares for 600-700 terminally ill patients and 

                their families throughout the Chicago area annually. Hospice care
