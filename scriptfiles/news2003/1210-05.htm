- December 10 - In the biggest coordinated union movement-wide mobilization in a decade, tens of thousands of America&#146;s workers and their allies chose today, International Human Rights Day, to launch an unprecedented series of events in cities across the United States to call for the restoration of workers&#146; freedom to form unions. </font><P>Democratic presidential candidates, political as well as civil rights leaders and major human rights advocates stood with workers in over 90 events in 38 states -- events such as marches, rallies, press conferences and hearings -- to protest employers&#146; routine violation of workers&#146; freedom to form unions, and to pledge to strengthen U.S. labor law. The freedom to form a union is one of the basic human rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ratified by Eleanor Roosevelt and representatives of four-fifths of United Nations members on December 10, 1948. </P><P>The participation by Amnesty International in the events and the endorsement by Human Rights Watch of fundamental changes in labor law were unprecedented. </P><P>Workers at many of today&#146;s events spoke movingly about the opposition they face when they attempt to exercise their right to form a union. One quarter of private sector employers illegally fire at least one worker when workers try to form a union, according to Cornell University research conducted by Kate Bronfenbrenner. Ninety percent of employers fight their workers&#146; efforts, often using intimidation, coercion, threats of plant closure, one-on-one meetings against the union with workers&#146; supervisors, and anti-worker consultants.</P><P>&#147;Behind the closed doors of the workplaces of America, workers face incredible -- often ruthless -- opposition when try to come together in a union,&#148; said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. &#147;These employers are literally robbing working people and their communities of better lives. At a time in our nation when the middle class is shrinking, when the gap between the rich and poor is growing, workers deserve the right to form a union to win a real voice on the job through collective bargaining.&#148; </P><P>Forty-five million U.S. workers say they would join a union today if they could, to improve their lives and working conditions. Workers form unions to get a voice on the job for fair treatment and decent working conditions, to remedy discrimination and receive better health and retirement benefits. </P><P>Speakers at events across the country stressed that when employers block workers from forming unions, the whole community suffers&#151;wages are suppressed, the tax base is weakened, racial and gender gaps grow and the door opens wider to more abuse of workers. </P><P>Speakers also referred optimistically to the new &#147;Employee Free Choice Act,&#148; bi-partisan legislation now before Congress. The Act will streamline the process of forming a union by respecting the decision of a majority of workers, by-passing the contentious and delay-prone National Labor Relations Board election procedure. It will also eliminate stalling in negotiating a first contract; and provide meaningful remedies for employer violations. </P><P>In New York City, AFL-CIO president John Sweeney gave a rousing address to more than two thousand workers outside the NLRB office, which last year filed more than 14,000 Unfair Labor Practice suits. The NLRB was also the culminating point for five thousand Boston protesters marching from a Workers&#146; Rights Board hearing at the Massachusetts State House. </P><P>Several Democratic presidential candidates addressed workers in New Hampshire, where recent support by all the Democratic candidates resulted in a major victory for workers at WMUR-TV who have finally negotiated a first contract after 11 months of stalling by the company.</P><P>In Chicago, more than 1000 workers and their allies rallied to demand that their right to form a union be recognized, before congregating at a Workers&#146; Rights hearing held at the Chicago United Methodist Church. Cleveland workers also turned out for a full slate of events, with a hearing as well as rallies to highlight the struggles of local workers. </P><P>In a moving candlelight ceremony in San Francisco, each candle bore the name of a worker fired for trying to form a union. In Los Angeles, thousands of workers and allies, such as Rev. Jesse Jackson, from feeder rallies merged in a culminating demonstration in Pershing Square, where speakers demanded an end to the abuse of the rights of America&#146;s workers. </P><P>Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin pledged support to concerned workers gathered on the steps of the Georgia State Capitol building. Meanwhile in Washington, DC, more than two thousand workers rallied outside the Department of Labor with Sen. Edward Kennedy to call for the restoration of the freedom to form unions and the protection of collective bargaining rights for federal workers; and in Pittsburgh, AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka gave support to janitors and grocery workers struggling to form unions. </P><P>Dozens more cities hosted similar events, in what AFL-CIO president John Sweeney is calling &#147;an unprecedented wave of public concern for the rights of workers, and a highly successful move towards the restoration of the freedom to form a union.&#148;</P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
