- July 25 - Chanting and holding signs reading &quot;Dying for AIDS 
drugs? Karl says drop dead&quot; and &quot;Bush's lies kill, generic medicines 
now!&quot;, angry AIDS activists staged a noisy disruption of an 
appearance by top White House advisor Karl Rove at the National 
Conference of the College Republican National Committee, at the 
Washington Hilton.
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;President Bush is breaking his promise to fully fund a $3 billion 
      global AIDS bill signed into law in June. Bush is breaking his 
      promise that countries can put access to medicines and public health 
      ahead of the patent rights of greedy drug companies. The deadly 
  global AIDS fraud perpetrated by this White House has gone far 
      enough,&quot; said Sean Barry, a protester.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Rove pulls the strings in this Administration, and Rove has the 
      blood of people with HIV on his hands.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two days ago, lawmakers in the House of Representatives, under the 
      direction of Rove's White House, opposed efforts to fully fund the 
      bill President Bush signed into law in June that would provide $3 
      billion in global AIDS funding in 2004, with $1 billion for the 
  nearly bankrupt Global Fund, the only multilateral program spending 
      money on treatment for dying people with AIDS.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Experts point out that life saving programs in the hardest hit 
      countries around the world could readily absorb the $3 billion 
  promised by Bush; the White House, on the other hand, claims funding 
      the Global Fund with $1 billion in 2004 would be profligate.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;President Bush just went to Africa, ground zero of the AIDS 
      catastrophe, and is immediately breaking his promise to fund the 
      Global Fund with $1 billion in 2004. The White House wants to 'go 
      slow' on fighting a threat to humanity Secretary of State Colin 
  Powell calls worse than terrorism. That's criminal,&quot; said Danae 
      McElroy, a protester.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The disruption of Rove's speech comes on the heels of the global AIDS 
      funding vote in Congress, and on the lead up to crucial talks at the 
      WTO, at the Cancun Ministerial (Sept 10-14), where US and drug 
      company intransigence has blocked a deal on access to medicines in 
      poor countries that lack capacity for efficient domestic 
      manufacturing. Karl Rove has been linked to intense negotiations with 
      US drug companies in determining White House policy on what is 
      considered a make-or-break issue for the Cancun Ministerial. &quot;While 
      Bush lies about life saving AIDS funding, he's preventing countries 
      from implementing policy that assures they can maximize medicines 
      access by purchasing low cost generics,&quot; said Sasha Post, a 
      protester. &quot;The US promised they would permit countries to put public 
  health before patent rights--for killer Karl, that's just one more 
      promise to walk away from.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ACTIVISTS DEMAND THE WHITE HOUSE:</font></p>
    </font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">support funding for the Global Fund immediately, by keeping Bush's 
        promise to spend $3 billion fighting global AIDS in 2004, with $1 
      billion for the Global Fund</font></font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">support a deal at the WTO on access to generics for countries with 
        inefficient domestic manufacturing capacity that is simple to 
        implement, doesn't exclude countries with moderate levels of 
        development, isn't restricted to a list of diseases, and doesn't 
    force poor countries to enact onerous &quot;safeguards&quot; to prevent 
  diversion to rich country markets</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">stop bilateral and regional trade policies that increase countries' 
        obligations to protect drug company patent rights at the expense of 
    public health and access to important medicines</font></li>
