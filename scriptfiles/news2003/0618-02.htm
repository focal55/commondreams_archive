- June 18 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), today, rejected assertions by the Republicans on the House International Relations Committee that his Resolution of Inquiry should be dismissed due to an ongoing investigation by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). On June 5, Kucinich introduced a Resolution of Inquiry to force the Administration to turn over the intelligence that led to misleading and false claims made by Administration officials in the lead-up to the war in Iraq. </font>

<p>	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Republicans on the International Relations Committee want to shun their congressional oversight responsibilities,&quot; stated Kucinich. &quot;It is clear that the committee Republicans are stonewalling. They don't want the American people to know that the Administration may have lied to them. The proper place for an investigation into disinformation the Administration used to lead the US to war is the House International Relations Committee. It is Congress' responsibility to provide oversight. Today, the Republican-led committee failed to live up to this responsibility.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resolution, signed by 40 Members of Congress, sought to force the Administration to turn over the intelligence to substantiate claims by the President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, and the White House Press Secretary that Iraq has chemical and biological weapons and therefore posed a threat to the United States. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resolution was referred to the House International Relations Committee, which, today, rejected the resolution in a partisan vote. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This Congress and the American people have a right to know if our nation was led to war based on misinformation, half-truths and possible lies,&quot; continued Kucinich.  &quot;Today, Congress had an opportunity to begin this process. But, instead of seeking the truth the Republican-led committee decided to take the path of obstruction. I will continue the fight in pursuit of the truth.&quot; </font></p>
