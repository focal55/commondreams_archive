                - April 2 - Dr. Nils Daulaire, President and CEO of the Global 

                Health Council, took an arsenal of low-tech and low-cost medical 

                interventions to Capitol Hill today to demonstrate how U.S. funding 

                on global health can save children's lives. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There are 

                five things that we can do with our federal funding that we know 

                how to do, that are simple, inexpensive and highly effective, 

                and that could save over 6 million lives a year," Daulaire said 

                during a congressional hearing on fiscal year 2004 federal funding 

                for foreign assistance. Daulaire told members of the House Foreign 

                Operations Appropriations Subcommittee that the Global Health 

                Council is requesting $620 million for international maternal 

                and child health programs -- a one-third increase over existing 

                funding. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Eleven million 

                children die unnecessarily around the world each year, and well 

                over half of them could be saved at a cost of pennies per child. 

                This is the best investment America could make in a safe and secure 

                21st century," he said. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Daulaire showed 

                members of Congress the interventions used by public health workers 

                around the world to fight childhood infectious disease and the 

                lives each could save: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 10 generic 

                antibiotic tablets (3 million lives saved) -- one vitamin A capsule 

                (1 million) -- one oral rehydration packet (2 million) -- one 

                insecticide-impregnated bednet (1 million) -- one pre-filled measles 

                immunization syringe (1 million) </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Vitamin A 

                is the simplest and cheapest intervention for the prevention of 

                blindness and for providing children with immunities to a range 

                of childhood ailments such as measles, malaria and diarrhea. One 

                dose costs about two pennies, and children only need to get it 

                once every six months. Vitamin A, by itself, could save up to 

                a million lives a year if every child in the world got it. That 

                is money well spent." Supplemental dosages of Vitamin A given 

                to pregnant women reduce infant mortality and protect infants 

                as well, Daulaire noted. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The simple 

                antibiotics that are used for treating childhood pneumonia costs 

                less than 25 cents for a full one-week course of treatment and 

                could save 75 percent of the three million who die from pneumonia 

                each year. That, too, is money well spent. A 12-cents measles 

                vaccines given once between 9 and 12 months of age could protect 

                kids from measles for the rest of their lives -- and save 800,000 

                lives a year." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"At this critical 

                point in our nation's history, we believe that it is time for 

                the United States to reaffirm our commitment to the children, 

                women and men struggling to survive in the developing world. Clearly, 

                this Subcommittee understands the strong link between health, 

                development and the growth of healthy societies," Daulaire said 

                in outlining a Global Health Council "wish list" including funding 

                for HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, family planning, and 

                infectious disease. "The appropriations process is one in which 

                hard choices have to be made, and priorities fought for. This 

                is an investment that works." </font>
