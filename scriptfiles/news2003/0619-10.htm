- June 19 - In a unified, bipartisan showing of support, the 14 women members of the U.S. Senate today wrote pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi on her 58th birthday and stepped up the international campaign to urge Burma&#146;s military junta to free her from captivity.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">             Suu Kyi has been in custody since May 30 when she and other members of the National League for Democracy were attacked by government-controlled thugs.  Although a U.N. envoy was able to visit her very briefly, she has been held in an undisclosed location and the military junta has refused a request by officials from the International Committee for the Red Cross to visit her.</font></p>

<p>             <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It is clear to me that the junta has recognized how well respected Suu Kyi is by her own people and they fomented an event in which people were killed and injured and she was taken into custody,&#148; said Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) who organized the drafting of the letter. &#147;What we need now is an international showing of support telling the junta that her continued captivity and its crackdown on democracy will not be tolerated.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The following is the text of the letter:</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Dear Aung San Suu Kyi:   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">             Our thoughts and prayers are with you and your National League for Democracy colleagues as we commemorate the occasion of your 58th birthday.  We would also like to remember and honor those NLD supporters who were killed, injured and arrested in the May 30 attack.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">             Please know that while you remain under house arrest, those of us who cherish freedom and democracy around the world stand by your side.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">             Last week, we joined our colleagues in the Senate in an unprecedented bipartisan show of support for passage of the &#147;Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003.&#148;  It is our greatest hope that in the very near future the NLD will able to assume its rightful role as the legitimate, democratically elected representatives of the Burmese people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">             Moreover, we want to convey to you, and to all the people of Burma, our heartfelt support for Burma&#146;s just cause and a future based on respect for human rights, democracy, the rule of law, and freedom for all.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">             The 14 women Senators who signed the letter are: Senators Feinstein, Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Patty Murray (D-WA), Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Susan Collins (R-ME), Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">             A report released yesterday by the Council on Foreign Relations Independent Task Force on Burma urged the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to condemn the military junta&#146;s crackdown on the democratic opposition and Suu Kyi&#146;s detention.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">             The report by the Task Force also found that her latest detention &#150; which follows at least seven years of earlier imprisonments after her New Democratic Party won the 1990 national election &#150; was only the tip of the iceberg of the regime&#146;s truly despicable human rights record:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> *                      Over 1,300 political prisoners are still in jail many of them elected parliamentarians;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*                      The practice of rape as a form of repression has been sanctioned by the Burmese military;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*The use of forced labor is widespread;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*                      Trafficking in young boys and girls as sex slaves is rampant;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*                      The government engages in the production and distribution of opium and methamphetamine.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

            The legislation, sponsored by Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senator Feinstein, would impose a  ban on all imports from Burma until the President determines and certifies to Congress that Burma has made substantial and measurable progress on a number of democracy and human rights issues.  A similar bill introduced in the House of Representatives has been approved in committee, but has not yet been taken up by the House.</font></p>

<p>             <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I urge the House to approve this legislation as soon as possible so the United States can firmly demonstrate to the junta and the world that we will not stand for its repressive rule and its attempts to crush the legitimate democratic representatives of the Burmese people,&#148; Senator Feinstein said.</font></p>
