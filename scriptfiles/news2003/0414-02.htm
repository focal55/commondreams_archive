                - April 14 - On Tax Day, April 15, dozens of state and local Green 

                Parties nationwide will undertake aggressive campaigns to educate 

                Americans about the effect the war on Iraq is having on the U.S. 

                economy. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We have events 

                happening in Alaska, California, Idaho, New York, and Delaware," 

                said Starlene Rankin, co-organizer of GPax, the Green Party's 

                Peace Action Committee, which is coordinating the activities. 

                "We'll be educating people about why there's no tax money left 

                to provide human services, education, health and infrastructure, 

                when billions of tax dollars go to corporations making weapons."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens in these 

                states will leaflet post offices with Green Party 'Guns and Butter' 

                flyers and the War Resisters League's military pie chart brochures. 

                New York Greens will distribute flyers at the General Post Offices 

                in Manhattan and the Bronx and outside major subway stops. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"New York City 

                residents are perhaps more aware than other Americans that the 

                Bush administration is impoverishing the citizens of the United 

                States in order to enrich a few defense contractors and oil corporations," 

                said Elizabeth Shanklin, a New York Green peace activist. "We 

                are losing firehouses, educators, library access, jobs, housing, 

                and health care." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens in San 

                Jose, California will participate in "Billionaires for War," a 

                satirical event on the war's billion-dollar windfall for corporations 

                favored by the White House. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Who are the 

                real winners of the war on Iraq? Bechtel, Alliant, TRW, Northrup 

                Grumman, and Boeing have multibillion dollar deals, with an unlimited 

                contract for Halliburton," said Heron Baker, Idaho Green delegate 

                to the party's national committee and GPax co-organizer. "Who 

                are the homefront losers? Child care for poor working families, 

                health care (especially AIDS), Head Start, the EPA, public housing, 

                job training, and other services. The Bush Administration has 

                also proposed a $1.4 trillion 'diversion' of Social Security to 

                pay for other programs in the next ten years." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed 

                2004 military budget is $399.1 billion (a $48 billion increase), 

                not including the requested $79 billion for 6 months for the war 

                on Iraq. A Yale report estimates that an additional $300 billion 

                will be needed to secure Iraq over two years of occupation. By 

                2035, the estimated cost of Bush's national missile defense program 

                will be $1.2 trillion. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Many Americans 

                are wondering whether the alleged weapons of mass destruction 

                will ever be found in Iraq," said Heron Baker. "The supposed threat 

                of an imminent attack by Iraq with WMDs was Bush's major justification 

                to invade. It's becoming more and more apparent that our economy 

                is being looted by the Bush Administration for a war based on 

                fraudulent premises."
