                5 - Responding to the report recently released by the Commission 

                on Opportunity in Athletics, Ralph Nader and League of Fans sent 

                a letter today to Secretary of Education Roderick Paige urging 

                him to reject all recommendations that would potentially allow 

                schools to reduce the number of athletic opportunities and scholarships 

                they are currently obligated to provide women under Title IX. 

                Title IX bars sex discrimination in any educational program or 

                activity that receives federal funding, including athletics. The 

                letter follows. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Secretary 

                Paige, </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are writing 

                to voice our strong support for Title IX  one of the most important 

                and successful civil rights laws in U.S. history  and to express 

                our concern over the recommendations made to you by the Commission 

                on Opportunity in Athletics to undermine the enforcement of Title 

                IX. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you know, 

                Title IX has affected positive change in this country for over 

                three decades. Prior to Title IX, if a woman wanted to pursue 

                a professional degree in college, she could be passed over for 

                a law school or medical school program simply because she was 

                a woman. Similarly, opportunities for girls' and women's sports 

                participation at all levels was absurdly deficient. Since then, 

                Title IX has been a vital tool in advancing equal opportunities 

                for women and girls in the classroom and on the playing field. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the benefits 

                of Title IX are not limited to opening opportunities for girls 

                and women who are happier, healthier and more confident because 

                they have played sports. Nor do the benefits end with the countless 

                women who have gone on to successful careers and trace their accomplishments 

                back to Title IX. What Title IX has achieved in influencing boys 

                and men who respect girls and women and their athletic, academic 

                and workplace abilities is every bit as important and nothing 

                short of remarkable. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the very 

                start, your creation of the Commission on Opportunity in Athletics 

                was widely believed to be a vehicle to push a pre-determined Bush 

                Administration agenda to weaken Title IX. Heavily weighted to 

                oppose Title IX, the Commission voted to recommend scaling the 

                law back based on misguided arguments blaming Title IX for the 

                elimination of some "lower profile" men's sports (men's sports 

                opportunities actually continue to grow), rather than the increasingly 

                excessive and irresponsible spending on the college football and 

                men's basketball "arms races." The Commission has perpetuated 

                offensive stereotypes that girls and women are not as interested 

                or as talented in playing sports as men -- a bias that civil rights 

                laws like Title IX seek to eliminate. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite their 

                heroic efforts in defense of Title IX, Commission members Julie 

                Foudy and Donna de Varona were heavily outnumbered both in terms 

                of the unbalanced composition of the Commission and witness testimony 

                that was skewed. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With ten out 

                of the fifteen Commissioners affiliated with Division 1-A schools 

                (most of them administrators or coaches from big-time football 

                schools or conferences) with the most self-interest in weakening 

                Title IX, representation was clearly slanted. So too was the witness 

                testimony with panelists hand-picked by the Department of Education 

                testifying two-to-one against current Title IX standards while 

                many civil rights activists and legal experts in favor of Title 

                IX were not heard. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the 

                gains women have made under Title IX, resources for women's sports 

                have never caught up to resources for men's sports at most colleges 

                and universities. Women are still being discriminated against, 

                with over 80 percent of schools still not in compliance with Title 

                IX. Women's athletic programs continue to lag behind men's programs 

                by every measurable criterion, including participation opportunities, 

                athletic scholarships, operating budgets and recruiting expenditures. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 56 percent 

                of our college populations are female, female athletes still receive 

                only 42 percent of all college athletic participation opportunities, 

                36 percent of sports operating expenditures, 32 percent of athlete 

                recruitment spending, and 42 percent of athletic scholarship money 

                -- amounting to $133 million less than male athletes receive in 

                scholarships each year. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Your recent 

                statement that the Department of Education will move forward only 

                on recommendations that received unanimous agreement of the Commission 

                is a step in the right direction, but not a satisfactory commitment 

                to protecting the Title IX policies that guarantee equal opportunity 

                for women and girls. In their Minority Report, Commission members 

                Foudy and de Varona raised serious objections to the entire document 

                and explicitly dissented from a few of what were characterized 

                as "consensus" recommendations. Foudy and de Varona say they unsuccessfully 

                "urged another meeting of the full Commission to carefully review 

                the language and impact of the final report," prior to publication. 

                Upon review of the report's treatment of some supposed "consensus" 

                recommendations as drafted, they made clear that they did not 

                agree with the report's formulations of previous points of agreement. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Foudy and de 

                Varona argue that the Commission recommendations (many of which 

                "would seriously weaken Title IX's protections and substantially 

                reduce the opportunities to which women and girls are entitled 

                under current law") are the result of a flawed process that failed 

                to address key issues or "reflect an understanding of the discrimination 

                women and girls still face in obtaining equal opportunity in athletics." 

                This criticism applies as well to the misnamed "consensus" recommendations. 

                In moving forward, you should give careful attention to the Minority 

                Report's recommendations, which were crafted with an eye toward 

                enhancing opportunities for both women and girls, and men and 

                boys. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Parents want 

                our sons and daughters to know that they are equally valued and 

                will receive equitable opportunities to play and be treated fairly 

                in athletics and in life. If your goal is to undermine Title IX 

                and the positive change the law has affected for more than three 

                decades, you will be sending a message to women, men, girls and 

                boys that their rights and abilities are different and unequal. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge you 

                to reject the recommendations (12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23 

                and the unnumbered recommendation) that would potentially allow 

                schools to reduce the number of athletic opportunities and scholarships 

                they are currently obligated to provide women under Title IX. 

                Make no mistake about it, if you choose to support any of those 

                proposals, you will be supporting discrimination against women 

                at educational institutions that receive federal funds. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until women 

                have the same opportunities as men to enjoy the psychological, 

                physiological and sociological benefits that sports participation 

                can provide, your duty is to preserve and vigorously strengthen 

                the enforcement of Title IX. </font>
