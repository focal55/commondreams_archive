<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AMHERST, MA - September 12 - Prominent media coverage of the Catholic Church sexual abuse 

scandals has reinforced inaccurate and misleading stereotypes of gay men as 

child abusers.  That was the conclusion of a study released today by the 

Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies (IGLSS).</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, entitled &quot;Subtle Stereotyping:  The Media, Homosexuality,and 

the Priest Sexual Abuse Scandal,&quot; analyzed the content of 1,326 news 

articles reported in the Boston Globe during the first year of the scandal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout the year's coverage, Globe readers were exposed to an average of 

two articles per week that linked homosexuality and child sexual abuse.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study's authors, psychologists Glenda Russell and Nancy Kelly, suggest 

that the Globe's linkages between homosexuality and child sexual abuse were 

not necessarily intentional.  However, as Russell adds, &quot;Linkages don't have </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to be intentional to be harmful.  The stereotype of gay-man-as-pedophile 

gets used in many policy contexts to justify discrimination and violence 

against gay people.&quot;  In their study, Russell and Kelly separately applied a research technique designed to study implicit messages in written material.  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The two authors' independent analyses of the articles were in agreement more than 95% of the time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When Catholic Church spokespeople began to place the blame for</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the abuse 

explicitly on gay priests,&quot; points out Russell, acting executive director of </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IGLSS, &quot;the Globe reporters often-but not always-directly refuted those 

claims.  Independent social science research is quite clear that gay men are </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">not more likely to commit child sexual abuse than non-gay men.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More subtle or indirect conflations of homosexuality and child sexual abuse 

occurred more frequently and were rarely challenged within articles.  As an 

example, Russell noted an article that describes several incidents of 

priests abusing children, yet begins with a description of a sexual 

encounter between two adult men.  Placing stories of the scandal alongside 

descriptions of other inappropriate behaviors and emphasizing the victims' 

sex also help to create a misleading association between homosexuality and 

abuse, according to the report.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before news of the Catholic Church scandal broke, public perceptions of gay 

men as pedophiles had begun to fade, the authors note.  When news media 

reopen old and unsupported stereotypes, they may inadvertently renew the use of such misinformation.  Therefore, the report argues that journalists and 

editors have a responsibility to become more aware how they contribute to 

stereotyping.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report concludes with recommendations for media professionals who wish 

to ensure accurate and fair coverage of the ongoing scandal.  

Recommendations include reporting on the stereotype itself, exercising 

greater vigilance to eliminate indirect conflations, and consulting with 

communication specialists.</font></p>
