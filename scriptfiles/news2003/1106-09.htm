<td valign="top" align="left" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- November 6 - Support for protecting the Northwest's economy and salmon runs reached a milestone today, with 100 House members signing on to the bipartisan Salmon Planning Act. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Introduced by Representatives Jim McDermott (D-WA) and Thomas Petri (R-WI), this bill has three main elements -- a science analysis by National Academy of Sciences (NAS) of current and anticipated salmon recovery actions, General Accounting Office (GAO) studies on how to best transition local economies to a free-flowing lower Snake River and authority to the Army Corps of Engineers to remove the four lower Snake River dams, if dam removal is deemed necessary by the federal agencies charged with protecting salmon and complying with tribal treaties.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What this is really about is ensuring the region has a strong economy and healthy wild salmon runs,&quot; said Michael Garrity, associate director, federal dams program, American Rivers.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This bill is a step toward a comprehensive solution, a vision for the future that works for people, salmon and the economy.&quot;  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The federal salmon plan, which was recently deemed illegal under the
Endangered Species Act by a federal court judge, required aggressive efforts at habitat protection and restoration and increased water flows, but was implemented at less than 30 percent this past year.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even if it had been implemented at 100 percent, scientists say that the surest way to avert extinction and restore salmon to abundant harvestable levels is to remove the four lower Snake River dams.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is a growing chorus of lawmakers saying that the road to salmon
recovery cannot continue to be gold-plated,&quot; said Autumn Hanna, senior
policy analyst, Taxpayers for Common Sense.  &quot;Spending billions on failing
recovery efforts is unacceptable. This bill provides a plan to avoid this
fiscal river of ruin.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The growth in congressional support for the Salmon Planning Act comes on the heels of an October 10th letter from 118 Members of Congress urging President Bush to consider &quot;all scientifically credible options,&quot; including lower Snake River dam removal, as his administration crafts a new salmon plan.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first aspect of the bill would require that the NAS complete a
scientific analysis of the actions undertaken in the Pacific Northwest to
protect and recover endangered salmon and steelhead.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Secondly, the bill commissions studies from the General Accounting Office to better understand the economic and community impacts of partially removing the four lower Snake River dams in eastern Washington.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, the bill gives the Army Corps of Engineers the authority to remove the dams, but only if dam removal is deemed necessary to comply with the Endangered Species Act, tribal treaties or the Clean Water Act.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Removing the four lower Snake River dams makes sense scientifically; however, we need the Salmon Planning Act to show us how to get there,&quot; said Shannon Ryan, endangered species associate, U.S. Public Research Interest Group.  &quot;We must ensure that the best thing for salmon is done the right way.&quot;  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Salmon Planning Act would clarify that federal agencies have the authority to call for lower Snake River dam removal if necessary, but even if federal agencies called for dam removal, the dams could not be removed without congressional appropriations.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Passage of the Salmon Planning Act would allow lower Snake dam removal to be considered on equal footing with a host of other recovery measures such as estuary habitat restoration, and hatchery and harvest reform.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Members of Congress are lining up on this common-sense legislation. The Salmon Planning Act's studies would provide the best information to show how dam removal -- a viable option -- would affect and potentially benefit, our region and nation. It would put an end to a lot of the speculation and fear-mongering by giving us solid studies. It's a smart bill for making smart policy,&quot; Kathleen Casey, regional field director, Sierra Club.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A cyclical improvement in ocean conditions has resulted in some larger salmon runs over the last three years, but wild (as opposed to hatchery-bred) Snake River salmon and steelhead remain below the levels needed for recovery.  Scientists are unsure how long ocean conditions favorable for salmon will last.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We cannot keep relying on Mother Nature's good graces to keep our salmon from extinction,&quot; said Pat Ford, executive director, Save Our Wild Salmon. &quot;We must ensure that we are doing everything to protect our salmon -- a Northwest icon and one of the very foundations of our economic and cultural spirit.&quot;  </font></p>
