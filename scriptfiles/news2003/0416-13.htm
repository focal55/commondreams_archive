                  officials, including President Bashar Assad. He said today: 

                  &quot;The proposal that Syria is reportedly putting forward 

                  at the U.N. for a Mideast free of weapons of mass destruction 

                  is a very good one.&quot; Abourezk is in D.C. on Wednesday and

                  went to Saudi Arabia, where he was detained in a camp for over 

                  a year. He is now teaching at the University of California at
