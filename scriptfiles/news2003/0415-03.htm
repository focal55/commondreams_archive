                - April 15 - The American Lung Association today welcomed a new 

                Environmental Protection Agency proposal to clean up pollution 

                from heavy equipment and other non-road diesel engines, as well 

                as require cleaner diesel fuel. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This EPA proposal, 

                when finalized and fully implemented, will dramatically reduce 

                air pollution from these diesel engines and protect public health, 

                " said John L. Kirkwood, President and CEO of the American Lung 

                Association. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2000, EPA 

                finalized rules that require the significant clean up of heavy-duty 

                trucks and buses and highway diesel fuel. Today's proposed rule, 

                when fully implemented, will provide additional dramatic reductions 

                of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides from the non-road sector. 

                This rule will help protect seniors, children and people with 

                lung diseases including asthma, who are among the most vulnerable 

                to the health effects caused by air pollution. Particulate air 

                pollution has been linked to thousands of premature deaths and 

                diesel exhaust has been classified as a likely human carcinogen 

                by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA proposal will 

                help reduce the health threat posed by diesels. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This proposal 

                must not be used by those who want to weaken or reopen the 2000 

                rules regulating heavy-duty trucks and buses and highway diesel 

                fuel," said Kirkwood. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The American 

                Lung Association will educate the public about the substantial 

                benefits of cleaning up diesel engines and the need to maximize 

                the pollution reductions from this rulemaking," said Kirkwood. 

                "Through our public comments, we will work to convince EPA to 

                clean up all diesel engines including marine engines and locomotives."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, with 

                Environmental Defense, the American Lung Association released 

                a new report Closing the Diesel Divide, Protecting Public Health 

                From Diesel Air Pollution to spotlight the magnitude of the impact 

                of diesel air pollution. The EPA proposal is a major part of the
