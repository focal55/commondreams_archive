- September 9 - With the fifth ministerial of the World Trade Organization (WTO) about to get underway in Canc&uacute;n, the food policy think tank, Food First/Institute for Food and Development Policy, is predicting that the battle cry of the social movements around the world, &quot;Derail the WTO!,&quot; might come true. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Every promise made to the developing countries-countries that form 80 percent of the WTO membership-has been broken to suit the interests of the richest 20 percent,&quot; said Anuradha Mittal, co-director of Food First, who will be attending the ministerial in Canc&uacute;n. &quot;As it stands right now, the draft proposal aims to create a global corporate constitution which will wreak havoc on developing countries around the world.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The draft proposal ignores developing countries' central concern around the United States and European Union farm subsidies. The draft also ignores the demand developing countries have made for protection of traditional foods and crops from dumping practices by richer countries, which threatens their food sovereignty. The draft also has brushed aside concerns around biodiversity, patents on life, and seed monopolies. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the poorest countries, whose commercial advantage lies with their farm products and textiles, continue to pay the stiffest tariffs on their exported goods. The proposal put forward for Canc&uacute;n by the rich nations forces sharp tariff cuts on developing countries, while allowing themselves to escape large cuts. For example, Kenya and Bolivia are expected to reduce tariffs by 80 percent, the EU by 28 percent, and the U.S. by a mere 24 percent. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The brute power of the United States and Europe have all but created an economic canyon between them and the South,&quot; said Peter Rosset, co-director of Food First, who will also be attending the ministerial. &quot;It is not surprising that farmer organizations around the world are opposed to the proposed agreement on agriculture in the WTO. Free trade has already dropped crop prices in most countries below the cost of production and farmers are finding it increasingly difficult to survive.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Is it too early to say that Canc&uacute;n will not produce agreements on any significant liberalization? Well, we might want to take a clue from the WTO itself, that has hinted at the possibility of holding another ministerial meeting in Geneva, six months after planned talks in Canc&uacute;n, to continue with the failed Canc&uacute;n agenda of the U.S. and EU,&quot; said Mittal. </font></p>
