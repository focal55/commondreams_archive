- November 18 - &quot;The League of Women Voters of the United States (LWVUS) opposes the energy bill that Congress will consider this week, and is calling on its tens of thousands of members nationwide to act quickly to help stop this ill-conceived measure,&quot; stated Kay J. Maxwell, President of the LWVUS.   </FONT><P> </P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The final version of the bill undermines existing environmental protections, makes global warming worse, and fails to provide for needed energy conservation measures,&quot; noted Maxwell.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;After months of secret negotiations, the final energy bill that emerged contains many provisions that are harmful to public health and the environment.  Chief among these is a provision that guts Clean Air Act protections,&quot; Maxwell said.  &quot;According to a 2002 Environmental Protection Agency report, more than 130 million Americans live in areas that violate clean air safeguards.  This energy bill will delay relief to those living with dirty air and compromise the health of the elderly, people with lung disorders and children,&quot; stated Maxwell.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The bill fails to take affirmative steps to curb global warming and, in fact, will dramatically increase air pollution and global warming through huge new incentives for burning coal, oil and gas.  In addition, the bill fails to provide for real energy conservation - the key element for any good energy policy,&quot; Maxwell noted.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Our natural environment and the health of millions of Americans, including children and the elderly, are at stake with this legislation.  This is a bad bill and the League is working to block it from becoming law,&quot; concluded Maxwell.</FONT></P><P></P><P> </P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>The League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan political organization, encourages the informed and active participation of citizens in government, works to increase understanding of major public policy issues, and influences public policy through education and advocacy.</I></FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
