- May 5 - In response to the barrage 

of recent tornadoes, the American Red Cross is rushing hundreds of 

relief workers to the devastated areas. Relief operations are 

already underway in Missouri, Kansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and 

Arkansas, where the Red Cross is providing for the immediate needs 

of the tornado victims, including food and shelter, as well as 

grief counseling and emergency healthcare and medication needs. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, as a large portion of the nation continues to be 

threatened by severe weather, the Red Cross is urging those ahead 

of these storms and those at risk for future threats to prepare 

now. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Already, over a dozen Red Cross shelters have opened throughout 

the affected states to give displaced families a place where they 

can sleep, get vital information about available assistance, have 

a hot meal, talk with a mental health worker or meet with a health 

services worker about any of their healthcare needs. Meanwhile, Red 

Cross damage assessment workers are scouring the affected areas to 

determine the extent of the widespread devastation. Emergency 

Response Vehicles (ERVs) outfitted to deliver food, water, comfort 

and hygiene supplies, as well as mobile kitchens, that can serve 

5,000 meals per day, have been mobilized within the affected 

communities. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Red Cross has activated a toll-free information and resource 

hotline, 1-866-GET-INFO. Callers to this hotline can learn shelter 

locations, recovery and preparedness information, where and how to 

receive Red Cross assistance or speak with a mental health 

counselor who can help those coping with the emotional trauma from 

the tornadoes. The Red Cross is also working to connect loved ones 

from outside the affected areas with family members in 

tornado-impacted communities. Those seeking information about the 

welfare of family members should call 1-866-GET-INFO.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nature's most violent storms, tornadoes can occur any time 

throughout the year and have been recorded in every state. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, the Red Cross provided lifesaving disaster relief for 

more than 4,775 families whose lives were turned upside by the 

devastating power of 32 tornadoes that roared through U.S. 

communities. The Red Cross set up tornado relief operations in 19 

states, from Utah to Wisconsin to Pennsylvania, in a season that 

was active and destructive from March through December. In the 

aftermath of these storms, Red Cross disaster relief workers 

provided safe shelter for more than 710 displaced residents in 47 

shelters and served over 437,000 meals for affected families. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The tornado season is now in full swing and the likelihood of 

continued storms and tornadoes remains high. The recent offspring 

of tornadoes has uprooted the lives of many, and the Red Cross 

continues to urge communities to be prepared. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Creating and Practicing a Home Tornado Plan: Pick an 

uncluttered place where family members could seek shelter: a 

basement, a center hallway, bathroom, or closet on the lowest 

floor. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Assembling a Disaster Supplies Kit: Kits should contain a 

first aid kit and essential medications, canned food and manual can 

opener, bottled water, flashlights and a battery-powered radio with 

extra batteries and other emergency items for the whole family. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Heeding Storm Warnings: Listen to your local radio and TV 

stations for updated storm information. A tornado WATCH means a 

tornado is possible in your area. When a tornado WARNING is issued, 

go to the safe place you picked to protect yourself from glass and 

other flying objects. If you are outside, hurry to the basement of 

a nearby sturdy building or lie flat in a ditch or low-lying area. 

If you are in a car or mobile home, get out immediately and head 

for safety. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Preparing for High Winds: Make trees more wind resistant by 

removing diseased and damaged limbs, then strategically removing 

branches so that wind can blow through. Install permanent shutters 

on your windows and add protection to the outside areas of sliding 

glass doors. Strengthen garage doors and unreinforced masonry. Move 

or secure lawn furniture, outdoor decorations or ornaments, trash 

cans, hanging plants and anything else that can be picked up by 

wind and become a projectile.
