<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- October 8 - The annual conference of the National

Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty will kick off the evening

of Thursday, Oct. 16 with a panel discussion that will examine the

status of the death penalty in Tennessee.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

Co-hosted by NCADP's state affiliate, the Tennessee Coalition to

Abolish State Killing, the conference will feature four days of

workshops, keynote speeches, author signings, artistic performances

and a Friday afternoon rally in front of the Tennessee state capitol. 

The conference will be held at the Sheraton Downtown Nashville.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

Brian Roberts, NCADP executive director, said Tennessee is a logical

state to host the national conference because it reflects the growing

national debate over the death penalty. &quot;Many people who end up on

Tennessee's death row get there because of ineffective assistance of

counsel, prosecutorial misconduct or because of convictions based

on the perjured testimony of a jailhouse informant,&quot; Roberts said.&quot;These are problems that are currently being addressed in Illinois

and in other states, and need to be discussed and debated in

Tennessee as well.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

Highlights of the conference include:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

****An opening panel discussion at 7 p.m. Thursday that will

challenge the notion that Tennessee's death penalty system is

any less flawed than those in states such as Illinois and Florida.

Panelists include former Tennessee Supreme Court Justice Penny White, 

NAACP-Nashville President Rev. Sonnye Dixon and Mary Ann Hea, a

board member of the Tennessee chapter of the National Alliance for

the Mentally Ill.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

****A Friday afternoon rally at 3:30 p.m. in front of the state

capitol. Speakers will include prominent leaders of national

anti-death penalty organizations, including NCADP's Brian Roberts.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

****A Friday evening performance by The Healing Stage entitled,&quot;Last Words: Resurrecting Our Nation's Executed.&quot; This national

production company is visiting Nashville in conjunction with

NCADP's annual conference.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

****Workshops Friday and Saturday dealing with such topics as

death row survivors, the moratorium movement, mentally ill people

on death row, and John Ashcroft and the efforts to expand the

federal death penalty.
