- December 22 - TomPaine.com, in its final Op Ad for the year in The New York Times, holds the administration to account for its lack of vision and misplaced priorities. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Keying off the White House's thoughts about sending a man to the moon as a way to galvanize the American public in the new year, the ad says &quot;Imagine how this country would be transformed if the President were to rally the nation to truly accomplish what is now just one of many empty promises: leave no child behind.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It continues:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;A White House acting on behalf of our children would begin by abandoning its efforts to dismantle health insurance programs for poor children and weaken Head Start. It would fully fund its own Leave No Child Behind Act. It would ensure that every kid had access to pre-kindergarten education and comprehensive after-school care. The Clean Air Act would be strengthened, not weakened. And debt-creating tax cuts would be rescinded.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Our country has always risen to great leadership. We could send another man to the moon. But we'd be better served if President Bush had the vision to send millions of healthy, well-educated children into the future.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To view the ad visit: <A HREF="http://tompaine.com/op_ads/opad2.cfm/ID/9648" TARGET="_new">http://tompaine.com/op_ads/opad2.cfm/ID/9648</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">TomPaine.com is a nonprofit, nonpartisan Internet journal.
