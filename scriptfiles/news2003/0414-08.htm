                - April 14 - Common Cause welcomes the House Ethics Committee’s 

                interpretive guidelines on recent changes to the gift ban rules, 

                but believes the changes must still be reversed. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Rep. Hefley 

                and the Ethics Committee have written helpful and narrowing interpretations 

                to these new rules, and we welcome that,” said Chellie Pingree, 

                president of Common Cause. “But the weakened rules are still in 

                place, so the underlying problem remains: Special interests have 

                the opportunity to curry favor with Members of Congress and their 

                staffs. These interpretations may be able to limit some of the 

                damage caused by the rule changes, but we still need to have the 

                gift ban rules restored.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House on 

                Jan. 7, with no public notice and little debate, voted to roll 

                back gift ban rules put in place under former House Speaker Newt 

                Gingrich (R-GA) in 1995 to restore the public’s faith in the integrity 

                of Congress. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the 

                changes relaxes the $50 gift limit on food to congressional offices, 

                while the other repeals the ban on reimbursement for charity fundraising 

                event. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hefley, chairman 

                of the Ethics Committee, wrote in an advisory opinion dated April 

                11 that Members and staff must refuse food gifts, even within 

                the dollar limits of the gift rule, if the person sending the 

                food has a direct interest in the particular legislation or other 

                official business on which staff is working at the time. “Acceptance 

                of the food in that circumstance may implicate the illegal gratuities 

                statute…” the opinion said. Hefley also makes clear that the food 

                gifts must be disclosed. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hefley’s panel 

                also said it would scrutinize trips made under a loophole engineered 

                by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX) to encourage lawmakers 

                to attend his own charity golf tournament, being held today and 

                tomorrow in Key Largo, Florida. That change would allow special 

                interests to pay for lawmakers’ travel and lodging to charity 

                events. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hefley states 

                in his advisory opinion that special interests will not be permitted 

                to earmark charitable donations to pay for Members’ expenses to 

                charity events, such as golf tournaments, where they can get valuable 

                face time with Members. Hefley also defines a “charity event” 

                as one whose primary purpose is to raise money for charity. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause 

                commends Mr. Hefley for taking steps in the right direction to 

                address the problem, and will continue to work to build support 

                in the House to reverse the gift ban changes. </font>
