                WA - April 16 - The Associated Students of Western Washington 

                University set a policy this week that requires all A.S. offices 

                and organizations to use 100% post consumer paper. The A.S. Board 

                of Directors also passed a resolution endorsing the switch, and 

                encouraging other University departments to follow their lead. 

                </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After months 

                  of research by a team of students and administrative staff, 

                  it was determined that the cost of switching to 100% post consumer 

                  paper is minuscule, and outweighed by the long-term benefits 

                  of the switch. The paper contract will be awarded to New Leaf 

                  Paper or Badger Paper, both environmentally responsible companies 

                  and industry leaders in post consumer content paper.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bids for 

                  100% post consumer paper were offered by Georgia Pacific and 

                  Boise Office Solutions, but were rejected due to both companies&#146; 

                  socially and environmentally irresponsible business tactics. 

                  &#147;We believe that the A.S. has taken a bold step by, not 

                  only switching to tree free paper, but also pursuing the most 

                  socially and environmentally responsible companies in the paper 

                  industry,&#148; said Trey Avery, head of Students for Environmentally 

                  Responsible Business, the student organization that lead the 

                  paper campaign at Western. &#147;I don&#146;t want my tuition 

                  dollars supporting a company that is involved in the logging 

                  of old-growth and endangered forests around the world. Any school 

                  or company that does business with Boise is in the business 

                  of forest destruction.&#148;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Western 

                  is joining a long list of companies and institutions that have 

                  canceled their contracts with Boise as a result of the environmental 

                  problems plaguing the company. Kinko&#146;s, Levi Strauss, L.L. 

                  Bean, Patagonia, the University of Texas at Austin and the University 

                  of Notre Dame are just a few of Boise&#146;s former customers 

                  that severed business ties with the logging giant for its refusal 

                  to stop the destructive practice of selling products made from 

                  endangered, old growth forests. Boise actively logs old growth 

                  forests throughout the U.S., and distributes wood products from 

                  endangered old growth forests around the world, including pristine 

                  forests in British Columbia. Boise has also come under increasingly 

                  intense public criticism for failing to join more than 400 companies, 

                  including Home Depot, Lowe&#146;s and Kinko&#146;s in a pledge 

                  to stop selling products made from endangered, old growth forests.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Widespread 

                  public support exists for old growth forest preservation. According 

                  to the Los Angeles Times, 9 out of 10 Americans favor preserving 

                  our remaining wilderness, and a Yankelovich poll shows that 

                  nearly two-thirds of Americans support old growth forest protection. 

                  Most tellingly, the Los Angeles Times reported last April that 

                  70 percent of consumers in traditional timber regions such as 

                  Oregon and Washington favor an end to old growth logging.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite 

                  this, Boise is leading the charge against the popular U.S. Roadless 

                  policy, a measure that would protect 58.5 million acres of America&#146;s 

                  public wilderness areas and is considered the most significant 

                  forest conservation measure in the last 100 years. Boise is 

                  also a top logger of forests on U.S. public lands and is one 

                  of America&#146;s largest distributors of wood products from 

                  endangered, old growth forests throughout Indonesia, Canada, 

                  Chile, and Russia.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 

                  three-quarters of the world's old growth forests have already 

                  been logged or degraded, much within the past three decades. 

                  In the U.S., less than five percent of original forests remain.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This 

                  is a major victory, but just the beginning of the larger campaign 

                  at Western,&#148; said Avery. The coalition of campus environmental 

                  groups, which includes Students for Environmentally Responsible 

                  Business, Western Environmental Watch, and the A.S. Environmental 

                  Center are now asking the rest of the University to switch to 

                  tree-free paper.</font></p>
