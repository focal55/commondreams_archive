                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

                  - April 4 - Legislation intended to improve farmers&#146; access 

                  to animal drugs would have the unintended effect of undercutting 

                  the Food and Drug Administration&#146;s (FDA) approval process 

                  for genetically engineered (GE) animals. That bill was criticized 

                  today by leading health, consumer, and environmental groups, 

                  who fear that transgenic animals, like fast-growing salmon, 

                  would be marketed without undergoing a thorough government review. 

                  FDA is planning to regulate GE animals by applying its existing 

                  authority to regulate animal drugs. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, representatives 

                  of the groups wrote all U.S. Senators about the potential food-safety 

                  and environmental concerns presented by transgenic animals. 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The 

                  application of genetic engineering in plant agriculture has 

                  already proven controversial ... and the commercialization of 

                  transgenic animals will almost certainly draw more public concern 

                  than plants such as soybeans,&#148; wrote the groups. The signers 

                  included officials of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, 

                  the Consumer Federation of America, Environmental Defense, and 

                  others. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The legislation 

                  at issue is S. 741, the Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Health 

                  Act, sponsored by Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL). Consumer and 

                  environmental groups say the bill should either be opposed or 

                  amended to exclude transgenic animals. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Whether 

                  intentional or not, the proposed legislation would fast track 

                  transgenic animals and handcuff FDA from ensuring safety before 

                  those animals hit the marketplace,&#148; said Gregory Jaffe, 

                  director of CSPI&#146;s biotechnology project. </font></p>
