- October 10 - The Children's Defense Fund (CDF) will celebrate its 30th anniversary by awarding scholarships to three outstanding high school students who have persevered to overcome tremendous obstacles in their lives. As part of the dinner celebration, to be held October 14, at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., these three young people will be honored for their hard work, academic excellence, community service and personal determination to &quot;beat the odds.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joining CDF President Marian Wright Edelman to present the &quot;Beat the Odds&quot; awards will be Roger Guenveur Smith, who plays Francisco Dupre on the new HBO docudrama series, &quot;K Street.&quot; Guests also will be treated to a performance by Diane Schuur and Maynard Ferguson with the Big Bop Noveau Band. News anchor Susan Kidd of NBC 4 in Washington, will emcee the event. 

The Children's Defense Fund celebrates 30 years of working to improve the lives of children through research, public education, advocacy, grassroots organizing and lobbying. Since its founding in 1973, CDF has held faithfully to its vision of an America that puts children first and lives up to its promise of equal opportunity for all people. While CDF has made significant improvements in the lives of millions of children and families, there is still much to be done to ensure that our rich nation provides all children what they need to learn, achieve and reach successful adulthood.</font></p>
