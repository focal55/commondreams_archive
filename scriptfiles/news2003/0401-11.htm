                and CHARLEY RICHARDSON, mfso@mfso.org, <a href="http://www.mfso.org" target="_new">www.mfso.org</a> 

                Lessin and Richardson are founding members of Military Families 

                Speak Out. They have a son who has been deployed in the Gulf and 

                just learned that he will be going into Iraq. They are in touch 

                with over 300 other families of people from every branch of the 

                military currently deployed in the Gulf and can help arrange interviews. 

                Lessin said today: "The most supportive thing that anyone can 

                do for our troops right now is to halt this invasion and protect 

                their lives as well as the people in Iraq. We need to end not 

                just this war, but also a foreign policy that drives these aggressive 

                wars." Richardson added: "If I saw my son getting into a car with 

                a drunk driver, I would try to stop that car from moving. For 

                me to stand on the side of the road and salute would be ridiculous."

                Solomon is co-author of the new book Target Iraq and executive 

                director of the Institute for Public Accuracy. He said today: 

                "While Donald Rumsfeld serves as a lightning rod for criticism, 

                the president of the United States has ultimate authority -- and 

                ultimate responsibility -- for all major policy decisions. But 

                the current debate over U.S. military strategy in Iraq is hollow; 

                it routinely accepts the continuation of a war that is a flagrant 

                violation of the U.N. Charter. The only way to end that violation 

                -- and to halt the ongoing slaughter -- would be to stop the bombing 

                and immediately withdraw American troops from Iraq." </font>

                jhorner@oaklandnet.com In California last night, Brunner moderated 

                the Oakland City Council's teach-in on the invasion of Iraq, the 

                first such city-organized teach-in. Erlich and Zunes, below, also 

                spoke at the teach-in. </font>

                rerlich@pacbell.net Co-author of Target Iraq, Erlich said today: 

                "The credibility of the U.S. military is highly suspect. It repeatedly 

                claimed that Umm Qasr and An Nasiriya had fallen and that there 

                was an uprising in Basra. Video provided by Al-Jazeera, which 

                still has a reporter in Basra, showed otherwise. Now, the U.S. 

                military is attempting to disavow responsibility for the bombing 

                in Baghdad that killed over 50 civilians. But Robert Fisk of Britain's 

                Independent is on the ground and has published what appear to 

                be the serial numbers of the U.S. missile that struck the Baghdad 

                neighborhood." Erlich will be visiting Canada beginning Thursday, 

                then continuing on to Seattle, Olympia and Portland. </font>

                of Tinderbox: U.S. Middle East Policy and the Roots of Terrorism, 

                Zunes said today: "The Pentagon claims that civilian casualties 

                are 'unavoidable.' This, however, is patently false. Civilian 

                casualties are unavoidable only if the war is unavoidable. This 

                war was not unavoidable." Zunes is a specialist on the Mideast, 

                including Syria.
