- September 17 - Greens called the breakdown of

talks at the World Trade Organization (WTO)

ministerial in Canc&uacute;n, Mexico a victory for the

movement against globalized corporate power. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Green activists especially praised the resolve of 21

developing nations in resisting the demands from

wealthy nations that they submit to privatization of

water, agricultural export subsidies, and other

schemes to drain resources, create poverty and

dependence, and repeal eco and human rights

protections and democracy for the benefit of western corporations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The influence of Greens around the world, especially

the Greens/EFA group, in cooperation with global

justice movements and developing countries, helped

bring these negotiations to a halt,&quot; said Annie Goeke,

co-chair of the International Committee of the Green

Party of the United States and one of two American

Green delegates at the WTO meeting.  &quot;We were pleased

to see the Kenyan delegation stand up to intense

pressure from the U.S. and European Union, thanks to

Kenyan Green Party Deputy Wangari Maathai, who serves

as Kenya's Minister of Environment.  Maathai has

worked for decades to inform Africans and other

developing nations about the destructiveness of

corporate control over people and land.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's obvious that the WTO cannot work in its present

form,&quot; said Jim Polk, Virginia Green and the other

Green delegate at the WTO meeting.  &quot;Canc&uacute;n broke down

because of injustice, double standards, and the lack

of democracy.  U.S. and European governments have

abused the doctrine of free trade to enlarge the power

of corporate elites, and the rest of the world will no

longer stand for it.  Elections throughout South

America are showing that the people reject these trade authorities, but WTO bureaucrats are the last ones to accept the decision of the people.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, Greens warn that, with the collapse of

negotiations in Canc&uacute;n, many developing nations will

be forced to deal with the crushing economic power of

the U.S. bilaterally. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Greens want fair trade, negotiated democratically,&quot;

said Tony Affigne, co-chair of the International

Committee.  &quot;We want trade rules to protect the

environment and labor rights.  We want the world's

farmers treated with dignity.  Fair trade rules will

let nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America

distribute affordable drugs for AIDS and other

diseases.  They'll protect the world's drinking water

from ruthless privatization, crops from genetic

engineering, local markets from global price wars.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;But after the collapse in Canc&uacute;n,&quot; Affigne warned, &quot;a checkerboard world of bilateral and regional agreements will pose new challenges for the fair trade movement. That new struggle is just beginning.&quot;</font></p>
