                20 years as a Foreign Service Officer of the U.S. Department of 

                State, most recently as political counselor in the U.S. Embassy

                a master's degree from the University of California at Berkeley 

                and a bachelor's degree from Swarthmore College. He was a member 

                of a group who received the 1994 Rivkin Award, given by the American 

                Foreign Service Association for constructive dissent for signing 

                a memorandum protesting the U.S. failure to stop the slaughter 

                of Bosnians by the Serbs. Five foreign service officers resigned 

                to protest that policy, and the administration subsequently changed 

                course. </font>
