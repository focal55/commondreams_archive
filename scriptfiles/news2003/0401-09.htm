                YORK - April 1 - Greenpeace today called on all members of the 

                United Nations to reject moves by the US to block a resolution 

                in the UN General Assembly condemning the invasion of Iraq and 

                calling for a ceasefire and withdrawal of US and British armed 

                forces. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a communication, 

                obtained by Greenpeace, the United States urges countries to vote 

                against or abstain from supporting a General Assembly meeting 

                to discuss the war, adding it would be considered "unhelpful and 

                directed against the United States." They further threaten that 

                invoking the Uniting for Peace resolution will be "harmful to 

                the UN." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This communication 

                is nothing short of a thinly veiled threat. This is the last chance 

                for the overwhelming majority of UN member states who are opposed 

                to this war to stand up for the charter of the UN and the rule 

                of law," said Greenpeace campaigner Mike Townsley. "It's vital 

                that UN member states reject US pressure to undermine their rights, 

                and support the Arab League's resolution to call for an end to 

                the ongoing invasion of Iraq which is costing more lives day by 

                the day," he added. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under UN Resolution 

                377, the so-called 'Uniting for Peace' Resolution, a majority 

                of the member states of the UN can call for an extraordinary session 

                of the General Assembly when the Security Council has failed in 

                its primary responsibility to maintain international peace and 

                security, because of a 'lack of unanimity' among the permanent 

                members. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A few weeks 

                ago, George W. Bush wanted the members of the UN Security Council 

                to 'stand up and be counted', and to cast their votes in open 

                session," said Townsley. "But, after it was clear they were going 

                to lose, American and British diplomats opted out and never brought 

                the resolution to a vote. As opposition to the war continues to 

                grow, the US is desperate to squash further debate. We call on 

                all nations to vote with their consciences and with the overwhelming 

                majority of global public opinion, and not to give in to US diplomatic 

                and economic threats," he added. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This latest 

                move by Arab League diplomats comes one week after Arab League 

                foreign ministers adopted a resolution calling for action by the 

                UN Security Council. Last week's resolution stated that, if the 

                Security Council route failed, as it did, the issue must be brought 

                to the General Assembly.
