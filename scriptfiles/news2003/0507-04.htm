- May 7 - Below is a letter from Families USA in support of the Democratic economic stimulus proposal that would provide $18 billion in immediate relief to states by increasing aid for Medicaid.  Many states are currently being forced to cut back on their Medicaid programs. These cutbacks will result in millions of seniors, children, and people with disabilities losing vital health care. Families USA estimates that an $18 billion temporary increase in Medicaid payments to states over the next year would create-or preserve from state budget cuts-at least 268,000 jobs, largely in the health care delivery sector.

Minority Leader

U. S. House of Representatives

The Capitol

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Representative Pelosi:

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Families USA strongly supports the Democratic economic stimulus proposal that you plan to offer as a substitute to the Republican Party's tax cut bill.

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We particularly appreciate your commitment of $18 billion in immediate help to state and local governments by increasing aid for Medicaid.  Families USA and other economists have repeatedly pointed out that increased Medicaid aid is one of the best ways to stimulate state economies (and therefore the national economy), while also preventing devastating cuts in health care to the nation's poorest nursing home residents, people with disabilities, and children in low-income families. Because of state budget requirements, almost every state is making major cutbacks in Medicaid eligibility, benefits covered, and payments to providers. These cutbacks will result in enormous long-term costs as children go untreated, as prescriptions go unfilled, and as mental health services are slashed. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the past we have used Department of Commerce economic models to estimate what a temporary increase in the Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage would mean to a state in terms of jobs created. From our past work in this area, we believe that an immediate $18 billion temporary increase in Medicaid payments over the next year would create-or preserve from state budget cuts--at least 268,000 jobs, largely in the health care delivery sector. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, by concentrating state aid and tax cuts on immediate stimulus items, your bill does not create the huge out-year deficits that the Republican bill creates; your bill does not threaten the future of the American economy and make it impossible to meet the Social Security and Medicare needs of the soon-to-retire Baby Boom generation.

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congratulations on a true stimulus package that immediately helps those who most need help in these difficult times. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sincerely,

 

Ronald F. Pollack

Executive Director
