                - March 17 - A new position paper from the National Council on 

                Disability (NCD) calls for Congress to strengthen the ability 

                of states to assist families with disabilities on welfare to transition 

                from welfare to work. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is now 

                a very strong record that indicates that significant numbers of 

                parents with disabilities and parents with children with disabilities 

                are in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. 

                The record also indicates that many of these families have been 

                sanctioned and have not received the services and supports they 

                need to succeed. Some of the states, using the flexibility that 

                Congress gave them in 1996 and the TANF funds freed up due to 

                falling cash assistance caseloads, have taken very practical steps 

                to assist these families. The federal legislation should include 

                provisions to ensure that people with disabilities receive the 

                appropriate supports and services to enable them to transition 

                to work successfully. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People with 

                disabilities often face multiple barriers to work. In addition 

                to the barriers faced by most low income Americans as they attempt 

                to work, such as inadequate transportation and limited opportunities 

                to improve education and skills, people with disabilities must 

                meet the specific challenges of their physical or mental impairment 

                or health condition-often requiring assistive technology, access 

                to accessible transportation, sign language interpreters, or personal 

                care assistance, work place supports etc. in order to participate 

                in programs designed to assist them in finding work. When appropriate 

                assessments of individual needs for reasonable accommodations 

                are provided, people with disabilities are afforded equal opportunity 

                for full participation, independent living, and economic stability.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paper 

                summarizes research about people with disabilities and TANF and 

                some of the proposals being offered for consideration to improve 

                how TANF-funded programs address the needs of families with a 

                member with a disability. NCD makes the following recommendations 

                for the TANF reauthorization: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Increase 

                TANF and childcare funding; -- Ensure that parents with disabilities 

                are screened, in a timely manner, with appropriate diagnostic 

                tools; -- Prohibit states from sanctioning families until the 

                state has taken steps to identify barriers, provided the family 

                with assistance in meeting the rules; and modified rules, if necessary 

                to address the parent's or child's disability so that the family 

                can comply with TANF requirements; -- Provide states with flexibility 

                in how they define countable work activities, including rehabilitation 

                and participation in other activities that will help the parent 

                to become work-ready, and how they determine the length of time 

                a particular individual or family will need the specific services 

                or treatment; -- Provide states with additional resources to train 

                case workers and other staff who serve TANF recipients about issues 

                unique to disabilities, including how to provide timely and effective 

                screening, and how to identify programs, resources, and opportunities 

                for collaborative community initiatives to achieve systemic improvements 

                in services for people with disabilities; -- Create advisory panels 

                at the state level to assist states in addressing the needs and 

                barriers of people with disabilities; -- Facilitate access to 

                continued Medicaid or other health coverage when recipients move 

                from welfare to work; -- Assist states to better coordinate and 

                provide services needed by children with disabilities and their 

                families to address the multiple challenges facing parents and 

                children with disabilities; and -- Ensure that TANF programs and 

                services comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 

                504 of the Rehabilitation Act. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The TANF block 

                grant, first created in 1996 to replace Aid to Families with Dependent 

                Children (AFDC), was scheduled for reauthorization in 2002. Rather 

                than undertaking the full reauthorization, Congress passed a short 

                extension, which has since been extended to the end of June 2003. 

                It is likely to be reauthorized by Congress in the next few months. 

                As part of the reauthorization process, there have been many proposals 

                to strengthen protections for parents and children with disabilities 

                participating in TANF-funded programs. It is important that the 

                law establish policies that reflect both the intention and desire 

                of people with disabilities to work, and the reality that certain 

                individuals may still have severe work limitations requiring long-term 

                assistance in order to work. </font>
