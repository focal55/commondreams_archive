The new analyses include state-by-state estimates of the number of people losing coverage in 34 states and descriptions of the cuts adopted in each state. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The reports, based on two new national surveys, find that in response to the biggest fiscal crisis since World War II, states are making unprecedented cutbacks in Medicaid and other health insurance programs, such as the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Those cuts have been achieved through reductions in eligibility limits, changes in procedures that make it more difficult for eligible people to enroll or remain enrolled (such as by making the application process more complicated and increasing paperwork and other burdens), and increases in premiums that some low-income people cannot afford.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Almost half of those losing health insurance coverage are children. Large numbers of low-income parents, seniors, people with disabilities, childless adults and immigrants also are losing coverage. The cuts will cause the number of Americans without health insurance coverage to rise. This loss in public insurance coverage comes on top of a loss of private health insurance coverage that has occurred across the nation in recent years.
