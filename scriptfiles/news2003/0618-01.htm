- June 18 - Today, Americans for a Fair Chance (AFC), a project of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Education Fund (LCCREF), launched a new public awareness campaign to educate Americans about the benefits of affirmative action. The campaign is timed to coincide with the upcoming U.S. Supreme Court decisions in the University of Michigan affirmative action cases. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Entitled, &#147;Because Affirmative Action Works,&#148; the multifaceted campaign includes media briefings, a public service announcement, and the launch of a comprehensive online clearinghouse, <a href="http://www.fairchance.org" target="_new">www.fairchance.org</a>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Karen McGill Lawson, executive director of LCCREF, said, &#147;This is a critical juncture in our efforts to preserve affirmative action. Those opposed to equal opportunity will likely seize upon the upcoming Supreme Court decisions&#151;no matter the outcome&#151;to continue their efforts to undermine affirmative action.&#148; </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

In an effort to raise awareness on the efficacy of affirmative action, AFC began a series of events relevant to diverse communities, commencing with a student convening in May, and continuing with other briefings, including a June 18 media briefing on the importance of affirmative action for the nation&#146;s military and national security. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The briefing will include former military leaders who will review the role affirmative action policies have played in strengthening the military academies and ROTC and the impact the Supreme Court decision could have on national security. Future briefings will highlight the support of other institutions&#151;including corporations and institutions of higher education&#151;for affirmative action. Additional student activities are also being planned. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

AFC is also sponsoring a public service announcement campaign that features a diverse cross-section of individuals who explain how they have benefited from affirmative action. The spots are airing on the websites of several non-profit organizations and will be the focus of an online advertising campaign. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

A newly designed web site, <a href="http://www.fairchance.org" target="_new">www.fairchance.org</a>, complements the public awareness campaign. The new site is an online clearinghouse of affirmative action news and information and offers such features as Real People, Real Stories&#151; personal stories of how affirmative action has opened the doors of opportunity; Media Watch, an interactive map of affirmative action media in each state; and a new daily online publication, Affirmative Action in the News, which collects and disseminates affirmative action-related news and information from around the country. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Wade Henderson, LCCREF counsel, noted, &#147;The public awareness campaign will greatly assist our efforts to provide the real story of affirmative action, and to debunk the myths being advanced by those opposed to the policy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The Supreme Court is expected to rule in the next few weeks in two cases challenging the affirmative action programs at the University of Michigan: Grutter v. Bollinger, involving the law school, and Gratz v. Bollinger, involving the University's undergraduate program. </font></p>
