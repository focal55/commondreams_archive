                - March 13 - The Afterschool Alliance today released a new analysis 

                of the current shortfall in federal afterschool funding, and warned 

                that if Congress adopts President Bush's budget proposal for the 

                federal 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) program, 

                more than half a million more children nationwide will be without 

                access to afterschool programs. That figure would be in addition 

                to those already denied afterschool because current funding levels 

                are inadequate to meet existing needs. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Afterschool 

                Alliance collected data from the 31 states where it was available 

                to gauge how well 2002 funding met the need for afterschool from 

                would-be grantees. The Alliance report, Closing the Doors on Afterschool 

                Programs concludes that the current funding shortfall left more 

                than 75 percent of 2002 requests for federal afterschool support 

                unfunded in those states. Federal 21st CCLC funding is now administered 

                by the states. New grant requests in 2002 in the 31 states totaled 

                $768.4 million, with only $188.8 million available. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In two states, 

                more than 90 percent of requested dollars were denied - Minnesota, 

                which was able to fund just eight percent of grant requests, and 

                Mississippi, which was able to fund just nine percent. Five other 

                states fell below the 20 percent mark: Hawaii (16 percent), Michigan 

                (12 percent), North Carolina (17 percent), South Carolina (16 

                percent), and Tennessee (17 percent). </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This data 

                should frighten anyone who cares about keeping children safe in 

                the afternoons and providing them with academic support," said 

                Afterschool Alliance Executive Director Judy Y. Samelson. "We 

                know from past research that afterschool programs can make a huge 

                difference for children and their working parents. This new analysis 

                makes it painfully clear that we're not close to meeting current 

                demand for afterschool. To cut back further on afterschool, as 

                the President proposes, would be to betray our children, their 

                parents and communities." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Closing the 

                Doors on Afterschool Programs also used existing state-by-state 

                allocation formulas to calculate the impact in each state of the 

                proposed Bush afterschool budget cut of 40 percent. Nationwide, 

                the cut from the current $1 billion to $600 million would mean 

                that approximately 561,000 children would be denied afterschool 

                care. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed 

                cut's impact would be even more pronounced when compared to the 

                funding authorization the President signed into law in his No 

                Child Left Behind Act. The legislation called for $1.75 billion 

                in funding in FY 2004. The dollar gap between the Bush proposal 

                ($600 million) and the No Child Left Behind authorization ($1.75 

                billion) would have funded afterschool care for 1.6 million children. 

                Experts say as many as 15 million children are without adult supervision 

                during the afternoon hours. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To calculate 

                the per-child cost for afterschool care, the Afterschool Alliance 

                used the Department of Education's afterschool cost estimate of 

                $700 per child. The Afterschool Alliance contacted each of the 

                50 states and the District of Columbia to request data on grants 

                requested and provided in 2002. For a variety of reasons, not 

                all were able to provide data. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Much of the 

                funding for the 21st CCLC program is committed in multi-year grants, 

                so not all 21st CCLC funds were available for new grants in 2002. 

                According to the U.S. Department of Education's budget justification, 

                across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, $289 million 

                was available for new grants in 2002. </font>
