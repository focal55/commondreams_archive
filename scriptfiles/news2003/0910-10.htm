- September 10 - The U.S. House of Representatives by a one-vote margin last night approved a school voucher plan for the District of Columbia, a move Americans United for Separation of Church and State has condemned as reckless and dangerous.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plan, enthusiastically backed by the Bush administration, would allocate $10 million in federal funds over five years to pay for tuition for an estimated 1,300 students to attend religious and other private schools. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;President Bush and his congressional allies are trying to impose a religious tax on all Americans,&#148; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &#147;The Senate must reject this misguided crusade.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn called on all Americans to contact their senators and urge them to vote against the voucher proposal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The public should not be forced to fund religious schools that are not accountable to the taxpayers,&#148; he said. &#147;At a time when budgets are tight, our first priority must be improving and strengthening public schools.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Continued Lynn, &#147;Concerned citizens need to contact their senators today and tell them to vote no on the D.C. school voucher bill.&#148; (The legislation is S. 1583, the &#147;D.C. Student Opportunity Scholarship Act.&#148;)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House leadership resorted to arm-twisting and underhanded tactics to pass the bill, Lynn charged. He noted that Majority Leader Tom DeLay waited until several Democratic House members left Washington to attend a debate among Democratic presidential candidates before bringing up the bill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DeLay (R-Texas) kept the vote open for 40 minutes while he pressured moderate Republicans to back the plan, ultimately winning a tie-breaking vote from Rep. Ernie Fletcher (R-Ky.), who had earlier voted against the plan. The measure then passed 209-208.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The fact that DeLay and his cronies had to resort to hardball tactics shows how weak voucher support in the House is,&#148; said Lynn. &#147;Had this been a straight up-and-down vote with all members participating, it would not have passed.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Continued Lynn, &#147;This bill was railroaded through the House using tactics of intimidation and deceit. Those of us who oppose vouchers are not afraid of debate and a fair vote. Tom DeLay apparently is. That is a shame.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Senate must not endorse this reckless and dangerous bill,&#148; Lynn said.</font></p>
