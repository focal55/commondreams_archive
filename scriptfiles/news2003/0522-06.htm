<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JAMES PAUL, james.paul@globalpolicy.org, <a href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/irqindx.htm" target="_new">www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/irqindx.htm</a>, <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0520-01.htm" target="_new">www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0520-01.htm</a>

Executive director of the Global Policy Forum, which monitors policy-making at the United Nations, Paul is author of the report "Oil in Iraq: The Heart of the Crisis." Paul said today: "The United States has bullied support from an unhappy and reluctant Security Council. The resolution ... gives legitimacy to the occupation authorities, accedes to a weak role for the U.N., fails to provide for a return of the U.N. inspectors, and turns over control of Iraq's oil resources to the occupiers. The Chilean ambassador has been recalled for failing to show sufficient support and enthusiasm for the U.S. positions. Many threats -- and perhaps promises of a few oil fields -- have brought the Council membership into line. The next step: the U.S. will effectively name the new U.N. representative to Baghdad."

Gordon, a professor at Fairfield University, wrote "Cool War: Economic Sanctions as Weapons of Mass Destruction" in the November 2002 issue of Harper's Magazine. She said today: "The U.N. resolution is a defeat for all those who wanted to see a free, independent Iraq, with the level of health, education, and social development that was present before the sanctions devastated the economy and the well-being of the Iraqi population. We have already seen how the U.S. sets its priorities as an occupying power: the oil fields are protected and put into operation immediately. At the same time, the U.S. has done little to stop the looting -- or restart the production -- of water purification facilities and electrical generators. The U.S. has shown a terrible disregard for Iraq's humanitarian situation over the last decade, as we have seen the U.S. veto essential goods ranging from child vaccines to water purification equipment."

A professor of expert systems at George Washington University, Nagy wrote the article "The Secret Behind the Sanctions: How the U.S. Intentionally Destroyed Iraq's Water Supply" in The Progressive magazine of September 2001. He said today: "According to my conversations with relief officials, Basra is within a week of running out of chlorine needed for water facilities."

Professor of international law at the University of Illinois and author of Foundations of World Order, Boyle said today: "Bush is basically getting the Security Council to reverse the long-standing Stimson Doctrine: That the world will not recognize the fruits of an aggressive war. But that is exactly what the Security Council has just done."

Communications director of the Institute for Public Accuracy, Husseini wrote the report "Autopsy of a Disaster: The U.S. Sanctions Policy on Iraq." He said today: "John Negroponte claimed today that Saddam Hussein was responsible for the continuation of the sanctions, but that claim ignores long-standing U.S. policy of maintaining the sanctions regardless of Iraq's compliance with its disarmament obligations. Just as the sanctions were maintained regardless of law, they are being lifted in similar fashion. Similarly, the devastating humanitarian effect of sanctions is recognized the moment it is convenient to do so.... The absence of the Syrian ambassador says a great deal about the Arab regimes: pathetically caught between their people and a U.S. government claiming a desire for democracy."
