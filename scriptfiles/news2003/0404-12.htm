                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK 

                  - April 4 - A recent Washington Post article describing the 

                  killing of civilians by U.S. soldiers at a checkpoint outside 

                  the Iraqi town of Najaf proved that &quot;embedded&quot; journalists 

                  do have the ability to report on war in all its horror. But 

                  the rejection by some U.S. outlets of Post correspondent William 

                  Branigin's eyewitness account in favor of the Pentagon's sanitized 

                  version suggests that some journalists prefer not to report 

                  the harsh reality of war.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pentagon 

                  version was the one first reported in U.S. media-- sometimes 

                  in terms that assumed that the official account was factual. 

                  &quot;What happened there, the van with a number of individuals 

                  in it...approached the checkpoint,&quot; reported MSNBC's Carl 

                  Rochelle (3/31/03). &quot;They were told to stop by the members 

                  of the 3rd Infantry Division. They did not stop, warning shots 

                  were fired. Still they came on. They fired into the engine of 

                  the van. Still it came on, so they began opening fire on the 

                  van itself.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fox's John 

                  Gibson (3/31/03) presented the story in similar terms: &quot;We 

                  warn these cars to stop. If they don't stop, fire warning shots. 

                  If they don't stop then, fire into the engine. If they don't 

                  stop then, fire into the cab. And today some guys killed some 

                  civilians after going through all those steps.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But later 

                  on the night of March 31, the Post released its story on the 

                  shooting that would appear in the April 1 edition of the paper. 

                  Branigin's report described U.S. Army Capt. Ronny Johnson's 

                  attempts to avoid the incident as he directed his troops via 

                  radio from the checkpoint:</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;'Fire 

                  a warning shot,' he ordered as the vehicle kept coming. Then, 

                  with increasing urgency, he told the platoon to shoot a 7.62mm 

                  machine-gun round into its radiator. 'Stop [messing] around!' 

                  Johnson yelled into the company radio network when he still 

                  saw no action being taken. Finally, he shouted at the top of 

                  his voice, 'Stop him, Red 1, stop him!'</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;That 

                  order was immediately followed by the loud reports of 25mm cannon 

                  fire from one or more of the platoon's Bradleys. About half 

                  a dozen shots were heard in all.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;'Cease 

                  fire!' Johnson yelled over the radio. Then, as he peered into 

                  his binoculars from the intersection on Highway 9, he roared 

                  at the platoon leader, 'You just [expletive] killed a family 

                  because you didn't fire a warning shot soon enough!'&quot; ---</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Post's 

                  account is significant because it suggests that, in fact, military 

                  procedures may not have been properly followed at the checkpoint. 

                  Several U.S. papers, including the New York Daily News, Boston 

                  Globe, Chicago Tribune, L.A. Times and San Francisco Chronicle, 

                  managed to include the discrepancy between the official Pentagon 

                  account and the Post's eyewitness description in their reports 

                  on the Najaf killings in their April 1 editions. The New York 

                  Times, however, did not, instead running a story that only presented 

                  the official version, under a headline that stated as a definite 

                  fact that adequate warning had been given before soldiers opened 

                  fire: &quot;Failing to Heed Warning, 7 Iraqi Women and Children 

                  Die.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While it's 

                  possible that the New York Times, unlike other East Coast papers 

                  like the Daily News and the Globe, had a deadline that did not 

                  allow it to include information from the Branigin article, the 

                  Times ran a follow-up article on April 2-- &quot;U.S. Military 

                  Chiefs Express Regret Over Civilian Deaths&quot;-- that still 

                  omitted any mention of the description of the incident in the 

                  Washington Post. The piece, by Christopher Marquis, described 

                  the victims as being &quot;killed when their van apparently 

                  failed to stop after orders by American guards.&quot; It rehearsed 

                  the official version of events (&quot;that soldiers fired warning 

                  shots to stop the van, then fired into the engine, but that 

                  the van continued forward, forcing troops to fire into the passenger 

                  compartment&quot;) and quoted Gen. Richard Myers on &quot;our 

                  policy of doing all we can to spare civilian lives&quot;-- all 

                  without mentioning the contradictory firsthand account from 

                  the Post.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Times 

                  was not the only outlet that either overlooked or chose to ignore 

                  the reporting that undermined the official story on the killing. 

                  NPR's Nick Spicer reported on the April 1 All Things Considered-- 

                  which aired at least 18 hours after the Post story broke-- that 

                  &quot;what we're hearing here at CENTCOM is that troops fired 

                  a warning shot as a vehicle approached a checkpoint. The vehicle 

                  did not stop. It then fired at the engine block. The vehicle 

                  continued. And then they fired in the passenger compartment 

                  and they killed seven women and children.&quot; Branigin's account 

                  was not mentioned.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Atlanta 

                  Journal-Constitution summarized the story thus on April 2: &quot;Seven 

                  Iraqi women and children are killed at an Army checkpoint 20 

                  miles north of Najaf after they failed to heed warning shots.&quot; 

                  The Houston Chronicle reported on April 1, without qualification, 

                  that &quot;U.S. troops...opened fire on a civilian vehicle that 

                  refused their order to halt and ignored warning shots.&quot; 

                  Although the story cited the Washington Post on the number of 

                  people killed in the incident, it ignored the parts of the Post 

                  account that contradicted the official account that the Chronicle 

                  treated as fact.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even the 

                  Washington Post itself, in an April 2 story by a different reporter, 

                  failed to mention Branigin's reporting when it reiterated the 

                  official description of the incident: &quot;At another checkpoint 

                  on Monday, U.S. troops blasted an approaching vehicle carrying 

                  as many as 16 people, most of them women and children, in the 

                  belief that an attack was underway. Ten people in the vehicle 

                  died. Soldiers said later that they fired warning shots that 

                  were ignored.&quot;</font></p>
