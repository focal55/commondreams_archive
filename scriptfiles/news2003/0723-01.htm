- July 23 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), the leader of the opposition to the war against Iraq in the House, took to the House floor, today, to challenge the President to take responsibility for his actions. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Kucinich stated:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Stephen Hadley, the Deputy National Security advisor tried to take the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Adviser off the biggest hook in town by accepting blame for the President falsely claiming in the State of the Union that Iraq was trying to go nuclear.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Hadley says he had 'forgotten' the previous memos from CIA Director Tenet discounting an Iraq-Niger uranium connection and neglected to remove this information from the speech.  So the American people are being asked to believe that the bogus cause of war against Iraq, eliminating a nuclear threat, was advanced because a lower level functionary simply overlooked a memo from a higher level functionary?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;That the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Adviser all were blissfully unaware of the fact that false nuclear claims they were circulating about Iraq were simply the result of a memo misfiled by a National Security clerk named Hadley.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Hadley?  Hardly!  Hadley?  Hardly!  Hadley? Hardly!&quot;</font></p>
