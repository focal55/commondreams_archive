- July 16 - Statement of U.S. PIRG Democracy Advocate Adam Lioz.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the second act of the &quot;wealth primary&quot; being staged for presidential nominations, candidates reported their fundraising totals to the Federal Election Commission last night.  The clear winners are big money donors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. PIRG's analysis shows that 29% of the money raised from individuals by 2004 presidential hopefuls would have been illegal before the passage of last year's Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), also known as McCain-Feingold.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BCRA doubled the amount that individuals are permitted to contribute directly to federal candidates' campaigns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The result is that candidates are raising more money from wealthy contributors and a smaller percentage of their funds from average Americans. In fact, 76% of 2004 presidential candidates' individual fundraising came in contributions of at least $1,000-up from 62% in the first two quarters for 2000 candidates.  Only 14% of candidates' individual money came below $200.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A $2,000 contribution limit is simply out of reach for all but an elite few Americans.  It gives one Washington lobbyist who can afford a maximum donation the same influence as 40 middle class families each contributing $50.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While big money donors are stuffing President Bush's coffers and deciding who has the resources to compete for the Democratic nomination, average citizens are priced out of the game.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new limits are a boon for the handful of Americans who can afford a $2000 ticket to each political event.  But they've left the rest of us in the cheap seats-farther from the action than ever before.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Presidential campaigns should be contests of ideas, not battles for big bucks.  Successful candidates should have to appeal to a broad spectrum of society, not just the economic elite.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That's why U.S. PIRG is working to improve the presidential public financing system and why we've asked the courts to strike down the increase in contribution limits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The State PIRGs have joined candidates, voters, students, civil rights leaders, and others in a suit challenging the increases in hard money contribution limits contained in BCRA.  The suit, which will be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on September 8, 2003, charges that the doubled limits violate the Equal Protection clause of the U.S. Constitution by denying non-wealthy candidates and voters equal access to the political process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opponents of reform are always talking about limiting speech.  But doubling the limits is devastating for the political speech of ordinary Americans who can't afford to give $2,000 to the candidates they favor. Our voices are being drowned out in a sea of big money.</font></p>
