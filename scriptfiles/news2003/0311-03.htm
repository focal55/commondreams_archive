                11 - Public Citizen applauds the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s 

                (NRC) Atomic Safety Licensing Board for refusing to approve an 

                application by a private consortium to build a high-level nuclear 

                waste storage facility in Utah. We hope that when the consortium 

                appeals, as it most certainly will, the NRC carefully reads the 

                board’s opinion and heeds its concerns. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Private Fuel 

                Storage, LLC, a consortium of nuclear utilities led by Xcel Energy, 

                is seeking a license to build and operate an aboveground nuclear 

                waste storage facility on the Skull Valley Goshute Indian Reservation 

                near Salt Lake City. The facility would store up to 44,000 tons 

                of waste from commercial nuclear reactors across the country in 

                as many as 4,000 dry storage "casks." The company wants to build 

                the facility directly under the airway used by the military to 

                fly single-engine military jets (F-16s) from Hill Air Force Base 

                to the Utah Test and Training Range. NRC staff had argued that 

                the probability of a plane crashing into the facility was negligible, 

                but the licensing board decided the risk of a military aircraft 

                crashing into the facility was too great to let the companies 

                proceed. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The state of 

                Utah and the licensing board are to be commended for their excellent 

                work in defense of public health and safety, which prevailed in 

                Monday’s almost unprecedented ruling against a nuclear industry 

                applicant. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The licensing 

                board has requested additional information about the consequences 

                of a potential airplane crash on the proposed facility. In the 

                meantime, NRC commissioners will review – and could overturn – 

                the board’s ruling. We urge them not to. An accident at the Utah 

                site or as waste is shipped there could have deadly consequences. 

                This project should not be allowed to proceed.
