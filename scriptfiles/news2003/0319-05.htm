                - March 19 - "While President Bush declares that the goal of his 

                war is "liberty and peace" for the Iraqi people, there's a terrible 

                danger that the breakdown of Iraqi society in the wake of the 

                invasion will place women in special peril," said Jo Chamberlain, 

                California Green and member of the steering committee of the Green 

                Party of the United States. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During Monday's 

                speech, the President announced his intention "to build a new 

                Iraq that is prosperous and free." Similarly, during the U.S. 

                war on Afghanistan, Colin Powell, Condoleeza Rice, and Laura Bush 

                promoted the war as benefiting women: "Because of our recent military 

                gains in much of Afghanistan, women are no longer imprisoned in 

                their homes. They can listen to music and teach their daughters 

                without fear of punishment." (Radio Address by Laura Bush to the 

                Nation," November 17, 2001) </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Greens 

                say that the U.S track record in Afghanistan and previous occupations 

                indicates that Iraqi women will face numerous dangers. A 2003 

                report on Afghanistan by Human Rights Watch notes that the fall 

                of the Taliban enabled former warlords to return to power, and 

                that many were assisted and financed by the U.S. Since the warlords 

                regained control, many Afghan women and girls have faced the same 

                intimidation and restrictions they faced under the Taliban. Schools 

                have been destroyed and women ordered not to show their faces.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Women delegates 

                to the ruling Loya Jirga have been threatened against participating 

                in elections, and women in portions of the country have suffered 

                increased sexual violence," said Elizabeth Shanklin of the Green 

                Party of New York State. "The failure of the U.S. to ensure the 

                safety and freedom of Afghan women and girls is likely to be repeated 

                in Iraq." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The presence 

                of 100,000 troops at minimum occupying post-war Iraq will create 

                a typical environment for the trafficking of women to meet soldiers' 

                "rest and relaxation" needs. Past collusion of U.S. military officials 

                in prostitution in countries including the Philippines and the 

                Honduras through licensing of brothels and medical exams has been 

                documented, and red-light districts exist near American bases 

                throughout the world, including the U.S., Okinawa, and Germany. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Local police 

                and government officials are often involved in management and 

                protection of brothels. Many women in the sex industry are coerced 

                through false employment agencies, kidnapped, sold by their families, 

                or indentured to smugglers. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The concentration 

                of troops creates a demand for prostitution," added Jo Chamberlain. 

                "This demand drives the sex trafficking industry, with tacit approval 

                by U.S. military officials." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The low status 

                of women in countries surrounding Iraq guarantees little support 

                for women who are forced into prostitution. Syria, Jordan, Saudi 

                Arabia, Kuwait, and Iran all have severe penalties for prostitution, 

                and trafficking and coercion of women for sex occurs throughout 

                the region. Victims of sexual trafficking are highly susceptible 

                to HIV and AIDS and, in some areas, life expectancy of women and 

                girls in brothels is 25 years or younger. The collusion of police 

                and local government officials in military prostitution guarantees 

                there is no access to assistance. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The world 

                we want for women, one that guarantees freedom, health, and safety, 

                cannot be gained through war and occupation," said Starlene Rankin, 

                organizer of the Green Party's national Women's Caucus and delegate 

                from the Lavender Caucus. "Those of us who are now protesting 

                Bush's invasion should also turn our attentions, as the war begins, 

                to the welfare of Iraqi civilians and the responsibility of military 

                officials. Even if a humanitarian catastrophe is inevitable, we 

                need to do everything we can to ensure the protection of civilians 

                during and after the war, especially women, children and others 

                who are especially vulnerable."
