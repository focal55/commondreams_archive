'We are raising funds to save this national treasure and at the same time are informing listeners about the history otherwise forgotten or suppressed.'</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">'The Pacifica Radio Archives has unique materials,' said  Larry Appelbaum, Senior Studio Engineer and Supervisor at the Library of Congress in Washington DC. 'Sometimes it's one of a kind and it becomes increasingly important to preserve these tapes and discs so that not only this generation can enjoy and appreciate the content but each successive generation can as well.'</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHO: The broadcast will include rare recordings of speeches and interviews with some of the most influential and controversial thinkers and cultural figures of the past 50 years, including Malcolm X, Fannie Lou Hamer, John Coltrane, Jacques Cousteau, Rachel Carson, Paul Robeson, Angela Davis, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Dylan Thomas, George Carlin, Woody Guthrie, and Edward Said.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WHAT: Also included in the broadcast are historical moments that are part of Pacifica Radio&#146;s unique legacy, such as the first American reporting in 1966 from North Vietnam and a 1962 interview with a former FBI agent offering the first known expose on the bureau and J. Edgar Hoover ever presented by American radio or television.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Audio-tapes of Patty Hearst while she was being held by the Symbionese Liberation Army secretly dropped off at both KPFK and KPFA stations in 1974 and the two KKK bombings of Pacifica's Houston station during their first year in 1970 are also included. One of highlights of the day will be a riveting telephone interview with an Iranian revolutionary holding hostages in the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979. When asked if the hostages will be executed, the Iranian student claims they have proof that the hostages are spies, and Americans should pressure President Carter to return the Shah to Iran. The State Department called KPFK the next day and warned the manager to never repeat such a broadcast. On a lighter note (no pun intended) the broadcast also includes the legendary1954 interview with guests smoking marijuana live on Pacifica&#146;s airways.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">BACKGROUND: Pacifica Radio&#146;s founder Lewis Hill's mission was to create a new kind of radio, supported by listeners, owing nothing to sponsors, providing an outlet for creative expression, and a safe haven for artistic experiments with the medium. Launched in 1949 with KPFA-FM in Berkeley, Calif., the network added stations in Los Angeles, New York, Houston and Washington, D.C over the next 28 years. Perhaps best known as a chronicler of social justice movements and cultural change, Pacifica stations have consistently embraced the performing and literary arts, and provided a stage to experiment with radio drama, spoken word, and the radio documentary.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Established in 1971, the Archives began as a repository for programs of exceptional historic value and those appropriate for rebroadcast by other stations or use as source material for radio producers, artists and scholars. Many of these tapes are extremely rare and have seldom been heard by the general public. The Archives began digitizing recordings and re-mastering the material in 1999. Since then, Pacifica has restored hundreds of historical recordings and requires funds to complete the restoration of thousands more.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">SCHEDULE: Wednesday, Nov. 19th, 'Voices of Courage and Dissent,' go to <A HREF="http://pacificaradioarchives.org">http://pacificaradioarchives.org</A>. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>For preview CDs of select programs contact: Karen Pomer 310.463.7025.</I><BR></FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
