- July 24 - &#147;Sure, I could use this $400 check. But then I think about how the broader

tax cut will affect me in other ways. My daughter will lose her school

librarian and her art teacher. We're going to wait longer for the bus. The

municipal pool is going to be closed this summer. You know, at some point,

as a taxpayer I have to say, 'Yes, it's my money, but I got something for my

tax dollars, and now it's going away.'&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ironically, some of the child tax credit checks that President Bush is

mailing to parents starting today will go to efforts to oppose Bush&#146;s &quot;tax

breaks for the rich&quot; agenda.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">United for a Fair Economy has launched a &#147;Let&#146;s REALLY Leave No Child

Behind&#148; petition drive and pledge campaign (online at

<a href="http://www.FairEconomy.org/childcredit" target="_new">www.FairEconomy.org/childcredit</a>) to oppose the tax break&#146;s windfalls for the

rich as well as the exclusion of low-wage working parents from the tax

credit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some parents are giving their checks to the Fund for Tax Fairness, a pool of

money at the Funding Exchange that gives grants to organizations advocating

more progressive taxation. Others are forwarding part of their child tax

credit to local schools, libraries, and human service organizations that

have been hit hard by budget cuts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the next four years, the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers will receive just 8 percent of the 2003 tax cut, while the top one percent will take home

36 percent. And, despite the President&#146;s &#147;leave no child behind&#148; rhetoric,

12 million children in low-income families will not qualify for the child

tax credits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This year, President Bush is sending an average tax break of $93,000 to

those who earn over $1 million.  But don&#146;t expect him to hold a press

conference to announce it. In fact, Bush has cut taxes on the wealthy so

much that the government will have to borrow $570 billion to make ends meet

this year. That's $7,800 in additional national debt for every single

American child. Instead of checks, Bush should be sending out invoices.&#148;</font></p>
