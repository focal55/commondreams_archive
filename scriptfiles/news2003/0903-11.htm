<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SEATTLE, WA - September 3 - In the wake of President Bush's visit to the Snake River's Ice Harbor Dam, American Rivers today released a report card revealing federal agencies have done a poor job managing salmon migration conditions in the Snake and Columbia rivers.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report card highlights the fact that the lower Snake River dams were violating the Clean Water Act even as the president toured the Snake River's Ice Harbor Dam in late August.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the day of the president's visit, the temperature of the water behind Ice Harbor Dam was 71.1 degrees Fahrenheit, or 3.1 degrees over the Clean Water Act standard of 68 degrees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report card, which looks at river conditions from the spring and summer of 2003, shows that the federal agencies responsible for managing the dams and river flows in the Columbia and Snake river basins have dramatically failed to meet federal standards for seasonal salmon migration flows and water temperature in the Snake and Columbia rivers -- violating both the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Because of the lower Snake River dams, the water temperature in the river is hot for weeks on end, creating harmful and sometimes lethal conditions for young salmon.  It's like having your children swim laps in a hot tub,&quot; said Michael Garrity with American Rivers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At the same time, young salmon aren't getting the water they need to carry them downstream to the ocean.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">High water temperatures also hinder the migration of adult salmon and prolonged exposure can be lethal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the Snake River, federal dam managers failed to meet spring salmon flow targets nearly 75 percent of the time, and failed to meet summer flow targets over 90 percent of the time -- earning two &quot;Fs&quot; from American Rivers.  For Snake River summer water temperatures, dam managers received an &quot;F&quot; because the Clean Water Act standard was violated over 75 percent of the time.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Federal dam managers received three more &quot;Fs&quot; for failing to meet spring and summer flow targets and the summer water temperature standard for the Columbia River even half the time. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Two weeks ago President Bush spoke at a Snake River dam to hail his administration's salmon recovery efforts, while that very dam was in violation of Clean Water Act standards, and had been for 40 days straight,&quot; said Garrity.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In May, federal judge James A. Redden invalidated the 2000 biological opinion for the Columbia and Snake rivers (Salmon Plan), finding that because its measures were not &quot;reasonably certain&quot; to be implemented, it violated the Endangered Species Act.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Judge Redden is supervising the administration's rewrite of the Salmon Plan, and will convene four status conferences over the next year to monitor federal progress.  The first status conference will be held in early October.  Any plan likely to pass judicial muster will need to address the consistent federal failure to meet flow and temperature standards.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In April 2001, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was ordered by another federal judge in a separate case to come up with a plan to bring the four lower Snake River dams into compliance with the Clean Water Act temperature standard for the lower Snake River of 68 degrees Fahrenheit.  Issues related to the corps' compliance with that order are still in court.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the past, federal dam managers have tried to have it both ways in regard to flow targets to aid salmon migration.  On one hand, they have brushed aside repeated failures to meet flow targets by pointing out that they are not mandatory.  On the other hand, they point to the inclusion of flow targets in the federal salmon plan as evidence that the plan protects salmon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's clear that the federal government didn't take the flow targets in the recently invalidated Salmon Plan seriously,&quot; said Garrity.  &quot;Any new salmon recovery plan that keeps the lower Snake River dams in place is going to have to address the ongoing federal failure to provide salmon-friendly flows and temperatures.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While an upswing in ocean survival (a cyclical phenomenon known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) has contributed to strong runs of mostly hatchery salmon for the last three years, wild Snake River salmon and steelhead remain well below levels necessary to achieve recovery.  Some federally-protected salmon stocks have continued to decline in spite of the favorable ocean conditions.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For instance, this year only 12 sockeye salmon made it past the uppermost dam on the lower Snake River on their way to Redfish Lake in central Idaho.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Most of the fish returning this year had been out in the ocean since before President Bush took office, so this administration deserves neither credit nor blame for the size of this year?s salmon returns.&quot; said Garrity.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;But if the Bush administration wants to have both plentiful salmon and the lower Snake River dams, river flow and temperature are certainly two things that will have to improve dramatically.&quot;</font></p>
