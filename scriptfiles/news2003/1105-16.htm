- November 5 - Saying it will protect consumers from &#147;Enron-style&#148; energy market manipulation, Consumers Union today praised the Senate&#146;s approval of an amendment by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash) that will prohibit energy market manipulation.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Senate took a long overdue step to protect consumers from the kind of massive market manipulation that Enron and others perpetrated in the Western electricity meltdown of 2000 and 2001,&#148; said Adam Goldberg, policy analyst with Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;One of the hard learned lessons from that electricity debacle is that when energy companies manipulate the markets, devastating consequences result,&#148; Goldberg added. &#147;Billions of dollars were lost and millions of lives were adversely affected. The toll on businesses both large and small was enormous.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The amendment to the agriculture appropriations bill (H.R. 2673) adopted by the Senate will amend the Federal Power Act (FPA) to prohibit manipulative practices in electricity markets and specify that electricity rates resulting from manipulative practices are not legal. This will strengthen consumer protections, and Goldberg said it should be added to the energy bill that&#146;s now working its way through Congress.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It&#146;s about time that Congress did something to ensure that the kind of devastation Enron and other energy companies caused never occurs again,&#148; Goldberg said. &#147;We certainly hope Congress carries through with today&#146;s vote and ensures that this amendment becomes law and is not dropped for political reasons.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Cantwell amendment was approved by the Senate on a 57 to 40 vote.</font></p>
