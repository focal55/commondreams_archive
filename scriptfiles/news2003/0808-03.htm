UTB brought their acclaimed <a href="http://www.upontheseboards.org/production/lysistrata_project.htm" target="_new">Lysistrata Project-Berkeley</a> to the Berkeley Rep, with a cast of over 100 actors, in March 2003. Recently they have produced the Art is Peace series including the unveiling of the hot new play INKWELL COMMUNIQUES also at the Berkeley Rep. They are a Troupe who present live events (plays, readings, salons &amp; symposia) in innovative ways. Their work focuses mainly on classical material and adaptations of time-honored works, illuminating the human condition yet also prizes the epic sweep of a Modern or Contemporary piece of theatre. UTB'S artistic staging director, Randall Stuart, director of the Berkeley version of the Lysistrata Project, felt compelled to bring Blume out to the Bay Area, so that we all might enjoy her message. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

THE ACCIDENTAL ACTIVIST was written in response to Kathryn Blume&#146;s experience as the co-creator of the <a href="http://www.lysistrataproject.com" target="_new">Lysistrata Project</a>, this solo piece, directed by Michaela Hall, is laced with optimistic socio-political observations and deft sketches of determined women of the world. Blume recounts a story that's part fact, fantasy &amp; caffeine-induced madness. This irreverent and irrepressible performer imagines how she might possibly make a difference on a planet that couldn't care less</font></p>
