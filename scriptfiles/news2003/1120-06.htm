- November 19 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force yesterday called upon Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney to uphold his oath of office by working to implement - rather than oppose - yesterday's landmark court decision finding that denying same-sex couples the freedom to marry violates the state's constitution. Immediately after the decision, Romney said that he would do all he could to stop marriage licenses from going out to &quot;nontraditional&quot; couples.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Statement by National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Executive Director Matt Foreman:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;On January 3, 2003 - just over 10 months ago - Mitt Romney swore to faithfully discharge all the duties incumbent on him under the Constitution of the State of Massachusetts. Yesterday, the state's highest court found that denying same-sex couples the right to marry violates that constitution and gave the legislature 180 days to facilitate the inclusion of same-sex couples in the state's marriage laws. The language of the decision is clear and unambiguous and does not - as Governor Romney claims - give the state the option of creating some separate and inherently unequal framework for same-sex couples. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">By saying he will do all that he can to prevent the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples, the Governor is violating his oath of office. Under his oath, the Governor has only one option - to faithfully and agreeably discharge all the duties incumbent on him under the state constitution - and that means working to implement the decision. As important, he is falling into the hands of those who will use this decision to divide the people of Massachusetts and America. We urge him to step back and do his constitutional duty.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Oath of Office for Governor of Massachusetts: </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;I do solemnly swear and affirm, that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent on me as: according to the best of my abilities and understanding, agreeably, to the rules and regulations of the constitution, and the laws of this commonwealth -- So help me, God.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">November 18 Statement from Gov. Romney: </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman. The exact equivalent to marriage is also reserved to a man and a woman. Over the next several months, I will work with legislative leadership and other legislators and community leaders to decide what kind of statute we can fashion, which is consistent with the law. We obviously have to follow the law as provided by the SJC. Even if we don't agree with it, we are going to follow it in terms of preparing legislation. We will initiate a constitution amendment process that will be consistent with what I think the feelings are of the people of the commonwealth. &quot; </FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
