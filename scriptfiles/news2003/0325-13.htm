                - March 25 - The Project On Government Oversight (POGO) today 

                called on the Pentagon&#146;s Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) 

                to block approval this week of a U.S. Air Force request to purchase 

                the next lot of F-22 fighter aircraft. Some senior Pentagon officials 

                favor canceling this overpriced and unproven system, yet they 

                face the obstacle of Congressional pork barrel politics.</font> 

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;For 

                  every F-22 it buys, the Air Force could buy four tried and true 

                  F-16s. Why are we wasting extraordinary amounts of money on 

                  a system that we don&#146;t need?&#148; said Danielle Brian, 

                  POGO&#146;s Executive Director. </font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The DAB 

                  is due to review the status of the F-22 flight test program 

                  and its readiness to begin initial operational testing in a 

                  two-hour closed-door meeting on Thursday morning. The Air Force 

                  is asking permission to procure 20 of the tactical fighters 

                  this year at a cost of up to $5.3 billion. </font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The F-22 

                  fighter development and testing program is dragging behind schedule 

                  and attempts by the Air Force to control costs are failing miserably, 

                  according to a recent report by the U.S. General Accounting 

                  Office (GAO), &#147;Tactical Aircraft: DOD Needs to Better Inform 

                  Congress about Implication of Continuing F/A Cost Growth&#148;, 

                  GAO-03-280 (see <a href="http://www.pogo.org/p/defense/da-030301-f22.html" target="_new">http://www.pogo.org/p/defense/da-030301-f22.html</a>). 

                  The report concluded that the Air Force has been unable to implement 

                  the cost-saving measures it promised and has kept Congress in 

                  the dark about excessive cost overruns.</font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GAO 

                  also concludes that the F-22 program is experiencing several 

                  technical problems, including violent movement or &#147;buffeting&#148; 

                  of the aircraft&#146;s vertical fins, overheating in some areas 

                  of the aircraft, a weakening of materials in the horizontal 

                  tail, and instability of the aircraft&#146;s avionics software.

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">POGO has 

                  published several reports on its investigations into the F-22 

                  that can be viewed at: <a href="http://www.pogo.org/p/defense/defsubmain.html#f22" target="_new">http://www.pogo.org/p/defense/defsubmain.html#f22</a>. 

                  One report predicted that because of skyrocketing costs, the 

                  Air Force would only be able to purchase 100 to 175 F-22s to 

                  replace the fleet of 1,600 F-16s.</font></p>
