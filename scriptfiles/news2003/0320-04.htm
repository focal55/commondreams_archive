                - March 20 - The Bush administration has begun its attack on the 

                people of Iraq. In an unprecedented use of force, the Pentagon 

                has vowed to “shock and awe” the people of Baghdad into surrender. 

                Today, organizers from the Not In Our Name Project (NION) responded 

                to the news. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robina Niaz, 

                an organizer with NION, said, “Of course the invasion of Iraq 

                is a terrible tragedy. However, this is not a failure of the peace 

                movement but a failure of US foreign policy. I am not discouraged 

                because I believe we have made great strides. Who could have imagined 

                that the whole world would become organized and march millions 

                strong against the war?” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mary Lou Greenberg, 

                another organizer, described how NION will continue its fight: 

                “Now that the war has started, it’s up to the people to stop it 

                as soon as possible, building on everything the movement has done 

                so far – from school walkouts and civil disobedience to resistance 

                from the pulpit. People are going to step up the resistance. We 

                are expecting that with the start of war there will be heightened 

                efforts to silence and intimidate people but the antiwar movement 

                will not be silenced.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“We’re going 

                to work with other forces to take it to a new and more powerful 

                level,” said Maya Sen, another NION organizer. She pointed to 

                the March 5 National Moratorium Against the War that was called 

                by NION, in which thousands of students nationwide walked out 

                of classes. “We encourage people to speak out at their jobs, stage 

                walkouts and teach-ins, and disrupt business as usual. The idea 

                is that people bring resistance into their daily lives.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joe Urgo, a 

                veteran and organizer with NION, said, “This war started before 

                Iraq and is clearly intended to go beyond it. My only answer is 

                relying on the people to stop it. The people in this country have 

                a dynamic role to play, a place where they can put their hands 

                on and change history.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NION, an organization 

                that was founded one year ago this week, has vowed to resist not 

                only the war that will “last a generation,” in the words of the 

                administration, but also the ethnic profiling and roundups of 

                immigrants and other attacks on Americans’ civil rights taking 

                place at home. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maya Sen said 

                that NION is unique in how it links these issues together: “We’ve 

                always taken the position that the aggressive actions the US is 

                taking against immigrants at home is really just another front 

                in the same war the US is fighting abroad on Iraq. There has been 

                a real building of consciousness on this issue over the past year.” 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the time 

                of its inception, NION has grown into a network that includes 

                28 chapters across the country and several in other countries, 

                representing the broad and deep diversity of the peace and justice 

                movement around the globe, and has mobilized hundreds of thousands 

                of people to take action to resist a government program it sees 

                as “immoral, unjust, and illegitimate.”
