                YORK - April 22 - Today, the Center for Constitutional Rights 

                (CCR) will file suit in the United States District Court in Washington 

                on behalf of an elderly couple from Michigan who lawyers say were 

                unfairly penalized under Cuba embargo regulations. Lawyers also 

                say the two were not informed of their Fifth Amendment rights, 

                protecting them from self incrimination.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the 

                  existing economic embargo against Cuba, Americans are allowed 

                  to travel to Cuba but are prohibited from spending any money. 

                  Travelers are presumed to have spent money in Cuba unless they 

                  can prove otherwise and can face large monetary travel fines.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The couple, 

                  Kip, 73 and Patrick, 58 Taylor of Traverse City, MI, sailed 

                  to Cuba on a boating trip in April 1996. Knowing that U.S. law 

                  prohibited spending money in Cuba, they stocked their sailboat 

                  with enough provisions to last for the duration of their three-month 

                  trip. While sailing back to Florida from Cuba, their boat was 

                  caught in a storm and struck by lightning that destroyed the 

                  mast.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Cuban 

                  Coast Guard rescued them in international waters, and the boat 

                  was towed back to port. However, when they applied to the Treasury 

                  Department for permission to repair it, they were told to abandon 

                  the boat&#151;and their two dogs&#151;in Cuba and fly back to 

                  the U.S. After weeks of attempting to negotiate, unwilling to 

                  leave their dogs and dismayed by a decision that would leave 

                  in Cuba assets worth more than the costs of repairs, the Taylors 

                  had the boat fixed. Many of the repairs were done by the Taylors 

                  themselves with the help of visiting sailors who donated parts.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After their 

                  return, the Taylors responded openly to every question asked 

                  by government officers about their trip. The Taylors were never 

                  told about their Fifth Amendment privilege to stay silent, their 

                  right to counsel or that any statements or evidence produced 

                  by them could be used against them in court.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Remarkably, 

                  after disclosing that they gave band-aid to a local cook who 

                  had burned his finger in an accident, The Taylors were charged 

                  with provision of &#147;nursing services to a Cuban national&#148;&#151;a 

                  transaction forbidden by the embargo. For the next four and 

                  a half years, the Taylors&#151;who are on a fixed income&#151;requested 

                  a reconsideration of the penalty or a hearing, without success. 

                  In April, 2001, Patrick Taylors&#146; tax refund, needed to 

                  pay for urgent medical expenses, was frozen and applied to the 

                  Taylors&#146; debt.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 

                  Center has long believed that the embargo is ill advised, illegal 

                  and unconstitutional in that it infringes on the right of every 

                  American to travel freely, said Ron Daniels, Executive Director, 

                  Center for Constitutional Rights. &#147;The way the embargo 

                  regulations are worded makes it very difficult to figure out 

                  what the law is and how to comply with it. Nonetheless, the 

                  Taylors made exceptional efforts to comply despite an incredible 

                  stroke of bad luck. The Taylors' experience is a glaring example 

                  of how the rights of American citizens can be trampled by this 

                  embargo.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shayana 

                  Kadidal, an attorney at CCR said, &quot;In practice, the embargo 

                  has been applied primarily to make examples out of ordinary 

                  travelers for political gain, rather than to limit the influx 

                  of dollars into the Cuban economy. The Treasury Department's 

                  reaction to the Taylors' plight-requiring them to abandon an 

                  easily repaired $40,000 asset to avoid spending money in Cuba 

                  is not only irrational and inhumane, but is profoundly inconsistent 

                  with the alleged purpose of the embargo.&quot;</font></p>

                  for Constitutional Rights represents almost 300 travelers who

                  Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Department of the 

                  Treasury (which enforces the embargo) for allegedly spending 

                  money in Cuba.</font></p>
