- December 3 - Following is a statement of Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW):</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It's been three months since the start of fiscal 2004, and what a surprise, Congress has yet to finish the appropriations process. Though they have missed their appropriations deadline and are faced with a $500 billion deficit, members are finding the time to pile on the pork. In fact, they just introduced the Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal 2004 (H.R. 2673), which consists of seven of the thirteen spending bills. Members often use omnibus bills as a mechanism to get copious amounts of pork, and this one is proving to be no different. The 1,448-page bill totals $820 billion and is stuffed to the brim with parochial projects. Here are some examples of the pork in H.R. 2673:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- $18,500,000 added by the House for the International Fund for Ireland;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- $1,000,000 added by the House for the Alabama Supercomputer Education Outreach Program;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- $725,000 added in conference for the Please Touch Museum in Philadelphia, Pa.;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- $400,000 added in conference for the New York Botanical Garden's Virtual Herbarium project in the Bronx;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- $387,000 added in conference for the Whittier Public Library Children's Area and History Room in the City of Whittier, Calif.;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- $250,000 added in conference for the Cleveland Health Museum in Ohio for exhibits;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- $200,000 added in conference for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland for the Rockin' the Schools education program;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- $200,000 added in conference for the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh for exhibit and curriculum development for the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum at the Senator John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional History Center;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- $50,000 added in conference for the Alaska Moving Image Preservation Association in Anchorage to digitize files/photos/videos of Alaskan history; and</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">-- $50,000 added in conference for the Imaginarium Science Center in Anchorage to develop science exhibits and distance discovery modules.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">CAGW will provide continuing updates on pork in the omnibus spending bill.
