- May 14 - The Million Mom March 

organization and Meetup Inc. today announced a new partnership to 

harness the growing power of technology to allow the Million 

Mom March to continue building an already strong grassroots "army" 

of volunteers concerned about the terrible toll that gun violence 

takes in America. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The partnership will allow the "Moms" to use Meetup.com to 

generate monthly face-to-face get-togethers with others who want to 

work to reduce gun violence in America. Through 

<a href="http://millionmoms.meetup.com" target="_new">http://millionmoms.meetup.com</a>, citizens across America will be able 

to self-organize and meet in local places every month. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Moms are on the march. This organization is getting bigger 

every day -- and we expect this technology will expand our 

organization significantly in the months ahead," said Mary Leigh 

Blek, president of the Million Mom March. "I think of Meetup.com 

as being the modern equivalent of a town hall bulletin board. 

We're a chapter-based organization that can benefit tremendously 

from these new tools." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"What's more American than groups of Americans gathering and 

mobilizing around an issue that they care deeply about? The first 

Saturday of every month is now Million Mom Meetup Day in America," 

said Scott Heiferman, CEO of Meetup, Inc. "Meetup's mission is to 

create local group gatherings and help stimulate local community, 

and we look forward to hearing stories from -- and seeing photos of 

-- Mom's across America getting involved with a cause that they 

believe in." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first "Million Mom Meetup Day" is Saturday, June 7 at 1 p.m. 

local time across America. Meetups will commence in upwards of 490 

U.S. cities and small towns and will continue on the first Saturday 

of each month thereafter. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meetup, Inc. creates global Meetup Days for most any topic. 

Meetups are real world, face-to-face get-togethers that take place 

in 561 cities in 34 countries at local cafis, restaurants, 

bookstores, and other local establishments. Meetup's mission is to 

create local group gatherings and help stimulate local community.
