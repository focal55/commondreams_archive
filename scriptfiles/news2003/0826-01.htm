<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BOSTON, MA - August 26 - CEOs at companies with the largest layoffs, most underfunded pensions and biggest tax breaks were rewarded with bigger paychecks, according to a new 

report, &quot;Executive Excess 2003: CEOs Win, Workers and Taxpayers Lose.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Median CEO pay skyrocketed 44 percent from 2001 to 2002 at the 50 

companies with the most announced layoffs in 2001, while overall CEO pay 

rose only 6 percent. These layoff leaders had median compensation of $5.1 

million in 2002, compared with $3.7 million at the 365 large corporations 

surveyed by Business Week.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the 30 companies with the greatest shortfall in their employees' pension 

funds, CEOs made 59 percent more than the median CEO in Business 

Week's survey. The General Accounting Office has labeled the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency that insures the nation's 

private pensions, &quot;high risk.&quot; Meanwhile, many companies are protecting executives with guaranteed golden retirement packages.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress fueled runaway CEO pay and helped U.S. companies avoid paying 

their fair share of taxes by blocking proposed stock option reforms ten years 

ago. Many corporations have boosted reported profits by not counting stock 

options as an expense in their financial statements to shareholders. Those 

very same corporations do deduct the value of stock option exercises from 

their corporate tax returns, reducing their tax burden. Between 1997 (the year 

that a proposal to require expensing of stock options would have taken

effect) 

and 2002, 350 leading firms received an estimated $3.6 billion in tax 

deductions based on their CEOs filling their pockets with $9 billion in option 

gains. A new proposal to require expensing of options is now under 

consideration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This lost federal revenue is about the same amount as the combined 2003 

budget deficits of seven of the top ten largest states (Florida, Illinois, 

Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, and Georgia). It also approximates the amount by which spending on Medicaid in all 50 states exceeded 

budgeted amounts in 2003. Corporate taxes' share of federal taxes dropped 

from 12 percent in 1996 to 8.7 percent in 2001.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the 25 Fortune 500 companies with the most subsidiaries in offshore tax havens, median CEO pay over the 2000 to 2002 period was $26.5 million -- 87 

percent more than the $14.2 million median three-year pay at firms surveyed 

by Business Week. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The top layoff leader in terms of layoff numbers is Carly S. Fiorina at 

Hewlett-Packard. She fired 25,700 workers in 2001, and saw her pay jump 231 

percent, from $1.2 million in 2001 to $4.1 million in 2002. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The top layoff leader by percentage pay increase is AOL Time Warner's Gerald M. Levin, who presided over 4,380 layoffs in 2001. Levin's pay increased a 

staggering 1,612 percent, from $1.2 million in 2001 to $21.2 million in 2002. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The highest paid layoff leader was Tyco's Dennis Kozlowski, who took home 

over $71 million in 2002, a $34.7 million raise, even though he was forced out 

in disgrace mid-year. In 2001, Tyco laid off 11,300 workers. The top 50 layoff 

leaders cut a total of 465,252 jobs in 2001.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Between 1990 and 2002, average CEO pay rose 279 percent, far more than 

the 46 percent increase in worker pay, which was just 8 percent above 

inflation. CEO pay dramatically outpaced the performance of the S&amp;P 500, 

which rose 166 percent in the same period, as well as the 93 percent rise in corporate profits. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CEO-worker pay gap was 281-to-1 in 2002, nearly seven times greater 

than the 1982 ratio of 42-to-1.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Authored by Sarah Anderson, John Cavanagh, Chris Hartman,and Scott 

Klinger, &quot;Executive Excess 2003&quot; is the tenth annual CEO pay study by the 

Institute for Policy Studies and United for a Fair Economy.</font></p>

inequality.</i></font></p>
