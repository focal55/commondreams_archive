- June 11 &#150; Bill Pryor&#146;s nomination to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals is stark evidence of President Bush&#146;s determination to undo the right of American women to freedom of choice. Pryor personifies the essence of the Bush Administration plan to pack the courts with right-wing ideologues. He is a committed anti-choice activist with a politicized view of the role of the courts. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pryor believes no right to privacy exists in the Constitution and has used extreme and inflammatory rhetoric opposing Roe v. Wade and other related Supreme Court decisions. This raises serious questions about his judicial temperament and ability to fairly decide matters pertaining to reproductive freedom. Pryor&#146;s extreme anti-choice ideology is one he has worn on his sleeve throughout his political career. As Attorney General of Alabama in response to a NARAL Pro-Choice America survey, he stated that abortion should only be legal when the life of the woman is endangered. This view places Pryor out of the legal mainstream and on the fringe of the anti-choice spectrum.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With a legal and political life driven by hostility to a woman&#146;s right to choose, Bill Pryor&#146;s nomination constitutes an insult to American women and must be stopped. If confirmed, Pryor would have the power to severely undermine and possibly contribute to the reversal of Roe. With statements like &#147;Abortion is murder&quot;, and &quot;Roe v. Wade is an abominable decision&#148;, Pryor does not deserve a lifetime appointment to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. NARAL Pro-Choice America calls on the Senate Judiciary Committee reject this nomination immediately.</font></p>
