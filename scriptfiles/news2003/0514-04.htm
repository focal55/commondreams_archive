-  

May 14 - It sounds like 

something that's best treated with an antacid. But many experts 

believe anaerobic digestion (AD) is a microbiological powerhouse 

that could be the key to unlocking the "electrifying power of 

manure." It could also help solve some persistent environmental 

issues associated with animal agriculture production. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AD technology holds such promise that a national summit is 

planned for June 2 - 4 at the Hilton North Raleigh in Raleigh, 

North Carolina to explore ways that it can be used within the 

context of animal waste management, rural economic development, and 

environmental improvement. Scientists, engineers, and government 

and industry officials will examine the opportunities for public 

and private sectors to work together to make the most of this 

technology. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the U.S., approximately 250 million dry tons of animal manure 

is produced yearly. Much of it is applied to farm fields, but many 

agricultural sites are already saturated with nutrients, making it 

increasingly necessary to reduce waste solids volume and to 

transport the manure off-site for use or disposal. One potential 

solution to this issue is anaerobic digester technology -- 

small-scale power plants that can be constructed on livestock 

farms. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By controlling the environment of bacteria in a covered tank of 

manure, farmers can harness the gas that is produced as the 

bacteria interact with the manure and other bacteria. The gas is 

burned to create electricity, which can then be used to power the 

farm, or even provide excess energy to the community. In the 

process, waste volume, odors and pathogens are reduced. AD also 

helps control the use or disposal of nitrogen that could adversely 

impact water quality. The dilemma for scientists, policy makers 

and industry professionals is how to make wider use of this 

technology. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Energy, 

and the Water Environment Federation sponsor the summit. It will 

provide a forum for examining the opportunities for public and 

private sectors to work together to facilitate digester adoption 

within the context of animal waste management, rural economic 

development, and environmental improvement. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is an exciting time for renewable fuels," said USDA's 

Under Secretary for Rural Development Thomas Dorr. "It is a time 

when our nation is looking to our farmers, ranchers, and rural 

businesses for their knowledge and resources in order to help 

America become energy independent and more economically strong," he 

said. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conference co-chair, Ted Payseur (Veenstra & Kimm, Inc.), said 

that in addition to providing a renewable energy source, AD 

technology offers tremendous opportunities for reducing air and 

water quality issues associated with animal agriculture production. 

According to Payseur, "this national summit will provide a forum to 

bring the industry's best and brightest together to maximize the 

use of the technology for both energy production and environmental 

protection."
