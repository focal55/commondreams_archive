                of this Year's Report: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In November 

                2002, the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural 

                Rights recognized that the "human right to drinking water is fundamental 

                for life and health." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In June 2002, 

                the Organization of American States General Assembly passed a 

                Resolution on Human Rights and Environment in the Americas, underscoring 

                "the importance of studying the link...between the environment 

                and human rights," and resolved, among other things, to "encourage 

                institutional cooperation in the area of human rights and the 

                environment in the framework of the Organization." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In October 

                2002, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights held a "General 

                Hearing" on the effects of environmental degradation on the realization 

                of human rights in the hemisphere, for the first time formally 

                and specifically addressing the linkages between human rights 

                and the environment. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Of the 191 

                nations in the world, there are now 109 national constitutions 

                that mention the protection of the environment or natural resources. 

                One hundred of them recognize the right to a clean and healthy 

                environment and/or the state's obligation to prevent environmental 

                harm. Fifty-three constitutions explicitly recognize the right 

                to a clean and healthy environment, and 92 make it the duty of 

                the national government to prevent harm to the environment. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In June 2002, 

                the Costa Rican President signed a decree banning open pit mining 

                in Costa Rica, halting all open pit exploration and mining projects 

                awaiting government approval. The President said the decree was 

                aimed at protecting Costa Rica's environmental wealth noting, 

                "These practices can be a real threat to living beings." </font>

                Linking Human Rights and Environmental Protection </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This report 

                shows repeated and increasing recognition of a human rights-based 

                approach to environmental protection as a prevailing international 

                legal norm. The relationship between environmental problems and 

                human rights violations calls for a holistic treatment of these 

                issues. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International, 

                governmental and non-governmental institutions dedicated to protecting 

                human rights must recognize the connection and take steps to provide 

                mechanisms to address the human rights implications of environmental 

                problems.
