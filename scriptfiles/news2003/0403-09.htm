                - April 3 - A prominent national Islamic civil rights group today 

                urged President Bush to rescind his nomination of an "Islamophobe," 

                who claims 10 to 15 percent of Muslims are "potential killers," 

                to the board of a government institution formed to promote the 

                peaceful resolution of international conflicts. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Washington-based 

                Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) says President Bush 

                yesterday nominated pro-Israel commentator Daniel Pipes, who many 

                American Muslims regard as the nation's leading Islamophobe, to 

                join the board of the United States Institute of Peace, a federal 

                institution created by Congress. The institute's board of directors 

                is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. (Pipes 

                made the claim about Muslims being potential killers in the October 

                8, 2001, issue of the Philadelphia Daily News). </font>

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Pipes' nomination 

                sends entirely the wrong message as America seeks to convince 

                Muslims worldwide that the war on terrorism and the war against 

                Iraq are not attacks on Islam. His bigoted views are incompatible 

                with the mission of the United States Institute of Peace. We respectfully 

                urge President Bush to rescind this ill-considered and poorly-timed 

                nomination," said CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad. He called 

                on the Senate to reject Pipes' nomination if it is not rescinded 

                by the president. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Awad added 

                that Pipes also lacks the credentials required for service on 

                the institute's board. All board members are required by law to 

                "have appropriate practical or academic experience in peace and 

                conflict resolution." "Pipes' anti-Muslim polemics have had the 

                opposite impact of that sought by the institute. His views promote 

                unending conflict, not peace," said Awad. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Muslims say 

                Pipes has a long history of advocating the political disenfranchisement 

                and marginalization of America's Islamic community. In an October 

                21, 2001, speech before the convention of the American Jewish 

                Congress, Pipes stated: "I worry very much from the Jewish point 

                of view that the presence, and increased stature, and affluence, 

                and enfranchisement of American Muslims...will present true dangers 

                to American Jews." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He has decried 

                any positive portrayal of Islamic history and beliefs in public 

                schools and termed the PBS documentary "Muhammad: Legacy of a 

                Prophet" an "outrage." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Jerusalem 

                Post, Pipes called for increased surveillance of ordinary American 

                Muslims. He wrote: "There is no escaping the unfortunate fact 

                that Muslim government employees in law enforcement, the military, 

                and the diplomatic corps need to be watched for connections to 

                terrorism, as do Muslim chaplains in prisons and the armed forces. 

                Muslim visitors and immigrants must undergo additional background 

                checks. Mosques require a scrutiny beyond that applied to churches, 

                synagogues and temples. Muslim schools require increased oversight 

                to ascertain what is being taught to children..." (1/22/03) </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, 

                Pipes faced a storm of criticism when he launched Campus Watch, 

                a web site that included "dossiers" on professors and academic 

                institutions thought to be too critical of Israel or too sympathetic 

                to Islam and Muslims. The web site also sought information from 

                students about their teachers' political opinions. Pipes has been 

                quoted as saying: "The Palestinians are a miserable people...and 

                they deserve to be" (Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, 

                July 2001). His personal web site is maintained by an Israeli 

                settler. He also claims Muslims have no real religious attachments 

                to the city of Jerusalem. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A central theme 

                of Pipes' commentary is that American Muslims are a threat because 

                they have the goal of "transforming (the United States) into a 

                Moslem country" (Jewish World Review, 11/16/2000). In fact, he 

                even claimed to have a special mental "filter" with which he can 

                detect those who want to "create a Muslim state in America" (Salon.com, 

                11/9/2001). He has also compared American Muslim voter registration 

                drives to those of the Communist Party USA. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pipes goes 

                so far as to recommend "vigilant application of social and political 

                pressure to ensure that Islam is not accorded special status of 

                any kind in this country" (Commentary, Nov. 2001). The "special 

                status" Pipes refers to includes ordinary religious accommodations 

                for Muslims in the workplace and "inclusion of Muslims in affirmative-action 

                plans." </font>
