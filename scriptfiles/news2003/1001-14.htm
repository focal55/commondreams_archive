- October 1 -Conservative radio talkshow host Rush Limbaugh has already started a controversy at his new perch on ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown.  On the show's September 28 broadcast, Limbaugh chastised the media for overrating Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb.  According to Limbaugh, reporters have been soft on McNabb because they are &quot;very desirous that a black quarterback do well. There's interest in black quarterbacks and coaches doing well.&quot;  Limbaugh added that McNabb, who has been voted by his fellow players to the Pro Bowl three times, is not &quot;as good as everyone says he has been.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today McNabb held a press conference to respond to Limbaugh's charges. &quot;The people who were watching in the African-American homes, the kids, the parents.... When they hear something like that, what do they think?&quot; he asked.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Limbaugh's comments have sparked a controversy in the media, as columnists and reporters discuss the subject of Limbaugh and racism.  ESPN can't claim to be surprised by the situation.  When the network hired Limbaugh, the talkshow host clearly intended to bring his politics into his sports

commentary: &quot;I am who I am,&quot; he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (7/15/03).  &quot;I think my overall philosophies of life will be a factor.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So is racism a part of Limbaugh's &quot;overall philosophies of life&quot;?  The following op-ed by FAIR's Steve Rendall and FAIR founder Jeff Cohen-- co-authors of 'The Way Things Aren't: Rush Limbaugh's Reign of Error'-- was written in 2000, when Limbaugh was being considered as an addition to ABC's Monday Night Football.  Limbaugh was ultimately rejected for the job.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">by Jeff Cohen and Steve Rendall </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Talk radio host Rush Limbaugh may be returning to television. He recently auditioned for a job as color commentator on ABC's &quot;Monday Night Football.&quot; The tryout followed weeks of self-promotion by the self-styled &quot;truth detector&quot; to the millions who listen daily to his syndicated radio show on some 600 stations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Limbaugh's audition is stirring controversy. Sports columnist Thomas Boswell quipped that if Limbaugh joins &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; then baseball's game of the week broadcasters might &quot;team up with John Rocker.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Veteran sports writer Michael Wilbon, who is black, indicated a boycott might result: &quot;If Rush Limbaugh is put in that booth, I will NOT listen to the broadcast,&quot; he wrote in a Washington Post chat session. &quot;His views on people like me are well documented and I would find it insulting and hypocritical to watch him... There are tens of thousands, probably hundreds of thousands who feel the same way I do.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If ABC hires Limbaugh, it's not clear a boycott will materialize. What is clear is that his expressed views on racial matters -- from the spiteful to the sophomoric -- would make him an odd color commentator. Indeed, CBS Sports dismissed Jimmy the Greek Snyder for ignorant racial remarks, less derisive than some of Limbaugh's.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a young broadcaster in the 1970s, Limbaugh once told a black caller: &quot;Take that bone out of your nose and call me back.&quot; A decade ago, after becoming nationally syndicated, he mused on the air: &quot;Have you ever noticed how all composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble Jesse Jackson?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1992, on his now-defunct TV show, Limbaugh expressed his ire when Spike Lee urged that black schoolchildren get off from school to see his film Malcolm X: &quot;Spike, if you're going to do that, let's complete the education experience. You should tell them that they should loot the theater, and then blow it up on their way out.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a similar vein, here is Limbaugh's mocking take on the NAACP, a group with a ninety-year commitment to nonviolence: &quot;The NAACP should have riot rehearsal. They should get a liquor store and practice robberies.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL) was in the U.S. Senate, the first black woman ever elected to that body, Limbaugh would play the &quot;Movin' On Up&quot; theme song from TV's &quot;Jeffersons&quot; when he mentioned her. Limbaugh sometimes still uses mock dialect -- substituting &quot;ax&quot; for &quot;ask&quot;-- when discussing black leaders.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such quotes and antics -- many compiled by Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) for our 1995 book -- offer a whiff of Limbaugh's racial sensibility. So does his claim that racism in America &quot;is fueled primarily by the rantings and ravings&quot; of people like Jesse Jackson. Or his ugly reference two years ago to the father of Madonna's first child, a Latino, as &quot;a gang-member type guy&quot; -- an individual with no gang background.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1994, Limbaugh mocked St. Louis for building a rail line to East St. Louis &quot;where nobody goes.&quot; East St. Louis is home to roughly 40,000 residents -- 98 percent of whom are African-Americans. One of its 40,000 &quot;nobodies&quot; is star NFL linebacker Bryan Cox.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once, in response to a caller arguing that black people need to be heard, Limbaugh responded: &quot;They are 12 percent of the population. Who the hell cares?&quot; That's not an unusual response for a talk radio host playing to an audience of &quot;angry white males.&quot; It may not play so well among National Football League players, 70 percent of whom are African American.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Compared to some talk radio hosts, racism is not central to Rush Limbaugh's shtick. But there has been a pattern of commentary indicating his willingness to exploit prejudice against blacks to further his on-air arguments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ABC has the right to hire Limbaugh, even at the risk of alienating members of its audience. (&quot;Monday Night Football&quot; is the second-most watched TV show in black households). Thrust into the world of pro football where Limbaugh himself would be something of a racial minority, is it possible that he'd rise above his history of racial bigotry and insensitivity? Not likely.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When all is said and done, the athletes are the key players on &quot;Monday Night Football.&quot; It would be great to know how they'd feel about a color man who seems to have trouble with people of color.</font></p>
