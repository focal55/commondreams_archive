- November 17 - Americans United for Separation of Church and State today criticized 
a plan by voucher proponents in Congress to circumvent debate on a controversial 
school voucher proposal by attaching it to an omnibus federal spending bill that 
cannot be amended.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In 
a last-ditch effort to send the school voucher program for the District of Columbia 
to a supportive president, Republican leaders will include the scheme in an omnibus 
spending bill that is expected to be approved by Congress before it adjourns for 
Thanksgiving, according The Washington Post.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Voucher 
supporters in the Senate know they can&#146;t pass this bill on an up-and-down 
vote, so they are resorting to strong-arm tactics to get their way,&#148; said 
the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &#147;The voucher 
measure drains desperately needed dollars from the public schools and transfers 
them to religious and other private schools. It&#146;s bad policy for public education, 
and it would violate Americans&#146; right to support only the religious institutions 
of their free choice.&#148;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In 
September, the U.S. House of Representatives passed by a one-vote margin the D.C. 
school voucher bill that would allocate $10 million in federal funds to pay for 
tuition for about 1,300 students to attend religious and other private schools. 
A $13-million voucher bill has stalled in the Senate.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Americans 
United and other members of the National Coalition for Public Education have urged 
lawmakers to oppose the voucher bills. The coalition has also asked members of 
Congress not to attach the proposals to other legislation that cannot be amended 
or debated.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Lynn 
urged Americans to voice alarm over the tactics congressional lawmakers are using 
to jam the federal voucher proposal into law.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;This 
is no way to approve legislation,&#148; Lynn said. &#147;The voucher proposal 
deserves to be studied and debated. Its supporters are afraid of such scrutiny 
and therefore are resorting to harsh measures to win the day for vouchers. &#148;</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
