- December 4 - The nonprofit Clean Air Trust today released the following reaction by Clean Air Trust Executive Director Frank O'Donnell to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's press release this afternoon on its &quot;new power plant rule&quot;:</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This is really just political damage control by the Bush administration and an attempt to divert public attention from its efforts to weaken clean air protections.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Earlier this week, it was revealed that the Bush administration plans to scrap effective pollution controls for mercury, a poison that can cause brain damage in babies. Instead, the Bush administration has adopted an industry proposal to delay meaningful controls for at least 15 years and set unnecessarily weak standards even then.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Regarding this new interstate rule, although public health and environmental groups obviously want to meet public health standards for smog and fine particle soot, this new proposal falls short. It would continue to allow industry to pollute too much for too long.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;It is really just the discredited &quot;clear skies&quot; plan wrapped up with a new bow -- an early Christmas present for big polluters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;More than two years ago, EPA told electric power company officials that smog and soot could be cleaned up both faster and better under the Clean Air Act than the plan described in today's press release. For example, this proposal would permit 50 percent more sulfur dioxide pollution -- and for a longer time -- than EPA previously said.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
