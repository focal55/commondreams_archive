<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CANCUN, MEXICO - September 4 - As hundreds of small farmers, indigenouspeople's groups and landless peasants start preparations to descend on Cancun to 

protest the Fifth Ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) scheduled 

to take place September 10-14, Friends of the Earth added its voice to the protests 

against the WTO and its new rules that promise a devastating impact on the world's 

biological and cultural diversity.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The WTO draft agreements on areas like agriculture, services and intellectual property 

rights will lead to increased deforestation and the replacement of traditional agricultural 

crops, seeds and livestock by large-scale monocultures, including those based on 

genetically modified (GM) crops. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most devastating impacts would come from agricultural trade agreements, 

especially if they would be based upon the recent US-European Union joint proposal 

for the modalities of agricultural negotiations. This proposal sets the scene for drastic 

market liberalization in agricultural products, while it leaves virtually untouched the 

massive direct and indirect subsidies these trading blocks are providing to their own 

export-oriented farmers (with the exception of a limited category of direct export 

subsidies). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The result will be devastating for small farmers in developing countries, who will be 

unable to compete with subsidized large-scale producers in industrialized countries. 

These small-farmers are the main custodians of the world's agrobiodiversity, which 

consists of thousands of plant and animal varieties and related traditional knowledge. 

When these farmers disappear, this wealth of biological and cultural diversity 

disappears too.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The large-scale, export-oriented agriculture that is promoted in current WTO 

proposals is also the main cause of deforestation, especially in tropical areas,&quot; said 

Simone Lovera of Friends of the Earth International.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is now widely recognized that the recent increase of deforestation of the Brazilian 

Amazon is mainly caused by the rapid expansion of soy bean production for the - 

mainly European - export market,&quot; Lovera added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The traditional knowledge of small farmers and Indigenous Peoples relating to the use 

and conservation of biodiversity is also being threatened by the growing practice of so- called &quot;biopiracy&quot;, the practice of Northern biotechnology industries to patent seeds, 

traditional knowledge and other elements of biological and cultural diversity of the 

South.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Developing countries have demanded a review of the WTO's Trade Related Aspects 

of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement to protect themselves against such 

biopiracy. As part of these negotiations, African countries have called for a prohibition 

of patenting of life forms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth International calls upon all countries to put a halt to such forms of 

privatization and commercialization of biological diversity. We call upon WTO 

members to protect small farmers and their agrobiodiversity against the devastating 

impacts of trade liberalization and prohibit the patenting of life forms and other forms of 

biopiracy.</font></p>
