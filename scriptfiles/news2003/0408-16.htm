                - April 8 - Private banks and taxpayer-supported government agencies 

                in Europe and the United States are financing the destruction 

                of one of the most biodiverse forests known to science, jeopardizing 

                endangered Sumatran elephants and wiping out one of Indonesia's 

                last significant rainforests, a study by World Wildlife Fund finds. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                the WWF report, "Elephant Forests On Sale," financial institutions 

                such as the UK's Barclays Bank and the German Deutsche Bank, as 

                well as export credit agencies from around the world, share responsibility 

                for the destruction, having issued loans and guarantees to help 

                finance two giant pulp mills on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sumatran 

                forest of Tesso Nilo, which is being consumed by the pulp mills, 

                contains more plant species per area tested than any forest ever 

                studied, including the Amazon, a WWF study discovered last year. 

                Tesso Nilo is the focus of an effort by WWF and local groups to 

                preserve it as a refuge for Sumatran elephants, which are forced 

                to wander continously in search of food and shelter as their forest 

                home disappears. Increasingly, the elephants are being captured 

                or killed as they raid crops in search of food and create significant 

                economic loss for farmers. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Export credit 

                agencies in Europe, Asia and the United States - government agencies 

                charged with encouraging overseas investment by domestic companies 

                - have made loans to help underwrite massive pulp mills near Tesso 

                Nilo and to fund the replacement of natural forest with plantations, 

                both to feed the mills and to produce palm oil. The new WWF study 

                shows that since the mid-1980s, 64 percent, or 778,000 acres, 

                of the Tesso Nilo forest has been converted into vast industrial 

                plantations. The raw materials produced on these plantations end 

                up as photocopying paper, cartons, margarine and sweets in offices 

                and households worldwide. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"To meet the 

                enormous demand for wood, paper pulp and palm oil, Tesso Nilo 

                and its surrounding rainforests are being shredded to bits," said 

                Dr. Mubariq Ahmad, CEO of WWF-Indonesia. "We urge businesses in 

                consumer countries to sell only those products for which elephants 

                do not need to die and help Indonesian industries to adopt sustainable 

                practices." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WWF is negotiating 

                with international paper and pulp businesses - both the producers 

                and buyers of Tesso Nilo products - to stop the ongoing destruction 

                of an additional 988,000 acres of neighboring rainforests. However, 

                many financial institutions were not able to come up with satisfactory 

                decisions on the debt restructuring for Asia Pulp and Paper, owner 

                of one of the two giant mills in the region now in bankruptcy. 

                As a result, WWF has called on all negotiating parties to tie 

                any debt repayment agreement to environmental conditions that 

                will not allow anymore of Sumatra's high conservation value forests 

                to be destroyed. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WWF is also 

                working with Indonesian authorities to ensure the designation 

                of Tesso Nilo as a national park. Tesso Nilo is located between 

                three areas that already have protected status. WWF is proposing 

                that these be linked to the planned Tesso Nilo National Park and 

                to each other by wildlife corridors. In this way, a protected 

                area of 1.5 million acres could evolve in which the resident animals, 

                such as elephants, could move freely again without creating conflicts 

                with people. The World Bank estimates that if current rates of 

                clearcutting continue, all of Sumatra's lowland rainforests will 

                be gone by 2005. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"WWF is calling 

                on banks and export credit agencies involved in Tesso Nilo to 

                use their leverage as creditors and investors to halt the destruction 

                of the rainforest and to develop strict investment screens to 

                avoid destructive investments in the future," said Tom Dillon, 

                director of WWF's U.S. program to protect the endangered Sumatran 

                elephant. </font>
