- December 9 - Rebecca R. Wodder, President of American Rivers, released the following statement on the 30th anniversary of the Endangered Species Act:</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">North America has the most freshwater species of any place on the planet. But our freshwater species are five times more likely to become endangered as those that live on land -- and their rate of extinction is comparable to species in the tropic rainforest. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Wetlands and small streams, in particular, are nature's nurseries for life of all kinds. Yet they are especially endangered themselves, this year, because of attacks on basic environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We need to rally around these fundamental laws in their hour of peril, or we?re risking the future of our species, as well. We?re also risking our prosperity in the present.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Last week a group of 104 economists, including two Nobel Prize winners, sent a letter to President Bush and Western governors saying that policies that harm the environment also harm the economy in the long run (<A HREF="http://www.econw.com/pdf/120303letter.pdf" TARGET="_new">http://www.econw.com/pdf/120303letter.pdf</A>).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Their letter warned that, &quot;Those who promise that workers, firms and communities tied to environmentally harmful activities can avoid these pressures if only the environmental laws, such as the Endangered Species Act, were set aside raise false hopes. Even if such laws were repealed, the costs of environmentally harmful activities will continue to rise and jeopardize the economic outlook for affected communities.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Endangered Species Act has been a great success for the American people. In the 30 years since the Endangered Species Act became law, the great majority of the species that have required its protection are still with us today.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Endangered Species Act protects not only habitats for wildlife, but the places that people enjoy spending time in, raising families near, and creating businesses around. It is our Noah's Ark, and on its 30th anniversary we must renew our commitment to the Act's protections, not let the current short-sighted Administration dismantle them.</FONT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
