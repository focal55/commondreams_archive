                ITALY - April 7 - The International Campaign to Ban Landmines 

                (ICBL) today called on Italy to use its powerful position as incoming 

                president of the European Union (EU) to condemn antipersonnel 

                mine use and actively promote the prohibition of the weapon. Today 

                marked the opening of the ICBL's annual three- day Global Landmine 

                Monitor Researchers' Meeting in Rome, bringing together over 130 

                landmine specialists from 75 countries. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The EU presidency 

                presents a great opportunity for Italy to speak out against antipersonnel 

                mine use by Iraq and others and to convince hold-out governments 

                to renounce this indiscriminate weapon now," said Liz Bernstein, 

                Coordinator of the ICBL. "We condemn any mine use and urge all 

                those who have banned the weapon to speak out publicly and privately 

                against any use of antipersonnel mines," she added. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week deminers 

                from the Mines Advisory Group (MAG) removed and destroyed hundreds 

                of live Italian Valmara-69 antipersonnel mines stored by Iraqi 

                government forces in a mosque in Kadir Karam in northern Iraq. 

                Iraqi forces have been documented planting mines before the current 

                conflict and have continued laying them in a number of areas. 

                Italy manufactured and exported millions of antipersonnel mines 

                to Iraq in the 1980s before renouncing the weapon in 1994. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All but two 

                current EU member-states are party to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, 

                which prohibits the use, production, transfer and stockpiling 

                of antipersonnel mines, and requires mine clearance and assistance 

                to mine victims. Greece is in the final stages of joining, while 

                Finland has set a target date of 2006. Of the ten countries about 

                to join the EU, all are party to the treaty except Estonia, Latvia, 

                Poland and Lithuania. Lithuania's parliament recently approved 

                ratification, while Poland has signed but not ratified. Globally, 

                there are 132 States Parties - most recently Cyprus and Sao Tome 

                and Principe - and fourteen signatories that have yet to ratify.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neither Iraq 

                nor the United States have joined the Mine Ban Treaty. While there 

                is no evidence that the United States has used antipersonnel mines 

                in the Iraqi conflict, it has been using cluster submunitions, 

                as has the United Kingdom. The ICBL has supported efforts to address 

                the humanitarian impact of cluster submunitions, which act as 

                landmines if they fail to detonate on impact as intended. It has 

                joined other organizations in calling for a moratorium on these 

                weapons until the humanitarian concerns are addressed. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Italy will 

                assume the six-month term EU presidency on 1 July 2003. It halted 

                landmine production in 1994, completed destruction of its 7.1 

                million stockpiled antipersonnel mines in November 2002, and in 

                2001 spent approximately 5.6 million Euro on mine action activities.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Italy and 

                the EU are major donors to humanitarian mine action efforts, but 

                at current levels of funding the needs of mine-affected countries 

                are still far from met," said Stefano Calabretta, of INTERSOS, 

                a member of the Italian Campaign to Ban Landmines, the host of 

                the Rome meeting. "The Italian Mine Action Fund must be renewed 

                at an increased level or at least continue at current levels if 

                we are to meet the long-term needs of communities affected by 

                this weapon," he added. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recipients 

                of Italian mine action funding in 2003 include Angola, Azerbaijan, 

                Bosnia & Herzegovina, Central America, Croatia, Iraq and Yemen. 

                According to Landmine Monitor, in 2001, new landmine casualties 

                were reported in 73 of the world's 90 mine-affected countries.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Italy is the 

                main sponsor of the ICBL's Landmine Monitor research network meeting 

                in Rome this week. The ICBL's Landmine Monitor initiative, established 

                June 1998, is the world's first systematic and sustained civil 

                society verification effort for a major multilateral treaty. In 

                1997 the ICBL and its then-coordinator Jody Williams were awarded 

                the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize for their central efforts to bring 

                about the antipersonnel mine ban. </font>
