                SILVER SPRING, MD - March 18 - The Sisters of Mercy of the Americas, 

                one of the world's largest English-speaking Roman Catholic congregations 

                of women religious, have publicly denounced President Bush's war 

                on Iraq. They have issued a corporate statement, the result of 

                a month-long process of reflection, discussion, and a poll of 

                their members. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The congregation 

                published their statement today in Silver Spring MD, and noted 

                that the statement "...is not intended to express a negative opinion 

                of efforts to assure the security and defense of this nation, 

                nor is it intended as a criticism of the military, or those who 

                serve in it. It is a historic moment of unanimity calling the 

                international community, and the US as part of that international 

                community, to use non-violent means to contain and decrease any 

                potential harm Iraq may pose." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sisters 

                spent a month weighing the pros and cons; deliberating about the 

                consequences of war-making and non-violent peace-making; reflecting 

                on their community's rule compelling each sister to "commit themselves 

                to follow Jesus in his compassion for suffering people." This 

                process led community members to determine that their call to 

                reverence the dignity of each person and pursue integrity of word 

                and deed in their lives could only be lived out in this present 

                global context by corporately and publicly opposing the USA's 

                determination to go to war with Iraq. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 90 percent 

                of those responding resolutely state, "It is our firm belief that 

                war is not the answer to difficulties in our world and particularly 

                of the Middle East." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sisters 

                urge President Bush, his advisors and members of Congress to cooperate 

                with and respect the United Nations' processes, and to reflect 

                on the probable repercussion within the Islamic world of a US-initiated 

                attack based on fear and suspicion against an Islamic nation. 

                They also urge the President, Congress and presidential advisors 

                to listen to the voices of the hundreds of thousands of United 

                States citizens begging for a halt to this attack on Iraq. </font>

                of Mercy of the Americas is an international community of sisters 

                vowed to serve people who suffer from poverty, sickness and ignorance, 

                with a special concern for women and children. In innovative and 

                traditional ways, Sisters of Mercy address human needs through 

                collaborative efforts in education, health care, housing, and 

                pastoral and social services. The Institute includes 25 regional 

                communities with 5024 members and 2371 associates who serve in 

                North, South and Central America, the Caribbean, Guam and the 

                Philippines. The Sisters of Mercy of the Americas sponsor or co-sponsor 

                seven major national healthcare systems, 20 colleges and universities, 

                20 elementary and preschools, 39 secondary schools, and hundreds 

                of affordable housing developments. They also serve in programs 

                ranging from hospices for persons with HIV/AIDS, to adult literacy 

                centers, and resettlement programs for refugees. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We, the Sisters 

                of Mercy of the Americas, oppose the use of military force against 

                the people of Iraq. It is our firm belief that war is not the 

                answer to the difficulties of our world and particularly of the 

                Middle-East. We believe that such action would be immoral and 

                unwise. While we acknowledge that the present government of Iraq 

                may pose a potential threat to its neighbors, we call on the international 

                community and the United States as part of that community to use 

                non-violent means to contain and decrease that potential for harm. 

                As part of this effort we urge President Bush, his advisors and 

                the members of Congress to: </font>

                Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction and to await the outcome
