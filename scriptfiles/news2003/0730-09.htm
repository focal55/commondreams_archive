- July 30 -  

Beginning this week, Willie Nelson's radio ads supporting Dennis 

Kucinich for President will start airing in Iowa.  The ads are narrated 

by Willie, a beloved figure in Iowa and the country, an artist known as 

a champion of heartland Americans.  The theme of his radio message is 

that Congressman Kucinich is the candidate ready to fight for Americans &quot;who need a stronger voice.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The goal of the spots is to continue to raise Kucinich's profile with 

voters.  Besides endorsing the candidate, one of Willie's ads also 

advertises his Labor Day concert for Kucinich in Des Moines: &quot;I'll be 

doing all I can to raise his profile, including a concert with his 

campaign right here in Iowa on Labor Day.&quot; (Willie will also perform 

concerts for the campaign in Cleveland on Sept. 6 and Madison, WI, on Sept. 13.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The radio spots are running on a number of Iowa stations, will expand to more stations in Iowa and then to other states.  The <a href="http://kucinich.us/willienelson.htm" target="_new">ads can be heard</a> on the <a href="http://kucinich.us/" target="_new">Kucinich.US</a> website, where campaign supporters and Willie fans will be able to make online donations to expand radio play for the ads.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Best Person for the Job&quot; (60 seconds)

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hey Iowa.  This is Willie Nelson.  I don't usually get too involved in 

politics, but this is more about getting involved with America.  I've 

looked at the candidates for president and I think the best person for 

the job is Congressman Dennis Kucinich.  I know Dennis.  He speaks up 

for Americans who need a stronger voice.  For family farmers and 

workers.  For the environment.  And a Kucinich Administration will put 

the interests of heartland Americans above the greed of big 

corporations. I encourage you all to visit his website at Kucinich.US 

and to come out and see him in person when he's in your area.  I'll be 

doing all I can to raise his profile, including a concert with his 

campaign right here in Iowa on Labor Day. This is Willie Nelson saying 

support Dennis Kucinich for President, and we'll see you down the road.
