- December 11 - It was big, and a nice, surprise&#151;generous, and compassionate.  And it was a lie.</FONT><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In his State of the Union address last year, President George W. Bush sounded the alarm against global AIDS and asked Congress &#147;to commit $15 billion over the next five years&#133;to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean.&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;Seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many,&#148; the President intoned.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">But now it turns out that in the new budget for fiscal 2005 in preparation at the White House, Bush won&#146;t put his money where his mouth was.  The Wall Street Journal yesterday reports that the President will ask Congress for only small increases to fight AIDS and poverty &#150; another big step back from a Bush promise.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">AIDS-fighting appropriations for fiscal 2004 are tied up in the omnibus spending bill that the Senate delayed yesterday because, in part, of outrageous hidden provisions included at the insistence of the White House.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Senate Democrats offered to separate out the foreign aid section of the bill and pass it, freeing up the AIDS money, but Bush and the Republican leadership refused, holding the money hostage to special interest provisions that strip away overtime pay protection for some 8 million workers and allow Rupert Murdoch and other global media barons to acquire more broadcast properties than Congress voted earlier to allow.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">From minutes after his bold and humane pledge to fight AIDS, Bush has done nothing but back away.  He only asked for $2 billion of the promised $15 billion in the budget he submitted shortly after his call to arms, and he fought efforts by Congress to increase it.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;In this instance, as in so many other, Bush is what his fellow Texans would call &#145;all hat and no cowboy,&#146;&#148; said Wes Boyd, founder of MoveOn.org.  &#147;It&#146;s just his latest calculated and cynical effort to play on an important issue for political points, and then abandon his commitment.&#148;              </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><I>MoveOn.org is an online political issues organization with nearly 2 million members in the United States.
