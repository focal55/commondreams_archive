                - April 3 - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has 

                ordered the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration 

                (OSHA) to take the steps necessary to protect workers from hexavalent 

                chromium, a dangerous lung carcinogen. The order, issued late 

                Wednesday, came in response to a lawsuit filed last year by Public 

                Citizen and the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy 

                Workers International Union (PACE). The suit was designed to force 

                the agency – which for years has dragged its feet on the matter 

                – to act. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the order, 

                OSHA must issue a proposed rule governing workplace exposure to 

                hexavalent chromium no later than Oct. 4, 2004, and a final rule 

                no later than Jan. 18, 2006. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OSHA has acknowledged 

                for nearly a decade that its current standard permits workers 

                to breathe in hexavalent chromium at levels that pose an unacceptable 

                cancer risk. Previously, in response to a 1993 petition from Public 

                Citizen and PACE, the agency had promised to issue a proposed 

                rule in 1995. Nonetheless, the agency repeatedly postponed action 

                to tighten the standard. In 1997, Public Citizen and PACE filed 

                suit in the Third Circuit to compel strengthened regulation of 

                the chemical, but lost because the agency said it would issue 

                a proposed rule by 1999. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After three 

                more years of agency inaction, Public Citizen and PACE filed suit 

                last spring in the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, alleging that 

                the agency had violated the law by unreasonably delaying action 

                on hexavalent chromium. On Dec. 24, 2002, the court issued an 

                opinion finding OSHA’s delay "unreasonable." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In that order, 

                the court decried OSHA’s "indefinite delay and recalcitrance in 

                the face of an admittedly grave risk to public health" and held 

                that "OSHA’s delay in promulgating a lower permissible exposure 

                limit for hexavalent chromium has exceeded the bounds of reasonableness." 

                The court ordered OSHA to "proceed expeditiously with its hexavalent 

                chromium rulemaking." The court directed the parties to engage 

                in mediation for 60 days in an effort to agree upon a schedule. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the mediation, 

                OSHA took the position that it would need more than four years 

                to arrive at a new final rule. Public Citizen countered with a 

                schedule that would have yielded a final rule in two years. Senior 

                Judge Walter Stapleton proposed that the parties agree on an approximately 

                three-year schedule. Although OSHA objected, insisting that it 

                be allowed another four years to take action, the court ordered 

                the three-year schedule. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We would have 

                liked the agency to move even faster," said Dr. Peter Lurie, deputy 

                director of Public Citizen’s Health Research Group. "But the important 

                point is that the agency has now been told that it has to act, 

                and that the leisurely schedule it wanted won’t adequately protect 

                workers’ health." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Added Public 

                Citizen attorney Scott Nelson, who argued the case, "It’s very 

                unusual for a court to step in and order an agency to act by a 

                specific date. The court’s action here is a reflection of the 

                agency’s extreme delay in the face of a problem that even it has 

                admitted for a decade is very serious. We hope this case will 

                send a message that agencies can’t expect to get away with neglecting 

                their missions indefinitely." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even with this 

                order, the proposed rule on hexavalent chromium would be the first 

                rule that OSHA has proposed for an industrial chemical in more 

                than a decade. </font> 

                <p></p>
