- April 28 - Median CEO pay at the 

37 largest defense contractors rose 79 percent from 2001 to 2002, 

while overall CEO pay climbed only 6 percent, according to a new 

report from United for a Fair Economy, &quot;More Bucks for the Bang: 

CEO Pay at Top Defense Contractors,&quot; by Chris Hartman and David 

Martin. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Median pay was 45 percent higher in 2002 at defense contractors 

than at the 365 large companies surveyed by Business Week magazine. 

The typical U.S. CEO made $3.7 million in 2002, while the typical 

defense industry CEO got $5.4 million. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The jump in median defense contractor CEO pay far exceeded the 

increase in defense spending, which rose 14 percent from 2001 to 

2002. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Compared with an army private's pay of $19,585, the average CEO 

at a major defense contractor made 577 times as much in 2002, or 

$11,297,548. This is also more than 28 times as much as the 

Commander in Chief's salary of $400,000. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study also looked at the size of campaign contributions by 

the largest defense contractors and found a strong correlation 

between campaign contributions made by a company in the 2000 and 

2002 election cycles and the value of defense contracts awarded to 

that company. Ninety percent of the difference in contract size can 

be accounted for by size of contributions. For example, top weapons 

contractor Lockheed Martin was also the top campaign contributor 

among defense firms. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 37 companies included in the CEO pay study were all the 

publicly-traded corporations with at least $1 billion in total 

defense contracts from 2000 through 2002. The list includes 

well-known defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, 

Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics, as well as some 

companies not usually associated with military spending, such as 

FedEx and Dell Computer. Compensation was defined as salary, bonus, &quot;other compensation,&quot; restricted stock awards, long-term incentive 

payouts, and the value realized from the exercise of stock options. </font></p>
