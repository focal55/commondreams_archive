- December 10 - Today, the Children's Defense Fund released an analysis comparing firearm deaths among children and teens in 2000 and 2001. While there was a small decrease in the number of overall deaths, the number of homicide deaths among young children rose dramatically, reinforcing the need for Congress to extend the assault weapons ban and reject S. 659, a bill that grants immunity from liability to gun manufacturers, when they return for legislative business in 2004. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Our nation's lawmakers have a moral obligation to protect our children from gun violence. One death is too many, and as recently as 2001, gun violence claimed more than 2,900 young lives. Yet, both the President and Congress are poised to make matters worse,&quot; said Children's Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The landmark 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, stopping the manufacturing of the most lethal guns, will expire in September 2004 if it is not reauthorized. &quot;The President says he supports the ban, but he has shown an unwillingness to exert any pressure on Congress to renew it. That inaction paves the way for military-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition making an unwelcome return to our neighborhoods,&quot; said Edelman.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Congress is also close to passing legislation that denies gun- violence victims their day in court by blocking lawsuits holding the gun industry accountable for the irresponsible manufacture and sale of guns. In addition, the legislation prohibits lawsuits filed by victims seeking to hold gun manufacturers and sellers accountable for their role in marketing and supplying guns to criminals. &quot;We need elected leaders to summon the political and moral courage to say 'no' to the gun industry and the NRA, and 'yes' to protecting our nation's children,&quot; added Edelman.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There were 2,911 firearm deaths of children and teens in 2001, down from 3,012 in 2000. Firearm homicide deaths decreased slightly from 1,776 to 1,771. Firearm suicide deaths decreased by 7.8 percent, from 1,007 to 928. Firearm accident deaths also continued to decline, down to 182 from 193 in 2000 -- less than one-third the number in 1991. However, when looking specifically at young children, a disturbing increase emerges. From 2000 to 2001, firearm deaths jumped from 46 to 70 among children ages 1- 4, and from 70 to 79 among children ages 5-9. Firearm homicides of children ages 1-4 nearly doubled between 2000 and 2001 -- from 28 to 55 deaths. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">------</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The mission of the Children's Defense Fund is to Leave No Child Behind(r) and to ensure every child a Healthy Start, a Head Start, a Fair Start, a Safe Start, and a Moral Start in life and successful passage to adulthood with the help of caring families and communities. CDF provides a strong, effective voice for all the children of America who cannot vote, lobby or speak for themselves. They pay particular attention to the needs of poor and minority children and those with disabilities. CDF educates the nation about the needs of children and encourages preventive investment before they get sick, get into trouble, drop out of school, or suffer family breakdown. CDF began in 1973 and is a private, nonprofit organization supported by foundation and corporate grants and individual donations. They have never taken government funds. </FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
