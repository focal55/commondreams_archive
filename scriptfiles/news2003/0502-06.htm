- May 2 - Following is an &quot;On the 

Docket&quot; report on Campaign Finance and the Courts from Democracy 21 

President Fred Wertheimer: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Court Decision on Constitutionality of New Campaign Finance 

Law Upholds Important Portions of the Law, Declares Other Parts of 

the Law Unconstitutional </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Supporters Confident Full Law Will Be Upheld in Supreme Court </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are pleased that today's split decision by a three-judge 

District Court panel upheld major portions of the Bipartisan 

Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), including major portions of the soft 

money ban,&quot; said Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer, a 

spokesman for and member of the legal team representing the 

congressional sponsors of the law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The decision, however, also creates serious loopholes in the 

soft money ban and this portion of the decision simply does not 

make sense in light of past Supreme Court rulings and the 

overwhelming record in this case. We are confident that the full 

soft money ban will be upheld by the Supreme Court,&quot; Wertheimer 

said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are also pleased that the court has recognized that Congress 

has the authority to address the problem of campaign ads run by 

outside groups in the guise of issue ads,&quot; Wertheimer said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I am confident that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act meets 

constitutional standards and I am eager to present the case to the 

Supreme Court,&quot; said former U.S. Solicitor General Seth Waxman, one of the attorneys who argued the case before the three-judge panel 

on behalf of the congressional sponsors. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;BCRA represents the culmination of years of study by Congress 

of a clear and present threat to the very vitality of faith in our 

precious system of democratic governance,&quot; according to Waxman. &quot;It 

bespeaks legislative care in balancing, on the one hand, the 

requirements of the First Amendment with, on the other hand, the 

absolute imperative to reclaim the integrity of our system.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decision by the District Court panel &quot;recognizes that 

Congress has the power to address the corrupting influence of big 

money on our political system,&quot; stated Roger Witten, lead counsel 

for the legal team representing the congressional sponsors, who 

joined in defending the law before the District Court panel. &quot;Portions of the court's decision, however, ignore the judgment of 

a bipartisan majority of Congress regarding the extent of the 

problem with large contributions and fail to take account of a 

legislative and court record that powerfully demonstrates that the 

need for the comprehensive loophole closing approach contained in 

the soft money ban,&quot; Witten said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Defenders of the BCRA are expected to move quickly to ask the 

Supreme Court to review those portions of the District Court 

decision that strike down the law. They are also expected to make 

a quick decision about asking the Supreme Court to stay the 

portions of the District Court decision that declared sections of 

the BCRA unconstitutional. </font></p>
