- November 3 - Jewish Voice for Peace, the group which initiated the campaign to stop Caterpillar from selling bulldozers to the Israeli army for use in the destruction of Palestinian homes, reacted with &quot;grave concern&quot; to reports that Israel has developed a remote control version of the US manufactured Caterpillar D-9 bulldozer. The group also announced plans to bring forth a shareholder resolution as soon as possible to halt the sale of bulldozers to the Israeli army. </font>

Israel has used the already heavily modified 60 ton manned vehicle to destroy Palestinian homes, town centers and olive groves. The statistics regarding the destructive and illegitimate use of these vehicles is staggering. Since the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising in September 2000, Israel has razed the homes of 12,737 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In March of this year, a non-violent activist, Rachel Corrie was killed by a larger version of this vehicle (D11) in Rafah, Gaza. The D9's are now being used to help destroy Palestinian land to make way for the separation wall being constructed through the West Bank, which has been criticized by the Bush Administration. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Destruction of Palestinian homes only increases Palestinian despair and rage,&quot; said Liat Weingart, JVP's co-Director. &quot;Far from making Israelis safer, it only endangers them more as such acts drive more Palestinians to violence.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Willful destruction of homes is considered a war crime under the Geneva conventions and has been condemned by the UN and major human rights groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and B'tselem. The contemplated use of a remote version of this vehicle will make it even easier for the destruction of Palestinian homes. JVP calls on Caterpillar to stop providing these vehicles, remote controlled or otherwise, to Israel until Israel stops using them to destroy Palestinian civilian homes and infrastructure. Please visit JVP's special Caterpillar website at <a href="http://www.catdestroyshomes.org/" target="_new">http://www.catdestroyshomes.org/</a> for further information on Caterpillar and our other campaigns and programs. </font></p>
