                - April 9 - In an interview published Monday, April 7 by the Baptist 

                Press, Department of Education Secretary Rod Paige was quoted 

                as saying, "All things equal, I would prefer to have a child in 

                a school that has a strong appreciation for the values of the 

                Christian community, where a child is taught to have a strong 

                faith." Paige seemed to denigrate the diverse student population 

                in public schools saying, "In a religious environment the value 

                system is set. That's not the case in a public school where there 

                are so many different kids with different kinds of values." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statement of 

                People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It was insensitive 

                and irresponsible for Secretary Paige to suggest either that public 

                schools should teach religious doctrine or that parents should 

                abandon public schools and send their kids to religious schools. 

                Either one of these reflects a lack of commitment to the mission 

                and success of our public schools. It is particularly unacceptable 

                that the country's chief public school officer exhibit such disdain 

                for the long tradition of diversity and inclusiveness celebrated 

                in our public schools. The more than 50 million children of varying 

                faiths in the public school system deserve an advocate and not 

                an adversary." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Secretary 

                Paige should take steps immediately to clarify his remarks and 

                to reassure these children and their parents that he will work 

                to uphold our tradition of a nonsectarian system of public education 

                that serves children of all faiths. The Secretary's statement 

                makes even more troubling the Department's recently released guidelines 

                about religion in public schools."
