- December 1 - Inter-faith religious leaders held a prayer service and demonstration outside of the U.S. Treasury Department today calling for bolder leadership from the Bush Administration around the linked crises of global AIDS and debt.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Held on World AIDS Day, the leaders started with a vigil to honor the 3 million lives lost this year to HIV/AIDS and prayed for healing and care for the 40 million people worldwide living with HIV, 95% of whom lack access to life-prolonging medicine.   The leaders also delivered a letter to President Bush and Treasury Secretary Snow signed by more than 80 religious leaders and organizations.   The letter calls on President Bush to request at least $5.4billion to fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria in his 2005 budget and for Secretary Snow to enact the increased debt cancellation provision of the Global AIDS bill as a step toward realizing full debt cancellation for impoverished nations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Gospel of Jesus Christ compels those of us who are Christians to speak out on the issue of HIV/AIDS. We speak out to share the love of God.  We care for, and pray with and for, those in need of healing. But we also speak out as an act of justice, seeking government assistance, medical research, and financial resources to help bring hope to the millions of families and people living with HIV/AIDS throughout the world,&quot; said Brenda Gorton-Mitchell, Director of the Washington office of the National Council of Churches.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The vigil was followed by a luncheon press conference where leaders of the United Methodist Church Board of Church and Society, the Religious Action Center for Reformed Judaism, the National Council of Churches, and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility called upon Secretary Snow and President Bush to take bold leadership to resolve the linked AIDS and debt crisis.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We have come together to say, if even one person that we could have saved dies on account of our failure to act, we have not done enough.  We come together to say we will not stand idly by. Together we have the capacity to save the lives of millions. For the sake of our shared humanity, we cannot afford to fail,&quot; said Rabbi David Saperstein, Director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;AIDS is inextricably linked to the crisis of debt that continues to impoverish nations.  Until the chains of debt are broken, African nations will be unable to mount an effective response to the growing AIDS crisis. Addressing AIDS and debt is not a partisan issue, it is a moral imperative,&quot; said Marie Clarke, National Coordinator of the Jubilee USA Network, the US arm of the global Jubilee movement calling for cancellation of impoverished country debts.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It is clear that the religious community played a key role in inspiring the administration's announcement last year around a $15 billion, five-year commitment to address the AIDS emergency in Africa and the Caribbean.  However during this past fiscal year the Administration supported only $2 billion for global AIDS, despite signing a bill passed by both Houses of Congress authorizing $3 billion for global AIDS in 2004.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;HIV/AIDS represents a disease that is devastating to the human condition worldwide.  While we support the Administration's commitment to fighting AIDS in fourteen African and Caribbean nations, we call on our nation to also increase its financial commitment to fighting AIDS in the other 36 nations of sub-Saharan Africa with growing AIDS epidemics as well as in Russia, China, and India, nations that are on the brink of disaster.  We also believe that the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria represents the most efficient and effective mechanism to invest U.S. resources in the fight against AIDS.  Now is the time for President Bush to make State of the Union promise a reality by pledging at least $5.4 billion to fight the linked scourges of global AIDS, TB, and malaria in your 2005 budget request and by supporting complete debt cancellation for impoverished nations.&quot; said Reverend Seams Finn, OMI, Vice Chair of the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility.</FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
