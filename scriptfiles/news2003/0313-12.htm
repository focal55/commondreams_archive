                - March 13 - The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) 

                today released a "National Parks Watch List for 2003" that calls 

                attention to upcoming decisions by the Bush administration and 

                Congress that will harm the health, integrity, and future of America's 

                National Park System. The Watch List also outlines potential solutions. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Because we 

                have observed a disturbing trend of political actions and inactions 

                that jeopardize national parks, we have created this 2003 Watch 

                List to describe the most far-reaching threats to the parks," 

                Thomas Kiernan, NPCA president, said. "The decisions by this administration 

                in the last several months are damaging to the national parks. 

                If this continues through the year, the administration will have 

                created a disastrous legacy in managing our national treasures."

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the key 

                threats outlined in the Watch List are: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Air Quality 

                in the National Parks: Some of the nation's most polluted air 

                is found in national parks. Administration actions will allow 

                outdated coal-fired plants to avoid cleaning up, leading to worsening 

                air quality in our parks. In addition, the administration's so-called 

                "Clear Skies Initiative," as drafted, is less protective of park 

                air than full enforcement of the current law. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- National 

                Park Land Giveaways: A recently issued Department of Interior 

                rule allows the Bureau of Land Management, without public comment 

                or a review of conservation impacts, to give away land in national 

                parks along rights-of-way claimed by state and local governments 

                and other parties. This action could cover some parks with a spider 

                web of paved roads or off-road vehicle trails. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Accelerated 

                Oil and Gas Leasing In and Near Park Units: The Bush administration 

                is stepping up leasing of oil and gas rights both inside national 

                park units and next to them, a threat to ecosystems, wildlife, 

                and archeological remains that will significantly increase pollution 

                in and near national parks. Parks at risk include Padre Island 

                National Seashore (TX), Arches National Park, (UT), Canyonlands 

                National Park (UT), Grand Teton National Park (WY), Glacier National 

                Park (MT), and Channel Islands National Park (CA). </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Privatizing 

                the National Park Service: The administration's recent step toward 

                privatizing 70 percent of National Park Service jobs is disturbing. 

                Forcing the National Park Service to adhere to top-down privatization 

                mandates could be disastrous for our national parks. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Bush administration 

                is failing its responsibility for providing Americans with safe, 

                healthy national parks," Kiernan said. "National parks are a part 

                of every American's heritage. The administration has begun to 

                roll back the years of progress that have been made in protecting 

                parks and their surrounding environments. President Bush promised 

                stepped-up protection for parks during his campaign. So far, he 

                has done more to exploit the parks than to heal them." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other threats 

                included on the Watch List are a Bush administration proposal 

                to reverse a Park Service phase out of snowmobile use in Yellowstone 

                and Grand Teton national parks; possible congressional action 

                that would authorize snowmobiling in the wilderness core of Denali 

                National Park, where it has always been off-limits; the administration's 

                failure so far to keep the president's campaign pledge to provide 

                an additional $4.9 billion in the Park Service budget to eliminate 

                a backlog of national park infrastructure projects; and legislation 

                introduced with administration support during the last Congress, 

                and already reintroduced this year, that would treat national 

                parks as the special property of local interests rather than as 

                national domain. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"NPCA research 

                shows that the Park Service gets only two-thirds of the funding 

                needed to maintain national parks properly ? an annual shortfall 

                of more than $600 million," Kiernan said. "The administration's 

                failure to keep the president's pledge on park funding is a key 

                problem that leaves many parks unable to carry out their mission 

                adequately. They are ill equipped to confront threats such as 

                habitat destruction and dwindling wildlife populations and unable 

                to serve satisfactorily the countless visitors and thousands of 

                schoolchildren who request educational opportunities. Taken together, 

                the upcoming decisions and actions outlined on NPCA's 2003 Watch 

                List spell hope or decline for our national parks. Unfortunately, 

                without a change of direction, the administration's actions point 

                toward decline." </font>
