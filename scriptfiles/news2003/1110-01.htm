  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PUBLIC EVENT: Clergy from Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and other faith traditions will gather at the United Nations to highlight the religious and moral challenge of global warming and call for political and personal action. While the U.S. signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, Congress never ratified it and President Bush has since repudiated it. Following an interfaith service, participants will visit 14 U.N. missions and meet with world leaders to discuss climate issues. Hundreds of people are expected to attend including large delegations from Massachusetts, Maine and New York.

The outdoor interfaith service will begin at 1:15 p.m.</font></p>
