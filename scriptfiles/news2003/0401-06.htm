                1 - The International Federation for East Timor (IFET) today urged 

                the new nation's President to fully support meaningful justice 

                for crimes against humanity and other crimes committed in the 

                territory. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter 

                to President Xanana Gusmao, IFET expressed dismay at his reaction 

                to February's indictment by the joint UN-East Timor Serious Crimes 

                Unit of high-ranking Indonesian military officers for crimes against 

                humanity committed before and after East Timor's 1999 referendum. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While praising 

                Gusmao's promotion of reconciliation and good relations with Indonesia, 

                the letter argued that they are not "incompatible with the pursuit 

                of justice... [and] that they should [not] be given priority over 

                justice." The Indonesian people "will not be well served by the 

                continued protection of [military] impunity," the letter said. 

                IFET also wrote that East Timor's pursuit of "national reconciliation 

                does not require impunity for those in Indonesia who directed 

                the violence." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFET expressed 

                dismay at UN efforts to distance itself from the SCU indictments 

                and said it would press the UN to support the process now and 

                after the current UN Mission in East Timor (UNMISET) ends in May 

                2004 so that all outstanding cases can be completed. It further 

                pledged to continue to build international support for the serious 

                crimes process. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We will continue 

                to urge [the UN] to find other ways of bringing the perpetrators 

                to justice, including the establishment of an international criminal 

                tribunal and prosecutions in third countries under universal jurisdiction 

                provisions," IFET said. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFET called 

                trials in Jakarta's ad hoc human rights "a manifest travesty of 

                justice" and argued that "the international community and the 

                Government of Timor-Leste must share the responsibility of providing 

                justice for East Timor." It called, "the issuing of the indictments 

                by the SCU... a major step towards holding the highest-ranking 

                perpetrators to account and relieving the suffering of the many 

                thousands of Timorese victims and their families." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFET was formed 

                in 1991 to support the self-determination process for East Timor 

                at the United Nations. It has 35 member groups from 20 countries.
