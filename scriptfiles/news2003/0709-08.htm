-  

July 9 -  - President Bush will use his trip to Africa  to tout his five-year, $15 billion anti-AIDS initiative, but it is unlikely that he will discuss the disastrous impact of the policies - and the domestic political concerns - behind it. The Bush AIDS initiative extends the administration's war on international family planning to HIV/AIDS prevention efforts in developing countries.  One-third of the new AIDS prevention money for Africa will be directed to groups that take narrow and ineffective approaches to HIV/AIDS prevention by excluding condoms and relying on &quot;abstinence-only&quot; messages.  These are precisely the policies pushed by the President's right-wing base. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When it comes to finding and implementing good strategies to defeat the scourge of AIDS in Africa, sound public health policies should never take a back seat to ideology.  Yet that is what has happened with President Bush's AIDS initiative,&quot; said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.  &quot;Millions of lives are at stake.  We should be making the best use of these scarce resources, but the Bush policies waste money and cost lives.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &quot;abstinence-only&quot; provisions of the Bush AIDS initiative were deliberately crafted by right-wing groups to prevent family planning providers from receiving the new AIDS funding.  These family planning organizations, however, are best situated to help prevent and treat AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many family planning providers in Africa have a long history of integrated service delivery for women and their families, a comprehensive approach to sexuality education, vast experience providing voluntary counseling and testing for sexually transmitted infection prevention, an ability to target at-risk populations, and extensive networks on the ground providing services.  This enables them to quickly and effectively target additional HIV/AIDS funds to those most in need.</font></p>
