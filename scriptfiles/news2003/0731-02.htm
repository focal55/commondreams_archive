- July 31 - The Sierra Club today thanked Senators for turning back another of President Bush's anti-environmental judicial nominees, Alabama Attorney General William Pryor.  Pryor has worked to take the federal cop off the beat, once arguing that Congress has no constitutional authority to protect wetlands under the Clean Water Act. The Sierra Club has joined with other organizations concerned about his record, including the NAACP, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and AFL-CIO, to oppose his nomination.  President Bush nominated William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are grateful that Senators rebuffed President Bush's latest attempt to fill the courts with judges like William Pryor, who is out of step with what most Americans believe,&quot; said David Bookbinder, Senior Attorney for the Sierra Club.  &quot;Why does President Bush continue pushing lifetime appointments for judges who threaten to unravel our fundamental rights and environmental protections?  The Courts may be the last hope we have to halt the Bush Administration's assault on the environment.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush has nominated judges who have records of siding with large corporations over citizen rights, limiting citizen access to the courts, and opposing environmental health and safety protections and William Pryor

is just the latest example.   Pryor has worked to weaken the Clean Air

Act

at a time when cities across the country are facing record numbers of unhealthy air days.  Pryor testified before Congress that the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) efforts to enforce the Clean Air Act &quot;invad[e] the province of the states.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pryor urged the Supreme Court to find that Congress' efforts to protect wetlands are unconstitutional in Solid Waste Authority of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 US 159 (2001).  Low-income neighborhoods and communities of color bear disproportionate environmental burdens in our society.  Instead of working to protect these communities, Pryor has sided with big polluters who often dump or release toxins with impunity.  Pryor stated that &quot;environmental racism cases should fail generally.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Pryor has a record of working to weaken the Clean Air Act at a time when cities from Philadelphia to Los Angeles are facing record numbers of unhealthy air days,&quot; concluded Bookbinder.  &quot;We want President Bush to nominate judges with records of enforcing laws that protect our clean air, our clean water, and our special places.&quot;</font></p>
