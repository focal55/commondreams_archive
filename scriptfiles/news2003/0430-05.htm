<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - April 30 - <i>Following is a 

statement of Judith P. Wilkenfeld, director, International 

Programs, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids: </i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Just weeks before the world's nations are to adopt the 

recently negotiated international tobacco treaty, the Framework 

Convention on Tobacco Control, the United States has launched a 

last-ditch effort to gut the treaty to the sole benefit of the 

tobacco industry. The U.S. this week sent a diplomatic note to 

other nations asking for their support to reopen the negotiations 

and make changes that would render the treaty largely 

meaningless. The U.S. proposal is a poison pill that would 

undermine four years of hard work that concluded on March 1, when 

171 member nations of the World Health Organization (WHO) reached 

agreement on a strong treaty. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Every issue the United States is raising has already been 

thoroughly debated, negotiated and settled, and the final treaty 

is supported by the vast majority of countries from every region. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In fact, the final treaty goes to great lengths to address 

U.S. concerns. For example, a provision calling on nations to 

enact comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotions and 

sponsorships includes an exception for countries with 

constitutional constraints. The objections the U.S. continues to 

raise are not valid concerns but excuses aimed at blowing up the 

treaty. If the negotiations are reopened to address the U.S. 

objections, it would open the floodgates for other countries to 

seek changes as well, returning the negotiating process to square 

one and delaying or destroying this unprecedented worldwide 

effort to address the global tobacco epidemic. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The treaty is scheduled to be adopted at the World Health 

Assembly, the annual meeting of WHO member nations that begins 

May 19 in Geneva, Switzerland. If the U.S. is unwilling to sign 

the treaty in its current form, then it should step aside and 

allow other countries to adopt this strong treaty that can help 

protect the health of their citizens. A strong treaty without a 

U.S. signature is better than a toothless treaty with a U.S. 

signature. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The specific change the U.S. is seeking would allow any 

nation to choose to opt out of any of the treaty's substantive 

provisions. This change would only benefit the tobacco industry. 

It would allow the tobacco industry to renegotiate the treaty on 

a country-by-country basis and lobby each nation to ignore treaty 

provisions the industry does not like. In its current form, the 

treaty would empower nations, especially developing nations 

targeted by the tobacco industry, to resist the industry's 

powerful political influence and enact scientifically proven 

measures to reduce tobacco use, improve health and save lives. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If widely adopted and effectively implemented by countries, 

the treaty could mark a fundamental turning point in reducing the 

terrible toll in health, lives and money that tobacco use takes 

around the world. It is strongest in requiring nations to adopt 

two policies proven to reduce smoking and save lives: a 

comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and 

sponsorship (with an exception for nations with constitutional 

constraints), and a requirement for large health warning labels 

covering at least 30 percent of the principal display areas of 

the cigarette pack. The treaty also provides nations with a 

roadmap for enacting strong, science-based policies in other 

areas such as secondhand smoke protections, tobacco taxation, 

tobacco product regulation, combating cigarette smuggling, public 

education, and tobacco cessation treatment.&quot; </font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The World Health Organization estimates that there are 1.1 

billion smokers in the world today, a number expected to rise to 

1.64 billion by the year 2025. About four million people die 

each year from tobacco use. If current trends continue, this 

figure will reach about 10 million per year by 2020, with 70 

percent of those deaths occurring in developing countries. </font></i></p>
