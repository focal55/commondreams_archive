                - April 15 - The Bush Administration will again attempt to shroud 

                their secret meetings with energy industries at a hearing before 

                the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals this Thursday, April 17. This 

                is the first hearing before the DC Circuit Court in the Sierra 

                Club's ongoing lawsuit against the Cheney Energy Task Force. The 

                Sierra Club is seeking to shed light on how much influence polluting 

                industries had in the crafting of the Bush Administration Energy 

                Plan. The plan has since served as the blueprint for much of the 

                polluting Energy bill that passed the House last week and the 

                energy bill currently before the Senate. For more information, 

                see fact sheet below. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every American 

                deserves a safe, clean, and affordable energy future. Fortunately, 

                the technologies exist to get us there. But the Bush Administration 

                and Congressional leadership are taking us down the wrong path 

                with a destructive, expensive, and polluting energy bill. Much 

                of the bill stems from the Bush Administration's Energy Task Force 

                plan, which was developed in secret with the help of energy industry 

                officials. Below is an update on the Sierra Club lawsuit to make 

                public information about those closed-door meetings: </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Latest Appeal 

                to be heard on April 17: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sierra Club 

                is suing Vice President Cheney and the Energy Task Force under 

                the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). We are seeking an accounting 

                of energy industry participation in crafting the Bush Administration's 

                destructive energy policy, which relies on subsidies to polluting 

                and outdated fossil fuel industries. The District Court ordered 

                the Administration to provide information about participation 

                from these industries, which the Bush Administration refused to 

                do, claiming Constitutional immunity from such inquiries. The 

                District Court rejected that contention, pointing out that the 

                Administration was attempting to "cloak what is tantamount to 

                an aggrandizement of Executive power with the legitimacy of precedent 

                where none exists." The Administration appealed and is now asking 

                the D.C. Circuit to make new law that would effectively shield 

                it from any legal scrutiny. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Cheney 

                Energy Task Force: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On January 

                29, 2001 President Bush established the National Energy Policy 

                Development Group, better known as the "Cheney Energy Task Force." 

                Formally, the Energy Task Force included the Vice President and 

                the Secretaries of Energy, Commerce, Interior, Transportation, 

                Agriculture, Treasury, and the EPA Administrator. On May 16, 2001 

                the Task Force issued its recommendations for a "National Energy 

                Policy" and Congress is now considering an Energy Bill based on 

                these proposals. According to media accounts, energy industry 

                leaders extensively participated in the Task Force. As a result, 

                the Energy Policy heavily favors these industries; indeed, some 

                parts of the Policy expressly mimic industry proposals. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Federal 

                Advisory Committee Act: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress enacted 

                FACA to regulate precisely this sort of special interest influence 

                over government policy. FACA requires advisory committees to open 

                their meetings and records to the public. If Sierra Club prevails, 

                the Administration will have to disclose extensive information 

                about Task Force membership, actions and records. With Court approval, 

                Sierra Club has asked for information about energy industry participation 

                in the Task Force. The Bush Administration point-blank refused 

                to respond, arguing instead that the Constitution categorically 

                prohibits such inquiries. When the District Court rejected this 

                argument, the Administration brought this appeal. </font>

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sierra Club's 

                case has been consolidated with a FACA case brought by Judicial 

                Watch. In addition, the General Accounting Office (GAO) also sued 

                (under a different law), seeking similar information. (GAO's case 

                was dismissed in December, 2002, and GAO did not appeal.) Finally, 

                the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) used the Freedom 

                of Information Act (FOIA) to seek information from various agencies 

                about the Task Force. When these agencies did not comply with 

                FOIA, NRDC sued, and its case is currently pending in federal 

                district court.
