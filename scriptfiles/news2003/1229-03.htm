- December 29 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) released the following statement today on the Mad Cow case:                                               </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The unfortunate discovery of a dairy cow in Washington State infected with Mad Cow Disease, or BSE, is a result of irresponsible US agricultural policies. BSE in the United States is preventable but the US Department of Agriculture (UDSA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must do more to protect American consumers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;Last year, the USDA tested only 19,990 cattle believed to be at risk for Mad Cow Disease, out of a population of about 96 million or 1 out of every 5,000 cattle. By contrast in Europe, every single animal above a given age gets tested for this fatal brain-wasting disease (one out of every four cattle).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;USDA argues that there is no risk to humans because slaughter houses are required to remove all central nervous system (CNS) tissue from sick cattle. This tissue is where BSE is found and can infect humans if eaten. However, removing this tissue is rarely completely effective. USDA's own studies found that 35 percent of advanced meat recovery product tested was contaminated with CNS tissue.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;While the USDA-sponsored Harvard risk assessment of BSE  in the U.S. noted that compliance with FDA's 1997 BSE feed rule is the most important factor in preventing a BSE outbreak, it is clear that this rule is not being rigorously enforced. Two GAO reports have shown how lax FDA has been in ensuring compliance with the feed rule. The first GAO report published some three years after the BSE feed rule went into effect found fairly widespread non-compliance. The 2002 GAO report found no improvement and found that the FDA compliance data was unreliable.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;When Congress returns I intend to introduce legislation that will: </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;       Prohibit meat from downer cattle from entering the human food supply; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;       Test all downer cattle using modern rapid quick tests (estimates range from 190,000 to 970,000 cattle) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;       Establish a mandatory trace back system for all bovines; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;       Require mandatory recall of food products infected </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;       Prohibit the feeding of the remains of any mammal to any animals that humans eat. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;       Tighten the law on dietary supplements, which currently allow supplements to contain CNS tissue; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;       Require doctors and hospitals to report all cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;More can and must be done to protect Americans, and our economy, from this devastating disease and the public panic it can cause</FONT></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
