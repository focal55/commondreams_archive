                VA - April 15 - In an unusual move, the powerful American Association 

                of Apparel and Footwear Manufacturers has called for the U.S. 

                government to impose a ban on apparel and footwear products from 

                Burma because of massive human rights abuses in that country. 

                The Association calls for the government to enact and "maintain 

                this ban until Burma demonstrates that it recognizes, respects, 

                and enforces basic human and labor rights for its own citizens." 

                The Association has almost 1,000 member companies including industry 

                powerhouses like Levi-Strauss & Company, Sara Lee Branded Apparel, 

                Liz Claiborne, and Perry Ellis. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Association 

                has done the right thing. This will strengthen our coalition's 

                grassroots effort to boycott 'Made in Burma' products," says Aung 

                Din, Director of Policy for the Free Burma Coalition. "No companies 

                - U.S. or otherwise - should profit from forced labor in Burma." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Association's 

                move follows pledges from over 40 companies in the apparel industry 

                to shun products from Burma, ruled by the military dictator Than 

                Shwe. Companies boycotting products "Made in Burma" include Wal-Mart, 

                Federated Department Stores, May Department Stores, Tommy Hilfiger, 

                Phillips-Van Heusen, Jones Apparel, Gart Sports, Saks, Adidas, 

                The Spiegel Group, and Columbia Sportswear. Over the past year, 

                apparel imports from Burma dropped by 27%, from $411 to $303 million, 

                depriving the cash-hungry regime of significant income. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Companies avoid 

                production in Burma due in part to grassroots boycott campaigns 

                that raise the issue of foreign investors doing business with 

                Burma's dictatorship, which uses systemic forced labor. International 

                agencies and governments, including the International Labor Organization 

                and the U.S. State Department, have documented the regime's massive 

                use of forced labor: "Forced labor, including forced child labor, 

                has contributed materially to the construction of industrial parks 

                subsequently used largely to produce manufactured exports including 

                garments," the State Department stated in a report. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1995, 

                the U.S.-based Free Burma Coalition has successfully persuaded 

                over 70 U.S. multinational corporations to leave Burma. Currently, 

                the coalition is calling on TIAA-CREF, the largest U.S. pension 

                fund, to take action on its investment in companies that operate 

                in Burma. The Free Burma Coalition's campaigns are a response 

                to the call by Burma's National League for Democracy for companies 

                to avoid Burma until democracy and human rights are restored.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Burma has been 

                ruled by military dictatorship since 1962. The regime prevented 

                the democratically elected government from assuming office in 

                1990.
