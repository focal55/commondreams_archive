                YORK - April 14 - The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation 

                Board (CSB) will hold a field hearing in New York City on April 

                16 on the subject of the April 26, 2002 explosion in Manhattan, 

                which injured 31 people and caused major property damage. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This investigation 

                concerns an explosion during waste mixing operations at Kaltech 

                Industries Group, an architectural sign manufacturing company 

                on West 19th Street in Chelsea. The CSB staff will present preliminary 

                findings on the causes of this incident, to be followed by several 

                panels of witnesses who will discuss the potential role of fire 

                codes in preventing chemical incidents of this kind. NYCOSH Executive 

                Director Joel Shufro will be one of the witnesses. A public comment 

                period will be provided. CSB will use the testimony and comments 

                in developing its safety recommendations from this case. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Operators 

                like Kaltech represent a major threat to workers and to the community," 

                said NYCOSH Board Chair William F. Henning. "Kaltech demonstrates 

                the need for new regulations to protect workers from chemicals 

                that are not highly hazardous in their pure form, but which can 

                react explosively when they are mixed with other chemical. It 

                also show the need for improved training for workers and better 

                enforcement of existing regulations." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The meeting 

                will occur on Wednesday, April 16, at the Fashion Institute of 

                Technology, Building A, 8th floor, 8th Avenue at 27th Street, 

                New York City, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
