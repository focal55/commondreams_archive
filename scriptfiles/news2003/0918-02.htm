- September 18 -A photographer whose pictures of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge created a national controversy, a congressman who helped protect California's Big Sur, and a woman who has climbed more than 4,200 peaks are among those being honored with national awards from the Sierra Club in two separate ceremonies.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subhankar Banerjee, a former Boeing engineer from Bellevue, Washington, left his job to spend 14 months taking pictures in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Banerjee was catapulted into the national spotlight this spring when an exhibition of his work at the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of Natural History was mysteriously moved from the rotunda to the basement, setting off a flurry of articles in such prominent publications as the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Newsweek, and others. Banerjee is the recipient of a Special Achievement Award for the publication of his book, &quot;Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons of Life.&quot; The award will be presented to Banerjee on Thursday, September 18 among 49 of his photographs currently on display at the California Academy of Sciences.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson and Benjamin Brumberg, former ombudsman for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, will be recognized with Distinguished Service Awards, which honor persons in public service for strong and consistent commitment to conservation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Steve Curwood of National Public Radio, the final honoree at Thursday's ceremony, will receive the David Brower Award for environmental journalism. Curwood hosts the weekly &quot;Living on Earth&quot; program, which is heard on more than 230 National Public Radio stations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Sam Farr (D-California) will receive the Edgar Wayburn Award, which honors service to the environment by a person in government, at the Sierra Club's annual banquet on Saturday, September 20.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At a time when there is an all out assault on clean air, clean water and wilderness, Representative Farr has shown extraordinary leadership in the environmental field, both locally and nationally,&quot; said Sierra Club President Larry Fahn. Rep. Farr sponsored the Big Sur Wilderness and Conservation Act of 2002, which gave permanent protection to the last unprotected federal lands in the Big Sur backcountry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Barbara Lilley of Simi Valley, California, will be recognized for her mountaineering accomplishments, which include reaching more than 4,200 different summits from the Sierra Nevada to Africa. Lilley was one of the first women to climb Mount McKinley (now called Denali) in Alaska. She will receive the Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ansel Adams Award for conservation photography will go to Douglas Steakley of Carmel, California, for his photography of the Big Sur.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Isaac Hall of Maui will receive the William O. Douglas Award for contributions in the field of environmental law. Over the past 25 years, Hall has litigated more cases on behalf of the environment than any other attorney in Hawaii.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Environmental Alliance Award, which includes a $1,000 prize from the Joseph Barbosa Earth Fund, will be awarded to the Winyah Group of the Sierra Club's South Carolina Chapter. The Group is being recognized for its work with other organizations to protect the waters of the Waccamaw River and its watershed in northeast South Carolina and southeast North Carolina.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A new award for 2003, the Madelyn Pyeatt Award, will go to Madelyn Pyeatt of Bellingham, Washington. This award recognizes the contributions of Club members working with youth. Pyeatt led more than 500 outings for underprivileged children in the San Francisco Bay Area before recently moving to Washington.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club's highest honor, the John Muir Award, which honors a distinguished record of achievement, will go to Vivian Newman, a club member from Maine who has spent two decades working to protect the integrity of our nation's coasts, waters and wetlands.</font></p>
