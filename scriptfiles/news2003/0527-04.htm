- May 27 - At a press conference with 

Russian Ambassador to the United States Yuri Ushakov, U.S. 

Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham announced today that the 

Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration has 

awarded Washington Group International and Raytheon Technical 

Services a total of $466 million to begin work to shutdown the last 

three remaining weapons-grade plutonium production reactors in 

Russia. The Department will work to replace those reactors with 

coal-fired heat and electricity plants. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shutting down the three reactors, two located at Seversk and one 

at Zheleznogorsk, will end the production of enough weapons-grade 

plutonium to produce approximately one nuclear weapon every day and 

a half. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The selection of the contractors is another significant step in 

advancing the Bush Administration's nonproliferation programs," 

Secretary Abraham said. "Replacing these reactors with fossil fuel 

energy is critical to eliminate the production of weapons-grade 

plutonium in Russian and closing these facilities. Russia and the 

United States have enjoyed a good relationship on this program and 

we look forward to continued progress." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The awarding of the work orders is the next major step in 

fulfilling commitments agreed to by the U.S. and Russian 

governments in Vienna, Austria, implementing the Elimination of 

Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production Program (EWGPP). 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a ceremony in Vienna in March 2003, Secretary Abraham and 

Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Alexander Rumyantsev signed an 

agreement that would reduce the threat from weapons of mass 

destruction by stopping plutonium production at the last three 

Russian plutonium reactors. As part of the agreement, the 

Department of Energy, working with its partners in Russia, will 

provide replacement fossil-fuel facilities to produce replacement 

energy for heat and electricity currently produced by the reactors 

and serving two cities in Russia. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Working with counterparts at the Russian contracting firm 

Rosatomstroi, both Washington Group International and Raytheon 

Technical Services will implement the shutdown programs for both 

sites. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Washington Group International will oversee work at the Seversk 

site. There, the U.S. will provide assistance in refurbishing an 

existing fossil fuel plan to produce electricity lost from the 

shutdown of the reactors. The refurbishment work, once contracts 

are signed with Rosatomstroi, is estimated to take five years, at 

that time the reactors will close. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Major work at the Seversk site will include refurbishing or 

replacing existing coal-fired boilers, providing one new high 

pressure coal-fired boiler, replacing turbine generators, 

completing construction of the fuel supply system, refurbishing the 

industrial heating unit and ancillary systems. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Raytheon Technical Services will oversee work at the 

Zheleznogorsk site. There, the U.S. will provide assistance in 

building a new fossil fuel plant. Once contracts are signed with 

Rosatomstroi, estimated time of completion for the project is eight 

years and the reactor will shutdown. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Major work at the Zheleznogorsk site will include providing a 

co-generation boiler, an extraction/condensing steam turbine, 

heating only boilers, a fuel handling system, an ash removal 

system, environmental controls, and a hot water pipeline to connect 

the new plant with the district heating system. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Abraham said in a letter to Minister Rumyantsev that he expects 

the Department's National Nuclear Security Administration to have 

final contracts in place with Washington Group International and 

Raytheon Technical Services by June 30, 2003. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reactors, although originally designed to produce 

weapons-grade plutonium, also provide heat and electricity required 

by the surrounding communities in Siberia. The EWGPP program is 

providing fossil-fueled energy plants to supply such heat and 

electricity to the surrounding communities, facilitating the shut 

down of the reactors. 

</font>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The three plutonium production reactors will continue to operate 

until the fossil-replacement plants are completed. These reactors 

have deficiencies in the areas of design, equipment, and materials, 

and are considered to be among the highest risk reactors in the 

world. To ensure reactor safety, high priority safety upgrades are 

being expeditiously pursued. The Department's Pacific Northwest 

National Lab will be responsible for necessary nuclear safety 

upgrades at both sites. These upgrades will not extend the life of 

the reactor facilities.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
