                - March 6 - The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen today petitioned 

                the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove from the 

                market the popular antidepressant nefazodone, manufactured by 

                Bristol-Myers Squibb. Nefazodone, marketed under the name Serzone, 

                has no unique therapeutic benefit and has led to at least 11 deaths 

                in the United States from liver toxicity, government records show. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In January 

                2003, the manufacturer removed nefazodone from the European market 

                after the Swedish Medical Products Agency announced that it would 

                require a warning on the drug’s label about the potential for 

                liver toxicity. In the United States, more than 4.5 million prescriptions 

                were filled for Serzone in 2001. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There is no 

                good reason to keep this drug on the market. It is no more effective 

                than other antidepressants, and it presents a unique health hazard 

                for patients," said Sidney Wolfe, M.D., director of Public Citizen’s 

                Health Research Group. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its analysis 

                of adverse event reports from the FDA, Public Citizen found that 

                from 1994, when it was first marketed, to the spring of 2002, 

                nefazodone was associated with at lease 53 cases of liver injury, 

                including 21 cases of liver failure and 11 deaths. Worldwide, 

                Bristol-Myers Squibb itself acknowledges 28 reports of liver failure, 

                including 18 deaths. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, 

                while nefazodone is not more effective at treating depression 

                than older drugs, according to research by the federal Agency 

                for Health Care Policy and Research, it is uniquely dangerous 

                to patients. Further, periodic liver testing has not been shown 

                to prevent injury and there is no way to predict which patients 

                are at higher risk for liver damage. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An analysis 

                by researchers in Spain found that, of 13 antidepressants, nefazodone 

                has the highest incidence of liver injury – seven to 22 times 

                that of the other antidepressants. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The liver toxicity 

                dangers of nefazodone are compounded by the fact that it inhibits 

                a key enzyme that is involved in the detoxification of about half 

                of all prescribed drugs, so nefazodone increases the toxicity 

                dangers of other drugs a patient is taking simultaneously. Also, 

                by inhibiting this enzyme, nefazodone can increase its own concentration 

                with potentially toxic results. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FDA in 

                December 2001 notified Bristol-Myers Squibb that it must add a 

                "black box" warning to the package insert for nefazodone warning 

                of life-threatening liver damage and recommending that physicians 

                advise their patients to be aware of signs of liver problems. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But black box 

                warning does not go far enough to protect patients, particularly 

                because the labeling presented a confused message, the petition 

                said. Although the black box warning recommends monitoring of 

                patients’ liver function, a second notice on the label downplays 

                the necessity of such tests. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the February 

                2002 issue of its monthly newsletter about drug safety, Worst 

                Pills, Best Pills News, Public Citizen labeled nefazodone as a 

                "Do Not Use" drug because of its known liver toxicity and recommended 

                that anyone who had been taking it consider switching to a safer 

                antidepressant. The petition and articles from the newsletter 

                about Serzone are posted online at <a href="http://www.worstpills.org" target="_new">www.worstpills.org</a>, 

                a drug information service launched this winter by Public Citizen.

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our readers 

                have known for a year to steer clear of this drug, and now patients 

                in Europe are protected, too," Wolfe said. "The FDA is endangering 

                the lives of patients in this country every day that it allows 

                nefazodone to remain on the market."
