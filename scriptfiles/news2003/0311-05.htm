                - March 11 - In the aftermath of the tragic Spring Training death 

                of 23-year-old Baltimore Orioles pitching prospect Steve Bechler 

                and the continued lack of commitment toward needed changes in 

                ephedra and supplement policies, Ralph Nader and League of Fans 

                today urged professional sports leagues, players' unions, the 

                Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Congress to take immediate 

                action against ephedra and the 1994 law that allows dietary supplements 

                to go unregulated. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our citizens 

                should never be used as guinea pigs for dietary supplements with 

                no guarantee of product safety," Ralph Nader said. "How many more 

                ephedra-related seizures, strokes, heart attacks, and deaths have 

                to occur before our leaders take action?" </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unlike drug 

                products that must be proven by the FDA to be safe and effective 

                for their intended use before marketing, the Dietary Supplement 

                Health & Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) frees any product that 

                calls itself a dietary supplement, like ephedra, from federal 

                regulation before they reach the consumer and does not require 

                manufacturers and distributors to record, investigate or forward 

                to the FDA any reports they receive of injuries or illnesses that 

                may be related to the use of their products. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Congress must 

                repeal the Dietary Supplement Health & Education Act of 1994," 

                stressed Nader. "Public health and safety needs to come before 

                the interests of the powerful and well-funded supplement industry 

                that showers congressional Republicans and Democrats with political 

                contributions." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                Public Citizen's Health Research Group, ephedra is responsible 

                for more than 100 deaths and hundreds of other cases of serious 

                damage to users (many of which are extremely well-documented and 

                have occurred at recommended doses). There are more reports of 

                death, stroke, arrhythmia, heart attacks, chest pain, seizures 

                and hypertension for ephedra than for all other dietary supplements 

                combined. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although DSHEA 

                leaves the burden of proof on the FDA rather than supplement companies, 

                the law allows the FDA to prohibit sale of a dietary supplement 

                if it "presents a significant or unreasonable risk of injury." 

                But despite the overwhelming, unequivocal evidence of the dangers 

                of ephedra (including more than 100 reports of death in the possession 

                of the FDA and the admitted legal authority for a ban), the FDA 

                refused a ban, proposing a warning label instead. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is irresponsible 

                that the FDA has the evidence to immediately ban dietary supplements 

                containing ephedra from the marketplace but still fails to do 

                so," Nader said. "This is another example of a government regulatory 

                agency falling to their knees under pressure from a powerful industry 

                that will continue to cause deaths and serious illnesses." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the sports 

                world, the mounting, high-profile disasters involving ephedra 

                are well documented. Nader praised the NFL, NCAA, FIFA and the 

                International Olympic Committee for doing their part to prevent 

                ephedra-related tragedies among their athletes. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is encouraging 

                to see that there are a few principled sports leagues and governing 

                bodies who refuse to wait for Congress or the FDA to act," said 

                Nader. "Major League Baseball, the NBA, NHL and their respective 

                players' unions need to show the same leadership before more preventable 

                illnesses or deaths occur in professional sports from ephedra-containing 

                products or other potentially dangerous dietary supplements." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shawn McCarthy, 

                director of the sports industry watchdog League of Fans, advocated 

                for the major professional sports leagues and unions to use their 

                influence to lobby Congress to repeal DSHEA and pressure the FDA 

                to take ephedra-containing supplements off the market. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The leagues 

                and players should tell our government to stop allowing the sports-supplement 

                industry to use professional athletes as test subjects," McCarthy 

                said. "Those companies are changing the culture of sports, and 

                creating a public health menace all the way down to the junior 

                high athletes who easily purchase and fill their lockers with 

                unregulated supplements and performance-enhancers so they can 

                be like the pros." </font>
