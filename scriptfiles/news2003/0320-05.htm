                - March 20 - On behalf of Churches for Middle East Peace, the 

                following statement was issued by Fr. Stan DeBoe, chair, and Corinne 

                Whitlatch, director. The full text follows: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Churches for 

                Middle East Peace deeply regrets the decision by the United States 

                and other nations to begin military action against Iraq. We are 

                concerned about the injury and loss of life of U.S. personnel 

                who have been deployed to the region and of the Iraqi people who 

                once again suffer the devastating effects of war. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the midst 

                of these horrific events, our prayers are with our brothers and 

                sisters in the Middle East. Mindful of God's will for peace and 

                justice on earth, we pledge our efforts to work actively for peace 

                and to urge the U.S. government to: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- bring hostilities 

                to a swift end, -- take measures to protect civilians and non-combatants, 

                -- abide by the Geneva Conventions and international law in the 

                conduct of war and in its aftermath, -- support efforts to alleviate 

                the humanitarian crisis that will result from the war, -- support 

                multilateral measures under the leadership of the United Nations 

                to rebuild Iraq and protect the Iraqi people, -- bolster regional 

                arms control measures following the war, and -- provide concrete 

                and immediate leadership to the process of establishing a viable 

                Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We pray that 

                the leaders of our nation and the nations of the world will have 

                compassion and wisdom. We join the members of our churches in 

                praying for the safety of United States servicemen and women and 

                for the safety of the people of Iraq. We call upon members of 

                our churches to act in a manner consistent with their faith and 

                conscience to foster peace in the Middle East. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a people 

                of faith, we believe that God calls us to paths of peace rooted 

                in mercy and justice. In the midst of conflict, violence, and 

                death, we will not stray from that path. Instead, we recommit 

                ourselves to God's vision of peace and will strive to build a 

                world of greater understanding, compassion and care, until we 

                can live without the threat of war and all people can live in 

                peace. </font>
