commercial whaling, the world's whales are bidding us all 'goodbye' in a new award-winning public service announcement 

television spot that is touching the hearts and minds of millions 

of viewers around the world. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 45-second TV spot was produced in Hamburg, Germany by the 

acclaimed advertising firm of Springer &amp; Jacoby, as part of a 

comprehensive ad campaign the company has developed pro-bono for 

the International Fund for Animal Welfare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In it, majestic whales swim underwater singing their haunting 

songs. Their songs transform from their natural calls to the 

international music hit &quot;Time to Say Goodbye&quot; by famed Italian composer and singer Andrea Boccelli. As the song climaxes, the 

whales wave farewell with their flukes as they swim off into the 

deep waters and the audience is told the whales are bidding the world farewell because &quot;Japan and Norway are whaling again.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The spot is being broadcast throughout Germany on the eve of 

the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), 

to be held in Berlin, Germany in June. It will then be aired 

internationally to generate public support for the protection of 

whales and the end of commercial whaling worldwide. It may also 

be viewed at <a href="http://www.ifaw.org" target="_new">http://www.ifaw.org</a>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This week, the powerful TV spot won a silver award for sound 

at the prestigious CLIO advertising competition in the U.S. It 

also won three awards in the 2003 competition of the Art 

Directors Club of Germany held earlier this year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;IFAW is delighted to be collaborating with the talented team 

at Springer &amp; Jacoby on this campaign, and we are very proud this TV ad is being so well received worldwide,&quot; said IFAW Director of Public Affairs, Patrick Ramage. &quot;Surprisingly, many people still 

do not know that commercial whale hunting takes place. We hope 

that this captivating and creative TV ad will inform people and 

encourage them to join IFAW's campaign to end whaling once and for all.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Springer &amp; Jacoby is one of the world's leading international advertising agencies, and is best known for its Mercedez-Benz 

advertising campaigns. The agency has branch offices in London, 

Paris, Barcelona and Milan, is a member of the US-group &quot;Partnership/Interpublic,&quot; and closely cooperates with Bozell in 

New York.</font> </p>
