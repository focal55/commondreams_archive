- April 29 - The Council on 

American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) today reported that it has 

received numerous hate-filled and threatening messages from the 

readers of a right-wing Islamophobic Web site. The Washington-based 

Islamic civil rights and advocacy group is working with the 

Department of Justice to investigate those messages that contained 

threats. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of the hate messages sent to CAIR from visitors to 

<a href="http://www.Worldnetdaily.com" target="_new">Worldnetdaily.com</a> include: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) &quot;I don't say kill (Muslims). But it would be a better world 

without them!&quot; 2) F--k you; and the one humped camel you rode in 

on. 3) You are lower than snake sh-t. 4) islam is a scam to keep 

people down...kill the infidels. f--k that kill muslims...f--k all 

of you...and die real soon 5) Take the f--king towels off your 

heads and join the human race, A--HOLES!!!! 6) Please leave My 

Country...And leave it NOW! 7) Get out of America 8) I have been 

encouraged by Joe Farah of WorldnetDaily to send this to 

you...leave this nation and go back to the pile of cow manure you 

all came from 9) It won't be long before the immigration police 

will be there to help you go home to the cesspool you came from. 

10) GO HOME! Wherever that is, it is not HERE! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CAIR officials say the hate-filled e-mails were prompted by a 

number of Worldnetdaily.com articles demonizing Muslims and by 

recent false charges made against CAIR by the site's editor, Joseph 

Farah. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His most recent articles smeared CAIR in an attempt to support 

the controversial nomination of Daniel Pipes to the United States 

Institute of Peace. The nomination of Pipes, who just this week 

said President Bush was wrong to call Islam a &quot;religion of peace&quot; 

and refused to condemn the internment of Japanese-Americans in 

World War II, is opposed by a number of Muslim and Arab-American 

groups, including CAIR. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Farah falsely claimed CAIR never condemned suicide bombings, 

called the conviction of the first World Trade Center bombings a &quot;travesty of justice,&quot; termed the conviction of Omar Abdel Rahman 

a &quot;hate crime,&quot; and that CAIR's board chairman said the Quran &quot;should be the highest authority in America.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We never called the conviction of the World Trade Center 

bombings a 'travesty of justice' and did not call the conviction of 

Sheikh Omar a 'hate crime,'&quot; said CAIR Executive Director Nihad 

Awad. &quot;Our board chairman did not say the Quran should be the 

highest authority in America and we have repeatedly condemned 

terrorism in all its forms, including suicide bombings,&quot; said Awad. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He citied the group's statement of condemnation issued following 

a bomb attack on a Passover celebration in the coastal city of 

Netanya last March that left 20 people dead and more than 100 

wounded: &quot;We condemn this attack and all other attacks on innocent 

civilians...This attack is of particular concern coming as it did 

during a religious observance in which the focus is remembrance of 

God... To break this cycle of violence and counter-violence, all 

parties must focus on a political solution based on justice and 

equality, not force of arms.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Awad also noted that the alleged statement about the Quran by 

CAIR's board chairman was not in fact a quote. It was a paraphrase 

of remarks that were either reported inaccurately or wrongly 

attributed by a reporter at a small California newspaper. CAIR is 

seeking a retraction from that newspaper. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Farah's attacks also contain a number of other falsehoods and 

distortions. For example, he distorted the facts in an attempt link 

a CAIR advisory board member to the first World Trade Center 

attack. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That person, Imam Siraj Wahhaj, is one of the American Muslim 

community's most respected leaders and he works with almost all 

national Islamic organizations. As part of the original World Trade 

Center case, the prosecutors released a long list of people who &quot;may be alleged as co-conspirators.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That list included anyone who came anywhere near Sheikh Omar. 

Since Imam Siraj was a leader in the New York community in which 

Sheikh Omar lived, his name was included on the list. He was never 

charged with any crime, nor was there any evidence presented that 

he was involved in the conspiracy in any way. Farah knows this but 

continues to vilify a respected Muslim leader. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a past column, Farah claimed, &quot;Islam has been at war with the 

West, with Christianity, with Judaism...ever since the days of (the 

Prophet) Muhammad.&quot; He also rejected criticism of a 

Worldnetdaily.com article advocating that, &quot;For every (Israeli) 

civilian, 100 non-combatant Palestinian adults will be slain, and 

for every child, 1,000 adults,&quot; saying that he found the proposal 

to be &quot;a very thoughtful and quite responsible contribution to the 

Middle East debate.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other editorials on WorldNetDaily.com called the Quran, Islam's 

revealed text, a &quot;suicide playbook&quot; and recommended air-lifting 

pigs into Afghan mosques. One Worldnetdaily.com columnist wrote 

recently: &quot;The only French custom that still survives (following 

Napoleon's invasion of Egypt) is the aversion to bathing.&quot; Another 

stated: &quot;...freedom and democracy are incompatible with Islam.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>CAIR, America's largest Islamic civil liberties group, is a 

mainstream organization that regularly works with national law 

enforcement authorities, elected officials and other civil 

liberties and minority groups. It is headquartered in Washington, 

D.C., and has 16 regional offices nationwide and in Canada. Since 

its founding in 1994, CAIR has defended the civil and religious 

rights of all Americans. </i></font></p>
