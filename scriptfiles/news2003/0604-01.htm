<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - June 4 - Ten leading banks from seven countries on Wednesday announced the adoption of the "Equator Principles," a voluntary set of guidelines developed for managing social and environmental issues related to the financing of development projects. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The banks will apply the principles globally and to project financings in all industry sectors, including mining, oil and gas and forestry. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The banks adopting the Equator Principles today are ABN AMRO Bank, N.V., Barclays PLC, Citigroup, Inc., Credit Lyonnais, Credit Suisse Group, HVB Group, Rabobank, Royal Bank of Scotland, WestLB AG, and Westpac Banking Corporation. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Together, these banks underwrote approximately 14.5 billion dollars of project loans in 2002, representing approximately 30 per cent of the project loan syndication market globally. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A bank adopting the "Equator Principles," undertakes to provide loans only to projects whose sponsors can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the bank their ability and willingness to comply with comprehensive processes aimed at ensuring that projects are developed in a socially responsible manner and according to sound environmental management practices. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Equator Principles are based on the policies and guidelines of the World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC). 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The banks received extensive advice and guidence from IFC, the private-sector investment arm of the World Bank, in drafting the Equator Principles, IFC said. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In implementing the guidelines, banks currently have or will put in place internal policies and processes consistent with them, IFC said, adding they will be applied to all loans for projects with capital cost of 50 million dollars or more. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Project finance refers to financing of projects where the repayment of the loan is dependent upon the revenues that a project is expected to generate once it is up and running. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Equator Principles use a screening process for projects which is based on IFC's environmental and social screening process. Projects will be categorised as A, B or C (high, medium or low environmental or social risk) by the banks, using common terminology. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For A and B projects, the borrower will complete an Environmental Assessment addressing the environmental and social issues identified in the categorisation process. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After consultating affected local stakeholders, category A projects, and category B projects where appropriate, will prepare Environmental Management Plans to address mitigation and monitoring of environmental and social risks. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Environmental Assessment will address issues such as sustainable development, use of renewable natural resources, protection of human health, cultural properties, and biodiversity, including endangered species and sensitive ecosystems and occupational health and safety. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other issues would include fire prevention and life safety, socioeconomic impacts, land acquisition and land use, Involuntary resettlement, impacts on indigenous peoples. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The borrower will be required to demonstrate that the project complies with host country laws and the World Bank and IFC Pollution Prevention and Abatement Guidelines for the relevant industry sector. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
