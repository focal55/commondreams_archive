<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- October 2 -  

White House pick for global AIDS czar endorses disinformation 

campaign on global AIDS funding, abstinence policies</font>.

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During Senate confirmation hearings yesterday, Randall Tobias, ex-Eli 

Lilly CEO and Pres. Bush's appointee for head of the U.S. Emergency 

Plan for AIDS Relief, included in his testimony incorrect and 

misleading statements about the capacity of poor countries to absorb 

U.S. funding for AIDS treatment and prevention, according to AIDS 

activists. His confirmation is expected in the Senate Foreign 

Relations Committee today.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Tobias told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that according to 

his experts, money is 'not the problem' in confronting the AIDS 

crisis,&quot; said Asia Russell of Health GAP. &quot;This is patently untrue. 

Annual spending on AIDS in poor countries needs to reach $10.5 

billion by 2005 just to utilize poor countries' existing 

infrastructure alone. U.S. underfunding of the fight against AIDS is a major problem.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, total global spending on AIDS is only $4.7 billion. &quot;While the 

Administration continues to hide behind the excuse of inadequate 

infrastructure,&quot; asserts Rusell, &quot;it is undermining the Global Fund, 

the multilateral program with the capacity and legitimacy in place to 

save lives now.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Global Fund needs $3 billion in 2004 to fund qualified proposals. 

Pres. Bush plans to give only 6.6%  of the total to the Global Fund 

in 2004, or $200 million, although the U.S. comprises 33% of the 

world economy. Bush promised $1 billion for the Global Fund, as part 

of his $3 billion Global AIDS Act, signed into law in May. Bush has 

broken that promise, according to advocates. &quot;The Administration 

plans to isolate and underfund multilateral efforts to combat the 

pandemic, even if they have to mislead the public in order to do it,&quot; 

said Salih Booker, Director, Africa Action.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before his confirmation hearing, Tobias drew criticism because of his 

lack of experience in public health and because of potential conflict 

of interest as a corporate Pharma CEO. Eli Lilly is a member of the 

Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, PhRMA, a group 

lobbying the U.S. Government to seek greater intellectual property 

rights to protect monopolies on expensive medicines in the developing 

world and whose members are major Republican campaign donors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Trusting this position--with so many lives at stake--to someone with 

no public health experience is astonishing,&quot; said Dr. Paul Zeitz, 

Director, Global AIDS Alliance. &quot;Tobias told the Committee he hoped 

to use his pharma background to 'get a better deal' on drug prices. 

Negotiations with brand-name companies have never been as effective 

as generic competition in reducing the prices of AIDS drugs. Will 

this be an initiative that favors corporate cronyism over best 

practice?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tobias also claimed, erroneously, that declines in the rate of HIV 

infections in Uganda are the result of campaigns focused primarily on 

abstinence. &quot;Promotion of abstinence has been, at best, only one 

aspect of a much broader campaign to reduce HIV in Uganda,&quot; notes 

Jodi Jacobson, Executive Director of the Center for Health and Gender 

Equity, &quot;One that has included frank talk about sex at all levels of 

public discourse and widespread promotion of effective condom use, 

among other strategies.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration efforts, says Jacobson, &quot;to portray Uganda's 

approach as a one-dimensional strategy serves a narrow ideological 

agenda, in which public health and scientific evidence are virtually 

irrelevant.&quot; The Bush Administration's plan to make abstinence-only 

strategies the core of its global prevention agenda &quot;will 

unquestionably lead to a more illness and death,&quot; said Jacobson.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amendments are expected to the White House Emergency Supplemental 

spending bill next week that would restore global AIDS funding to the 

original level promised by the President. Similar amendments have 

already been aggressively opposed by the White House, through Senate 

proxies including Bill Frist (R-TN).</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 2, 2003</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Senator:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AIDS emergency is fast becoming the worst health catastrophe in 

human history. Already, twenty five million people have died from 

AIDS. Around the world, more than 42 million people are now infected 

with the virus that causes AIDS.  Without the hope of treatment, they 

too will die.  In the State of the Union message, President Bush 

boldly proclaimed that: &quot;This nation can lead the world in sparing 

innocent people from a plague of nature.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The leadership of the President's AIDS initiative is critical to the 

success of the overall effort to reverse the AIDS pandemic.  We 

believe that the President's nominee, Randall Tobias, is not the 

appropriate person to serve as the coordinator of the President's 

Global AIDS Initiative.  Therefore, we urge you to oppose his 

nomination.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Tobias has virtually no significant experience working in the 

field of public health or in the effort to combat AIDS.  Mr. Tobias 

was unable in his confirmation hearing to cite any direct experience 

working on the issue of AIDS.  The President's Global AIDS initiative 

deserves to be led by a qualified individual with extensive public 

health expertise.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Tobias' experience as a pharmaceutical executive raises serious 

questions of conflict of interest in the procurement of the 

lowest-cost medicine.  Mr. Tobias is not divesting from his holdings 

in Eli Lilly, one of the leading members of the pharmaceutical trade 

association (PHRMA).   PHRMA has worked tirelessly to block AIDS 

sufferers around the world from having access to the lowest 

cost-generic medicine.  In his testimony, Mr. Tobias misleadingly 

suggested that no further obstacles remained to providing access to 

the lowest-cost generic medicine in the developing world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Tobias' testimony raises serious questions about his fitness to 

serve as the AIDS coordinator.  During his confirmation hearing, he 

misleadingly stated that the Global Fund could not effectively 

utilize additional funds.  In fact, as he ought to know, the Global 

Fund requires billions more for its upcoming rounds of grants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Tobias testimony also revealed a rejection of comprehensive 

prevention strategies in favor of a policy giving priority to 

abstinence-only prevention.  Responding to a question about the 

success of Uganda's balanced ABC approach to HIV prevention, Mr. 

Tobias clearly indicated that he would privilege abstinence and 

faithfulness over condoms as a means to prevent the spread of HIV 

despite overwhelming evidenced that a balanced approach to prevention 

is the most effective and best meets the needs of women and 

vulnerable groups.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A well-balanced and fully funded US response to the HIV/AIDS 

emergency is needed now more than ever.  For this reason, we 

respectfully urge your opposition to the nomination of Mr. Tobias.</font></p>
