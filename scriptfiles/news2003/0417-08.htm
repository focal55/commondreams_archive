                - April 17 - Although just a small percentage of Marines at Camp 

                Pendleton, Calif., reported using the herbal supplement ephedra 

                daily during 2000, half the heat-related injuries reported that 

                year were among the Marines who had used ephedra, according to 

                an unpublished study. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This strongly 

                confirms that serious health risks are associated with ephedra 

                use, Public Citizen said today. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A summary of 

                the study, posted on a military Web site, was based on a survey 

                and medical data from the First Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, 

                Calif. It found that although 7 percent of Marines reported daily 

                use of ephedrine dietary supplements during the year 2000, "half 

                of all [Marines with] heat related injuries in 2000 in 1MARDIV 

                (First Marine Division) had used ephedra." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The information 

                also documented specific cases of ephedra-related injuries in 

                military personnel, including a death from Cybertrim (a supplement 

                containing ephedra) at Marine Corps Logistic Base in Barstow, 

                Calif., and a cerebral hemorrhage in an active duty person at 

                Point Loma Naval Submarine Base in San Diego. That person was 

                using Ultimate Orange, another ephedra supplement. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Military personnel 

                could not be reached to obtain further information about the study. 

                Previous reports indicate that there have been about 30 deaths 

                of active duty military personnel who were using ephedrine dietary 

                supplement products. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen 

                is publicizing the Camp Pendleton information the same week as 

                the publication of an article by Sidney M. Wolfe, M.D., director 

                of Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, about ephedra in the 

                April 18 edition of Science magazine. In the article, "Ephedra: 

                Scientific Evidence Versus Money/Politics," Wolfe traces the history 

                of injuries and deaths linked to ephedra and the influence of 

                money and politics on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s 

                (FDA) refusal to ban it. He noted that although some manufacturers 

                are no longer selling supplements containing ephedra, the government 

                should not rely on the marketplace to protect the public’s health. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Regulation 

                is now coming from the marketplace, operating in the vacuum created 

                by FDA inaction," Wolfe wrote. "This is not an acceptable way 

                to safeguard public health, and product labeling is not enough. 

                We call on the FDA . . . to stop the occurrence of further preventable 

                deaths and injuries by banning ephedra products." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data show that 

                products containing ephedra increase the risk of hypertension, 

                stroke, heart attacks, arrhythmia and seizures. More than 100 

                deaths in the United States have been linked to ephedra. Most 

                recently, the death of Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve Bechler 

                focused public attention on the dangerous supplement ingredient 

                yet again. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of 

                these serious problems, Public Citizen in 2001 petitioned the 

                FDA to ban ephedra. While a number of manufacturers have announced 

                they will stop selling supplements containing ephedra, the government 

                has yet to act. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It would appear 

                that the FDA is part of the ‘Ephedra Industry Survival Service,’ 

                not part of the public health service, Wolfe said. "The government 

                is talking about putting warning labels on ephedra products, but 

                that is not enough. These products can kill, and they shouldn’t 

                be on the shelves." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both the Army 

                and the Air Force have stopped selling ephedra products in their 

                commissaries. The National Football League, the National Collegiate 

                Athletic Association and the International Olympic Committee have 

                prohibited the use of ephedra among athletes. </font>
