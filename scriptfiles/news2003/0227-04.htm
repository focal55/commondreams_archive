                HHS to Launch Medicare Demonstrations to Improve Health Care through

                - February 27 - HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson announced today 

                that HHS is seeking proposals to improve the quality of care provided 

                to certain Medicare beneficiaries. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The demonstration 

                projects will create new programs to better manage the health 

                care of beneficiaries that may have certain chronic conditions. 

                The projects will receive payments that will allow health care 

                organizations to offer tailored health plans exclusively to beneficiaries 

                with conditions such as stroke, congestive heart disease and diabetes. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are moving 

                aggressively on many fronts to make the Medicare program more 

                responsive to the needs of its beneficiaries, especially those 

                who live with chronic illnesses," Secretary Thompson said. "We 

                can improve the quality of health care for these beneficiaries 

                by providing an environment where doctors and hospitals can coordinate 

                their patients' care." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HHS' Centers 

                for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which will oversee the 

                demonstrations, expects that organizations will provide disease 

                management programs that promote patient-centered, multi-disciplinary 

                approaches to care; encourage the use of sophisticated information 

                technology to support the provision of evidence-based care; and 

                focus on the improvement of care processes and patient outcomes. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is part 

                of an overall strategy to remove the barriers to more appropriate 

                care for people who are covered by Medicare," said CMS Administrator 

                Tom Scully. "It will bring new participants into this type of 

                payment model and provide them with the resources necessary to 

                coordinate the care of chronically ill beneficiaries." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organizations 

                participating in this initiative will receive a capitated payment 

                rate for all Medicare-covered Part A and Part B services. Capitated 

                payments are predetermined rates paid each month for each beneficiary 

                enrolled in a health care program. This predetermined rate is 

                based on the projected costs of the enrollee for the payment year, 

                fully adjusted for their health status. Beneficiaries currently 

                enrolled in the Medicare fee-for-service program, including those 

                who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, may elect to 

                participate in one of the demonstration plans. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The demonstration 

                will run for three years. Applicants have 90 days from the notice 

                publication date to submit proposals. The notice will be published 

                in the Feb. 28 Federal Register. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chronic diseases 

                are being targeted by the demonstrations because of the profound 

                burden they impose on patients -- particularly racial and ethnic 

                minorities, who are disproportionately affected. Historically, 

                a small proportion of Medicare beneficiaries has accounted for 

                a major proportion of Medicare fee-for-service expenditures -- 

                with about one out of eight beneficiaries accounting for roughly 

                three quarters of expenditures. Many high-cost beneficiaries are 

                chronically ill with certain common diagnoses, and most of the 

                Medicare expenditures for their care are for repeated hospitalizations.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new capitated 

                disease management initiative is the latest in an ongoing series 

                of disease management demonstrations: </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Last fall, 

                CMS launched a disease management demonstration to determine the 

                impact on costs and health outcomes of offering disease management 

                services and prescription drug coverage to Medicare fee-for-service 

                beneficiaries with advanced-stage congestive heart failure, diabetes, 

                or coronary heart disease. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In April 

                2002, a coordinated care demonstration began to test whether coordinated 

                care can improve medical treatment plans, reduce avoidable hospital 

                admissions and promote other desirable outcomes among Medicare 

                beneficiaries with chronic diseases. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- A case management 

                demonstration began in the fall of 2001, to test whether intensive 

                case management services for congestive heart failure and diabetes 

                mellitus are cost-effective means of improving clinical outcomes, 

                quality of life, and satisfaction with services for high-risk 

                Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- CMS will 

                soon send guidance to states on how Medicaid programs can incorporate 

                disease management services into their benefit plans through the 

                use of waivers or state plan amendments. The new guidance will 

                help states tailor benefits to the needs of enrollees with chronic, 

                or long-term illnesses. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CMS plans to

                and a Medicare fee-for-service population-based demonstration 

                targeting specific diseases such as congestive heart failure, 

                diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in selected 

                areas with underserved and disadvantaged populations. </font>
