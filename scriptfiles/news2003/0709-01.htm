- July 9 - The Kucinich for President Campaign is announcing endorsements from 3 

leading activists: Granny D (Doris Haddock), Tom Hayden, and Arun 

Gandhi, the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The insurgent Kucinich campaign has been gaining steam financially and 

in endorsements and grassroots volunteers. (On Monday, Kucinich was 

endorsed by prominent feminists who vowed to recruit others to the campaign; last week, Willie Nelson endorsed with a pledge to perform 

benefit concerts.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GRANNY D, now in her 90s, is the legendary activist from New Hampshire, 

the first primary state. In 1999, she wore out four pairs of shoes and 

was hospitalized in Arizona for dehydration and pneumonia, but she was 

unstoppable as she marched for political reform on a 14-months trek from California to Washington D.C. Her full statement is <a href="http://kucinich.us/wesupportdennis.htm" target="_new">here</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It reads in part:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I am proud to endorse Dennis Kucinich for President. When I walked 

3,200 miles across the United States and inquired of people why they 

were not voting, they said: 'Find us someone who understands us, who 

cares about us.' I'm talking about people living in trailers; people 

living in small towns with boarded-up windows on Main Street; people 

coming out of farmhouses in Iowa, squeezed out of their livelihood by 

stinking agri-hog farms; people whose well-paid jobs have been shipped overseas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I promised to look for someone who would understand them, that had a vision of the future for them, that believed in Peace, Love, Justice. 

Well, here he is: Dennis Kucinich. I believe he is the candidate who can bring new voters and disgruntled voters into the political process. To those people I met on my walk across America: 'Now keep your promise 

to me and come out and vote for him!'&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOM HAYDEN is another renowned activist endorsing Kucinich, who he 

refers to as &quot;the candidate with the best stands and the best history.&quot; 

An author, civil rights activist, leader of the anti-Vietnam War 

movement and defendant in the &quot;Chicago 8&quot; trial, Hayden went on to 

become an effective California State Assemblyman and Senator for 

7-terms. He is a leading figure in today's peace movement and the 

movement for global justice and against sweatshops.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARUN GANDHI heads the M.K. Gandhi Institute of Nonviolence in Tennessee, where he carries on the work of his grandfather, Mahatma Gandhi. Arun Gandhi is a U.S. citizen who endorsed as an individual, not as a 

representative of any group: &quot;I am happy to support Dennis Kucinich 

because I believe he is our only hope. Never before has it been so 

important that the nation rally around one candidate as today. This 

nation has been hijacked by right-wing politicians who are leading us on to certain disaster. Dennis Kucinich, with his progressive policies and 

love of peace, is the only candidate who can bring us back from the brink.&quot;</font></p>
