International Criminal Court

Law Pressures Non-U.S. Allies to Sign ICC Immunity Pacts</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(New York, June 30, 2003) - A deadline set out in the &quot;American 

Servicemembers Protection Act&quot; (ASPA) that threatens U.S. military 

assistance to countries supporting the International Criminal Court 

(ICC) will pass tomorrow, the NGO Coalition for the International 

Criminal Court announced. The July 1, 2003 ASPA deadline, which 

coincides with the one year anniversary of the entry into force of 

the Rome Statute of the ICC, provides that any ICC State Party 

receiving U.S. military assistance will lose those funds unless a 

Presidential waiver is issued either on the basis of national 

security interests or because a country has signed a U.S.-requested 

ICC immunity agreement by that date.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ASPA, signed into law last August, is part of a multi-pronged 

Bush administration campaign to gain broad-ranging exemptions from 

ICC jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The ASPA makes specific reference to the U.S. government's 

global initiative to conclude bilateral immunity agreements, which 

require that signing states not hand over any U.S. nationals or 

military personnel to the jurisdiction of the ICC. While the ASPA 

contains broad Presidential waivers and exempts all NATO and other 

major U.S. allies, it is unclear how these exemptions and waivers 

will be administered. Potentially at risk are fiscal year 2003 funds 

that have not yet been disbursed and over $230 million in fiscal year 

2004 assistance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the U.S. began approaching states for signature of these 

agreements last July, as many as 49 mostly small, poor countries have 

reportedly signed these agreements, but only a handful have ratified 

them. The majority of signatories are countries in Africa and Asia 

that are not States Parties to the ICC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the intense pressure for signature of bilateral immunity 

agreements, a number of important U.S. allies and regional bodies 

have rejected them. Argentina, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, 

South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, Slovenia and Croatia, plus all 15 

members of the European Union, are among countries that have refused 

the U.S. request. The EU Presidency last week welcomed a declaration 

by the 10 EU accession countries, and other associated states and 

EFTA countries, in which they affirmed the EU Common Position 

rejecting the U.S. bilateral immunity deals, and resolved that their 

national policies would adhere to that position. The EU has stated 

that the bilateral treaties proffered by the U.S. violate Article 98 

of the Rome Statute. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush administration has renounced sixty years of U.S. support 

for international law and justice,&quot; said William Pace, convenor of 

the NGO Coalition for the ICC. &quot;The only politically motivated 

'prosecutions' are by the U.S. against the ICC.&quot; The ICC is a 

multilateral treaty-based organization that was signed by 139 

countries, including the United States during the Clinton 

administration.  President Bush has opposed the court claiming that 

it could be used as a forum for frivolous prosecutions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What we're seeing is that the Bush administration has been signing 

these immunity deals with the world's poorest countries, many of 

which cannot stand up to a threat of the loss of aid,&quot; said Heather 

Hamilton, director of programs at the World Federalist Association. &quot;We've also seen that the U.S. government is exceeding the terms set 

out in ASPA by concluding these agreements with countries that are 

not States Parties to the ICC,&quot; she added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A number of countries have reportedly received large sums of U.S. 

financial assistance upon signature of the bilateral immunity 

agreements. In the case of Sierra Leone, upon signature of a 

bilateral immunity agreement it was announced that the U.S. would 

invest $25 million in the Sierra Rutile mines. In other instances, pressure for signature of a bilateral immunity agreement has included 

threats such as restricted accession to NATO, as has been reported in 

some of the Balkan states, and the withdrawal of 'dual use' funding 

such as in the case of the Bahamas, where American Ambassador J. 

Richard Blankenship warned that an &quot;unfavorable&quot; response could 

result in the loss of funding for the paving and lighting of an 

airport runway.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ICC comprises the 90 countries that have ratified or acceded to 

the Rome Statute, including the overwhelming majority of U.S. allies. 

Seated in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC has recently elected 

all of its top officials, including 18 highly qualified judges, a 

prosecutor and registrar, who together bring to the court a diverse 

range of nationalities, cultures and languages, and top-level 

experience in international, humanitarian and criminal law.</font></p>
