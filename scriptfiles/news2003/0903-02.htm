- September 2 - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN), with a delegation of five 

Republican Senators, returned Friday from southern Africa lacking the 

necessary commitment to fully fund the fight against global AIDS. The 

trip to Africa is the second by U.S. decision-makers in less than two 

months. Yet, as with President Bush's journey in July, all are coming 

back with rhetorical expressions of concern but with empty hands and 

excuses for inaction.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both the Bush Administration and U.S. Congress have laid out plans for 

$15 billion to be spent on AIDS treatment and prevention over five 

years, yet as a major decision approaches in the Senate next week, their 

message is that a full $3 billion for FY 2004 cannot be effectively 

spent. Citing reasons like lack of &quot;infrastructure&quot; and lack of &quot;absorptive capacity,&quot; many in the U.S. government appear set to spend 

only $2 billion, thereby denying life-saving medicines to Africans and 

others living with HIV/AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Once again, 'lack of infrastructure' is being used as an excuse not to 

put money where it's desperately needed,&quot; said Brook Baker with AIDS 

treatment activist group Health GAP. &quot;[USAID Administrator] Andrew 

Natsios claimed over a year ago that AIDS treatment would be impossible 

in developing nations due to 'poor infrastructure' and now, in no 

less-deadly fashion, Frist is using the same excuse to obstruct adequate 

funding at year later.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Trumpeting the Bush Administration's claim that there is insufficient 

capacity to absorb more than $2 billion for 2004 (only $500 million more 

than 2003), Frist and others perpetuate serious misinformation, and 

ironically ignore evidence of renewed commitment and expanded capacity 

that should have been apparent during their African journey.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to UNAIDS, there is underutilized capacity to deliver 

antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in developing countries such that an 

additional 500,000 people could be on treatment tomorrow using capacity 

that existed as long ago as 2001. Current UNAIDS estimates of capacity 

are even higher, suggesting that nearly 2 million people in developing 

countries could be on lifesaving ARVs if there were an adequate 

commitment of resources, rather than the mere 300,000 currently 

receiving such treatment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another fact overlooked by decision-makers is that the Global Fund to 

fight AIDS, TB and Malaria is nearly bankrupt, only a couple of years 

after its inception, due to a lack of funding from wealthy countries 

such as the U.S. The Global Fund, currently chaired by Secretary of 

Health Tommy Thompson, is said by experts to be the best proven 

mechanism for fighting AIDS, yet will be unable to fully fund grants in 

October of this year for its third round of proposals from 

disease-ravaged countries.  This despite the fact that the first two 

rounds of funding will speed AIDS treatment to 491,000 over the next 

five years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As early as next week, the U.S. Senate will vote on spending for global 

AIDS in the Labor, Health and Human Services budget. In order to 

supplement the meager investment planned so far, Senator Richard Durbin 

(D-IL) is planning to introduce an amendment that would fund the $3 

billion Congress authorized for 2004, including $1 billion for the 

Global Fund. As it stands, the Senate is poised to appropriate less than 

$2 billion with at most $200 million going to the Global Fund--$150 

million less than last year's appropriation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is incomprehensible that after going to some of the worst-hit 

countries by AIDS, the so-called leadership of our country cannot muster 

up the dollars necessary to save millions of lives,&quot; said Kris Hermes of 

Health GAP. &quot;Arguments about 'absorptive capacity' and 'infrastructure' 

show a willful intent to deceive by the U.S government&quot; continued 

Hermes.  &quot;Sure there should be more investment in infrastructure now so 

that more people can be treated in the future.  But, we could also buy 

and deliver affordable generic medicines today that would reverse the 

tide of death in Africa.  This promise of resources should be 

front-loaded not back-loaded. The Senate must act on behalf of people 

living with HIV/AIDS and appropriate at least $3 billion in 2004 with a 

minimum of $1 billion for the Global Fund.&quot;</font></p>
