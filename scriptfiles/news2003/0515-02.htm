FRANCISCO -  

May 15 - On Thursday, May 15, the world’s largest logging and paper company, International Paper (NYSE: IP) will join one of the world’s largest home builders, Centex Homes (NYSE: CTX) and Lanoga Corporation to announce that they are halting all purchases of Indonesian pulp and wood, which new studies link to illegal logging that is threatening the existence of indigenous communities.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 15, International Paper will make public its policy stating "[A] complete break with Indonesian wood fiber is the only practical option consistent with International Paper’s commitment to help save the endangered forests there." In a parallel statement, Centex will pledge to eliminate Indonesian plywood for home construction: "In regions where much of the world’s lauan is produced, we have found inadequate systems in place to provide assurance that lauan does not originate from endangered or illegally logged forests."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same time, timber giant Georgia-Pacific (NYSE: GP) maintains lucrative contracts with loggers in Indonesia, and home improvement chain Home Depot (NYSE: HD) continues to buy from limited suppliers through a policy of "constructive engagement." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Georgia-Pacific and Home Depot are threatening the existence of indigenous communities in Indonesia," said Brant Olson, a spokesperson for Rainforest Action Network. "We are calling on these two companies to immediately halt all purchases of Indonesian wood and pulp until indigenous rights to their traditional lands are recognized and the Indonesian government agrees to stamp out illegal logging."

</font>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IP and Centex both recognize the severity of the situation in Indonesia and are working to ensure they’re not contributing to the wholesale liquidation of some of most biologically diverse ecosystems on earth. According to Importing Destruction, a report also being released on May 15 by RAN, "The largest trees of Indonesia’s rainforests are being turned into the world’s cheapest tropical hardwood plywood, furniture, tool handles and construction materials" (available for download). Lauan is a tropical tree that is prime habitat to endangered species including the orangutan. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is a major victory for Indonesia’s rainforests and their inhabitants but we will continue our campaign until Georgia-Pacific and Home Depot agree to completely ban all Indonesian forest products," said Jennifer Krill, RAN’s Old Growth Campaign Director.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WALHI, the Indonesian Forum on the Environment, and AMAN, the Alliance of Indigenous Peoples of the Archipelago, also released a report today rebutting efforts by some US purchasers to pursue certification standards in Indonesia that would stamp certain species and specific forest concessions as acceptable for logging. WALHI and AMAN dismissed these efforts on the grounds that prudent forest stewardship principles are untenable where corruption and illegal logging is rampant, and where indigenous communities do not have legal rights to manage their traditional lands. "Certification standards in Indonesia are currently not possible . . . and will not become possible until substantial national and local legal, institutional and policy reforms take place," according to The Application of FSC Principles No. 2 and 3 in Indonesia: Obstacles and Principles (also available for download).

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reports bolster claims already made by Indonesia’s Environment Minister, Nabiel Makarim, calling for international efforts to curb the demand for illegally harvested timber. "Due to the corruption of civilian officials, local authorities – including our police officers and military personnel – do not enforce many of the national laws regarding timber harvesting and turn a blind eye to the practice of illegal logging," said Makarim. "Since we apparently cannot stop the supply, it has become clear that Indonesia will not overcome illegal logging without stemming the foreign demand for Indonesian logs and forestry products."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As an alternative to Indonesian purchasing, RAN suggests that popular Indonesian products should be switched. "Lauan plywood can be replaced with rubberwood, ramin tool handles and paintbrush handles can be replaced with poplar" states the RAN report, "and merbau flooring and furniture can be replaced with bamboo and rattan."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rainforest Action Network is known for its "market campaigns" which have motivated major companies, including Burger King, Home Depot and Citigroup to adopt policies to protect the world’s rainforests and the rights of their traditional inhabitants through education, grassroots organizing and non-violent direct action. WALHI, the Indonesian Forum for Environment, is a coalition of over 500 local environment and social groups from across Indonesia. AMAN, the Alliance of Indigenous Peoples of the Archipelago supports the struggles of dozens of indigenous peoples across the Indonesia archipelago.
