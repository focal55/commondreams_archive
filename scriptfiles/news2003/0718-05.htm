- July 18 - A long-running water conflict escalated sharply today as conservationists sought to have the Bush administration's U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  held in contempt of court for failing to reduce flows in the Missouri River. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ordered lower river flows on July 12th -- and reiterated that order on July 14th -- to prevent the submergence of river sandbars that endangered birds use as nesting sites and that the public uses as riverfront recreation areas.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to the motion, Judge Gladys Kessler has ordered the Army Corps to appear before the court at 9:30 a.m. on July 21, 2003, for a hearing. Choosing not to single out individuals, conservationists are seeking fines imposed on the agency until it complies with the court order. At her discretion, the judge may seek to identify and sanction particular individuals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shortly before the court's order to lower river levels was to take effect, the Bush administration made an after-hours announcement that its U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would simply not comply. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead, a Corps spokesman announced that the White House would seek $42 million in additional funding for other measures along the river -- and that work would begin to rewrite the scientific record that supported the ruling.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's a remarkable situation that I have never seen in my 25 years of legal practice. The Corps of Engineers is going  to flout a federal court ruling rather than make modest operational changes on the Missouri River that are required by law. &quot; said David Hayes, former deputy secretary of the Department of the Interior and now an attorney in private practice with Latham and Watkins.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While more money for the environment would always be a good thing, if it actually arrives, scientists have unanimously stated that at least some modest efforts to restore more natural flows on the river are critical to save not only terns, plovers and sturgeon but also to prevent dozens more species from becoming endangered,&quot; said Tim Searchinger, attorney for Environmental Defense.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The contrast between conclusions presented by independent scientific bodies and executive branch agencies is stark:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Degradation of the Missouri River ecosystem will continue unless the river's natural water flow is significantly restored... scientists know that the natural rise and fall in water levels is essential to biological productivity in large rivers.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Corps' Biological Assessment does not contemplate the need to employ a spring rise or lower summer release from the Gavins Point Dam to provide for the recovery of the federally-protected Missouri River species.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=154-07152003" target="_new">Bush administration, July 15, 2003</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The administration justifies its obstructionism by citing a prior order from the 8th Circuit court in Omaha, NE, to keep river flows high enough for commercial barge traffic. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In their contempt motion, conservationists dispute that legal interpretation on two grounds: The 8th Circuit order applied to the 2002 navigation season and has therefore already expired, and the 8th Circuit order does not relieve the Corps of its obligations under the Endangered Species Act.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conservationists believe 8th Circuit ruling will carry little weight in the contempt hearing before Judge Kessler -- who has already described it as &quot;a problem of the Defendants making.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Science and law aside, the essence of the political conflict is that lower summer flows which protect wildlife also increase recreational use of the Missouri River and its reservoirs, but shallow water inhibits commercial barge traffic. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Government economists estimate that the court-ordered lower flows would bring a net $8.8 million economic gain for the region.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two hundred years after Lewis and Clark first explored the Missouri River, the river is in a state of sharp ecological decline and its economic potential has been hobbled because of unnatural river flows that benefit a dwindling and heavily-subsidized commercial barge industry. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The federal government spends more than $7 million each year to keep the 730+ mile shipping channel open for a reported seven commercial barges that regularly use it. This miniscule traffic contributes just $6.9 million to the regional economy each year, according to the Army Corps. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's time to inject some common sense in the management of the Missouri River, the Army Corps' priorities are as obsolete as the manual typewriter they wrote them on,&quot; said Rebecca R. Wodder. &quot;It's hard to reconcile sacrificing a $100 million recreation industry for a barge industry too small to tow its own economic weight.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A coalition of ten conservation organizations sued the federal government on February 13, charging that status quo dam operations were pushing the interior least tern, the piping plover, and the pallid sturgeon towards extinction in violation of the Endangered Species Act. </font></p>
