- April 25 - The East Timor Action Network (ETAN) strongly criticized the UN Commission on Human Rights for turning its back on the East Timorese people 

and jeopardizing current and future UN missions.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's statement continues the trend of ignoring Indonesia's failure to 

hold accountable those responsible for the massive human rights abuses in 

East Timor,&quot; said John M. Miller, spokesperson for ETAN.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a chairperson's statement, the Commission expressed &quot;disappointment&quot; in 

Indonesia's conduct of its Ad Hoc Human Rights court on East Timor and 

called on Indonesia to &quot;improve the current legal processes.&quot; Follow up is 

unlikely as the Commission decided to limit next year's agenda to 

consideration of technical cooperation with East Timor in the field of 

human rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Indonesia's ad hoc court on East Timor is fundamentally flawed,&quot; said 

Miller. &quot;The Commission, by calling for Indonesia to fix an irreparable 

process, is in effect saying it is willing to play along with Indonesia's 

farce.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is clear that only an international tribunal on East Timor can achieve 

meaningful justice. We urge the Secretary-General and Security Council to 

set up such a tribunal to prosecute those who committed war crimes and 

crimes against humanity from 1975 on,&quot; said Miller. &quot;Instead of coddling </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesia, the UN and its members should commit more resources to the 

existing serious crimes process in East Timor, which has issued credible indictments of top officials for the 1999 violence.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Commission's statement commended the work of the Serious Crimes Unit and called on governments to cooperate with it, but does not mention 

Indonesia's public refusal to extradite the nearly two-thirds of 

already-indicted suspects believed to reside in Indonesia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Whether on or off the Commission's agenda, support for the rule-of-law and 

basic compassion for the victims demands holding responsible the commanders 

and other ranking officials who oversaw and coordinated systematic 

violations of human rights,&quot; said Miller. &quot;The Indonesian military directed 

its scorched-earth campaign in East Timor against a UN mission; those 

murdered included UN personnel. Countries whose citizens staffed the 1999 

UN mission should want to send the strongest possible message to others who 

would do likewise.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This week, Indonesia announced it was campaigning to regain a seat on the 

UN Human Rights Commission.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Indonesia must earn a place on the Commission. It can start by putting in 

place effective mechanisms to deal with past abuses and by ending military 

impunity in Papua, Aceh and elsewhere,&quot; said Miller.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Commission's 53 member states are elected by the Economic and Social Council. While a member of the Commission from 1991 to 2002, Indonesia 

worked to deflect and water down criticisms of its own human rights record.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1999, ETAN has joined with East Timorese civil society to urge the UN 

Security Council and Secretary-General Kofi Annan to establish an 

international tribunal. For additional information see ETAN's web site 

(<a href="http://www.etan.org" target="_new">http://www.etan.org</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Background</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following the August 30, 1999 UN-organized referendum on independence, the 

Indonesian military and its militia proxies systematically destroyed East 

Timor, murdering approximately 2000 East Timorese, destroying over 70 

percent of the infrastructure and raping hundreds of women. Hundreds of 

thousands were forced from their homes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Commission of Inquiry set up by the Commission on Human Rights and three 

special rapporteurs recommended establishing an international tribunal for 

East Timor in the following months. Instead, the UN Secretary-General and 

Security Council decided to give Indonesia the opportunity to hold its own 

trials.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The UN also authorized and funded the Serious Crimes Unit (SCU) and Special 

Courts in East Timor to prosecute crimes against humanity. While the SCU has indicted high-ranking officials for orchestrating the violence in 1999, 

Indonesia has refused to extradite anyone to East Timor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesia's ad hoc Human Rights Court on East Timor has been characterized 

by poorly drawn indictments and weak prosecutions that have in effect 

rewrote history. Eleven of 14 Indonesian defendants have already been 

acquitted by the court. The sentences handed down for the five convicted (including the only two East Timorese defendants) have not been 

commensurate with the crimes committed: four defendants received less than 

the legal minimum under Indonesian law, and all remain free pending appeal. 

The verdicts in the last two cases before the ad hoc court are expected 

shortly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a report this year to the Human Rights Commission, Sergio de Mello, UN 

High Commissioner for Human Rights and former UN administrator in East 

Timor, criticized &quot;the limited geographical and temporal jurisdiction of </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the Court; the lack of experienced prosecutors and judges; the intimidating 

and, at times, hostile, courtroom treatment of Timorese witnesses by some 

judges, prosecutors and defense counsel; the causes and consequences of 

non-attendance of Timorese witnesses at the proceedings; and the lightness 

of the sentences imposed, which bear no reasonable relationship to the 

gravity of the offences committed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also noted &quot;the failure to put before the court evidence that </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">portrays the killings and other human rights violations as part of a 

widespread or systematic pattern of violence seriously undermines the 

strength of the prosecution's case and jeopardizes the integrity and 

credibility of the trial process.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The UN's Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers 

recently wrote that the prosecutions violate &quot;the principle that 

prosecutions are to be undertaken in good faith.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The defendants were primarily accused of failing to prevent the actions of 

others rather than for acts they may have directly committed. The 

prosecution repeatedly described the violence in 1999 as the result of 

conflict among East Timorese factions and portrayed the UN administration 

of the referendum as biased and anti-Indonesian.</font></p>
