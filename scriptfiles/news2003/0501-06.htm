- May 1 - The diplomatic and 

security costs of the Bush administration's proposals to explore 

new nuclear weapons far outweigh any marginal benefits such arms 

might yield, an expert panel led by Senator Edward Kennedy 

(D-Mass.) warned April 29. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) 

issued a statement with the same message in conjunction with the 

panel discussion, sponsored by the Arms Control Association. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush administration is asking Congress to continue 

funding research on modifying existing types of nuclear weapons 

to enable them to destroy deeply buried and hardened targets. It 

is also seeking a repeal of a 10-year-old prohibition, known as 

the Spratt-Furse Amendment, against research and development 

leading to the production of low-yield nuclear weapons. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kennedy took issue with both of the administration's 

proposals. He noted that the "bunker buster" currently being 

researched would have a destructive potential 10 times that of 

the blast that destroyed Hiroshima and could "spew tons of 

radioactive waste into the atmosphere, with a devastating plume 

that could poison huge areas in its path." Kennedy also 

dismissed the concept of low-yield weapons, saying, "The 

precision-guided munitions and standoff weapons we have today 

make these mini-nukes unnecessary. They would be no more 

effective than conventional munitions, and would be far more 

dangerous to our troops." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Led by Kennedy, the panel warned that the administration's 

proposals send the wrong message to the rest of the world that 

the United States believes nuclear weapons have a battlefield 

role. The proposals threaten to breakdown the long-standing 

firewall between conventional arms and nuclear weapons and 

jeopardize what has become an international norm of the non-use 

of nuclear weapons, according to the panel. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kennedy declared, "A nuclear weapon is not just another item 

in our arsenal, and it's wrong to treat it like it is." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feinstein asked, "How can we effectively seek to dissuade 

others from developing nuclear weapons while we are going 

forward with the development of new nuclear weapons ourselves?" 

She cautioned, "If we are not careful, our own nuclear posture 

could provoke the very nuclear proliferation activities we are 

seeking to prevent." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Sidney Drell, professor emeritus at Stanford University, 

said that using nuclear weapons, either to respond to a chemical 

or biological attack or in a tactical situation against a deeply 

buried bunker is a "terrible idea." He added, "I think that's 

the most dangerous idea in the world that we face." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The administration contends that making nuclear weapons more 

"usable," by reducing their potential for causing civilian 

casualties or improving their effectiveness in destroying sites 

buried deep below the Earth's surface, would enhance the 

deterrent value of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drell and Dr. Matthew McKinzie of the Natural Resources 

Defense Council contested the notion that a nuclear weapon could 

be developed to destroy a deeply buried target, yet cause little 

collateral damage. Drell said the concept is a "physical myth." 

Both physicists noted a nuclear weapon exploded just beneath the 

Earth's surface would actually create more fallout than one 

detonated above the target because the former casts more 

radioactive dirt and particles into the air. Drell noted that 

for a five-kiloton weapon to produce no fallout, it would have 

to be detonated about 350 feet deep, but "we don't know how to 

go below 50 (feet)." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drell argued that instead of investing in new nuclear 

weapons, the United States would benefit more by improving its 

conventional weapons capabilities and means to gather accurate 

information and target suspected sites of concern. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead of approving the Bush administration's initiatives to 

explore new nuclear weapons, Daryl G. Kimball, the executive 

director of the Arms Control Association, recommended four other 

actions: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Maintain the current prohibition on low-yield nuclear 

weapons research. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Shift nuclear bunker buster funding to non-nuclear 

munitions research. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Reaffirm the U.S. nuclear test moratorium and focus 

stockpile stewardship efforts on surveillance and maintenance 

activities most useful to ensuring the reliability of the 

existing U.S. nuclear arsenal. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Clarify that as long as the United States possesses 

nuclear weapons, their role is limited to the deterrence of 

nuclear attack by other states. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These four recommendations are further detailed in New 

Nuclear Policies, New Weapons, New Dangers -- a new Arms Control 

Association report on the Bush administration's misdirected 

approach to nuclear weapons. The report is available online at
