                26 - There are reports giving rise to concerns that war crimes 

                may have been committed by both sides in the recent fighting, 

                Amnesty International said today. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coalition forces 

                have confirmed attacking the main Iraqi television station early 

                on Wednesday. According to reports from the BBC, US Central Command 

                in Qatar has said that missiles struck Iraq's main TV station. 

                The Pentagon is reported to have said that the purpose of the 

                operation was to counter the command and control abilities of 

                the Iraqi regime, and also to deal with propaganda and the disinformation 

                campaign of Baghdad. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The bombing 

                of a television station simply because it is being used for the 

                purposes of propaganda is unacceptable. It is a civilian object, 

                and thus protected under international humanitarian law," said 

                Claudio Cordone, Senior Director for International Law at Amnesty 

                International. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"To justify 

                such an attack Coalition forces would have to show that the TV 

                station was being used for military purposes and that the attack 

                properly balanced the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated 

                with the incidental risk to civilian life." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Attacking 

                a civilian object and carrying out a disproportionate attack are 

                war crimes. The onus is on the Coalition forces to demonstrate 

                the military use of the TV station and, if that is indeed the 

                case, to show that the attack took into account the risk to civilian 

                lives." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"At times of 

                war many civilian activities can be seen as supporting, in a general 

                way, the war effort. But to accept that all such activities can 

                be targeted is to accept the logic of 'total war'. Preventing 

                the devastation of such 'total wars' has been one of the key underpinnings 

                for the development of the rules of war in recent decades," Claudio 

                Cordone added. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iraqi forces 

                are reported to have deliberately shelled civilians in Basra and 

                to placing military objectives in close proximity to civilians 

                and civilian objects. There have also been reports of Iraqis dressed 

                in civilian clothes in order to allow surprise attacks on coalition 

                troops. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Any direct 

                attack on civilians is a war crime. Those who blur the distinction 

                between combatants and civilians undermine the very foundations 

                of humanitarian law," said Claudio Cordone.
