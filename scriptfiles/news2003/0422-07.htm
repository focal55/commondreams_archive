                - April 22 - On Earth Day 2003, the national League of Conservation 

                Voters (LCV) and the California League of Conservation Voters 

                (CLCV) announced their joint sponsorship of a presidential candidate 

                forum on environmental issues, to be held Thursday, June 26, in 

                Los Angeles. Each of the nine Democratic presidential candidates 

                has been invited to appear. The goal of the event is to highlight 

                the critical importance of the environment to voters in the 2004 

                presidential election. </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're 

                  thrilled to partner with our friends in California to showcase 

                  the environment as a political priority to voters all over the 

                  country,&quot; said Deb Callahan, LCV president. &quot;I can't 

                  think of a better way to make sure the environment plays a key 

                  role in the 2004 presidential election than to start with a 

                  joint LCV/CLCV candidate forum.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Where 

                  the Democratic candidates stand on the environment is a matter 

                  of great interest to voters in California and throughout the 

                  country,&quot; said David Allgood, CLCV Southern California 

                  director. &quot;A candidate forum is the best way for voters 

                  to learn how important environmental protection is to those 

                  who want to be our next president.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both organizations 

                  hope to use the event to encourage voter participation in the 

                  upcoming presidential election through an in-depth discussion 

                  on the environment. Polls show that the environment is a key 

                  issue that affects ballot-box decisions, especially in California, 

                  a state that could play a deciding role in the presidential 

                  primary. The candidate forum is part of a series of activities 

                  by LCV and its partners to amplify the environment as an issue 

                  in the presidential campaign. Also in June, LCV and its partners 

                  will release a report card on the Bush environmental record. 

                  In September, LCV will release individual reports detailing 

                  each of the candidate's environmental positions. Throughout 

                  the year, LCV will distribute its &quot;LCV Environmental Primary,&quot; 

                  a weekly e-mail to members of the media and other interested 

                  parties that provides news and views on the environmental statements 

                  and activities of the presidential candidates. </font></p>
