Medical student members of AMSA will speak at press conferences across the country today advocating for the proposal.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Physician's Proposal would cover every American for all necessary medical care, including long-term care and prescription drug coverage. Patients could choose to go to any doctor and hospital. Physicians could continue to practice on a fee-for-service basis, or receive salaries from group practices, hospitals or clinics. &quot;The Physician's Proposal outlines the fundamental changes needed to save our broken health care system from excessive health care costs and lack of access to care for our poorest and sickest patients. As physicians-in-training, we see first-hand the painful impact on individuals and communities as the health system continues to fail many who it intends to serve,&quot; says AMSA National President Lauren Oshman, M.D., M.P.H.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMSA believes that equal access to comprehensive health care is a fundamental human right. AMSA has advocated for a more just health care system since 1950 and has supported single-payer national health insurance since 1989. &quot;Our commitment to universal health care stems from an understanding that the future of the medical profession is linked with our health system and the nation's health,&quot; states medical student Anjali Taneja, M.P.H, who serves as Jack Rutledge Fellow for Universal Health Care at AMSA. &quot;The current market-based system, which treats health care as a commodity, has had disastrous effects for the nation's health, the sustainability of the health system, and the doctor-patient relationship.&quot; The AMSA Foundation's 2002 American Health Care System Survey found that an overwhelming majority of first and fourth year medical students believe that health care is a right.</font></p>
