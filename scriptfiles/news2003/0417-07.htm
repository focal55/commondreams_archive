                - April 17 - Today, NASA administrator and former Secretary of 

                the Navy Sean O'Keefe addressed the National Press Club about 

                "NASA's Strategic Plan." The following analysts are available 

                for interviews: </font>

                Director of the Global Resource Action Center for the Environment, 

                Slater said today: "NASA's strategic plan involves the acceleration 

                of militarizing space. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard 

                Myers was head of U.S. Space Command when it published its 1998 

                'Visions for 2020' report which talked of 'dominating the space 

                dimension of military operations to protect U.S. interests and 

                investment.' In January 2001 the space commission chaired by Donald 

                Rumsfeld affirmed the same vision -- to dominate the globe from 

                the high ground of space -- with the official imprimatur of an 

                incoming Secretary of Defense.... It's particularly troubling 

                that this strategic plan is being announced only days before the 

                convening of the Non-Proliferation Treaty Preparatory Committee 

                meeting in Geneva." Slater will be going to Geneva for that conference. 

                She added: "The U.S. is sabotaging global disarmament. Hopes for 

                meaningful progress towards nuclear disarmament have been shattered, 

                particularly by the shameless grab to dominate space." [A PDF

                Director of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power 

                in Space, Gagnon said today: "Immediately after his appointment 

                by George W. Bush, O'Keefe told the nation that all of NASA's 

                missions in the future would be 'dual use.' This of course means 

                that the distinction between civilian and military technologies 

                will be rubbed out. The military takeover of the space program 

                is near complete." </font>

                to Our Planet. He said today: "At all of our peril, O'Keefe is 

                moving to expand NASA's program of using nuclear power in space 

                -- including reviving the decades-old notion of building nuclear-powered 

                spacecraft. What if the Columbia shuttle had been nuclear-powered? 

                Nuclear debris would have spread over Texas and Louisiana. Still, 

                two days after the Columbia tragedy, NASA advanced its new $3 

                billion space nuclear program, Project Prometheus. It is being 

                pushed despite the development of new safe space energy systems, 

                including solar-electric propulsion and solar sails."
