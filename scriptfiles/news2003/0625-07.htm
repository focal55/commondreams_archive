<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - June 25 - No one should be tried before the U.S. military commissions authorized by President Bush unless their rules are significantly changed, Human Rights Watch said today. In a new briefing paper, Human Rights Watch said use of the commissions under current military orders and instructions will fall far short of international due process standards.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Military commission trials of terrorist suspects under the existing rules will violate the basic rights of the accused, produce verdicts of questionable legitimacy, and send a message to the world that justice can be jettisoned in the fight against terrorism, Human Rights Watch said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The commissions are a discredit to American traditions of justice,&quot; said Jamie Fellner, director of Human Rights Watch's U.S. Program. &quot;The Department of Defense should go back to the drawing board.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Department of Defense has incorporated certain due process safeguards to the proposed commission proceedings, including making the trials public, requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt for conviction, presentation of evidence and cross-examination of witnesses. But these provisions provide a patina of due process to proceedings that otherwise remain seriously flawed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the problems with the current rules:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  1)   Lack of Independent Judicial Oversight.  The rules limit

      appellate review of the commissions to a specially created

      military panel appointed by the Secretary of Defense. President

      Bush has final review of commission convictions and sentences.

      The executive branch is thus prosecutor, judge and jury, and,

      potentially, executioner. There is no independent judicial review

      of verdicts, no matter how erroneous, arbitrary, or legally

      unsound.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

  

  2)   Violation of Rights of POWs.  The lack of independent appeal

      is a particularly grave fault if the commissions are used for

      people who should have been considered prisoners of war, such as

      the Taliban detainees at Guant&nbsp;namo. Prisoners of war (POWs) are

      entitled to at least the same procedures as the detaining power

      would give its own troops accused of comparable crimes. In the

      United States, that means a court-martial, with appeal to a

      civilian court.  The failure to follow this procedure for people

      who should be POWs would be a war crime.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  3)   Restrictions on Right to Counsel.  Commission rules require defendants to be represented by military defense counsel.

      Defendants may put civilian counsel on their defense team but a

      military lawyer must remain on the team as well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  4)   Limitations on Effective Defense.  The commission rules

      place severe limitations on the ability of defense lawyers to

      communicate confidentially with their clients, to travel and to

      conduct the investigations and research necessary for their case.

      For example, attorney-client conversations may be monitored by

      the government; attorneys may not talk about any aspect of the

      case with prospective witnesses; and all research must be done at

      the site of the commissions (presumably Guant&nbsp;namo Bay).  In

      addition, civilian counsel, even if they have the requisite

      security clearance, may not be given access to all the materials

      presented to the commissions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  5)   Censorship of Defense Counsel.  The rules impose a gag order

      on defense counsel, preventing them from speaking with the press

      or the public unless they receive prior approval from military

      officials. Some limitations on defense counsel's ability to

      comment publicly continue even after the trials have ended.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  6)   Military Trial of Civilians.  The military commissions will

      be permitted to try persons who were never combatants and whose

      connection to armed conflict may be tenuous at best. For example,

      a non-U.S. citizen living in the United States who has

      financially contributed to al-Qaeda could be prosecuted before

      the commission for &quot;aiding and abetting&quot; the enemy. With U.S.

      courts fully functioning, there is no justification for

      subjecting civilians to military trial and violating their right

      to a hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  7)   Second-Class Justice for Non-Citizens.  Under the

      President's Military Order, U.S. citizens may not be tried before

      the commissions, regardless of whether they were enemy combatants

      who committed war crimes. This exclusion presumably reflects a

      political judgment that the U.S. public would not accept the

      truncated justice of military proceedings for U.S. citizens.

      International human rights law, as well as U.S. constitutional

      law, does not permit the United States to discriminate between

      citizens and non-citizens with regard to their fair trial rights.</font></p>
