                - April 1 - Today, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the 

                historic University of Michigan affirmative action case. The court 

                will consider whether state educators can consider race as a factor 

                in law and undergraduate admissions. Progressive Caucus Co-Chairs 

                Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) and Barbara Lee (D-CA), today, called 

                on the Supreme Court to uphold affirmative action and rule in 

                favor of the University of Michigan. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, Co-Chairs 

                Kucinich and Lee issued the following joint statement: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Affirmative 

                action is necessary, affirmative action is right, and affirmative 

                action must be preserved. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“For the first 

                time since Brown v. Board of Education, which opened up educational 

                opportunities for millions of Americans, our public schools are 

                becoming increasingly segregated by race. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“In our cities, 

                indices of black-white segregation suggest extreme separation 

                of minorities far beyond the levels reported in other multi-racial 

                societies such as Brazil, Canada, Australia, and the UK. In fact, 

                the only other nation where minority segregation indices routinely 

                exceed those reported in the United States was the Union of South 

                Africa under apartheid. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Segregation 

                in our cities leads to dire consequences in the educational environment 

                for minorities. High minority school districts receive far less 

                in state and local educational funding than districts that have 

                predominantly white students. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“America’s 

                diversity is strength, not a weakness, and it is absolutely critical 

                that we nurture programs that enhance opportunities for those 

                who have been historically left behind. To do nothing, to abolish 

                affirmative action, is to use de jure means to fall back into 

                the de facto segregation of the past, which made a mockery of 

                democracy, equality, liberty and justice – the very values on 

                which this nation was founded. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Affirmative 

                action is still essential because a truly level playing field 

                is still an elusive goal, not a reality. Today, we stand united 

                in our support of affirmative action and the University of Michigan. 

                Our nation is at a critical junction; the Supreme Court must not 

                send our nation back into some of the darkest moments in our history, 

                but instead lead our nation to a fair and just future.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both Kucinich 

                and Lee joined 110 Members of Congress, on February 18, 2003, 

                in signing a friend of the court brief on behalf of the University 

                of Michigan. </font>
