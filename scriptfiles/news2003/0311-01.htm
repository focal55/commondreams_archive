                VA - March 11 - AMSA members and other medical students will join 

                thousands of nursing and public health students throughout the 

                nation in participating in on-campus activities to learn more 

                about the plight of the more than 74 million Americans who lack 

                health insurance. These events have been planned as part of Cover 

                the Uninsured Week, a series of national and local events designed 

                to raise awareness about the uninsured. The campus events are 

                planned for Tuesday, March 11 at medical, dental, public health 

                and nursing schools across the country. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cover the Uninsured 

                Week is a weeklong series of events taking place in communities 

                from coast to coast during March 10-16. To advance the nation's 

                understanding of the uninsured, some of the most influential organizations 

                in the United States including AMSA are joining with The Robert 

                Wood Johnson Foundation in support of the week. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Medical research 

                shows that uninsured Americans often delay medical treatment and 

                preventive screenings because they cannot afford them. As a result, 

                the uninsured often live sicker and die younger than Americans 

                who have health insurance coverage. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As physicians-in-training, 

                we believe that equal access to comprehensive health care is a 

                basic right. AMSA has long encouraged medical students to recognize 

                the plight of the uninsured and our responsibility to take leadership 

                in solving this crisis", said Eric J. Hodgson, M.D., national 

                president of AMSA. "We are encouraged that today's on-campus activities 

                will engage even more health professional students in meaningful 

                discussions and partnerships to eradicate uninsurance in America."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today's students 

                are tomorrow's health leaders, and it is crucial for them to understand 

                that millions of uninsured Americans live sicker and die younger 

                than they should because they lack health care coverage," said 

                Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, M.D., M.B.A., president and CEO of The Robert 

                Wood Johnson Foundation. "These campus discussions are making 

                it clear to the next generation of physicians and nurses that 

                they will not be able to provide the best care for every patient 

                until the uninsured have health coverage." </font>
