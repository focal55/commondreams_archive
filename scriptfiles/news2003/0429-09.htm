- April 29 - Western communities 

would be left at risk from wildfire under a bill that the House 

Resources Committee will review Wednesday, according to a broad 

coalition of environmental groups. The bill stands in sharp 

contrast to a proposal by conservation groups that would focus 

aid on communities at risk from wildfire. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposal to be considered by the committee was circulated 

by Representative Scott McInnis (R-Col.) for the first time last 

Friday, and may be voted on in committee before a single 

committee hearing is held. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The McInnis bill, like the Bush administration's so-called 

Healthy Forests initiative, does not focus scarce federal funding 

and resources where they would do the most good: in the Community 

Protection Zone adjacent to at-risk communities. Instead, the 

bill will continue to allow the Forest Service and Department of 

Interior to conduct misguided logging projects deep in the 

backcountry in the name of &quot;fuel reduction.&quot; In fact, these plans 

would provide more help to timber companies than to 

fire-threatened and cash-starved communities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society, Earthjustice, 

American Lands, Natural Resources Defense Council, U.S. Public 

Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG), Alaska Coalition, National 

Environmental Trust, Defenders of Wildlife, Trout Unlimited and 

other national, regional and local environmental groups support 

an alternative approach, known as the Community Protection Plan. 

The groups advocate fuel reduction projects and &quot;firewise&quot; 

protections along the boundaries of communities adjacent to 

forest lands. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We know that the Forest Service has limited resources, and 

that the best way to reduce the risks of fires to homes and lives 

is to focus on forest areas immediately around communities. So 

why do Rep. McInnis and the Bush Administration insist on 

diverting limited resources to logging in the backcountry instead 

of focusing on protecting communities?&quot; asked Carl Pope, Sierra 

Club Executive Director. &quot;We can do better to protect communities 

from fires.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through block grants to states, the Community Protection Plan 

would provide funds for fuel reduction on private, state and 

tribal lands-which comprise 85 percent of the forested land near 

vulnerable communities-as well as on federal lands. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This approach, the coalition says, would put the limited 

available funds to use where they are most effective: at the 

sites where forest fires pose a real threat to human lives and 

homes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In contrast, the McInnis bill does not prioritize projects 

that would create a crucial defensible space around western 

communities. Instead it calls for logging 20 million acres of 

federal lands, often far from any community, and provides 

virtually no funding for fuel reduction on non-federal lands. 

What scant funds the McInnis bill provides to local communities 

are buried within new programs in the bill that are not dedicated 

to protecting communities from wildfire. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is time for Congressman McInnis and the Bush 

administration to reverse their present course,&quot; said Gene 

Karpinski, U.S. PIRG Executive Director. &quot;They should start 

protecting communities at risk rather than the profits of the 

timber industry.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conservation groups are also concerned about the chilling 

effect that the McInnis bill, like the Bush administration 

proposal, would have on the basic democratic principal of public 

participation in the management of public lands. The McInnis 

proposal seeks to eliminate the most important part of the 

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) -- the requirement that 

alternatives to agency actions be considered. The courts have 

called this consideration of alternatives the &quot;heart of NEPA.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush administration and Rep. McInnis continue to try to 

pin the blame for wildfires on public participation and 

environmental laws rather than the real cause -- poor forest 

management,&quot; said Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of 

Wildlife. &quot;If they would focus on protecting communities and 

improving their forestry practices rather than dismantling 

environmental laws, they might actually accomplish something 

useful.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The McInnis bill also seeks to significantly interfere with 

our nation's independent judiciary. It requires a court to limit 

preliminary injunctions of logging projects carried out under the 

bill to 45 days, unless the court affirmatively acts to renew the 

injunctions. It also seeks to force any courts, including 

appellate courts, to issue a final ruling on a case in 100 days. 

It even attempts an astounding change in the American legal 

standard that governs how courts determine equitable relief for 

an injured party. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If courts adhered to the desires of the McInnis bill, these 

logging projects would essentially be put at the front of the 

line ahead of most other civil and criminal cases on the courts' 

dockets,&quot; said Marty Hayden, Legislative Director for 

Earthjustice, the nation's largest non-profit environmental law 

firm. &quot;The McInnis bill even attempts to allow logging to go 

forward after a court has ruled that a project is illegal. It's 

the equivalent of allowing a convicted felon to walk.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Title IV of the McInnis bill seeks to allow the Secretaries of 

Interior and Agriculture to conduct an unlimited number of 1,000 

acre logging and other projects, termed &quot;applied silvicultural 

assessments,&quot; which would be categorically excluded from public 

review under NEPA. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Calling a 1,000 acre clearcut an 'Applied Silvicultural 

Assessment' is the height of green-scamming,&quot; said Randi Spivak, 

Director of American Lands. &quot;The McInnis bill is an insult to the 

public if he thinks that citizen' won't see this as a clear 

hand-out to the timber industry that will do nothing to protect 

communities. Commercial logging is commercial logging and it 

shouldn't be exempt from our fundamental environmental 

protections.&quot; </font></p>
