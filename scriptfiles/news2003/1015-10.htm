- October 15 - NBC News and the Center for Responsive Politics announced today that they have agreed to an exclusive, first priority arrangement for monitoring, tracking and reporting campaign finance issues as part of NBC&#146;s comprehensive &#147;Decision 2004&#148; coverage.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the arrangement, which takes effect immediately and continues through Election Day 2004, NBC News will work with CRP to generate regular reports on trends and developments in political fundraising and campaign spending. CRP&#146;s extensive database and analysis will be featured on NBC&#146;s &#147;Today,&#148; &#147;Nightly News with Tom Brokaw,&#148; &#147;First Read&#148; (NBC News&#146; daily political e-mail), MSNBC and MSNBC.com.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday, the Bush-Cheney campaign released more record shattering fundraising figures: almost $50 million for the third quarter &#150; more than any presidential candidate may spend in all the primaries and still remain eligible for federal matching funds &#150; and over $80 million year to date. Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, leading the Democratic pack for the quarter with almost $15 million raised, has broken his party&#146;s fundraising record for a three-month period, previously held by Bill Clinton &#150; and did it with the unprecedented help of small donors giving repeat contributions over the Internet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the Democratic candidates file their quarterly reports by midnight tonight, eyes are on the 28-day old candidacy of retired Gen. Wesley Clark, also raising funds over the Internet; on Sen. John Edwards&#146; ability to expand beyond his trial lawyer base; and on Sen. Joe Lieberman&#146;s typically high spending rate, among other factors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;With this new arrangement, CRP and NBC News are uniquely positioned to track money and its essential role in the political process,&#148; said Mark Lukasiewicz, executive producer of NBC&#146;s &#147;Decision 2004&#148; coverage. &#147;The viewer cannot understand what is happening in this election without understanding where the money comes from and where it ends up.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRP, which provides analysis of campaign contributions and their impact on federal elections and public policy to a wide variety of media, says its arrangement with NBC News will provide the network&#146;s journalists with on-demand targeted research and database analysis on a priority basis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Said Larry Noble, CRP&#146;s executive director and former general counsel to the Federal Election Commission, &#147;As the nation&#146;s premier non-partisan resource for money-in-politics data and analysis, CRP is delighted to be working with NBC News to give the public the latest campaign finance figures, trends and analysis leading up to the 2004 elections.&#148;</font></p>
