- December 9 - A burst of grassroots activism, the Senate&#146;s most senior senator and a humorous Santa Claus TV ad seemed likely in combination today to stop &#150; at least for now &#150; a sneaky effort by George W. Bush and his Republican congressional allies to wipe out federal overtime pay protections for millions of American workers.</FONT><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The MoveOn.org Voter Fund began airing nationally on Tuesday a television ad protesting the &#147;early Christmas gifts&#148; to corporate friends and supporters of the Bush campaign in the $820 billion omnibus appropriations bill that passed the House of Representatives yesterday.  The ad is running extensively on cable news stations, throughout the week, featuring a clever Santa Claus figure who morphs into George W. Bush as an announcer says solemnly:  &#147;Yes, big contributors, there is a Santa Claus.  But he&#146;s not at the North Pole.  He&#146;s in the White House!&#148;</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For a direct link to the ad, click on <A HREF="http://www.moveonvoterfund.org" TARGET="_new">www.moveonvoterfund.org</A>.

At the same time more than 1,200 MoveOn.org volunteer PR representatives were reaching out to local newspapers and news stations in more than 100 cities around the country, pointing to these inequities in the bill supported by the White House and GOP leaders:</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;        OVERTIME PAY&#151;A prohibition that Congress earlier approved on regulatory changes at the Labor Department to strip away overtime pay protection for as many as eight million workers was left out of the bill.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&middot;        MEDIA EMPIRES&#151;A similar restriction approved by Congress earlier to stop FCC Chairman Michael Powell from taking limits off the number of broadcast outlets a media company can own also would be erased.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee and the senior senator, Robert W. Byrd (D-WV), refused to allow the legislation to go forward on a unanimous consent motion, and too few senators were in town to enable the Senate leadership to prevail in a vote.  Thus the issue was likely to slide into late January.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MoveOn.org members throughout the country gathered more than 200,000 petition signatures in less than a week, called hundreds of congressional offices and launched a first-time grassroots PR offensive to generate opposition to passage of the omnibus bill.  Union members and others, including some conservative Republican groups, also were active in opposing the bill.</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;This was a rehearsal for what we expect will be an ongoing battle in the coming election year to stop George W. Bush and his congressional allies from giving away the store to political contributors and supporters,&#148; said Zack Exley, organizing director for MoveOn.org and the Voter Fund.  </FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;These terrible provisions were added to what should have been a routine continuing resolution at the last minute, by top Republican leaders in Congress&#151;423 pages of legislative code and gobbledygook.  Our 2 million members and other Americans were alerted by the ads and Internet communications and the result has been an appropriate delay,&#148; he said</FONT></P><P> </P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The MoveOn.org Voter Fund Is a Section 527 political issues committee affiliated with the online organizing project MoveOn.org.</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
