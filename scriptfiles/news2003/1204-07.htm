<td valign="top" align="left" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">RESTON, VA - December 4 - As World AIDS Day 2003 events conclude, the American Medical Student Association (AMSA), the nation's largest, independent medical student organization stresses the need for continued action in the fight against Global AIDS and urges all presidential candidates to address the growing epidemic in their platforms.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">HIV/AIDS has infected 42 million, killed 25 million and orphaned 14 million children, and the number infected increases by two every 30 seconds. America must keep its promise for funding of prevention and treatment of global HIV/AIDS. Presidential candidates should pledge to &quot;donate the dollars and treat the people.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To commemorate World AIDS Day 2003, the World Health Organization and UNAIDS unveiled an action plan to reach the 3 by 5 target of providing antiretroviral treatment to three million people living with AIDS by the end of 2005. This is a vital step towards the ultimate goal of providing universal access to AIDS treatment to all those who need it, and it is essential that the future leader of the United States support this ambitious goal by appropriately funding the Global Fund and supporting production and importation of generic medications through fair trade policies.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;AIDS is the crisis of our generation. The next leader of the free world must be ready to enact aggressive policies to end this pandemic,&quot; says Lauren Oshman, M.D., M.P.H., AMSA National President. &quot;President Bush has only provided unfounded mandates while blocking access to generic medications with strict trade policies that only maximize big pharmaceutical company profits. Seven out of the nine democratic candidates have already announced stronger AIDS policies than the current administration. It is vital that these promises be kept.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For more information on the presidential candidates, and actions surrounding Election 2004, visit <A HREF="http://www.healthgap.org" TARGET="_new">www.healthgap.org</A>.
