                - March 5 - Families USA prepared a report for Cover the Uninsured 

                Week (CTUW) that was released today by The Robert Wood Johnson 

                Foundation as part of the kickoff for CTUW. The Families USA report, 

                based on Census Bureau data, found that 74.7 million Americans 

                under 65 years of age - almost one out of three (30.1 percent) 

                - were uninsured at some point during 2001-2002. Almost two-thirds 

                (65 percent) of these uninsured people were without health coverage 

                for at least six months, and nearly one-quarter (24 percent) were 

                uninsured throughout the two-year period. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following 

                is the statement of Ron Pollack, executive director of Families 

                USA, concerning the report: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The findings 

                in this report should represent a sea change in the way we think 

                about the uninsured. Now that almost one out of three non-elderly 

                Americans experienced significant periods without health insurance, 

                the uninsured problem is no longer simply an issue of altruism 

                about other people, but it is also one of self-interest for us 

                all. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As the 75 

                million who were uninsured over the past two years reflect, working 

                families are increasingly at risk of becoming uninsured - whether 

                due to a pink slip from a job, unaffordable cost increases, or 

                cutbacks in employer and public health coverage. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With large 

                and growing portions of the U.S. population becoming uninsured, 

                we are moving towards a political tipping point that will require 

                real and meaningful action to expand health coverage." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report
