- June 6 - The regional environmental organization, the Caribbean Conservation Association (CCA), recently entered into a partnership agreement with the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW, <a href="http://www.ifaw.org" target="_new">http://www.ifaw.org</a>) to initiate a program aimed at the protection and conservation of marine habitats and marine life across the Caribbean region. An important focus of the partnership surrounds joint efforts to protect coastal and marine habitats in the region and to promote eco-tourism development and other sustainable livelihood opportunities.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Secretariat of the Caribbean Conservation Association, at the Association's 36th Annual General Meeting in Trinidad last year, was charged by its members to promote the benefits of non-whaling activities in the Caribbean and in other regions of the globe. The project is therefore envisaged, inter alia, as an informational counterbalance to the bombardment of Caribbean states with information and campaigns which actively seek to justify regional and international whaling activities.

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leading this call for the "balancing" of the available information was the Antigua-based Environmental Awareness Group (EAG), supported by the St. Lucia Animal Protection Society. Carole McCauley, Interim Executive Director of the EAG, in a request to the CCA stated, "I don't feel, at least from an Antigua perspective, that there has been enough awareness work on the issue... The EAG does not have the resources to launch a media campaign ... with flashy TV and radio commercials, glossy and full-color teacher resources, etc. And though we could theoretically launch a project of our own to raise funds to do this ourselves, it makes better sense for a regional organization to carry this on behalf of the numerous regional stakeholders and nations involved. National organizations will certainly participate in the implementation of such a project."

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is expected that the collaboration will benefit all CCA members and encourage the pursuance of other sustainable livelihood opportunities such as eco-tourism. Non-governmental organizations worldwide will also benefit from access to promotional materials, resulting from the program.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Executive Director of the CCA, Dr. Joth Singh regards the partnership as an important step in contributing to sustainable development and protection of the region's marine life. "IFAW has tremendous experience in tackling exploitive approaches to marine and coastal habitats as well as a large database on issues related to whaling. The region has lacked a well-focused effort to provide a balance to the somewhat one-sided position being promoted in support of commercial whaling. We are looking to IFAW to assist us in filling this gap. The CCA's aim in this regard is to ensure that Caribbean peoples fully understand the implications of adopting a pro-whaling position as well to be aware of the opportunities, which the region may be better placed to pursue, for example, generating revenue from whale watching activities. Accessing IFAW's extensive information base and expertise are key benefits to the CCA from this partnership. This program is consistent with the CCA's mandate which is to enhance the quality of life for Caribbean peoples by advocating for the development and implementation of policies, programmes and practices which contribute to sustainable management of the region's natural and cultural resources."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFAW's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Fred O'Regan called the partnership a very positive step in IFAW's continued commitment to the Caribbean. "IFAW is honored to be partnering with CCA on issues of shared concern. We have been active in the Caribbean since 1991. Our work combines scientific research, habitat protection and support for ecotourism and other projects benefiting local people and communities. We have also worked with national governments and local groups across the region to promote awareness of the unique animal species and habitats of the Caribbean. We have initiated floating classroom educational programs, helped develop marine mammal stranding protocols, conducted whale watching workshops, educated local residents about the marine environment, and worked closely with university students and Fisheries officials across the region. We are delighted to be expanding this work and to be joining CCA in a renewed effort to improve public awareness of threats to the fragile marine environment and what we can all do to help protect the beautiful marine resource on which all of us depend."

They seek to motivate the public, to prevent cruelty to animals and to promote animal welfare for conservation policies that advance the well-being of both animals and people. As one of the largest international animal welfare organizations in the world, IFAW has offices in 15 countries.
