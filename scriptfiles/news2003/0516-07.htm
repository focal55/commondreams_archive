- May 16 - Democracy Now!, the national listener-sponsored public radio and television show  announced today that its award-winning War and Peace Report has been picked up by over 20 new radio and television outlets nationwide, with stations in Canada, Europe and Australia, reflecting the public&#146;s increasing desire for alternative views on the large issues facing the world today. The recent additions bring the total number of stations airing Democracy Now! to over 140. The announcement coincides with the launch of a web site, <a href="http://www.democracynow.org" target="_new">www.democracynow.org</a>, providing state-of-the-art news access for visitors using open source software.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Our growth reflects both the depth of the public&#146;s desire for alternative perspectives on the news and their distrust of the corporate-run media,&#148; said the Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman.  &#147;Americans realize that they need more information than they are getting from the corporate-controlled media and Pentagon-approved embedded journalists.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democracy Now!&#146;s War and Peace Report doubled in length to two hours daily as demand for alternative news sources soared during the early days of &#147;Operation Iraqi Freedom&#148;.  The additional hour is carried in almost every city in which the program airs.  According to Goodman, the response has been extraordinary:  &#147;Community radio stations, NPR affiliates and cable access television stations from around the country are airing the show, and listeners and viewers are thankful.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Along with the new web site, the Democracy Now! studio was redesigned by award-winning designer Mark Friedberg, known for such films as Identity, Far From Heaven and The Ice Storm.  Actor and activist Tim Robbins advised on the lighting and camera shots.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democracy Now! is a national, listener-sponsored public radio and TV show, pioneering the largest community media collaboration in the U.S.. The show airs Monday-Friday on over 140 stations including Pacifica radio stations and affiliates, NPR stations, public access TV stations, Free Speech TV (DishNetwork Channel 9415), Shortwave Radio (Radio for Peace International), and with both audio and video streaming over the internet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the new stations that carry Democracy Now! are NPR affiliates WSQX in Binghamton, New York, KUSP in Santa Cruz, California, KRCB in Sonoma, California and KDHX in St. Louis, Missouri.  The show continues to be picked up by community stations like KOTO in Telluride, Colorado and WMPG in Portland, Maine.  New public access television stations to pick up the show include KDOL in Oakland, California, Channel 5 in Baltimore, Maryland DHTV Channel 21 in St. Louis and Harpswell Community TV in Maine.
