<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OAKLAND/SAN FRANCISCO, CA - June 19 - As the Bush administration pushes genetically engineered (GE) crops on the Third World at a ministerial conference in Sacramento next week, a new report collecting the views and comments of leading Third World farmers and activists comprehensively refutes the value of GE food, arguing instead for improved access to food and local food sovereignty. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Voices From the South</i>, released by Food First/Institute for Food and Development Policy and Pesticide Action Network, states that development of GE crops has not centered on feeding people but on securing markets for the world's largest agrochemical/biotech companies. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Genetically engineered crops are instruments of industrialized agriculture,&quot; said Silvia Ribeiro of the ETC Group and one of the authors of the report. &quot;They benefit the richest people in the world, not the hungriest. GE crops are designed to take control of production of food away from local communities, by creating greater dependence on huge agribusiness corporations for seed and pesticides.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Listing six myths about GE crops regularly espoused by corporations, Voices from the South responds to each myth with analysis of people from the global south. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;You can break down these myths into three basic components: Greenwashing, poorwashing, and hopedashing,&quot; said Anuradha Mittal of Food First. &quot;Greenwashing suggests that biotech will create a world free of pesticides; Poor washing would have us believe that we must accept genetically engineered crops if we are to feed the poor in the Third World; and hopedashing claims there are no alternatives. But in our report, this rhetoric is comprehensively punctured by the very people GE crops are supposed to benefit. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What farmers in the developing world need are policies that give farming communities control over their own resources and build on local ecological knowledge,&quot; states Timothy Byakola, PAN Uganda, &quot;not another technological quick fix.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report notes that there is already enough food to feed the world one and a half times over, and that genetically engineered crops have already caused economic and ecological problems where they have been grown. Hunger in the world today is not caused by a lack of food, but rather by poverty and inequality. The report argues that the poor and hungry of the developing world need economic and social policies that emanate from people themselves, rather than policies that are imposed externally, authored by unaccountable corporations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Edited by Ellen Hickey of Pesticide Action Network and Anuradha Mittal, of Food First, the report includes articles by Chee Yoke Ling (Malaysia), Timothy Byakola (Uganda), Silvia Ribeiro (Mexico), Raphael Mariano (The Philippines) Farida Akhter (Bangladesh), Vandana Shiva (India), Tewolde Behran Gebre Egzhiaber (Ethiopia), Maria Luisa Ramos (Bolivia), Bernadette Lubozhya (Zambia), among others. </font></p>
