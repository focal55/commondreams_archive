- October 30 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, issued the following statement on President Bush's trip to Ohio today:</font>
<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Once again today, the President will visit Ohio to fill his campaign coffers and promote his failed economic policies. Unfortunately, the President's political stump speech and fundraising will do nothing to help the over 338,000 Ohioans currently out of work. </font></p>
<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President's economic policies have failed Ohio, and the nation. Ohio has lost 220,700 jobs since President Bush has taken office, including 151,800 from the manufacturing sector.  Under this President, and his economic stewardship, Ohio's unemployment rate has jumped from 3.9% to 5.8%.</font></p>
<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President's one-size-fits-all economic solution of tax cuts to the wealthy is a proven failure in Ohio. Under the President's latest tax cut the first 60% of Ohio taxpayers will see a cut of only $380 in total over the next four years. But, the richest 1% of Ohioans will be rewarded with tax cuts of $52,240 on average over the same period of time. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President's economic strategy of 'leave-no-billionaire-behind' tax cuts combined with the sticking the American taxpayers with the over $150 billion dollar price tag for his unjustified war against Iraq will make it impossible for our economy to recover.  Already, this Administration's policies has led to cuts in spending on important domestic needs such as education, health care, veterans benefits, child care and led to sky high state budget deficits. Ohio, alone, is facing a projected state budget deficit of $2 billion in FY '04.</font></p>
<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Due to state budget cuts, a result of the faltering national economy, the Cleveland Municipal School District will lose $25.5 million annually. And, statewide Governor Taft has ordered $100 million in cuts to state spending in education. We can, and must, do more to provide opportunities for our children.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In addition, I hope that his tour of the state will include the empty factories and bankrupt corporations that are the legacy of his Administration's economic policies. Ohio's manufacturing base, like many states, has been decimated by NAFTA. Yet, with record job losses and a failing economy this Administration wants to expand NAFTA. It is clear that such a policy would only further harm Ohio's economy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mr. President, Ohio needs more than a politically expedient trip. We need jobs. Ohio, and our nation, deserve better than the economic policies your Administration has provided. To stimulate our economy takes more than tax cuts to the wealthy. It requires federal spending, progressive tax cuts to people who need the money now, and real efforts to create new high paying jobs.&quot;</font></p>
