                - March 3 - The American Civil Liberties Union today hailed passage 

                of the 50th city council resolution protesting the Bush Administration's 

                continuing disregard for civil liberties. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today's milestone 

                demonstrates that this backlash is not an isolated movement," 

                said Laura W. Murphy, Director of the ACLU Washington National 

                Office. "Millions of Americans, from the Heartland to the coasts, 

                from Alaska to Florida, now live in communities that have through 

                these resolutions voiced their insistence that American society 

                can be both safe and free." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The city of 

                Cotati in Sonoma County, California this week unanimously adopted 

                a resolution making it the 50th community to organize in support 

                of civil liberties since 9/11. The movement to pass these resolutions 

                and city ordinances, several of which seek to limit the implementation 

                of repressive federal policies, has been gaining momentum over 

                the past several months. With today's resolution, the number of 

                Americans living in communities that have passed such measures 

                stands now at approximately 5.5 million people. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Significantly, 

                support for the resolutions has not been isolated to smaller municipalities 

                nor has it been limited to communities generally considered liberal 

                or libertarian. Over the past several months, major cities and 

                communities such as Seattle, Detroit, Denver, San Francisco, Burlington, 

                VT, and Flagstaff, AZ have passed resolutions. Likewise, resolutions 

                have passed in communities as politically diverse as Fairbanks, 

                AK, Carrboro, NC and Northhampton, MA. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several of 

                the resolutions contain strong limitations on cooperation with 

                controversial government policies, most notably the USA PATRIOT 

                Act. Common provisions require city officials not to spy on constitutionally 

                protected political and religious activities, to prohibit profiling 

                based on race, ethnicity or religious beliefs and to limit local 

                police from participating in the enforcement of federal immigration 

                laws. Particularly strong are the Madison, Detroit and Fairbanks 

                ordinances. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is 

                  democratic participation at its best and most effective," Murphy 

                  said. "Millions of Americans are rightly concerned about an 

                  Administration that enforces our laws selectively based on race, 

                  ethnicity or religion; that has established a parallel system 

                  of quasi-military arrest and detention that's used to lock people 

                  up when we don't have evidence to put them through civilian 

                  courts, and that has no reticence about spying on innocent Americans 

                  who are not suspected of being involved in any criminal activity."</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
