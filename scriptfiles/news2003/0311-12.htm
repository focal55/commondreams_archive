                - March 11 - The U.S. Justice Department and the Environmental 

                Protection Agency today announced a comprehensive Clean Air Act 

                settlement with Lion Oil Company to reduce harmful air emissions 

                from the company's El Dorado, Ark., refinery by 1,380 tons per 

                year. The State of Arkansas is joining in the settlement. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The agreement 

                will address air pollutants -- nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide 

                and particulate emissions -- that can cause serious respiratory 

                problems and exacerbate cases of childhood asthma, as well as 

                carbon monoxide, which can be harmful to the cardiovascular system. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The settlement 

                calls for Lion Oil to spend more than $21.5 million to install 

                state-of-the-art pollution control technology to significantly 

                reduce emissions from a catalytic cracking unit (its largest emissions 

                unit), heaters, boilers, wastewater vents, flares, and leaking 

                valves throughout its refinery. With this settlement, the company 

                will continue its operations and continue meeting the public's 

                demand for fuel and increased production capacity. Lion Oil also 

                will pay a $348,000 civil penalty, which the State of Arkansas 

                will share, and spend more than $450,000 on supplemental environmental 

                projects designed to reduce emissions from the refinery. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This settlement 

                is a win for cleaner air, the public, and other members of the 

                oil refining industry who have already settled with the government," 

                said Assistant Attorney General Thomas L. Sansonetti. "It illustrates 

                our commitment to level the corporate playing field by assuring 

                that those members of the refining industry who voluntarily agreed 

                to install improved controls and meet stringent compliance standards 

                will not suffer a competitive disadvantage. We expect other companies 

                to follow suit." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This settlement 

                signals our resolve to ensure that petroleum refineries across 

                this nation comply with the Clean Air Act," said John Peter Suarez, 

                EPA's Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. 

                "We are continuing to make significant strides with our state 

                partners to address air pollution problems across the refining 

                industry. The environment and public health will benefit greatly 

                from this agreement." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the settlement, 

                Lion Oil will cut air emissions by using innovative control technologies, 

                incorporating improved leak detection and repair practices, and 

                making other emission control upgrades at the El Dorado refinery. 

                Currently the refinery has a processing capacity of more than 

                58,000 barrels of oil per day. These improvements will reduce 

                annual emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) by approximately 530 

                tons, sulfur dioxide (SO2) by approximately 650 tons, particulate 

                matter (PM) by approximately 200 tons, and significantly reduce 

                carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from process units at the El Dorado 

                refinery. "This settlement will result in substantially reduced 

                air pollution from the El Dorado refinery and deter other companies 

                from violating the Clean Air Act in the State of Arkansas," said 

                Tom Gean, the United States Attorney for the Western District 

                of Arkansas. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This settlement 

                is the latest global agreement reached under this Administration's 

                efforts to assure the petroleum refining industry's compliance 

                with major provisions of the Clean Air Act. During the past few 

                years, petroleum refiners, like Lion Oil, have voluntarily entered 

                into global discussions with the United States. Those companies 

                include Koch Petroleum, BP Exploration and Oil, Motiva Enterprises, 

                Equilon Enterprises LLC, Deer Park Refining Limited Partnership, 

                Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, Conoco, and Navajo Refining. Together 

                these settlements provide for a comprehensive and cooperative 

                approach to addressing environmental problems across the industry. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The settlement 

                will be lodged with the U.S. District Court in Fort Smith, Ark., 

                for 30 days to allow for public comment.
