<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - September 12 - The Assembly of States Parties to 

the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) this 

morning elected a high-profile Board of Directors to the Victims 

Trust Fund of the court, who are charged with the disbursement of 

funds to victims of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 

The members of the Board, who represent the five UN regional groups, 

are: from Africa, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, former Chairman of the 

Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa; from Asia, Her 

Majesty Queen Rania of Jordan; from Eastern Europe, His Excellency 

Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, former Prime Minister of Poland; from Latin 

America, His Excellency Mr. President Oscar Arias S&aacute;nchez, former 

President of Costa Rica; and, from the Western European and Others 

Group, Madame Simone Veil, former Minister of Health of France and 

former President of the European Parliament.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The world renowned stature and integrity of these individuals will 

do much to bring public attention to the need for support of the role 

of victims in the international justice process,&quot; said Dr. Yael 

Danieli, Senior Representative to the UN of the International Society 

for Traumatic Stress Studies. &quot;These individuals will lend prominence 

to the court as a whole, like a jewel in the crown of justice,&quot; she 

added. The Board of Directors will serve a three-year term, during 

which they will be responsible for setting up the structure and 

management criteria for the effective operation of the Trust Fund.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ICC recognizes the role of victims by enabling victims and their 

families to apply for compensation for the crimes defined in the Rome 

Statute. Victims' participation in the ICC is amplified by the 

historically unprecedented ability of victims groups and civil 

society actors to submit communications directly to the Office of the 

Prosecutor for review.  The ICC prosecutor may initiate a proprio 

motu investigation based on these communications.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the opening plenary of the Assembly of States Parties meeting this 

week, Prosecutor Moreno-Ocampo indicated that he was ready to use 

this proprio motu power to seek authorization from a Pre-Trial 

chamber of judges to commence an investigation of alleged crimes 

committed in the Ituri region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. 

Reports by UN agencies and communications received by the Office of 

the Prosecutor from civil society groups indicate that at least 5,000 

people have been killed there since the Rome Statute's July 1, 2002 

entry into force.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Assembly of States Parties also elected a Deputy Prosecutor for 

Investigations, Mr. Serge Brammertz of Belgium. He will undertake a 

solemn oath on November 3, 2003 and begin a six-year term of office 

at the court's headquarters in The Hague.</font></p>
