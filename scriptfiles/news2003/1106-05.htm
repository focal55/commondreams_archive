- November 6 -  Today, as the President signs into law the latest installment for our involvement in Iraq, Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), a leader in the House of Representatives in opposition to the war against Iraq and the current US occupation, issued the following statement:</font>
<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today, with the President's signature on the latest installment of $87 billion for our involvement in Iraq the total price tag for taxpayers, to support the President's failed policy in Iraq, is over $150 billion. That is $150 billion dollars that will not go to help our struggling economy, crumbling schools, or broken health care system.</font></p>
<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By pursuing a unilateral preemptive attack against a country that posed no threat to our national security, the President has squandered the goodwill shinned on our country after 9/11. Now today, with the United States bogged down in a quagmire, with almost daily US casualties, the President is sticking the US taxpayers with the bill for his failed policy. </font></p>
<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The occupation of Iraq is not only a fiscal drain on our nation. At a time when our resources should be used to root out terrorism the ill-advised occupation of Iraq is draining our Armed Forces. Today, the Administration, which has already spread our Armed Forces thin, is calling on 43,000 National Guard troops for service in Iraq. The calling up of National Guard troops for year-long rotations of service in Iraq is yet another example of the failure of this Administration to plan for post-war Iraq. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The answer to the crisis in Iraq is not more money and more US troops. We need to acknowledge that the continued U.S. presence in Iraq is counterproductive.  Every day that we are inside Iraq the situation gets progressively worse as evidenced by the frequent and more sophisticated attacks on our troops.  More US troops have died occupying Iraq than died in the war for Iraq. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We must end the occupation of Iraq. Our presence in Iraq is helping to create instability. It is time to begin the process of getting the UN in and the US out.&quot;</font></p>
