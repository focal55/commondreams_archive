                YORK - April 7 - As North Carolina physicians gear up for an April 

                8 statehouse rally in the face of skyrocketing medical malpractice 

                insurance costs for some specialties, Americans for Insurance 

                Reform (AIR), announced today the release of a comprehensive new 

                study of medical malpractice insurance in North Carolina. The 

                study, based on the insurance industry's own figures, shows that 

                the causes of and solutions to this crisis lie not with the legal 

                system (i.e., capping damages) but with the business practices 

                of the insurance industry. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study by 

                AIR, a coalition of over 100 consumer and public interest groups 

                representing more than 50 million people, makes nearly identical 

                findings to those reached in a similar AIR study of national trends 

                released in October 2001. Specifically, the study, Stable Losses/Unstable 

                Rates in North Carolina, shows that North Carolina’s insurance 

                crisis has not been caused by the legal system or jury verdicts. 

                Rather, it is a self-inflicted phenomenon caused by the mismanaged 

                underwriting practices of the insurance industry. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stable Losses/Unstable 

                Rates in North Carolina makes two specific findings: First, over 

                the last 18 years, medical malpractice payouts, included all jury 

                verdicts and settlements, have approximately tracked rates of 

                medical inflation. Second, over the last 30 years, insurance premiums 

                have not tracked payouts at all but instead directly followed 

                the ups and downs of the economy. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the economy 

                is strong and the insurance industry’s investments are gaining, 

                medical malpractice rates have decreased. On the other hand, when 

                the economy is weak, as it has been since the second half of 2000, 

                the insurance industry’s investment loses precipitate sudden medical 

                insurance rate increases. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These findings 

                suggest that the real reason medical malpractice insurance rates 

                have fluctuated so dramatically in North Carolina is market forces 

                - not, as the insurance industry claims, because of a sudden massive 

                increase in medical malpractice jury awards or payouts, which, 

                in constant dollars, have been decreasing for the last decade. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“These data 

                together constitute a ‘smoking gun,’ which should, once and for 

                all end the debate about the cause of the current medical malpractice 

                crisis for some North Carolina doctors,” said the author of the 

                study, J. Robert Hunter, Director of Insurance for the Consumer 

                Federation of America, former Texas Insurance Commissioner and 

                AIR co-founder. “Insurers, whose own investment actions have made 

                insurance unaffordable and unavailable, are blaming others for 

                their own mismanagement by manufacturing a crisis for surgeons 

                and other doctors that simply should not exist. By increasing 

                rates, insurers are forcing hospitals, doctors, and ultimately 

                patients, to suffer for their poor business and investment decisions.” 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hunter said, 

                “There is only one way to solve this problem: reforming the business 

                and accounting practices of the insurance industry. State regulators 

                must enforce and state lawmakers must strengthen state insurance 

                laws in order to end the boom and bust swing from illegal overpricing, 

                such as the rates doctors are being asked to pay today, to illegal 

                and inadequate underpricing, which will be seen when the market 

                softens too much later in the cycle.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joanne Doroshow, 

                Executive Director of the Center for Justice & Democracy and AIR 

                co-founder, said “For far too long, the insurance industry has 

                been engaged in a pricing scheme designed to gouge the American 

                people based on a premise that lacks any basis in fact. Moreover, 

                the insurance industry has been lobbying state legislatures around 

                the country and Congress to limit a consumer’s legal rights by 

                publicly putting out wrong and misleading information. While insurance 

                companies are blaming high rates on the increase in claims by 

                patients, rising verdicts and exploding tort system costs, in 

                reality, it is the insurance industry’s efforts to make up for 

                their economy-driven, market-based investment losses that are 

                the cause. There needs to be a serious investigation into the 

                kinds of shenanigans the insurance industry has been engaging 

                in when it comes to medical malpractice.” </font>
