- May 1 - The following statement 

will be delivered today by Reverend Rigby, pastor of St. 

Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Austin, Texas, on behalf of the 

Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On behalf of the national Religious Coalition for 

Reproductive Choice and its Texas affiliate, I applaud the 

Senators who this morning voted against cloture on the 

nomination of Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court of 

Appeals. To these Senators, I say thank you for standing up for 

women's constitutional rights and against the Bush court-packing 

scheme. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have come to Washington today from Texas -- a part of the 

country that will be most affected by Justice Owen's 

confirmation. I wish to speak on behalf of people of faith who 

believe that women have not only the right but also the 

responsibility to make their own reproductive choices. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Priscilla Owen's record on the Texas Supreme Court 

demonstrates that she is a judicial activist who has no 

hesitation about imposing her own harsh and rigid beliefs about 

abortion rights on others. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Her opinions regarding judicial bypass for minors seeking 

abortion in the series of Jane Doe cases are particularly 

chilling to me as a person of faith. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Jane Doe 1 case, Justice Owen questioned whether Doe, 

a college-bound senior who was pregnant and had received 

information about her options from friends, family, a parenting 

teacher, and Planned Parenthood, was aware of the religious 

implications of abortion, despite the fact that the law in no 

way involves religious considerations. Justice Owen wrote: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I would require a minor to indicate to the court that she is 

aware of and has considered that there are philosophic, social, 

moral and religious arguments that can be brought to bear when 

considering abortion." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Justice Owen's opinion was cruel to the minor girl and 

insensitive and callous to differing beliefs and values. Her 

opinion went far beyond the Texas statute and the intent of the 

legislature. She disregarded not only the law but also the 

conscience of a minor girl who looked to the court to protect 

and safeguard her rights. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is offensive to me, as a minister who trusts women to make 

moral decisions such as whether to terminate a pregnancy, that 

this statement presumes religious considerations would always be 

against abortion. In fact, many religions believe the opposite 

-- that abortion may be the most responsible, most moral 

decision in some cases. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Justice Owen's writings show lack of awareness about beliefs 

other than her own, a clear problem in a judicial system that 

serves people of all faiths and backgrounds. As Jane Doe 1 

shows, Justice Owen would place her ideology regarding 

reproductive rights over the law. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That is tyranny, not justice. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I implore the Senate to continue to use whatever means the 

Constitution allows to block this nominee, whose record shows 

she will deprive women of the right of conscience over their 

personal decisions. 

</font>
