- November 12 - <i>Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families USA, released the following statement today about the status of the House-Senate Conference Committee's deliberations on Medicare prescription drug legislation:</i>
    </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;While recent public attention about pending Medicare legislation has understandably focused on several key issues - such as the premium support proposal and possible caps in Medicare spending - significant and harmful decisions are being made concerning prescription drug coverage for America's poorest seniors.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;These decisions are noteworthy because they undermine the single most beneficial feature of pending Medicare legislation: the provision of much-needed prescription drug assistance for the people who can least afford their medicines.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Tentative decisions by the House-Senate Conference Committee would cause enormous problems for millions of low-income seniors. Those tentative decisions include:</font></p>
</font>
<ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Prohibiting the poorest of the poor - those who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid - from receiving Medicaid 'wrap-around' help with their Medicare drug co-payments. This may cause as many as 6 million of the lowest-income Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for their drugs than they do today.</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot; Contrary to the Senate bill, the conferees intend to disqualify low-income seniors from receiving much-needed drug subsidies if they have a small amount of assets. The Conference Committee's assets test would disqualify approximately 2.8 million poor seniors from the subsidies they need to make medicines affordable.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot; Contrary to the Senate bill, the Conference Committee will force low-income seniors to enroll for drug subsidies in state welfare offices, not in Social Security offices. This will result in a more complicated process and prevent many from getting the subsidies they need. </font>
    </ul>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot; As the conferees dole out huge subsidies for HMOs, PPOs, and drug companies, Congress should make sure that the people who need help the most actually receive it.&quot;
</li>
    </ul>
