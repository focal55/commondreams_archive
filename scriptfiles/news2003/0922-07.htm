- September 22 - Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), the nation's oldest independent liberal political organization, demands that President George W. Bush take a fresh approach vis a vis Iraq. First, the President must tell the whole truth about Iraq. Second, he must embrace an international approach to the war on terrorism with the full participation of the United Nations. Finally, the President must remove the two who helped to shape this Administration's misguided, ill-advised policy in Iraq; Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By repeatedly misrepresenting the facts about Iraq, the Bush Administration has put the United States in a dangerous situation. Our once fervent allies now distrust our motives and are reluctant to engage human and financial resources in a costly endeavor that most disapproved in any case.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A full apology and humble interaction with the international community is the most appropriate way that the United States can stabilize Iraq and move forward with the genuine business of neutralizing international terrorism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, the Administration must present a significant level of accountability for actions taken and taxpayer funds used. The current and ever-growing cost of the war is sinking our budget into greater and greater deficits. Billions of dollars are being spent with little to no accountability. Echoing the sentiments expressed recently by Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA), ADA National Director Amy Isaacs stressed, &quot;Billions of dollars should not be freely spent in Iraq without disclosure and accountability from the Bush Administration.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, the most important progress can be achieved by changing the face of our military leadership. Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz repeatedly have hindered the United States by their arrogant handling of relations with foreign leaders. Their collective words and actions have served only to enflame an already volatile situation. It is, therefore, imperative that President Bush fire Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Wolfowitz who have ill-served him, the nation, the Iraqis and the world. By doing so and hiring experienced yet diplomatic replacements, the United States can begin to regain its place in the world's esteem.</font></p>
