-  

May 27 - The Low Impact Hydropower Institute (LIHI) Governing Board, voted unanimously today to hire Fred Ayer, Portland, Maine as LIHI's new Executive Director.  Lydia Grimm, the former Executive Director, has left to join the legal office of the Bonneville Power Administration.  Mr. Ayer will begin his tenure June 2, 2003.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LIHI is the only public program to certify hydropower projects that exceed regulatory requirements for protection of environmental quality.   The certification provides market benefits to the project owners, in states where electricity consumers may choose their electricity suppliers or products.  The program has now certified five projects in Connecticut, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and Idaho.   

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prior to joining LIHI as its Executive Director, Mr. Ayer has been involved with hydropower projects  for over twenty-five years.  He has worked on over 75 hydro regulatory projects as both a consultant and employee of licensees.    

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Highlights of his work as a consultant include: assisting the Avista Corporation (Spokane, WA) in the successful collaborative relicensing of its 790 Mw Noxon Rapids and Cabinet Gorge Projects on the Clark Fork River in Montana and Idaho; advising the Catawba-Wateree Relicensing Coalition in North and South Carolina in connection with their participation in an upcoming relicensing; and leading training sessions for US Forest Service and National Park Service officials on FERC relicensing.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other training-related activity includes speaking at FERC Outreach Sessions for Alternative Licensing Processes in nine states, presenting workshops on collaborative processes at the National Conservation Training Center's Hydropower Workshops in three states, lecturing regularly at a dam removal course offered by University of Wisconsin, and chairing an international panel at a 2001 hydropower conference in Prague, Czech Republic. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 1983 through 1990 he served as Director of Environmental Affairs at the Bangor Hydro-Electric Company, where he was instrumental in developing the relicensing strategy for the 13 Mw West Enfield Project that included the removal of a dam in one river as mitigation for impacts on another. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are delighted that  Fred will be the new  Executive Director of LIHI," said Richard Roos-Collins, chair of LIHI's Governing Board. "He has extensive knowledge of the hydropower industry as well as the entrepreneurial experience necessary to move our certification program forward, so that it becomes truly national in scale.   We are grateful to Ms. Grimm for her outstanding and pioneering work as our first Executive Director."   

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The LIHI office will relocate from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine in June.  

</font>
