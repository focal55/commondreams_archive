- July 25 - After weeks of behind-the-scenes wrangling, the U.S. House of Representatives today approved a bill that would radically change the way Head Start programs are administrated and allow for religiously based job bias.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By a 217-216 vote in the early morning hours of July 25, the House passed H.R.2210 after rejecting an attempt to remove a controversial provision that permits religious groups operating Head Start centers to hire people based on their religion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House bill, dubbed the &#147;School Readiness Act of 2003,&#148; would allow religious groups that run Head Start programs to reject job applicants who fail to meet religious criteria and to fire staff members who do not conform to religious doctrine or conduct.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Rev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, deplored the House&#146;s action.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The House has just passed a terribly flawed bill,&#148; said Lynn. &#147;There is no justification for allowing employment discrimination in federally funded programs. This advances the Bush administration&#146;s &#145;faith-based&#146; initiative at the expense of civil rights and civil liberties.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Religious leaders from a broad array of faith communities have expressed opposition to publicly funded religious discrimination,&#148; added Lynn. &#147;Representatives of President Bush&#146;s own Methodist denomination have come out against this. We must not allow Congress to roll back our constitutional protections.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-Calif.) offered an amendment to strip the hiring discrimination provision from the &#147;School Readiness Act.&#148; But that amendment was defeated by a 231-199 vote before the House went on to approve the bill.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AU&#146;s Lynn urged the Senate to defeat the House&#146;s proposed changes to Head Start, which is designed to provide poor families with education and health-care assistance for their youngsters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We hope the Senate defeats this ill-conceived change to Head Start,&#148; Lynn said. </font></p>
