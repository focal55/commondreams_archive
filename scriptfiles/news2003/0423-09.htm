<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - April 23 - An innovative 

framework to provide automatic, affordable health insurance to 

nearly all Americans is outlined today in a Web-published Health 

Affairs article by health policy experts Karen Davis and Cathy 

Schoen of The Commonwealth Fund. The article, "Creating Consensus 

on Coverage Choices," would build on existing sources of public and 

private health coverage by combining tax credits for private 

insurance, public program expansions, and a new mechanism to make 

enrollment more automatic. The article also provides a roadmap for 

a phased-in series of steps to achieve affordable and automatic 

coverage for all Americans over time. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The framework presented by Davis and Schoen seeks to bridge 

differences between those policy strategies that rely on tax 

credits to increase private insurance coverage and those strategies 

that would increase health coverage through public program 

expansions. An estimated 39 million of the 42 million Americans who 

are uninsured would gain coverage, increasing total national health 

expenditures by a modest 3 percent. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We know what works in the current system, so we should build on 

success instead of trying to reinvent the wheel," said Davis, 

president of The Commonwealth Fund. "The consensus approach gives 

people the choice to keep the coverage they have if it's working 

well for them. It provides a long-term vision, but also lends 

itself to phasing in and adjustment over time with experience. The 

federal government could begin to enact some pieces of this plan 

immediately." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Key aspects of the consensus framework include: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Access to affordable coverage for small-business employees, 

the self-employed, and other uninsured individuals through a new 

Congressional Health Plan. The Congressional Health Plan would 

provide a choice of any insurance plan participating in the Federal 

Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). It would be open to 

anyone working for a business that has fewer than 50 employees, as 

well as to self-employed workers and other uninsured individuals. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Automatic enrollment and premium assistance. Any uninsured 

person would receive tax credits to help pay premiums that exceed 

5 percent of their incomes (10 percent for those in upper tax 

brackets). The uninsured would be enrolled automatically in the 

Congressional Health Plan and would have a choice of other group 

options. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Public coverage expansions for low-income individuals and 

people at risk for being uninsured because of their health or age. 

Medicare would be open to those 60 and older who lack access to 

group coverage, to the disabled on the Medicare waiting list, and 

to Medicare dependents. State-run programs, with enhanced federal 

financing to reduce state costs, would be open to any individual or 

family with an income below 150 percent of poverty. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Building on employer-sponsored coverage where it is working 

well. To minimize disruptions in coverage, employers would continue 

to be the mainstay of the health insurance system for working 

families. Companies that do not offer coverage to employees would 

contribute 5 percent of payroll-up to $1 per hour worked-to a fund 

that would help pay for coverage. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The framework illustrates ways in which various approaches 

could be combined, and it also shows what could be accomplished 

incrementally if you have a vision of how different parts fit 

together," noted Schoen, vice president at The Commonwealth Fund. 

"Another possible step toward covering everyone would be to conduct 

state demonstrations like those suggested by the recent Institute 

of Medicine report. Given the fiscal conditions that states are in, 

such demonstrations would require a new commitment of federal 

resources." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the Health Affairs article, Davis and Schoen discuss how the 

tax system could be used to provide income-related credits and to 

ensure automatic enrollment of the uninsured into private and 

public group health plans. The framework would couple this 

automatic enrollment and premium assistance with a mix of private 

and public insurance expansions designed to provide affordable, 

continuous, and high-quality coverage options for the entire 

under-65 population. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new Congressional Health Plan -- the proposal's 

centerpiece -- would allow small-business employees, the 

self-employed, and other uninsured individuals to enroll in the 

same insurance plans offered to federal employees. Members of 

Congress could also participate to show their commitment to 

high-quality coverage. The program would be open to everyone, 

regardless of their health status or age. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To make coverage affordable to those with very low incomes who 

cannot afford coverage even with tax credits, as well as to those 

at risk for being uninsured because of their health or age, public 

insurance programs would be expanded. In addition, the framework 

includes provisions that would improve the stability and continuity 

of employer-based coverage and encourage more firms to participate 

in group coverage. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In total, these components would reach an estimated 39 million 

of the 42 million Americans who were uninsured in 2002, if 

participation were mandatory. Even if participation were voluntary, 

an estimated 33 million of the uninsured would still be covered. 

For the entire under-65 population, the new insurance framework 

would provide the security of more continuous, affordable coverage. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The authors' cost estimates suggest that the combined approach 

would result in a marginal increase in total national spending, 

while providing out-of-pocket cost savings for the uninsured and 

more affordable premiums for individuals and small businesses. 

Various features would also likely reduce insurance administrative 

costs throughout the health system, including the costs associated 

with instability of coverage. People with health problems would 

have the added security that continuous insurance coverage would be 

available to them at an affordable price. The net federal costs of 

the expansion are estimated to be $70 billion when fully 

implemented-an amount that could be partially offset by repeal of 

the one-percentage-point reduction in the income tax scheduled to 

take effect in January 2004.
