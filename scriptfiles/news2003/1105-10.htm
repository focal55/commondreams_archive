<td valign="top" align="left" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BOSTON, MA - November 4 -   U.S. Sen. John Edwards (D-NC), who has previously said it would be &quot;irresponsible&quot; for the federal government not to arrest cancer and AIDS patients using medical marijuana under the provisions of state medical marijuana laws, acknowledged on national television tonight that he has used marijuana in the past.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   The statement came in response to an e-mailed question read by moderator Anderson Cooper during the &quot;America Rocks the Vote&quot; candidate forum broadcast live on CNN from Boston's Fanueil Hall. Other candidates acknowledging they had smoked marijuana were U.S. Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) and former Vermont Governor Howard Dean. U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) -- who has previously promised to sign an executive order allowing medical use of marijuana -- said, &quot;No, but I'd decriminalize it.&quot; Ambassador Carol Moseley Braun dodged the question, laughing and saying, &quot;I'm not going to answer.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   On the campaign trail, Edwards has been perhaps the most hard-line of the Democratic contenders on the issue of medical marijuana. Asked during an August 21 candidate forum in New Hampshire whether he would end raids conducted by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration against medical marijuana patients and caregivers in California, Edwards said, &quot;I don't think you can say to people working for you, `No, ignore violations of the law.' I think that's irresponsible for the president to do.&quot;</font></p>
<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Edwards has shown that he is undeserving of any office, much less the presidency,&quot; said Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana Campaign Coordinator Aaron Houston, who attended the forum but was not given the opportunity to ask a question. &quot;Senator Edwards said it would be `irresponsible' not to arrest cancer and AIDS patients for doing precisely what he has done -- smoked marijuana -- even if it is the only thing that relieves their pain and nausea. Perhaps we should change his grade in our Voter Guide from `D-' to `H' for Hypocrite.&quot;</font></p>
