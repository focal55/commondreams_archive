- September 26 - Members of the Green Party of the

United States are mourning the death and celebrating

the life of Edward Said, the Palestinian scholar and

political writer who passed away on Thursday,

September 25.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Professor Said was a model for many of us in the

Green Party,&quot; said Ben Manski, Co-Chair of the Green

Party of the United States.  &quot;We read his articles

regularly, and we admired the principled stands he

repeatedly made for human rights, democracy, and

nonviolence.  He condemned the terrorism that the

Israeli state visited against Palestinians, and the

terrorism that Palestinians inflicted on Israelis. 

Professor Said insisted that democracy, equality, and

adherence to international law and justice were the

only solutions to the crisis.  In his absence, the

Green Party will continue to voice the humanist values

he defended.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;He spoke out on behalf of Ralph Nader in the 2000

election and was heartened by our party and the

possibilities it presented,&quot; said Connecticut Green

Justine McCabe, Ph.D., an anthropologist who has done

research in the Middle East and is member of the

party's International Committee.  &quot;Edward Said

embodied that great combination of high intellence,

superb scholarship and political activism.  Perhaps

most significant for Greens was his constant reminder

that political events and history are not 'natural' --

they're not like a rock or a tree; but are made and

unmade by men and women.  Said provided great hope

that if we keep at it, we can change the course of

events.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Edward Said criticized both the lawless violence of

the government of Israel and the corrupt despots of

Arab nations, including the Palestinian Authority, and

he held the US responsible for supporting both,&quot; said

Mazin Qumsiyeh, Ph.D., Palestinian-American Professor

of Genetics at Yale Medical School and a Connecticut

Green.  &quot;It helped that Professor Said was an

excellent writer, with an encyclopedic knowledge and

profound understanding of literature and music, and

wasn't afraid to voice independent opinions.  Books

like 'Orientalism' and 'Culture and Imperialism'

helped lay the basis for multicultural studies, the

recognition of diverse ethnic literary voices, and the

complex historical relationship between the imperial

West and the 'exotic,' exploitable Muslim east.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens note that Edward Said correctly foresaw the

collapse of the 1993 Oslo Accords, which forced a

dependent and inferior status on the Palestinian

territories, rendering them vulnerable to Israeli

settlements, dispossession, and state brutality. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;To me, Edward Said was one of those rare philosopher

kings whose politics emerged as poetry,&quot; said Ross

Mirkarimi, spokesperson for the California Green

Party, who has worked in the Middle East on

humanitarian issues.</font></p>
