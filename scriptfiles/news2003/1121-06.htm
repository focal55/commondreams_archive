-  
November 21 - An analysis by the national consumer group Public Citizen suggests that there were strong financial incentives for AARP to support the Republican-drafted Medicare prescription drug bill, because the organization is likely to realize significant profits from the programs to be established by the legislation. AARP has created shock waves within the political world by endorsing the prescription drug bill now before Congress, despite numerous provisions in the bill that violate the organization&#146;s previously stated positions.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">AARP has launched a $7 million ad campaign to support the bill, with TV and newspapers ads running in numerous major markets across the country.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Public Citizen&#146;s analysis demonstrates that while AARP might be considered primarily a membership organization, it has in many ways become a business &#150; one that derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from a variety of insurance-related ventures, and only 29 percent of its revenues from membership dues.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The analysis shows that the majority of AARP&#146;s annual revenue comes from selling such products as Medigap supplemental drug insurance policies and offering prescription drug discount cards. It also sells its membership list to corporations, such as health insurers, and sells advertising space in its magazine to customers that include pharmaceutical and insurance companies. Plus, it earns income by temporarily investing insurance premiums paid by its members before they are due to the insurer.

A large portion of this royalty income was derived from insurance policies administered by the UnitedHealth Group, one of the largest managed care companies in the country. Such health plans are a central feature of the Medicare drug bill before Congress. </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">AARP&#146;s investment income from insurance products totaled $26.7 million in 2002, or 4.2 percent of income. This would dramatically increase if many more health premiums get written as a result of the legislation, which is likely. </FONT></LI><LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">AARP derives income from a prescription drug discount card marketed to its members, which is a program that would be offered in 2004 and 2005 before the prescription drug benefit becomes available if the Medicare bill becomes law. </FONT></LI></UL><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;AARP has a fine history of representing senior citizens in this country,&quot; said Clemente. &quot;We hope that considerations of financial profit played no role in its decision to endorse the bill that most national seniors groups oppose. The organization would do well to make a declaration to this effect and, given the many problems in the bill and the strongly voiced concerns of so many of its members, reconsider its support for the legislation.&quot;<p align="center">###</p></FONT><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
