- May 16 - Mark Crispin Miller, author of &quot;The Bush Dyslexicon&quot; will be continuing his hit one-man show, &quot;Operation American Freedom&quot; at the Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, in NYC, on consecutive Saturday evenings beginning May 31through the end of June. Performances will be at 10pm on: May, 31 and June 7, 14, 21 &amp; 28.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tickets for these performances are $20 ($10. for Students) and reservations can be obtained by calling 212-691-4815 or online at <a href="http://www.markcrispinmiller.org/" target="_new">www.markcrispinmiller.org</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A long-time media critic and political commentator, Miller wrote &quot;Operation American Freedom&quot; out of frustration with the US press, which, he claims, has shirked its constitutional obligation to protect American democracy and basically &#147;functions as a mere p.a. system for the White House and the Pentagon, failing to inform the people of this country.&#148; Far from keeping a suspicious eye on federal power-the journalistic task envisioned by the Founding Fathers-the mainstream press has, in the name of &quot;patriotism&quot; and the &quot;war on terrorism,&quot; let the Bush administration strip away our basic freedoms. Miller uses dazzling comic riffs and startling journalistic revelation to encourage the audience to play an active role &quot;in this all-important struggle to protect free speech and realize this nation's democratic promise.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Miller's view, &quot;American journalism&quot; is threatening to become an oxymoron as major scandals don't get any coverage whatsoever and political and corporate malefactors get off easy, while the president is readily compared to Winston Churchill. Meanwhile, America's economy is in collapse, the threat of global terrorism is as grave as ever, and our nation is detested the world over. &quot;If you feel as if you've lost your mind,&quot; says Miller, &quot;you are not alone.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is, in fact, specifically for those who feel as if the world has gone insane that Miller first conceived of &quot;Operation American Freedom'&quot; which, writes Ari Berman of Editor &amp; Publisher offers &quot;a provocative, funny, and deeply disturbing one-man show. While the mainstream press still wants nothing to do with it, the first run of shows have sold out, with more planned. Can Miller do for political standup what Michael Moore did for Flint, Mich.?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Operation American Freedom&quot; has been garnering tremendous praise and excellent word-of-mouth as it plays to sold-out audiences in New York City. </font></p>
