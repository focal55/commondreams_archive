- May 12 - The Broad Foundation and 

Teach For America today announced that The Broad Foundation 

increased its commitment to Teach For America to a total of $2.7 

million dollars. This new grant of $1.875 million is the second 

grant The Broad Foundation has made to support Teach For America's 

mission to eliminate educational inequity in the United States. 

The grant will enable Teach For America to continue to increase the 

number of qualified teachers it places in under-served communities.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I believe public education is the leading civil rights issue of 

the 21st century. I am pleased to support Teach For America's 

commitment to eliminate educational inequity in this country," said 

Eli Broad, public school reform advocate and founder of The Broad 

Foundation. "Every child deserves a quality education regardless of 

their race, where they live, or their parents' income. Teach For 

America gets the best and brightest into teaching and places them 

in the most under-served classrooms in America," he said. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Teach For America is the national corps of outstanding recent 

college graduates who commit to two years of teaching in low-income 

communities and become life-long advocates to expand opportunity 

for all children. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are extremely grateful for the growing support from The 

Broad Foundation," said Wendy Kopp, founder and president of Teach 

For America. "They are providing additional funding for our program 

as part of their effort to implement systemic reforms nationwide. 

Their commitment sends a strong message to the greater 

philanthropic community." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new $1.875 million grant from The Broad Foundation runs from 

December 2002 to July 2006. The funds will be used to further help 

Teach For America reach its goal to have nearly 4,000 corps members 

teaching in rural and urban public schools across the country. To 

that end, the organization plans to double its presence in existing 

placement sites, triple its presence in New York City, and launch 

new sites in Philadelphia and Miami in 2003 and South Dakota in 

2004.

The Broad Center for Superintendents, a national effort focused on 

identifying, training, and supporting outstanding leaders to become 

successful urban school superintendents; and The Broad Institute 

for School Boards, an annual training program for newly elected

Teach For America is the national corps of outstanding college 

graduates who commit two years to teach in low-income urban and 

rural communities and become life-long advocates to expand 

opportunity for children. Corps members go above and beyond 

traditional expectations to impact the lives of children growing up 

in low-income communities. Beyond their two years, corps members 

take their insight and added commitment to assume leadership roles 

from inside education and from every other sector - and work toward 

the fundamental changes necessary to provide more equal 

opportunities for all children in our nation.

graduates of all academic majors. Corps members teach in 18 

locations in underserved communities across the country: Atlanta, 

Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, southern 

Louisiana, the Mississippi Delta, New Jersey, New Mexico, greater
