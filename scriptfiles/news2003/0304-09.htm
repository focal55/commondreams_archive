                - March 4 - The Medicare proposal announced by President Bush 

                today betrays seniors and people with disabilities by forcing 

                them to join unreliable private insurance plans in order to get 

                significant coverage for the high cost of prescription drugs. 

                The White House plan, announced during a speech to the American 

                Medical Association, is also far inferior to the bill by House 

                Democrats, also introduced today, to add a drug benefit to Medicare. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"What is surprising 

                about this new proposal is how little it differs from the administration 

                plan that was leaked to the press in January and summarily rejected 

                by members of the president’s own party," said Frank Clemente, 

                director of Public Citizen’s Congress Watch. "This administration 

                continues to have its sights set on destroying traditional Medicare. 

                Its proposal would lure beneficiaries into unreliable private 

                plans. Those who stay in traditional Medicare would be punished 

                with much more meager coverage." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The president’s 

                proposal would establish two classes of Medicare beneficiaries. 

                Those willing to give up free choice of doctor and the reliability 

                of traditional Medicare by joining private insurance plans would 

                be eligible for more generous prescription drug coverage. Those 

                opting to stay in traditional Medicare would get a discount card 

                promising unknown discounts, but no coverage for the high cost 

                of prescription drugs until they had spent thousands of dollars 

                out-of-pocket. By contrast, the House Democrats’ plan would make 

                much more generous coverage available equally to those in traditional 

                Medicare, which covers the vast majority of beneficiaries (89 

                percent), as well as those in private insurance plans. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The president’s 

                proposal would waste taxpayer money because it relies on inefficient 

                private plans to offer coverage for prescription drugs, whereas 

                the Democrats’ plan would use taxpayer money more wisely by relying 

                on the much more efficient Medicare program to offer drug coverage. 

                Government auditors have found that private plans spend far more 

                on administrative costs than Medicare. HMOs have administrative 

                costs of approximately 15 percent and indemnity insurers have 

                administrative costs of 20 percent. In contrast, Medicare spends 

                just 2 percent on administrative costs. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also, turning 

                Medicare over to private insurance companies would mean unreliable 

                coverage. Since 1999, 2.4 million beneficiaries have had to scramble 

                to find new coverage when their HMO dropped out of the Medicare+Choice 

                program. And in much of the country, particularly rural areas, 

                there are no viable HMOs for beneficiaries to use. In contrast, 

                by making coverage available through the traditional Medicare 

                program, the House Democrats have proposed prescription drug coverage 

                that seniors and people with disabilities would be able to rely 

                on. In more than 30 years in operation, the Medicare program has 

                never dropped a beneficiary from coverage.
