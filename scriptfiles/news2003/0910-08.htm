<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - September 10 - NYS Governor George E. Pataki today joined with members of the Albanese Organization, the Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority, Northwestern Mutual, and leaders in the architectural and building industries to inaugurate the country's first &quot;green&quot; -- environmentally sustainable -- residential high rise building. The Solaire, located at 20 River Terrace in New York's Battery Park City neighborhood, is also the first new residential construction to be completed in downtown Manhattan since 9/11. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Governor, who set the stage for environmentally responsible development in New York State by introducing the nation's first green building tax credit in 2000, unveiled the building's cornerstone in a ceremony at The Solaire's front entrance, beneath its signature photovoltaic panels. Governor Pataki said, &quot;The Solaire is a model for future residential development in New York City and across the nation. The technologies employed in constructing this wonderful building are all tried and tested. Albanese Organization has done a wonderful job integrating them to create this residence; these technologies can be duplicated and the advantages realized by any like-minded developer. I want to thank The Albanese Organization and James Gill and Tim Carey of the Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority for working together to move this project from vision into reality.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Russell C. Albanese, President of the Albanese Organization, said, &quot;Our challenge was not only to engineer a building that would be responsible in its use of the earth's resources, but also provide a healthy living environment for its tenants. The vision we shared with Governor Pataki and BPCA was to create a prototype building that would demonstrate the substantial positive impact an environmentally engineered residential tower would have on the lives of individuals and families, and on the neighborhood and the city as a whole. I want to commend Governor Pataki for his foresight in promoting green development and passing the first green building tax credit in the country, well before issues like mold, energy capacity and water quality became everyday news topics. He is leading New York State and the entire country towards a greener, healthier, more environmentally responsible future.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Solaire (www.thesolaire.com) was designed to meet stringent requirements for environmental sustainability and resource conservation and management throughout the building infrastructure and within each individual apartment. The 293-unit, 27-story tower has been environmentally engineered to consume 35% less energy, reduce summer peak demand for electricity by over 65%, utilize one-third less potable water, provide healthier indoor air quality and offer substantially more natural light than typical residential buildings. Among the most innovative environmental features of the building are: </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Photovoltaic cells, integrated within the exterior walls, capable of generating five percent of the building's base electric load. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fresh air supply to each residence, filtered to remove 85% of particulate matter. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An air conditioning system fueled by natural gas and free of ozone-depleting refrigerants. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On-site black water re-use system for the building's flush system and to supply the HVAC cooling tower. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Storm water catchment system to irrigate the rooftop garden. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A complete building management and monitoring system to control and monitor air quality and energy performance. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The use of building materials with high recycled content, or manufactured with renewable or rapidly renewable resources, free of added urea formaldehyde and containing low or no volatile organic compounds (VOCs).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Timothy S. Carey, President &amp; CEO, Battery Park City, said, &quot;In 2000, Governor Pataki initiated the nation's first tax credit for 'green' development, and in doing so set the stage for healthy urban living. Thanks to the vision of the Governor, The Solaire serves as a benchmark for environmentally sustainable development, and an example to the entire world.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rising interest in healthy living and environmentally responsible building has propelled interest in The Solaire. The first tenants moved in over July 4 weekend. The building is already more than 80% leased. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The ability to live in a building that promotes good health at every level of design, construction and maintenance is proving to be a powerful attraction for New Yorkers. The coupling of an environmentally astute structure with superior finishes, spectacular views and 5-star service is an ideal package,&quot; said Christopher Albanese, Executive Vice President of the Albanese Organization. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Albanese Organization (www.albaneseorg.com) is a privately held, full-service real estate firm dedicated to creating commercial and residential buildings of distinction, quality and architectural merit that optimize value, are environmentally responsible, and enhance the communities in which they are located. Albanese Organization has been a leader in the New York real estate development community since 1949. </font></p>
