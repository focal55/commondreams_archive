- June 30 -  As the  date approached for the

Federal Communication Commission's decision on

'relaxing' media consolidation rules, the Green Party

of the United States joined countless individuals and organizations who submitted public comments overwhelmingly against media ownership in fewer fewer hands.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting estimated that the

FCC Commissioners received some 750,000 letters,

faxes, emails and phone calls prior to the vote.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But that opposition failed to sway the majority of the

FCC's members; in a 3-2 decision, the rules regulating

media ownership were eased per industry wishes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 'chilling effect' of this decision could go far

beyond newsrooms and broadcast studios, &quot; said Ben

Manski, Co-Chair of the Green Party of the United

States. &quot;Should this ruling stand, there will be less opportunity for public oversight as corporations ignore diverse views in the name of mainstream appeal and greater profits.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;And less information available means  less

knowledgeable people,&quot; agreed Starlene Rankin,

Lavender Green Caucus delegate to the national party. &quot;These are public airwaves being passed around between

private corporations. Citizens are the owners and

their views aren't even being considered.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The June 2 decision, though, inspired a Congressional initiative, Under corrective legislation that recently passed the Senate Commerce Committee, individual companies would be barred from buying TV stations reaching more than 35% of the national market. Also barred would be cross-ownership of print and broadcast media in single markets. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A measure sponsored by Committee Chair John McCain

would eliminate the exemption allowing radio station

ownership to exceed appplicable caps. And

re-evaluation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act is

also being urged.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are heartened by these actions as well as similar sentiments in the U.S. House,&quot; said David Larson, Media Coordinator for the Iowa Green Party. &quot;We hope all members of Congress will serve the U.S. public interest and oppose the ruling.&quot;</font></p>
