                - March 27 - Massive and unfair tax cuts that would drive the 

                federal government deeper into debt are being aggressively promoted 

                by powerful right-wing groups that are ideologically opposed to 

                the government's role in providing basic services and protections 

                to individuals. A new report by People For the American Way examines 

                five major organizations whose ability to commit resources to 

                and exert influence on policymakers and grassroots operations 

                have helped keep the Bush administration's irresponsible tax policies 

                high on the domestic agenda, despite ever-worsening deficit projections, 

                the huge cost of war in Iraq and its aftermath and warnings about 

                the nation's long-term economic health. The report is available 

                at <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=9498" target="_new">http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=9498</a>.

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"For those 

                who want to drastically restrict the federal government's ability 

                to take action on behalf of individuals and the common good, there 

                is method to the madness of reckless tax cuts that is particularly 

                troubling at a time of war and economic uncertainty," said People 

                For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas. "They see massive 

                deficits as a way to undermine the federal government's ability 

                to deal with national priorities like stronger public schools, 

                a cleaner environment, and better access to health care." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report 

                profiles five groups who share an anti-tax, anti-government and 

                pro-privatization agenda, but play to different strengths. Americans 

                for Tax Reform is the inside-the-beltway operation which excels 

                at building and maintaining political coalitions among politicians, 

                industry groups and other right-wing interest groups. The Heritage 

                Foundation and Cato Institute are the ideological think tanks, 

                churning out policy papers and providing the bulk of material 

                support and marketing might for policymakers. Citizens for a Sound 

                Economy drives the field operation, channeling corporate money 

                into grassroots campaigns for specific legislative proposals. 

                Finally, Club for Growth is the uncompromising political action 

                committee, enforcing ideological rigor by targeting wavering politicians 

                when they are most vulnerable, including Republicans deemed insufficiently 

                committed to anti-tax dogma. </font>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The debate 

                about tax policy should be broader than just how many billions 

                or trillions of dollars will be given away to America's millionaires," 

                said Neas. "It is important for policy makers and the American 

                people to understand that behind the push for these huge tax cuts 

                is an anti-government movement that is eager to force radical 

                reductions in the social services and legal protections provided 

                by the federal government to the American people. The tax plan 

                is part of a broader strategy that includes packing the federal 

                judiciary with judges who embrace a states' rights approach to 

                the Constitution in order to restrict the federal government's 

                legal authority to protect Americans' rights and address pressing 

                issues. This report sheds some light on the key players in this 

                movement and their strategies." </font>
