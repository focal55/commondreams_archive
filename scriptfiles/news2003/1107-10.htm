- November 7 - The nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) 
activist and allies conference opened its doors in Miami on Wednesday, November 
5, 2003 for two days of pre-conference intensive day long-trainings. Creating 
Change continues on Friday, November 7 with the continuation of last year's conference 
theme, 'Building an Anti-Racist Movement for Social and Economic Justice' with 
15 separate day-long sessions of the &quot;Skills Academy For Leadership and Action.&quot; 
Saturday and Sunday will feature nearly one hundred workshop sessions on a variety 
of topics including: Aging; Anti-Violence; Bisexuality; Campus Issues; Elections 
and Campaigns; Gender Identity; Health; Legal; Military; Media; People of Color, 
Transgender and Youth Issues; and, Spirituality and Faith. The 16th annual Creating 
Change conference attracts more than 2,000 attendees from across the country.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;I 
hope as a city we influence the politics on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
issues to a higher level...including influencing the politics of the county and 
state,&quot; Miami Beach Mayor David Dermer said in welcoming the conference to 
Miami during Thursday evening's opening reception. &quot;One day there will be 
no issues of discrimination in any city.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;We 
have to remain vigilant,&quot; said Dade County Commissioner Jimmy Morales later 
in the plenary. &quot;With you guys (the Task Force) down here in Miami, we can 
continue to build our momentum and bring the rest of the state with us into the 
21st century.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Task 
Force Executive Director Matt Foreman then announced the winners of the $10,000 
Anderson Prize Foundation Creating Change Awards, which this year went to Newark, 
NJ activist LaQuetta Nelson of the Newark Pride Alliance and San Francisco activist 
Shannon Minter of the National Center for Lesbian Rights.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;My 
heart is saddened because of how I got here,&quot; Nelson said. &quot;I am here 
because a young 15-year old lesbian had the courage to do something I didn't have 
the courage to do as a child. Look what price Sakia Gunn paid for me to be here 
today... no child should have to fear losing their life walking down the street. 
No child&amp;for African-American LGBT people, it is hard. I challenge every one 
of you who are in the white LGBT community, I challenge you to challenge yourselves 
to do better in the area of race relations.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;I 
am incredibly grateful to the Task Force and to the Anderson family for this honor,&quot; 
Minter said. &quot;As a transgender man working for a lesbian organization, I 
am proud to accept this award as a testament to the many other transgender activists 
and allies who have labored for years to build bridges between the gay and transgender 
communities. I am especially honored to be selected by the National Gay and Lesbian 
Task Force, which has long stood as a beacon of uncompromising support and acceptance 
for transgender people.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Democratic 
Senator Jarrett Barrios of Massachusetts set the stage for the day-long Skills 
Academy for Leadership and Action during this morning's opening plenary session, 
saying, &quot;Why is it important that it not just be about LGBT issues? We in 
this room understand in our bones it isn't just about our equality. It's not just 
us too, but you too when we talk about whatever issues affect us. The challenge 
will always be, must be, you too. Not just LGBT folks, but all of us.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">National 
Gay and Lesbian Task Force Executive Director Matt Foreman spoke of the forces 
of the religious and political Right mobilizing an anti-LGBT backlash the likes 
of which we've never seen. &quot;Using the threat of 'gay marriage' they are raising 
millions of dollars and launching an unprecedented, coordinated campaign to dehumanize, 
demonize and defame us,&quot; Foreman said. &quot;This is about much more than 
denying equal rights for LGBT people. Just as they have exploited choice, race, 
immigrants and poor women (to name only a few) in the past, they will use LGBT 
people as a wedge issue in the 2004 elections to divide America and insure that 
they - a distinct minority - stay in power.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Creating 
Change attendees will participate in an intensive and all-new training and skills-building 
component at Creating Change this year. &quot;The Creating Change Skills Academy 
for Leadership and Action&quot; Friday curriculum was designed to meet the needs 
of activists and organizers working at the local and state level build a stronger 
and more powerful political force for social and economic justice. Experts and 
leaders from the LGBT movement and from allied movements for social change will 
teach the Skills Academy sessions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Upcoming
