                - March 3 - The Association for Integrity in Accounting (AIA), 

                a new public interest accounting group formed in the wake of the 

                recent corporate scandals, today outlined an ambitious agenda 

                to restore integrity to the accounting profession. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Association, 

                founded by leading accounting professors and professionals, will 

                focus on four main areas: 1) watching the watchdogs; 2) restoring 

                professional independence; 3) assuring corporate accountability 

                and disclosure; and 4) redeeming accounting education. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The mission 

                of the Association for Integrity in Accounting is to provide an 

                independent forum to present and advance positions on a wide range 

                of critical accounting and auditing issues, standards and regulations 

                affecting the accountability and integrity of the profession and 

                the public interest in maintaining trust and confidence in accounting,” 

                said founding member Linda Ruchala, an associate professor of 

                accountancy at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Association 

                held its founding meeting this weekend in Washington D.C. with 

                members from around the world. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a watchdog 

                of the watchdogs, the AIA will undertake a thorough evaluation 

                of the current financial reporting system and keep a close eye 

                on the activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission and 

                other regulatory boards. The AIA’s preliminary evaluation calls 

                for abolishing the Financial Accounting Standards Board </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To restore 

                professional independence, the AIA will propose legislative and 

                rule changes to alleviate the conflicts of interest that arise 

                from the way that CPAs are currently selected and paid. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the area 

                of assuring corporate accountability and disclosure, the AIA will 

                call for increased transparency on stock options and derivatives 

                and for expanding the reporting of social and environmental liabilities. 

                The AIA will be a voice for openness and transparency in accounting. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to 

                redeem education, the AIA will call on educators to help accounting 

                students think critically and independently instead of memorizing 

                technical and often flawed rule-based approaches. The AIA will 

                investigate and publicize the lessons of Enron and other accounting 

                scandals so students, professionals, and the public can learn 

                from these “corporate autopsies.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“We are enduring 

                an economic blight that has been engendered by a systematic violation 

                of the fiduciary mandate, where insiders – management, directors, 

                auditors, bankers, consultants, etc. – have betrayed their public 

                trust,” said founding member Tony Tinker, a professor of accountancy 

                at CUNY-Baruch College. “Systemic problems require solutions that 

                are adequate to their scale; AIA’s mission is to initiate such 

                a comprehensive re-evaluation of accounting and auditing practice. 

                “ </font>

                a nonprofit that promotes citizen participation in democracy, 

                is helping the AIA get started as part of its incubation program 

                of needed public interest voices. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“For too long, 

                the public interest voices in the accounting industry have been 

                overwhelmed by corporate pressures,” said Ralph Nader, founder 

                of Citizen Works. “Today, we are pleased to introduce a new public 

                interest voice to restore integrity to the accounting profession, 

                to remind the profession of its public interest duty, and to make 

                sure that we can all benefit from their work honestly and well 

                done, no matter how large, how powerful and how demanding their 

                corporate clients.
