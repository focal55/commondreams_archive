                ELF submarine transmitter system will be re-sentenced in Federal 

                District Court in Madison, Wisc. (120 N Henry St.), on Friday,

                WI, Jane Hosking of Luck, WI, John LaForge of Luck, WI and Jeff 

                Leys of Milwaukee, for their failure/refusal to complete court-imposed

                2002 the Magistrate imposed 85 hours of community service work. 

                The four were part of a group of five convicted Sept. 10, 2002 

                of trespassing during a Mothers' Day 2002 demonstration at the 

                ELF site. The fifth activist, attorney John Bachman of Eau Claire,

                from federal prison in eastern Pennsylvania, after serving seven 

                months. Heid was sentenced by Mag. Crocker to one month for refusing 

                to pay a $500.00 fine imposed for an October 2001 trespass conviction 

                at the ELF site. As part of the same stint, Heid also served 6-months
