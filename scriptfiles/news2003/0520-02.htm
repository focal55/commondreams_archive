- May 20 - On the first anniversary of the new country's independence, 

the International Federation for East Timor (IFET) urged the UN Security



Council to establish an international tribunal to try the masterminds of



war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the territory from 1975 

to 1999.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an open letter to council members, IFET called a tribunal "essential to 

punish past violence and deter future violence against the people of East 

Timor and Indonesia and against UN personnel."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesia has established an Ad Hoc Court on Human Rights for East Timor, 

and verdicts in its last trials are due shortly. in order to deflect moves 

to establish an international tribunal. But Indonesia has failed to 

"overcome [the court's] inherent flaws," IFET wrote, citing numerous 

criticisms by UN officials of the ad hoc court. East Timor's leaders have 

urged the international community to take primary responsibility for 

judging crimes against humanity committed in East Timor.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, noted IFET, "[a]n international tribunal is not only a matter of 

justice for the people of East Timor."  The letter pointed out that 

Indonesian security forces committed the crimes as Indonesia defied 

multiple UN resolutions and, in 1999, sought to undermine a UN operation.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Many of those accused of abuses continue to occupy positions of 

responsibility in Indonesia," IFET wrote. The letter cited the example of 

Major General Adam Damiri, who missed a recent session of his trial before 

Indonesia's ad hoc court because he was involved in preparing military 

operations in Aceh. On Monday, Indonesia launched a military assault 

against the war-torn province. It was the largest attack by Indonesia since 

the 1975 invasion of East Timor.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter concluded that East Timor's "[r]econciliation with Indonesia is 

... hampered by the failure to bring to justice the Indonesian military,



political, and police leaders who planned, organized and commanded the 

terror campaign in 1999 and who ordered the invasion, occupation and 

destruction in East Timor."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, IFET called on the Security Council to extend the mandate of the 

Serious Crimes Investigation Unit (SCU) and its special courts. IFET said 

the "work of the SCU would serve as a solid basis for an ad hoc 

international tribunal." The SCU has issued several indictments of ranking 

Indonesian officials for crimes committed in 1999, Among those indcted are 

General Wiranto, the former Defense Minister, and two-thirds of those 

indicted by the SCU are believed to reside in Indonesia, which refuses to 

extradite anyone to East Timor.
