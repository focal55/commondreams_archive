- November 26 - Americans with food allergies will have an easier time spotting common allergens on food labels if legislation sponsored by Senator Judd Gregg (R-NH) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA) becomes law. That bill unanimously passed the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee last week, and Representative Nita Lowey (D-NY) plans to introduce similar legislation in the House. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The bill would require food manufacturers to use plain English words like &#147;milk&#148; or &#147;wheat&#148; rather than less familiar words like &#147;casein&#148; or &#147;semolina&#148; to identify common food allergens on ingredients lists. The bill also would close a major loophole that now lets allergens in spices and flavorings go undisclosed. Eight ingredients&#151;eggs, fish, milk, peanuts, shellfish, soybeans, tree nuts, and wheat&#151;account for most allergic reactions. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&#147;For those people with food allergies, this bipartisan legislation could be a real life-saver,&#148; said CSPI executive director Michael F. Jacobson, who noted that each year 29,000 Americans are hospitalized and 150 die each year from allergic reactions to food. &#147;Parents shouldn&#146;t have to worry that a food product with some unspecified &#145;natural flavoring&#146; is going to trigger anaphylactic shock in their kid.&#148; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The bill would also require the FDA to inspect food manufacturing facilities for, and to encourage the food industry to reduce inadvertent cross-contamination of, foods with allergens during processing. The bill also directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect data on adverse reactions to allergenic foods. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Although similar legislation cleared the HELP committee last year, Congress adjourned before the bill reached a floor vote. This year the bill enjoys the support of the Bush Administration. </FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
