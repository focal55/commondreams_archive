- September 3 - Boise Cascade Corporation, a leader in the forest products industry, today released a new environmental statement marking significant progress in helping to protect endangered forest areas throughout the world and old growth forests in the United States.  Rainforest Action Network has applauded the policy as an expanded commitment to sustainable forest stewardship for the industry.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With this announcement, Boise becomes the first major U.S. forest products company to adopt a comprehensive environmental statement for its operations and the first distributor of wood and paper products to extend an environmental policy to its suppliers. The statement reflects the company&#146;s heightened commitment to environmental leadership and was developed with input from groups including Rainforest Action Network, American Lands Alliance and the National Forest Protection Alliance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statement highlights the major areas of Boise&#146;s environmental commitment.  It affirms Boise&#146;s commitment to work with environmental groups to successfully eliminate the purchase of wood products from endangered areas.  Boise also commits to give purchasing preference to suppliers who provide wood products from certified, well-managed forests whenever feasible.  Among other provisions, the statement includes Boise&#146;s assurance that its purchase of logs, pulpwood, and chips will strengthen efforts to thwart illegal logging.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This statement formalizes Boise&#146;s commitment to environmental stewardship by linking the company&#146;s broad and varied environmental activities into a unified statement,&#148; said George Harad, Boise&#146;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">John Bender, Senior Vice President, Boise Building Solutions, said, &#147;We are proud of the progress we&#146;ve made, and gratefully acknowledge the support of our customers in this effort.  Their dedication to constructive dialogue has helped us achieve the high standards this policy reflects.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We congratulate Boise for joining the growing number of U.S. companies that have taken steps to protect the world&#146;s last remaining endangered forests.  Boise&#146;s leadership will be an important catalyst in ensuring that these areas are protected for future generations,&#148; said Michael Brune, Rainforest Action Network&#146;s Executive Director.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jennifer Krill, Old Growth Campaigns Director for Rainforest Action Network, said, &#147;Boise has become the first American forest products company to adopt an international policy to help protect endangered forests.  With such strong leadership from Boise and its customers, we expect it&#146;s only a matter of time before the rest of the industry follows suit.&#148;  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Randi Spivak, Executive Director of American Lands Alliance, said, &#147;Boise&#146;s new environmental policy offers new hope for the world&#146;s endangered forests.  We acknowledge Boise for its commitment to completely phase out of endangered areas and to protect these vital, life supporting ecosystems around the world.&#148;</font></p>
