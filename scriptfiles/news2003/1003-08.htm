</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They told Burg such a meeting would give him &quot;a first-hand understanding of the human consequences of a major nuclear accident.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joyce Corradi of Middletown, Pennsylvania, a Harrisburg suburb, said: &quot;Mr. Burg, I&#146;d be willing to bet your home is not within a mile radius of that nuclear power plant, and there&#146;s a reason for that. It&#146;s not safe.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 6, 2002, Davis-Besse employees discovered a corroded hole in the reactor head. Only 3/8-inch of cracked, bulging stainless steel was containing the reactor core. Subsequently, FirstEnergy discovered that the reactor&#146;s emergency cooling system has not worked in the 26 years the plant has been operating. A retired NRC senior safety analyst said the report &quot;contains the admission that Davis-Besse would most probably have melted if there had been a loss-of-coolant accident.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 2, 2003, FirstEnergy found that &quot;equipment designed to prevent a hydrogen gas explosion similar to what happened during the Three Mile Island partial nuclear meltdown has been inoperable at FirstEnergy Corp.'s Davis-Besse plant since it opened in 1977.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nuclear safety engineer David Lochbaum at the Union of Concerned Scientists has concluded that &quot;had the hole opened up, the accident would likely have been worse than Three Mile Island but not as bad a Chernobyl.&quot; </font></p>
