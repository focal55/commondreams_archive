                VA - April 8 - Medical students from across the country recently 

                enacted new policy addressing the national medical malpractice 

                insurance crisis at the American Medical Student Association's 

                (AMSA) 53rd annual convention. AMSA's House of Delegates voted 

                in favor of a comprehensive, multifaceted approach to medical 

                malpractice reform. In an unprecedented show of support for consumer 

                rights, the medical students voted to oppose caps on non-economic 

                damages and other simplified approaches as a sole solution to 

                malpractice reform. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the US 

                House of Representatives recently passed legislation limiting 

                awards for non-economic damages to $250,000, AMSA firmly opposes 

                these caps as a means of solving the crisis. "Caps on non-economic 

                damages will harm only patients who have been deemed worthy of 

                receiving compensation by our legal system. Evidence does not 

                show that caps will eliminate frivolous lawsuits. Instead of penalizing 

                our patients, it is time to call into question the insurance companies 

                who are setting the exorbitant premiums--their practices are helping 

                to drive this crisis. Any reform of the medical malpractice system 

                should include insurance reform", explained Eric Hodgson, M.D., 

                AMSA National President. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMSA believes 

                that the reduction of preventable medical injury and the fair 

                and timely compensation of injured persons to be the most important 

                goals of a medical malpractice system. "Medical students are appalled 

                that preventable medical errors kill up to 100,000 people each 

                year. Medical malpractice reform must work to create a safer health 

                care system for our patients instead of primarily addressing the 

                increasing costs to physicians" added Dr. Hodgson. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The medical 

                malpractice crisis gained national attention recently when physicians 

                took part in strikes to protest rising malpractice insurance premiums. 

                Medical students recognize that the rising costs of medical liability 

                insurance may affect their professional decisions and those of 

                practicing physicians as well. Of particular concern is that the 

                situation has left residents of some states without access to 

                medical care. Dr. Hodgson concluded, "Forcing doctors to make 

                career choices based on ability to afford insurance premiums may 

                cause shortages in certain medical specialties. For the benefit 

                of our patients, future physicians are addressing this issue head 

                on." The following principles on professional liability reform 

                were adopted by the House of Delegates at AMSA's 53rd National 

                Convention. </font>
