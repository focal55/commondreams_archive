- July 29 - <i>&quot;This is a 9/11, major wake-up call that the enemy is at our doorsteps. This will redirect the stream of what is morally right and what is morally wrong into a deviant kind of behavior. There is no way that homosexuality can be seen other than a social disorder.&quot;</i> </font></p>

Today the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force released a compilation of negative and often vitriolic reactions of religious right and political leaders since the Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas and the decision of the Canadian government to extend the freedom to marry to gay and lesbian people. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

'Know Thy Enemy: Quotes about the Sodomy Ruling and the Same-Sex Marriage Backlash', contains quotes from a wide variety of public opinion makers, including Rev. Jerry Falwell, President George W. Bush, and Sen. Rick Santorum. The compilation will be updated online on a regular basis. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We expected a backlash to the developments in Canada and the Supreme Courts Lawrence decision,&quot; said National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Executive Director Matt Foreman. &quot;What we didn't expect was the degree of vitriol and misinformation that has spewed forth. The right is portraying a long-overdue court decision saying that the police cannot break into the bedrooms of America as the death knell of American values. This campaign of misinformation and hyperbole is clearly aimed at promoting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to outlaw the recognition of marriages between persons of the same sex.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Foreman added, &quot;The Task Force is committed to not only exposing these anti-gay extremists for what they are. As we have for the past 30 years, we will fight them every step of the way to make sure the voices of fairness and decency prevail.&quot;</font></p>
