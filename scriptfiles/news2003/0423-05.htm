- April 23 - Protesters will deliver 600 pairs of shoes, 

symbolizing the number of preventable deaths each day of HIV-positive 

South Africans who have no access to AIDS medicines at a 1 PM march 

and rally Thursday April 24, at the South African Embassy. The march 

will leave from Massachusetts Ave & California St NW, arriving at 

3051 Massachusetts Ave, NW, Washington, D.C. 20008. Protest sponsors 

include ACT UP New York and Philadelphia, Health GAP, Student Global 

AIDS Campaign, and African Services Committee.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Washington, D.C. rally marks a global day of protest called by 

the largest grassroots AIDS activist group in South Africa, the 

Treatment Action Campaign  (TAC). The day of protest is part of a 

broadly supported campaign launched by TAC to force the South African 

government to support a national HIV/AIDS treatment plan. 

Simultaneous actions are planned in major cities throughout the 

world, from Nairobi to Amsterdam (for more details about 

international actions, contact TAC spokesperson, Vuyani Jacobs: tel: 

011 27 73 209 3606, email: vuyani@tac.org.za and go to 

<a href="http://www.tac.org.za" target="_new">www.tac.org.za</a>.)

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of ACT UP, including activists dressed in mourning shrouds, 

will deliver the 600 empty shoes to South African embassy 

representatives, while protesters chant, holding banners and playing 

drums.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"People with AIDS are global citizens-we have an obligation to 

support South Africans living with HIV and demand that their 

government begin to treat its 4.6 million HIV positive people," said 

John Bell of ACT UP Philadelphia. "We look forward to the day when 

the South African government will commit to treating people with HIV, 

so all sectors of civil society can be partners with government in 

immediate implementation of a treatment plan to save lives. Until 

that time, we must stand with South Africans who are fighting for 

their lives, and fighting for the life of their great country."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The South African government has refused to endorse a national plan 

for treatment and care, including access to antiretrovirals, despite 

widespread national support for treating people living with HIV, and 

widespread acknowledgement of the massive social, public health, and 

economic damage to the country as a result of untreated HIV disease.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After four years of pressure on their government, TAC activists 

launched a non-violent campaign of civil disobedience March 20, 2003 

because, "[O]ur consciences no longer can allow us to stand by and 

let people die needlessly while government procrastinates, delays and 

impedes the development and implementation of an HIV/AIDS Treatment 

and Prevention plan. We support our Constitution. In fact our civil 

disobedience actions draw attention to the fact that the government 

does not respect the right to life, dignity, equality and health care 

access of children, men and women who live with HIV/AIDS" (excerpt 

from TAC's submission to the South African Human Rights Commission, 

April 1 2003).

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The vast majority of people in South Africa have no access to the 

medicines that have transformed AIDS in wealthy countries into 

something approaching a chronic, manageable illness. The South 

African government's own research has confirmed that HIV is the 

leading cause of death among women between the ages of 15 and 39, of 

maternal mortality, and is a major factor exacerbating poverty.
