                - March 18 - Dangerous explosive duds from cluster munitions used 

                by allied forces in the 1991 Persian Gulf War are still being 

                found and destroyed in Kuwait at the startling rate of 200 per 

                month, according to official documents obtained by Human Rights

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                Watch released a new briefing paper today warning against the 

                use of cluster bombs in Iraq. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Documents from 

                the Kuwait Ministry of Defense show that 2,400 explosive cluster 

                munition duds were found and destroyed in Kuwait in 2002, and 

                a similar number the previous year. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The use of 

                cluster munitions in Iraq will endanger civilians for years to 

                come," said Mark Hiznay, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch 

                and author of the new briefing paper. "Cluster bombs also threaten 

                U.S. and friendly soldiers during combat." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                Watch has issued detailed analyses of the U.S. use of cluster 

                bombs in the Persian Gulf War, in Kosovo and in Afghanistan. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 

                1991 Gulf War, the United States and its allied coalition dropped 

                bombs containing about twenty million submunitions, and also reportedly 

                fired artillery projectiles containing more than thirty million 

                submunitions. These resulted in millions of hazardous duds, each 

                functioning like an indiscriminate antipersonnel landmine. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At least eighty 

                U.S. casualties during the war were attributed to cluster munition 

                duds. More than 4,000 civilians have been killed or injured by 

                cluster munition duds since the end of the war. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                Watch called attention to four particular types of U.S. cluster 

                munitions that have had high failure rates in combat or in testing: 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The Multiple 

                Launch Rocket System (MLRS) with M77 submunitions has had a failure 

                rate of 16 to 23 percent. Each standard volley of twelve MRLS 

                rockets would likely result in more than 1,200 explosive duds. 

                -- 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) artillery 

                projectiles with M42 and M46 submunitions have had a failure rate 

                of 14 percent. -- Rockeye CBU-99/CBU-100 air-dropped bombs with 

                Mk 118 submunitions. This Vietnam-era cluster munition was used 

                extensively in the 1991 Gulf War and has accounted for a very 

                large percentage of the explosive duds subsequently encountered. 

                Almost 20 percent of the cluster munition duds found in Kuwait 

                in 2002 were from Rockeye bombs. -- The CBU-87 Combined Effects 

                Munition with BLU-97 submunitions had a failure rate of at least 

                7 percent in Yugoslavia and Kosovo in 1999. More than 10,000 air-dropped 

                CBU-87s with more than 2 million submunitions were used in the 

                Gulf War; more than 1,000 with over 200,000 submunitions were 

                used in Afghanistan. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United 

                States has cluster munitions containing more than one billion 

                submunitions in current stockpiles, including more than 434 million 

                155mm DPICM artillery submunitions and more than 309 million MLRS 

                rocket submunitions. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights 

                Watch has called for a global moratorium on use of cluster munitions 

                until the humanitarian problems are addressed. Short of that commitment, 

                Human Rights Watch urges that the United States, United Kingdom, 

                and others that may deploy cluster munitions in Iraq take the 

                following steps: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Prohibit 

                the use of any cluster munitions in attacks on or near populated 

                areas; -- Suspend use of and withdraw cluster munitions that have 

                been tested and identified as producing high dud rates; -- Refrain 

                from using or transferring out-of-date types of cluster munitions 

                in an effort to "clean the closet" of stockpiles; -- Record, report, 

                track and mark known or suspected cluster munition strike areas; 

                and, -- Preserve this information so it can be disseminated quickly 

                in clearance efforts. </font>
