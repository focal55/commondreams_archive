- May 13 - Wild Oats Markets, 

Inc, a leading chain of natural food stores, pledged to be the 

first grocer outside of California to post warnings at seafood 

counters advising women and children to avoid or limit consumption 

of certain mercury-tainted seafood. In a written statement, Wild 

Oats said, "By providing this information to our customers, we are 

allowing them to make informed choices on the food they purchase 

and consume." The Zero Mercury Campaign praised Wild Oats for 

taking the lead in warning at-risk populations about mercury 

contaminated fish and urged other supermarkets and grocers -- as 

well as fish markets and restaurants-to follow suit.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We commend Wild Oats for warning shoppers at all 101 of their 

stores in twenty-five states about exposure risks from mercury in 

fish," said Michael Bender, director of the Mercury Policy Project. 

"Wild Oats is demonstrating a high level of corporate 

responsibility and genuine concern for the health and well-being of 

their customers." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">State and federal health agencies warn pregnant and nursing 

women and their young children against eating swordfish and other 

fish because mercury can cause brain damage and health consequences 

even in low concentrations. Mercury from such sources as 

coal-burning power plants and incinerators is released into the air 

and moves up the food chain and eventually into larger predators 

like shark, swordfish and tuna. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Wild Oats' pledge to educate consumers about mercury 

contamination in some fish is trend-setting," said Jon Hinck, 

toxics project director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine 

which is a member of the Zero Mercury Campaign. "We are also 

pleased to hear that Wild Oats also supports clean air initiatives 

to reduce mercury pollution." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wild Oats postings come on the heels of lawsuits filed in 

California by the Attorney General against fish retailers and 

restaurants to warn consumers about mercury contaminated seafood. 

In February, several grocery store chains -- including Safeway, 

Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Kroger's and Albertson's -- responded by 

posting warnings in their California stores urging mothers and 

children to not eat swordfish and shark, and to limit consumption 

of other fish, including fresh or frozen tuna. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We praise Wild Oats for taking this initiative, but posting 

these warnings should not be optional for stores, restaurants, and 

markets that are selling mercury-contaminated fish," said Elizabeth 

Saunders of Clean Water Action. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A recent report by the Centers for Disease Control estimated 

that one in 12 women of childbearing age in the United States have 

unsafe mercury levels, translating to over 300,000 babies born at 

risk each year.
