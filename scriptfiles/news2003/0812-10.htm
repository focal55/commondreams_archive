<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MANCHESTER, NH  - August 12 -  Responding to a statement at a campaign event today by Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana (GSMM), Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) reiterated his support for changing federal law to allow people with cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, and other serious illnesses to have medical marijuana, with their doctors' approval.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   During the opening of Kucinich's New Hampshire campaign headquarters, GSMM member Linda Macia, who suffers from several debilitating illnesses for which conventional medications have not provided relief, thanked Rep. Kucinich for his support.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Macia said, &quot;I want to thank you for your compassion for seriously ill medical marijuana patients and for your passionate support of the Hinchey Amendment,&quot; referring to a speech Kucinich gave on July 22, urging his colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to support an amendment to an appropriations bill that would have barred the Justice Department and Drug Enforcement Administration from spending any money to raid or arrest medical marijuana patients and providers in the states that have eliminated or reduced penalties for the medical use of marijuana.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Kucinich responded, &quot;It's not even a question, if someone needs it.&quot; Kucinich then left the podium and stepped toward a teary-eyed Macia to hug her. &quot;How are you doing?&quot; Kucinich asked. Macia responded, &quot;I'm in a lot of pain.&quot; When Kucinich returned to the podium, he said, &quot;Thank you, Linda. ... In my administration, you're going to get the help you need.&quot;</font></p>

<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congressman Kucinich has made the strongest statements about medical marijuana of any of the nine Democratic presidential contenders, and he should be thanked for his compassion,&quot; said GSMM Campaign Coordinator Aaron Houston. &quot;Seriously ill people who are simply trying to take their medicine can count on Kucinich to protect them from arrest and prison.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Rep. Kucinich previously said he supports medical marijuana &quot;without reservation.&quot; In a May 29 San Francisco Chronicle interview, Kucinich said, &quot;Compassion requires that medical marijuana be available ... to any patient who needs it to alleviate pain and suffering.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   In a CNN/Time poll published Nov. 4, 2002, 80 percent of Americans supported legal access to medical marijuana. In a resolution adopted this July, the American Nurses Association endorsed &quot;legislation to remove criminal penalties including arrest and imprisonment for bona fide patients and prescribers of therapeutic marijuana.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   <i>Based in Manchester, New Hampshire, Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana is a grassroots coalition of patients and activists. GSMM is organizing during the New Hampshire presidential primary campaign to raise awareness of the need for federal action to protect medical marijuana patients.</i></font></p>
