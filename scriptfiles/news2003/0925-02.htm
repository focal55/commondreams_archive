-  

September 25 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), leader of the opposition to the war against Iraq in the House, issued the following statement on recent press accounts that the chief Administration weapons inspector has found no evidence of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons in Iraq:</font>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's news account is no surprise to those of us who said all along that Iraq was not an imminent threat and that this war was unnecessary. There can be no dispute now that this Administration sent this country to war based on falsehoods and lies.</font></p>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Time and time again in their campaign to sell the war, the Administration cited evidence of 'vast stockpiles' of weapons of mass destruction to mislead the country into believing that Iraq was a imminent threat. We now know that this orchestrated campaign of deception, from the President on down, was used solely to play on the fears of Americans and to misled Congress. </font></p>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mr. President, where are the 'vast stockpiles' of weapons of mass destruction? What is the justification for this unnecessary and unsuccessful war?</font></p>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is long past time for this Administration to step forward and be honest with the American people. They owe it to the families and loved ones of the 305 brave men and women who have died in Iraq, and they owe it to every American taxpayer who they are now asking to foot the $87 billion bill.</font></p>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This report, debunking a year and half long campaign by the President and his top aides, further strips away at the credibility of this Administration both at home and abroad. It is time for the United States to become a willing partner in the international community and work with, not further alienate, our friends and allies to bring peace and stability to the region.&quot;</font></p>
