- September 5 -  

A recent report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) confirms that Superfund's trust fund will be depleted by next month, leaving regular taxpayers to shoulder the financial burden for toxic cleanups. The nation's preeminent toxic waste cleanup program has been plagued by under-funding and a dramatic slowdown in the pace of cleanups, leaving communities exposed to dangerous toxic chemicals.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We've known for a long time that the Superfund trust fund was running out, but unfortunately the President and Congress have continually failed to reinstate Superfund's polluter pays fees, leaving regular taxpayers to foot the bill,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Environmental Health Advocate Julie Wolk.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress allowed Superfund's polluter pays fees to expire in 1995, giving polluters a 4 million dollar a day tax holiday and forcing regular taxpayers to foot more and more of the bill for toxic cleanups. As the trust fund dwindles to zero, regular taxpayers, who paid 18 percent of program costs in 1996, will likely pay at least 79 percent of program costs next year. By the following year, when the trust fund is exhausted, taxpayers will foot virtually the entire bill, while polluters get a $4 million per day tax holiday. Former Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton all collected or supported reinstatement of the polluter pays fees, but the Bush administration has expressed its opposition to reinstating the fees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At the same time that taxpayers are paying more and polluters are paying less, the number of Superfund sites getting cleaned up has dropped by more than half,&quot; said Wolk. &quot;This means that that the one in four Americans who still lives within four miles of a Superfund toxic waste site will be exposed to toxic chemicals for even longer periods of time,&quot; she concluded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, the Bush Administration cleaned up only 42 Superfund toxic waste sites and expects to clean up approximately 40 sites this year. This is a more than 50% decrease from the late 1990's when EPA cleaned up an average of 87 sites per year. According to a congressionally requested study completed in 2001, the Bush administration has under-funded the Superfund program by between $1.2 and $1.8 billion from 2001-2004, leaving communities across America at risk of chemical exposure and the diseases caused by toxic chemicals.</font></p>
