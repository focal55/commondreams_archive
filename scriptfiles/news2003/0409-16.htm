                - April 9 - U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige should repudiate 

                his recent remarks favoring Christianity in public schools and 

                expressing hostility toward religious diversity, according to 

                Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an April 

                  8 letter to Paige, Americans United demanded that the federal 

                  official apologize for his remarks about religion in the schools 

                  or step down from his public post.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paige, in 

                  an interview reported by the Baptist Press News Service on April 

                  7, said, &#147;All things equal, I would prefer to have a child 

                  in a school that has a strong appreciation for the values of 

                  the Christian community, where a child is taught to have a strong 

                  faith. Where a child is taught that, there is a source of strength 

                  greater than themselves.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The education 

                  official also reportedly said that as a Christian, he is puzzled 

                  by the animosity to God in public school settings.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The 

                  reason that Christian schools and Christian universities are 

                  growing is a result of a strong value system,&quot; he said. 

                  &quot;In a religious environment the value system is set. That's 

                  not the case in a public school where there are so many different 

                  kids with different kinds of values.&#148;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Rev. 

                  Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive director, said Paige&#146;s 

                  remarks amount to government promotion of Christianity and an 

                  attack on religious pluralism in the public schools.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Secretary 

                  Paige&#146;s comments are outrageous and offensive,&#148; said 

                  Lynn. &#147;Our public schools serve children from varied religious 

                  backgrounds. As our nation&#146;s top educator, Dr. Paige should 

                  celebrate religious diversity, not denigrate it.&#148;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Continued 

                  Lynn, &#147;Religious pluralism strengthens our nation; it doesn&#146;t 

                  weaken it. If Dr. Paige does not understand this, he should 

                  resign.&#148;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter 

                  to Paige, Lynn wrote, &#147;I am disappointed that you, as the 

                  leader of America&#146;s public education system, apparently 

                  have little appreciation for the great religious diversity of 

                  our nation and our public school system. I am writing to you 

                  today to strongly urge you to repudiate these statements immediately 

                  and publicly reaffirm your commitment to a public school system 

                  that welcomes and values young people of all religious faiths 

                  and none.&#148;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concluded 

                  Lynn, &#147;I urge you, as strongly as I can, to repudiate these 

                  unfortunate comments at the earliest opportunity. If you cannot 

                  in good conscience do so, then please resign your post. The 

                  position of Education Secretary should be occupied by someone 

                  who not only understands, but indeed values, this nation&#146;s 

                  commitment to religious diversity and separation of church and 

                  state.&#148;</font></p>
