                - March 13 - Two national advocacy groups are seeking the release 

                of a document being withheld by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 

                (NRC) that will indicate how the agency will handle the licensing 

                and public hearings for a uranium enrichment plant in central 

                Tennessee. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The document 

                contains the commissioners’ response to six "white papers" submitted 

                last spring by Louisiana Energy Services (LES), a private consortium 

                that wants to build the plant. The "white papers" are memos focusing 

                on licensing issues that may be contentious, such as whether the 

                consortium is targeting an economically depressed area and whether 

                the plant is needed. The papers are an attempt to persuade the 

                commissioners to decide how they will handle critical licensing 

                issues before LES submits a license application. Public hearings 

                on similar issues resulted in the denial of a license for a proposed 

                LES plant in Homer, La., in 1997. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both the Nuclear 

                Information and Resource Service (NIRS) and Public Citizen have 

                submitted comments on the "white papers." At the urging of NIRS, 

                the NRC invited the public to respond to the memos. The agency 

                has received more than 350 comments, almost all urging the NRC 

                to reject the consortium’s position. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Commissioners 

                have outlined their views on the issues and have informed the 

                agency’s staff, according to the trade publication Inside NRC 

                (March 10, 2003), but they have yet to make their views public. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 11, 

                Public Citizen sent a letter to NRC Chairman Richard Meserve, 

                asking that the document be released and that the NRC explain 

                what procedure it would use to license the proposed LES plant. 

                On March 12, NIRS submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 

                request for the document. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The public 

                deserves to know if the NRC commissioners have capitulated to 

                the consortium’s unreasonable demands that the agency pre-determine 

                controversial licensing issues, which would make a mockery of 

                the public hearing process," said Wenonah Hauter, director of 

                Public Citizen’ s Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"LES asked 

                the NRC to rule in its favor before a public hearing on exactly 

                those issues that resulted in the company’s license being denied 

                in Louisiana, including critical issues of environmental justice, 

                disposal of radioactive waste, and whether the plant is even needed—which 

                it’s not," said Michael Mariotte, executive director of NIRS. 

                "We intend to sue the NRC if it adopts LES’ positions, so the 

                agency might as well tell us now if it intends to act on behalf 

                of this company or on behalf of the public." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the 

                groups hope that the NRC’s reluctance to release the document 

                may indicate that the agency has decided to rule against LES. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"LES has been 

                looking for a positive signal from the NRC," Mariotte said. "But 

                the NRC so far isn’t providing that signal. This may be just another 

                blow to the LES project, which is already staggering from its 

                inability to obtain a zoning change in Tennessee and the March 

                10 withdrawal of the Canadian company Cameco, which held a 20 

                percent interest in the project, from the LES consortium." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LES is dominated 

                by the European uranium enrichment firm Urenco, which itself is 

                a consortium composed of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., the Dutch 

                government and various German firms. Other LES partners include 

                Westinghouse (itself a division of BNFL) and three U.S. nuclear 

                utilities: Exelon, Entergy and Duke Power. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LES announced 

                plans in 1989 to build a uranium enrichment plant near Homer. 

                But a local citizens group, Citizens Against Nuclear Trash, aided 

                by NIRS, Earthjustice and others, successfully challenged the 

                consortium’s license application, resulting in the first-ever 

                denial of a license by the NRC. </font>
