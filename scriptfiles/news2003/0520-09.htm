- May 20 - The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), the motor voter law, was signed into law on May 20, 1993.  “The League has been relentless as a ‘fighter for freedom,’ President Clinton noted ten years ago, ‘impatient with an imperfect democracy and dedicated to widening the circle of liberty to encompass more and more of our fellow citizens,’” remembered Kay J. Maxwell, president of the League of Women Voters of the United States.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“As we look back at the progress made under the motor voter law, it is clear that it did what it was intended to do - get more Americans on the rolls.  NVRA would make voter registration easier and more accessible to all, and it did,” noted Maxwell.  “According to the Federal Election Commission voter rolls have increased, with 22 million more Americans being registered to vote in the 2000 elections than were in 1992.  Motor voter made democracy more accessible to American citizens,” said Maxwell.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The battle for voting rights has continued since passage of motor voter.  As League President Becky Cain predicted ten years ago, ‘the real test for motor voter will come in implementation,’” Maxwell stated.  “Problems persist, like the inability of states to get the names from DMV offices to the voter rolls.  States need to spend the money to ensure that voters who register actually get their names on the rolls, cast ballots and have their votes counted,” urged Maxwell.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Last year’s passage of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) was a historic step,” Maxwell added.  “The League, instrumental in the fight for HAVA, is now helping to implement this law nationwide, taking active roles on state planning commissions and ensuring that its reforms – provisional ballots, better voting machines, statewide registration lists and more and better trained poll workers - are in place at the polls in 2004,” said Maxwell.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“What will get voters to the polls is a campaign where the candidates reach out to them and reconnects ordinary citizens with their government.  Thanks to motor voter, the voters are there if the candidates reach out to them,” Maxwell concluded.
