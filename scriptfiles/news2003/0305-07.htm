                - March 5 - </font>The National Council on Disability (NCD) released 

                two policy briefs analyzing and responding to certain flawed aspects 

                of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) decisions of the 

                U.S. Supreme Court -- "Chevron vs. Echazabal: The ADA's 'Direct 

                Threat to Self' Defense" (2/27), and "Reasonable Accommodation 

                After Barnett" (3/5) (<a href="http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/03publications.html" target="_new">http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/03publications.html</a>). 

                <p></p>

                "Chevron vs. Echazabal: The ADA's 'Direct Threat to Self' Defense 

                provides a synopsis with the legal disposition of the case. It 

                also examines the implications of the Court's Chevron decision 

                for ADA law and disability policy and makes recommendations to 

                align the definition of "direct threat" with Congressional intent. 

                The paper also includes a section describing the practical effects 

                of the Chevron decision on Mario Echazabal and its ramifications 

                for other people with disabilities. 

                <p></p>

                "Reasonable Accommodation After Barnett" examines the implications 

                of the U.S. Airways Inc., vs. Barnett decision, especially in 

                light of prior circuit court decisions on reasonable accommodation, 

                and looks at how subsequent cases are interpreting Barnett. The 

                paper addresses some of the larger issues raised by the case; 

                what happens when the employment and economic goals of the ADA 

                seem to clash with already established economic priorities and 

                expectations; who has the higher "right" to a job when demand 

                is higher than supply? 

                <p></p>

                In future papers in this series, NCD will examine various specific 

                substantive aspects of the Court's rulings that have weakened 

                or restricted the impact of the ADA. 

                <p></p>

                NCD plans to address some limitations the Court has imposed on 

                the remedies available in ADA cases and take a cross-issue look 

                at the consequences of the Supreme Court's decisions by contrasting 

                the state of the law before the decisions were rendered with the 

                legal situation after the decisions, to identify undesirable and 

                unjust results in the decisions of the lower courts as a result 

                of the Supreme Court's rulings. 

                <p></p>

                NCD will then develop legislative proposals for addressing those 

                issues that appear appropriate for legislative correction, and 

                present those proposals, along with pertinent supportive material 

                from the previous papers in a final, comprehensive report Righting 

                the ADA.
