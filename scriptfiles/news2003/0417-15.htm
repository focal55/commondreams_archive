                  BAGHDAD (16 April, 2003) - Voices in the Wilderness representatives 

                  met today with the U.S. Military's Civil Military Operations 

                  Center (CMOC) in their headquarters at the Palestine Hotel to 

                  discuss the emergency, humanitarian crisis facing Baghdad. Trash 

                  removal has not occurred for a month. Electricity, Sanitation 

                  and Communications were all seriously damaged during the U.S. 

                  war, and have yet to be restored in Baghdad. Cholera outbreaks 

                  have been reported in Basra, and rumored to have been found 

                  in the central Iraqi city of Hilla. Some of the local clinics 

                  are up and running, but medications for conditions such as hypertension 

                  and diabetes are no longer available. Quality control equipment 

                  and systems are also unavailable, and the lack of quality control 

                  could lead to serious problems in treatment, as well as creating 

                  the potential for epidemics due to contaminated blood products. 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The previous 

                  distribution system set up under the &quot;Oil-for-Food&quot; 

                  program is in total collapse, and - unless essential services 

                  are immediately restored - Iraq faces a humanitarian catastrophe.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prior to 

                  the war, the Pentagon set up Humanitarian Operations Coordination 

                  Centers (the HOC in Qatar and Kuwait, and the HAC in Jordan), 

                  as well as disaster assistance response teams (DART), to coordinate 

                  relief efforts between the U.S. military and United Nations 

                  and non-governmental organizations. Not only are HOC, HAC, and 

                  DART personnel not in Baghdad yet, CMOC was not even aware of 

                  the existence of these other military-humanitarian coordinating 

                  bodies. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CMOC reported 

                  that they did not yet have a plan for how to restore essential 

                  services in Baghdad, but are working on creating such a plan 

                  today. However, that information will not be publicly available 

                  for review, and will only be shared with organizations that 

                  agree to work with the U.S. Military in Baghdad - cutting out 

                  any humanitarian agency that insists on maintaining neutrality. 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CMOC also 

                  reported that they spent several days locating hospitals, power 

                  plants, and water &amp; sanitation plants in order to do needs 

                  assessments. Apparently no one in the U.S. Military thought 

                  to ask the United Nations, or other international organizations 

                  working in Iraq, for any of this information prior to, or even 

                  after, the fall of Baghdad. The World Health Organization and 

                  the Red Cross have been working in Iraq for years. The United 

                  Nations Development program has been working to assist Iraq 

                  in restoring electricity since 1996. Locations and assessments 

                  of civilian infrastructures are not secret information - except 

                  in the Pentagon's world. Why didn't anyone ask for this information? 

                  Why wasn't a plan for rehabilitation developed prior to the 

                  war? </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When told 

                  that of rumors of a cholera outbreak in Hilla, CMOC even asked 

                  Voices in the Wilderness where that neighborhood was located 

                  in Baghdad - unaware that Hilla is a major Iraqi city located 

                  approximately 1 hour south of Baghdad! </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The biggest 

                  problem CMOC reported is the lack of local workers needed to 

                  get civilian systems up and running. However, CMOC seemed unaware 

                  that the mostly unmanned roadblocks put up throughout the city 

                  are making it difficult for anyone to get to work, as is the 

                  lack of a coordinating body responsible for organizing these 

                  efforts. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PROBLEMS 

                  THAT NEED TO BE IMMEDIATELY ADDRESSED:</font></p>

                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A coordinating 

                    body, not associated with any military organization, needs

                    efforts by all of the agencies working, or seeking to work, 

                    in Iraq. Previously, this was the corrupt, but functional,

                      administrators at hospitals and other civilian centers fled

                      chaotic conditions where lower-level staff are unsure who, 

                      if anyone, has the authority to make urgent decisions. This 

                      &quot;power vacuum&quot; must be immediately filled by creating 

                      new, decision-making-structures, not corrupted by the previous 

                      regime.<br>

                    crisis caused by their war. The international community must 

                    exert itself, and return UN control to dealing with this crisis, 

                    until Iraqis can form a government of their own to deal with 

                    the problems created by 12 years of sanctions and war. </font></li>
