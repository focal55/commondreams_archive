- May 1 - Nearly half the American 

population-more than 137 million Americans-continues to breathe 

unhealthy amounts of the toxic air pollutant ozone (smog), 

according to the American Lung Association State of the Air: 2003 

report released today. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The annual report cites that moderate improvements in smog 

levels are due to a break from summer heat, not air pollution 

cleanup activities, further illustrating the urgency for Americans 

to fight for cleaner air in the face of potentially devastating 

changes in the nation's environmental policies. The Lung 

Association anticipates increasing numbers in its 2004 report, 

which will include data from the hot 2002 summer. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report was released in the shadow of the Administration's 

rollback of key Clean Air Act provisions and additional proposals 

that would weaken public health protections of that law, thereby 

denying tens of millions of Americans healthy air for the 

foreseeable future. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Lung Association urges Americans to contact members 

of Congress to oppose any bills that would weaken the Clean Air Act 

and to contact EPA by May 3, 2003 to oppose the proposed changes 

that would weaken the New Source Review provisions. Americans can 

log on to <a href="http://www.lungusa.org" target="_new">http://www.lungusa.org</a> to make their voice heard to 

Congress and EPA on these critical issues. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Four years into the American Lung Association State of the Air 

reports, where we've analyzed data since the mid-1990s, we can 

point to no significant ozone improvements other than a few lucky 

changes in the weather," said John Kirkwood, president and chief 

executive officer of the American Lung Association. "We can't 

depend on Mother Nature to protect Americans from disease and death 

caused by breathing human-made smog. It's time to fight for our 

right to breathe clean air and for America to solve the air 

pollution problems that Americans create." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The release of the American Lung Association State of the Air: 

2003 also marks the beginning of the annual ozone season, when the 

summer heat traditionally causes smog levels to rise across the 

nation. The report examines ozone air quality data for 1999-2001, 

which are the most recent quality-assured data from the U.S. 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The report grades and ranks 

counties on how often their air quality reaches "unhealthful" 

categories of the EPA's Air Quality Index for ozone air pollution. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the fourth consecutive year, four California metropolitan 

areas-Los Angeles, Fresno, Bakersfield, and 

Visalia-Tulare-Porterville-top the list of America's smoggiest 

cities, followed by Houston-Galveston-Brazoria, Texas. Rounding out 

the top 10 most ozone-polluted cities list are Sacramento-Yolo and 

Merced, Calif. and three Southeastern locales-Atlanta, Ga., 

Knoxville, Tenn., and the Charlotte, N.C. metropolitan areas. The 

report found that over half-55.5 percent-of counties with ozone 

monitors received an "F" rating. While this year's report includes 

data from 14 additional counties, only five million fewer Americans 

live in counties that received an "F," compared with the 2002 

report. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We see a tiny dip in the number of Americans directly affected 

by ozone, but at these huge numbers, it's insignificant," said 

Kirkwood. "Smog control has been held up for years, and now we risk 

losing some important tools we have in the Clean Air Act that are 

based on protecting our health. In the meantime, kids with asthma 

and people with any lung disease run a very real risk of suffering 

respiratory problems from breathing ozone. Even healthy, active 

adults can find it hard to breathe." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Threats to the Clean Air Act -- 

The American Lung Association's report cites two administration 

initiatives that would repeal, weaken, and delay Clean Air Act 

safeguards: regulatory changes that roll back the "New Source 

Review" safeguards, and the administration's proposed legislative 

air pollution plan, unconvincingly called the Clear Skies 

Initiative. Compounding years of legal issues that have stalled 

full implementation of the Clean Air Act, these actions would 

cripple the Act, prohibiting or delaying measures intended to 

protect public health. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In February 2003, the American Lung Association, as part of an 

environmental coalition, filed a lawsuit against EPA for adopting 

illegal changes to New Source Review, a provision of the Clean Air 

Act that requires approximately 17,000 of the nation's oldest and 

dirtiest power plants, oil refineries and other industrial 

facilities to meet emissions standards applicable to new facilities 

by installing up-to-date-pollution control devices whenever the 

plants make changes that increase pollution. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Trying to drastically weaken New Source Review is the tip of 

the iceberg of policy changes that would weaken the core of the 

Clean Air Act, which has helped protect public health for 40 

years," said Kirkwood. "We are at risk of losing major advances in 

our nation's air quality to politics. Clean air is a health issue 

and is being tossed aside to benefit industry-our biggest source of 

outdoor air pollution." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration's legislative air pollution plan would hurt 

public health and help big polluters by delaying and diluting cuts 

in power plants' sulfur, nitrogen and mercury pollution compared to 

timely enforcement of current law. The administration plan would 

roll back the current law's public health safeguards to protect 

local air quality, curb pollution from upwind states and protect 

our national parks. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The American Lung Association has fought for clean air for 30 

years, and we will continue to defend the strongest tool we 

have--the Clean Air Act--until we achieve cleaner, healthy air for 

all Americans," said Kirkwood. "The relationship between air 

pollution and lung disease is undeniable. That's why clean air 

remains a priority goal for the American Lung Association." 

</font>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- American Lung Association State of the Air: 2003 Report 

Highlights -- 

Ninety-three counties' ratings improved by at least one grade 

since last year's report, while 26 counties received lower grades 

this year. Only two cities-Redding, Calif., and Chattanooga, 

Tenn.-stepped off last year's list of most ozone-polluted cities; 

both, however, maintained their F grades despite the change in 

ranking. Six counties-Blount, Tenn., Douglas, Ga., Knox, Tenn., 

Fayette, Ga., Maricopa, Ariz., and Wake, N.C.-were deleted from 

this year's list of the 25 most ozone-polluted counties, replaced 

by Nevada, Calif., Placer, Calif., Tarrant, Texas, Henry, Ga., 

Camden, N.J., and Hartford, Md. Of the newcomers, only Camden 

County, N.J. has ever been on this list before. Louisville, Ky. and 

Allentown-Bethlehem-Eaton, Pa. are newcomers to the nation's top 25 

smoggiest metropolitan areas since last year. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 7.4 million adults with asthma and nearly two million 

children suffering from asthma attacks live in counties that 

received an "F" grade in ozone air pollution. Those totals 

represent 70 percent of the 10.6 million American adults with 

asthma and 69 percent of the 2.8 million children who have had an 

asthma attack and live in counties with an ozone monitor. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Lung Association State of the Air: 2003 report also 

presents new analyses of regional ozone sources and trends, as well 

as examining ozone transport-the pollutants being carried by 

winds-that leads to unhealthy smog levels even in regions where 

smog is not actually created. Ozone not only moves into a state 

from the outside but also moves within the state. Some air 

pollution episodes have been followed hour-by-hour as they move 

city-by-city within a state. In many cases, the highest levels of 

ozone will show up in suburban areas downwind of larger 

communities. Some regions, including the Southeast and Midwest, are 

notable as sources of transported ozone affecting cities and states 

within the region and outside it; they lead the nation in emissions 

of both volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides-the two 

essential groups of gases required to make ozone. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- About Ozone -- 

Ozone is a highly reactive form of oxygen that results primarily 

from the action of sunlight on hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, 

which are emitted in a variety of activities, especially fuel 

combustion. Ozone levels typically rise between May and October 

when higher temperatures and increased amounts of sunlight combine 

with stagnant atmospheric conditions that are associated with smog 

episodes. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even relatively low ozone levels can affect healthy people's 

ability to breathe, leading to shortness of breath, chest pain when 

inhaling deeply, wheezing and coughing. Long-term exposure can 

result in reduced breathing ability and increases the risk of 

respiratory disease later in life. Children, the elderly and 

individuals with chronic lung disease, such as asthma, are at 

greatest risk of breathing problems from ozone exposure. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We had made great progress through the 1980s in reducing smog, 

but unhealthy ozone levels actually increased in some regions 

during the '90s," said Kirkwood. "We need to make major policy 

changes that will have a long-term, positive impact on our smog 

problem." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- What Americans Can Do -- 

"Americans' right to breathe clean air is being threatened," 

said Kirkwood. "We need individuals to fight for the Clean Air Act, 

support New Source Review, and oppose efforts that benefit big 

polluters and harm public health."
