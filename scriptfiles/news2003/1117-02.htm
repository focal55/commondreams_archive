- November 17 - The U.S. Justice Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
and Explosives (ATF) is continuing to place the general public at risk by refusing 
to use its regulatory powers to restrict the availability of a handgun disguised 
as a pen, the Violence Policy Center (VPC) charged today. Recently, the gun's 
manufacturer, Canadian citizen Marc Lefebvre, president of Stinger Manufacturing 
Co., Inc., bragged, &quot;If I put it [the pen gun] on the table, no one will 
know it's a pistol. If no one had ever seen our product, 80 percent of them would 
not know what it is.&quot; At the same time, an ATF spokesman has acknowledged 
that &quot;We [ATF] have the ability to re-evaluate this gun but I don't know 
if we are going to at this time.&quot; Stinger is reported to have sold approximately 
4,000 of its pen guns. </FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">ATF's 
inaction is in spite of an October 2002 &quot;Officer Safety Bulletin&quot; warning 
about the Stinger pen gun issued nationally by the U.S. Air Force Office of Special 
Investigations based at Andrews Air Force Base, and warnings by the Department 
of Homeland Security that terrorists might attempt to use ordinary items to conceal 
explosives or weapons&#151;the exact purpose of a pen gun. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Under 
federal law &quot;Gadget-type firearms and `pen' guns which fire fixed ammunition&quot; 
are classified as an &quot;Any Other Weapon&quot; (AOW) under the National Firearms 
Act of 1934 (NFA) and come under the NFA's strict licensing and registration regimen. 
To purchase an &quot;Any Other Weapon,&quot; the buyer must go through an extended 
and extremely detailed background check, register the weapon, and receive approval 
from local law enforcement. ATF distinguishes Stinger's pen gun from other such 
weapons and treats them as standard handguns simply because in order to be fired, 
the &quot;grip,&quot; or handle, of the gun must be angled to its barrel. ATF 
could immediately re-classify the pen gun as an AOW if it chose to do so. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">VPC 
Executive Director Josh Sugarmann asks, &quot;What will it take for ATF to exercise 
its regulatory authority&#151;and governmental responsibility&#151;to reclassify 
this weapon? Stinger's pen gun can be re-classified tomorrow to protect public 
safety on our streets, in our offices, in the air, and across borders. Yet blinded 
by its growing fealty to the gun industry, ATF seems willing to wait for tragedy 
before acting.&quot; </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
Stinger pen gun, manufactured in Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan, is 5.6 inches long, 
weighs only five ounces when empty, and retails for $250. It is currently available 
in 17 and 22 caliber, with more calibers &quot;Coming Soon!&quot; Stinger's web 
site (www.stingerpengun.com) boasts, &quot;The Stinger Pengun is the only legal 
pengun in the world&quot; and promises that the gun opens up &quot;A whole new 
world of possibilities.&quot; A past advertisement displayed on the site states 
that the gun &quot;Transforms From A `Pen' To A Legal Pistol In 2 Seconds.&quot; 
Soon-to-be marketed accessories include an 18-inch &quot;sniper barrel&quot; and 
attachable &quot;heart dagger.&quot; According to Stinger's Lefebvre, &quot;Some 
people use them as a concealed carry weapon, because it's a very concealable weapon.&quot; 
Stinger also manufactures the &quot;Survivor Knifegun,&quot;&#151;a handgun concealed 
in a pocket knife with blade. The $375 &quot;Knifegun&quot; is 3.7 inches long, 
1.09 inches wide, weighs 12 ounces, and is also classified by ATF as a standard 
handgun.</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
