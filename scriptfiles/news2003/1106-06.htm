- November 6 - From New York to Texas to Oregon, hundreds of volunteers in dozens of cities nationwide will join together on Saturday, November 8th to urge Ford Motor Company to raise the fuel economy of its vehicles. The activities are part of a national Day of Action against Ford Motor Company organized by the Sierra Club, Rainforest Action Network, Global Exchange, the Sierra Student Coalition, and others. Leading activists will speak about the benefits of hybrid technology and other existing fuel-saving innovations that could make all of Ford's cars, trucks, and SUVs go farther on a gallon of gas to save money at the gas pump, curb global warming, and cut America's oil dependence.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're urging Ford to build the kind of clean, innovative cars we know people want,&quot; said Jason Mark of Global Exchange. &quot;Cars that go further on a gallon of gas would save people money at the gas pump, cut the country's dependence on oil, and reduce global warming pollution.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Starting Friday and extending through the weekend, citizens across the country will hold events outside of local Ford dealerships in their communities.  They will present Ford representatives with tens of thousands of postcards and photos from local community members calling on Ford Motor Co. CEO Bill Ford to 'Picture Clean Cars.'  Activists will also inflate a 15-foot tall SUV outside of Ford's lobbying headquarters in Washington, DC. Local events will feature hybrid vehicles and other clean car technologies. The events will coincide with a national radio outreach campaign in 21 media markets nationwide, calling on Ford to put existing gas-saving technology in all its new vehicles.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ford CEO Bill Ford, Jr. understands that building cleaner cars is good for the environment and good for his company,&quot; said Brendan Bell of the Sierra Club's Global Warming program. &quot;Yet Ford is failing to put this understanding into action.  Ford has broken its commitment to raise the fuel economy of its SUVs and continues to postpone the introduction of its first hybrid vehicle.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a 2003 EPA report, Ford's vehicles rank the lowest of any major automaker in overall fuel economy.  With nearly 2.5 million cars and light trucks sold in the United States in 2002, Ford's vehicles release more global warming pollution worldwide than the entire country of Mexico. Ford has fallen even further behind by recently rescinding a pledge to raise the fuel economy of its SUVs by 25%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is a better way,&quot; added Bell. &quot;Bill Ford Jr. should do the right thing and build cleaner cars-for our families, for our future.&quot;</font></p>
