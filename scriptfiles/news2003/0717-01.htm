(check local listings), NOW with Bill Moyers examines how the influence of 

the Tuna industry on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may be 

putting Americans and their children at risk for mercury poisoning. The 

report exposes that the FDA only tests about a dozen cans of Albacore 

tuna for mercury a year and doesn't ask to review the tuna industry's own 

tests. A consumer group's recent study indicates that as many as 22 

million cans of tuna could have mercury levels above the FDA's action 

level, which would make them subject to recall.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even though canned tuna is known to contain methyl mercury and is the 

third most popular item on grocery store shelves after sugar and coffee, it isn't listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in its current 

consumer advisory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We know there are people who are eating more canned tuna than is 

considered safe,&quot; says NOW's senior Washington correspondent Roberta 

Baskin. &quot;It's important that people get the information they need to assess the risk. But the FDA has, so far, been studying the mercury in tuna 

problem and lagging behind other governmental agencies on putting out 

clear advice about it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A startling fact revealed in the broadcast is that the Environmental 

Protection Agency's (EPA) mercury guidelines are much stricter than the FDA's. According to the EPA's standard, a 45-pound child eating just one 

six ounce can of white chunk Albacore tuna per week risks ingesting 

almost four times more mercury than is considered safe.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FDA, NOW reports, hasn't added tuna to its advisory because, the agency says, it doesn't want to scare consumers away from an affordable food with widely acknowledged health benefits. But last month, the World 

Health Organization and the United Nations' Food and Agriculture 

Organization cut in half its recommendation on how much mercury people 

can safely consume in their food. Reluctant to wait for the FDA to toughen 

their warnings, ten states have issued their own advisories on mercury levels in canned tuna: California, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, 

Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Washington, Wisconsin, and 

Vermont. </font></p>
