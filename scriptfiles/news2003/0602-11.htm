- June 2 - HHS Secretary Tommy G. 

Thompson today announced the release of 16 grants totaling nearly 

$3.5 million to support nursing education opportunities for 

individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The grants will fund scholarships or stipends and pre-entry 

preparation and retention activities for disadvantaged students, 

including students from racial and ethnic minority groups that 

are underrepresented among registered nurses. Minority 

enrollment in the nursing schools receiving grants averages 38 

percent, about double the national average of 19 percent. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These schools and programs have proven their ability to 

enroll and graduate competent, skilled health care workers, which 

is important in expanding access to health care for all 

Americans," Secretary Thompson said. "Today's grants will 

encourage minority students to enter the field of nursing and 

help alleviate the critical shortage at this time." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of minority groups account for about 30 percent of the 

total U.S. population, but they represent just over 12 percent of 

the nursing workforce. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nursing Workforce Diversity grants are funded through HHS' 

Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and its 

Bureau of Health Professions. This year's grantees are all 

nursing schools or non-profit organizations. Nursing centers, 

academic health centers, state and local governments and 

faith-based organizations are also eligible to apply for the 

grants. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These programs help ensure that a competent health 

professions workforce is prepared and available in areas where 

care is needed most," HRSA Administrator Elizabeth M. Duke said. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Secretary Thompson identified the nation's nursing shortage as 

a national priority early in his tenure. HHS funding for nursing 

programs will reach $113 million in fiscal year 2003, $20 million 

more than last year's total. The Nurse Reinvestment Act of 2002, 

which President Bush signed in August, authorized six new grant 

programs to further increase the number of nurses and improve the 

quality of nursing services. More information is available at 

http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/nursing/reinvestmentact.htm.
