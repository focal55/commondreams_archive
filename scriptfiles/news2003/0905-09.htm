- September 5 -  Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) was joined today by Senators Kennedy and Feingold and Representatives Conyers, George Miller, Frank, Filner, Lee, Grijalva and Woolsey in sending a letter to California Governor Gray Davis urging him to sign legislation to protect the civil rights of workers.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        The letter urges Governor Davis to sign the a bill, A.B.1715, passed by the State Legislature, that would prohibit employers from requiring, as a condition of employment, employees to sign mandatory arbitration agreements regarding civil rights claims. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        The letter states, </font></p>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We urge you to sign A.B.1715 and ensure the integrity of the many civil rights laws you have already signed into law, supporting the EEOC and all of the civil rights and labor groups that are working so hard to protect these fundamental democratic values.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        In the next few weeks Kucinich, and more than 50 other Democratic House members, will introduce the Preservation of Civil Rights Protections Act of 2003. Senators Kennedy and Feingold will introduce an identical bill in the Senate. The legislation, broader than the bill passed in the California, would require that any agreement to arbitrate an employment claim arising under any Federal statue be made post-dispute, in order to ensure that the agreement and waiver of rights is truly knowing and voluntary. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        The lawmakers continued in their letter, </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We view this battle against mandatory arbitration of workplace claims to be a fundamental issue of worker and civil rights. We intend to forcefully carry on the fight for the integrity of our civil rights and labor laws in Congress, in the courts, and with the public. Based on your long commitment to civil rights, we hope you can join us in this fight.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A.B. 1715 was passed by the California State Legislature on August 28, 2003. Governor Davis has until Monday, September 8, 2003, to sign the bill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For a copy of the letter please contact Doug Gordon at (202) 225-5871 or <a href="mailto:doug.gordon@mail.house.gov">doug.gordon@mail.house.gov</a>. </font></p>
