                  Normand is executive director and Zaidi is research director 

                  of the Center for Economic and Social Rights. The group recently 

                  released two reports: &quot;Tearing Up the Rules: The Illegality 

                  of Invading Iraq&quot; and &quot;Water Under Siege in Iraq: 

                  United States and British Military Forces Commit War Crimes 

                  in Iraq by Depriving Civilians of Access to Water.&quot; The 

                  second report analyzes the U.S. military attacks on the infrastructure 

                  of Iraq in 1991 and the current attacks on Basra and Baghdad, 

                  cities which have had infrastructure taken out. The report notes 

                  that in 1991: &quot;By disabling electricity and water, the 

                  U.S. intended to pressure the Iraqi leadership by imposing widespread 

                  suffering on the civilian population. Brig. Gen. Buster Glosson, 

                  the architect of the U.S. air war, stated that one purpose of 

                  the bombing was to 'put every household in an autonomous mode 

                  and make them feel they were isolated... I wanted to play with 

                  their psyche.' Another U.S. Air Force planner explained that 

                  'we wanted to let people know, &quot;we're not going to tolerate 

                  Saddam Hussein or his regime. Fix that and we'll fix your electricity.&quot;'&quot;

                  Professor of international law at Ohio State University, Quigley 

                  said today: &quot;Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, an occupying 

                  power has the obligation of 'ensuring the food and medical supplies 

                  of the population.' If news reports of the U.S. military conditioning 

                  the delivery of food supplies on Iraqis providing information 

                  are true, that is a violation of international law.&quot; </font>

                  President of the Center for Constitutional Rights, Ratner said 

                  today: &quot;This war is an aggressive war and is flatly contrary 

                  to international law. It is neither in self-defense nor has 

                  it been authorized by the Security Council. That makes it a 

                  crime against peace. </font>
