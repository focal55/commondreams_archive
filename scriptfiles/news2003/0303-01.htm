                - March 3 - On Saturday March 1 representatives from the anti 

                war movement from 26 countries and three continents met together 

                in London to plan the next steps in the world campaign against 

                war on Iraq. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All countries 

                reported rapidly growing opposition, and the meeting mapped out 

                a plan of escalating action over the next weeks to try to stop 

                war, including student occupations, mass direct action, strikes 

                and popular assemblies against war. (See statement below) </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If war starts 

                the meeting called on the movements across the world to organise 

                mass protests on the day of an attack in every town and city and 

                mass demonstrations in every capital city the following Saturday. 

                </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following the 

                unprecedented success of the global anti war day on February 15 

                we announce a massive escalation of action in the next weeks to 

                try to prevent war. We believe a war on Iraq is wrong whether 

                it has the backing of the United Nations or not. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There will 

                be direct action at military installations and to stop military 

                transport, mass pressure on parliamentary and United Nations representatives, 

                student strikes and occupations, workplace industrial action, 

                the establishment of peoples' assemblies and popular consultations 

                against war. Every day now is crucial in the campaign to stop 

                war. In many countries there will be mass demonstrations on International 

                Womens' Day March 8. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In many countries 

                there will be demonstrations, protests and mass civil disobedience 

                on March 15 in solidarity with the 'Converge on the White House' 

                demonstration in Washington. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">March 21st 

                will be wherever possible a day of workplace solidarity against 

                war. This will involve workplace assemblies and various forms 

                of industrial action. In some countries national strike action 

                against war is being already being planned on this day. We call 

                on trade unions everywhere to support and promote action against 

                war on March 21st. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We put the 

                warmongers on notice that if they ignore world opinion and launch 

                a new attack on Iraq there will be a tidal wave of resistance.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the day
