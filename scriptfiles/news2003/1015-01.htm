- October 15 - Renowned for 2 year tree-sit, activist/author Julia Butterfly Hill 
announces her refusal to pay taxes that support war and government 
corruption.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What:    Press Conference to announce the redirection of over 
$150,000 in federal 
taxes away from the US government and into various not-for-profit 
social         service and environmental organizations. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When:    Wednesday, October15th, 2003, 12:00 Noon</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Where:   Federal Building, San Francisco
       450 Golden Gate @ Polk, Lower Plaza Area </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why:      To speak out and stand up against the devastating effects 
of the US led war machine.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statement of Julia Butterfly Hill:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The annual US military spending far exceeds that of China, Iraq, 
Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Libya combined.  Yet, for all this 
spending, we as a nation are not safer, only more brutal.  We live in 
a time of profoundly devastating war&#139;a war that threatens our 
democracy, human rights, free speech, education, health care, social 
security, environment and of course, there is the murdering of an 
unknown tens of thousands of innocent people in Afghanistan and Iraq 
who we dare to marginalize as casualties.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">United States soldiers are being killed nearly every day.  And what 
is this war for?  To protect the big-money, oil interests of the 
elite.  Now the Bush Administration is demanding $87 BILLION DOLLARS 
($87,000,000,000) from the US citizens to rebuild a country that was 
destroyed by our bombs on the exaggerated pretense of Iraq's alleged 
possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, the greatest accumulations of weapons of mass destruction 
exist right here&#139;in the United States.  These weapons of death are 
funded by US citizens' tax dollars stolen from the basic necessities 
that better our society such as social services, education, health 
care and the safeguarding of human rights and our environment.  For 
example, under the Bush tax cuts that help to provide for war 
funding, Medicaid benefits are cut by $93 billion; Food Stamps will 
be cut by $13 billion; Temporary Assistance for Needy Families will 
be cut by $8 billion and in a move that reminds us who truly benefits 
from war and who loses, $14.6 billion is being cut from benefits for 
Veterans, including money for disabilities.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, our tax dollars are not only being spent to build the 
largest death machine humankind has ever known, but also the largest 
prison industrial complex in the world.  We seem to be able to come 
up with endless billions for war, yet we have children without 
textbooks in schools that are falling apart, where it is 
statistically more likely for a child of color to end up in prison 
than to get into college, where the laws that protect air and water 
quality and biodiversity are being destroyed, and health services are 
not equally accessible to all citizens as is the case in every other 
civilized nation on earth.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was raised by Christian parents who taught me about the Ten 
Commandments, the first of which is 'Thou Shall Not Kill'. Paying for 
the murder of innocent people with my tax dollars is something that I 
cannot do in good conscience.  It goes against every moral fiber of 
my being to support this cycle of uncontrolled madness, especially at 
the expense of such critical human necessities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I find it especially disturbing to see the Bush Administration 
having blatant ties to convicted corporate criminals such as 
Haliburton, which formed 35 offshore tax shelters when Vice President 
Dick Cheney was CEO.  While Haliburton has been avoiding paying 
untold millions of dollars in federal taxes, it was awarded a closed- door, no-bid contract from the Bush Administration to secure the oil 
supply of Iraq.  Unfortunately, this is just one example of the many 
instances where a corrupt system allows politically connected, mega- corporations to avoid paying taxes while the working class is forced 
to pay subsidies for big business with their hard-earned tax 
dollars.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thousands of others before me have taken this stand.  I am not 
avoiding paying taxes.  I have thought through this very carefully, 
and with a clear mind and heart I am humanely re-directing my tax 
payments to where they belong, because our current federal government 
refuses to do so.</font></p>
