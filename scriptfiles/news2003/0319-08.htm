                - March 19 - In a tremendous victory for America's environment, 

                52 Senators voted to turn back an effort today to drill for oil 

                in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. A bipartisan group of 

                Senators prevailed in safeguarding this national treasure and 

                the native people who depend on it, despite heavy lobbying by 

                the Bush administration and the oil industry. Senators passed 

                an amendment to strip Arctic drilling revenues from the Budget 

                Resolution, marking a pivotal vote in the 25-year fight to protect 

                the Arctic. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush Administration 

                tried to advance Arctic drilling through the complicated budget 

                process by slipping in an assumption of $2.15 billion in expected 

                revenues to the federal treasury from leasing and development 

                of the Arctic Refuge. When the Budget was brought to the floor 

                today, Senators Boxer offered an amendment to strip Arctic drilling 

                revenues from the bill, which prevailed by a vote of 52-48. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today's vote 

                is a big victory for America's environment and the American people, 

                and we're thrilled that a strong, bipartisan group of Senators 

                stood up to protect this spectacular landscape," said Carl Pope, 

                Executive Director of the Sierra Club. "Americans consistently 

                voice support for protecting the Arctic, and today the Senate 

                listened by rejecting this backdoor attempt to drill in this special 

                place." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drilling in 

                the Arctic is the centerpiece of the Bush Administration's energy 

                policy, and drilling proponents have tried to exploit the current 

                geopolitical situation and concerns about rising gas prices to 

                gain support for drilling. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Americans 

                are concerned about national security, but drilling in the Arctic 

                will do nothing to alleviate these fears," continued Pope. "Arctic 

                drilling would not put a dent in our dependence on foreign oil, 

                would do nothing to strengthen our national security, and would 

                not save consumers a dime. We cannot drill our way to energy independence." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United 

                States sits on just three percent of the world's known petroleum 

                reserves. Government estimates indicate that there is less than 

                a six month supply of oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, 

                and even the oil industry admits it would take ten years to make 

                it to US markets. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Should we 

                sacrifice the crown jewel of the refuge system for speculative 

                revenue gains and six months of oil?" asked Pope. "Americans overwhelmingly 

                say 'no.' They support protecting the Arctic Refuge, and today 

                their Senators heard them loud and clear." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senators Boxer 

                (D-CA), Chafee (R-RI) Feingold (D-WI) Snowe (R-ME), Lieberman 

                (D-CT), and Kerry (D-MA) led the winning effort to strip arctic 

                drilling revenues from the Budget Resolution. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Senators, 

                both Republican and Democrat, stood firm against tremendous pressure 

                from the Bush administration and its allies in the oil industry," 

                said Pope. "We thank them for their steadfast support in fighting 

                to make sure the Refuge is protected, not needlessly plundered. 

                The Arctic Refuge is too valuable to be just another number in 

                the budget process." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A recent National 

                Academy of Sciences report on the cumulative effects of drilling 

                on Alaska's North Slope reaffirmed the devastating impacts that 

                drilling has already caused in the region and provided further 

                evidence that we need to protect the Arctic Refuge. The coastal 

                plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a national treasure--home 

                to polar bears, wolves, and countless migratory birds. The coastal 

                plain is also the birthing grounds for the 129,000-member Porcupine 

                River caribou herd and it is sacred land to the Gwich'in Indians, 

                a native people whose traditional lifestyle depends on the caribou.
