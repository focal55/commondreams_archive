                - March 26 - The Senate defeated a measure to reinstate Superfund's 

                polluter pays fees to make polluters, instead of regular taxpayers, 

                foot the bill for toxic cleanups. Senator Lautenberg's amendment 

                to the Budget Resolution, which was defeated 43 to 56, would have 

                funded toxic cleanups at Superfund sites across the country, protecting 

                the public health of millions of citizens. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Reinstating 

                Superfund's polluter pays fees would provide more money for toxic 

                waste cleanups and shift the burden of paying to run the Superfund 

                program from taxpayers to polluting industries," said U.S. PIRG 

                Environmental Health Advocate Julie Wolk. . "Every April 15, average 

                Americans pay their taxes, but the Bush administration is letting 

                polluters off the hook tax-free," she continued. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regular taxpayers, 

                who paid only 18 percent of program costs in 1996, would pay 79 

                percent or more of program costs in 2004 under the President's 

                budget request. Superfund's original 'polluter pays' funding mechanism 

                expired in 1995, and Superfund's trust fund, which contained a 

                high of $3.6 billion at that time, will be nearly exhausted by 

                the end of 2004. As the fund diminishes to zero, taxpayers could 

                pay for the entire program. Former Presidents Reagan, George H.W. 

                Bush, and Clinton all collected and supported reauthorization 

                of the polluter pays fees, but the Bush Administration has expressed 

                its opposition to reinstating the fees. Senator Lautenberg's amendment 

                would have replenished Superfund's trust fund and shifted costs 

                back to polluting industries. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Superfund 

                program has experienced a major lack of funding in recent years, 

                with site cleanups slowing down nearly 50% in the last two years. 

                Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency cleaned up only 

                42 Superfund toxic waste sites compared to an average of 86 sites 

                per year in the middle and late 1990's. Last year, EPA under-funded 

                cleanups by $229 million, or 45 percent. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"People and 

                communities across the country remain at risk of chemical exposure 

                as long as the Superfund program is underfunded," said Wolk. "It's 

                time to start protecting communities and refund the program that 

                has been proven to clean up toxic waste sites," she concluded.
