                activities in Iraq in full coordination with its partners within 

                the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which includes the International 

                Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the lead agency for the Red 

                Cross and Red Crescent Movement in all conflict situations, the

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American 

                Red Cross emergency response to the current crisis in Iraq has 

                multiple dimensions. The aim is to support our partners to respond 

                quickly, flexibly, and to fullest of the Movement's capacity. 

                Together, the American Red Cross and its partners with the Movement 

                have prepared and together we are responding. These are the highlights 

                of the American Red Cross's contributions: </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are providing 

                technical expertise to the relief operations -- The American Red 

                Cross has positioned personnel in the region with expertise in 

                logistics and relief management in order to respond quickly and 

                effectively to the evolving needs of the people affected in Iraq 

                and the surrounding region. Specific activities include the determination 

                of needs, procurement of relief supplies, and distribution planning.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are participating 

                in both the ICRC and the Federation Appeals for this relief operation 

                -- The American Red Cross understands that the nature of this 

                conflict requires an emergency response that is fast-moving, tightly 

                coordinated, neutral and impartial. To facilitate and support 

                the speed and flexibility of the Movement's response, the American 

                Red Cross is providing cash to support both Appeals. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have pre-positioned 

                stocks and are channeling supplies to the relief operations -- 

                The American Red Cross embraces disaster readiness as a necessary 

                component to a speedy and effective emergency response. To support 

                the rapid delivery of relief items to those most vulnerable, the 

                American Red Cross has pre-positioned stocks in the region including 

                kitchen sets, hygiene parcels, blankets, tarps, and water containers. 

                The American Red Cross immediately made available a portion of 

                these supplies -- 34,000 blankets and 30,000 water containers, 

                which are currently en route to the ICRC for distribution to the 

                most vulnerable in Iraq. </font>
