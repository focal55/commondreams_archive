- August 1 - Statement of Katherine Morrison, Staff Attorney</font>.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are disappointed that the Senate voted to leave American consumers at risk from future Enron-style abuses by rejecting the Cantwell amendment to prevent market manipulation. The Senate bill is already loaded with provisions written by and for the utility, nuclear, coal and oil industries that threaten our pocketbooks, public health, national security and environment. This amendment would have been a step toward protecting consumers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The electricity title proposed by Senator Domenici rolls back existing consumer protections and ignores effective policies to increase energy efficiency and shift to clean, renewable energy. It is a dream for well-heeled energy lobbyists, and a nightmare for consumers and the environment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of increased consolidation and poorly-crafted state deregulation of the electricity industry, consumers are more vulnerable than ever to rip-offs and blackouts. Although the electricity title attempts to add in some protections, it only bars one type of manipulative trading practice. The title still allows companies and individuals that have engaged in fraud and abuse to continue to participate in the energy markets. Senator Cantwell's amendment would have prohibited all forms of fraudulent market manipulation. It would have required the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to prevent utilities that knowingly engaged in manipulative practices from participating in the market. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We applaud the 48 Senators who voted for the Cantwell amendment to protect consumers from fraud and abuse. Although the amendment failed, this was still a strong showing of support for strengthening consumer protections in the electricity market. We urge the Senate to support any efforts to strengthen the electricity title and protect consumers in the energy bill. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American deserves a safe, clean, affordable energy future. The Senate should reject this expensive and dangerous energy bill. </font></p>
