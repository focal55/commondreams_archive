-  
November 4 - The Bush Administration announced today that it cleaned up only 40 Superfund sites in FY2003. For the third year in a row, the number of cleanups completed is down by 50% from the middle and late 1990s. The Bush Administration continues to oppose reinstatement of Superfund's polluter pays fees.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration is leaving toxic messes in the backyards of American taxpayers for longer periods of time and forcing those same taxpayers to foot the bill for the cleanups,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Environmental Health Advocate Julie Wolk. &quot;Costs to taxpayers have increased by more than 300% since 1995, the year Superfund's polluter pays fees expired,&quot; she continued.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a recent GAO report, the Superfund trust fund, which used to pay for the bulk of orphan Superfund cleanups, is virtually bankrupt. Without funding from the trust fund, the Superfund program competes for general revenues with all other taxpayer-funded programs. Advocates for reinstating the polluter pays fees argue that trust fund monies are more important than ever during times of tight budgets and deficit spending.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush Administration touts the 70% of Superfund cleanups paid for directly by responsible polluters. While this is true and always has been, 30% of sites do not have a responsible party from whom to recoup cleanup costs. Cleanups at these &quot;orphan sites&quot; had historically been funded by the Superfund trust fund, filled with money from the polluter pays fees. As the trust fund has disappeared, the cost of &quot;orphan site&quot; cleanups has shifted to taxpayers, who paid only 18% of their costs in 1995 and will pay to up to 100% in FY2004.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Instead of obfuscating the truth about the status of the Superfund program, the Bush Administration should reinstate Superfund's polluter pays fees, re-fund the program, and start protecting communities across the country from chemical exposure and disease,&quot; said Wolk.</font></p>
