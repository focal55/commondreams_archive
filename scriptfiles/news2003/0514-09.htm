- May 14 - The American College of 

Physicians, joined by organizations representing over a quarter 

million doctors and millions of consumers, urged Congress to enact 

Senator Jeff Bingaman's Health Coverage Affordability, Reliability 

and Equity Act of 2003 (HealthCARE Act) to preserve the health of 

the tens of millions of Americans exposed to grave health and 

financial risks because of a lack of affordable healthcare 

coverage. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"During the past two years, 75 million Americans were without 

health insurance at some time. These working Americans went off to 

work each day without the security of knowing their families have 

access to basic medial care," said Dr. Wheby. "We can no longer 

afford to ignore the problem of the uninsured because it is too 

complex, too partisan or too risky to make sure these families have 

access to affordable health coverage. " 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Physicians know firsthand that, without insurance, children and 

adults do not have access to regular preventive and screening 

checkups. They often delay obtaining treatment until they are 

seriously ill-leading to an increase in premature deaths and 

unnecessary suffering," said Dr. Wheby. "Senator Bingaman's bill is 

a huge step forward in its nonpartisan approach to reforming the 

health insurance system." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACP is joined by organizations representing primary care 

physicians-family physicians, pediatricians, internists, and 

geriatricians-several medical specialty societies, and a prominent 

consumer advocacy group in announcing support for the HealthCARE 

Act of 2003. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Never before have so many doctors and consumers joined together 

to support a framework for expanding health insurance coverage," 

said Dr. Wheby. "Together, doctors and patients are speaking with 

a single voice to tell Congress that the time for inaction is over. 

Senator Bingaman's HealthCARE Act provides a sensible and 

achievable approach for breaking the logjam on the uninsured." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The HealthCARE Act is based in large part on an ACP proposal 

that preserves and builds on the current health care system to 

provide affordable health insurance to all Americans by 2010. The 

bill possesses important elements missing from many other proposals 

- it is realistic, pragmatic and capable of uniting opposing 

factions of the health and political system behind a single viable 

approach. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Under this plan, states would be given new options to expand 

the "safety net" of public programs for the poor, without imposing 

another unfunded budget mandate on economically-strapped states. 

-- Advance, refundable tax credits will give eligible 

individuals the same dollar subsidy toward buying health insurance 

that the federal government provides its own employees. 

-- Tax credits could be used to buy individual coverage or 

coverage through a state purchasing arrangement modeled after the 

Federal Employees Health Benefit program, giving recipients the 

ability to choose from the variety and number of affordable health 

plans available to members of Congress and other federal employees. 

-- Small businesses would have access to same types and variety 

of affordable health plans through the state purchasing 

arrangements. 

-- States would be given the flexibility and federal funding 

support to develop their own innovative programs to cover the 

uninsured. 

-- An expert Commission would recommend additional measures to 

make coverage available to all Americans by the end of the decade. 

</font>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American College of Physicians is the largest medical 

specialty organization and the second-largest physician group in 

the United States. ACP members include more than 115,000 internal 

medicine physicians (internists), related subspecialists, and 

medical students.
