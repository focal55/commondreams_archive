- May 15 - Private industry is stepping 

up its quest for an AIDS vaccine, but it needs increased government 

support to maintain the momentum, according to findings of a new 

survey released today by the non-profit AIDS Vaccine Advocacy 

Coalition (AVAC), a watchdog group that accepts no government or 

industry funding. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AVAC survey of 11 pharmaceutical and biotech companies 

engaged in AIDS vaccine research found that more public-sector 

funding was needed to expand product development and manufacturing, 

increase the number of international sites where AIDS vaccine 

trials can be conducted, and guarantee the purchase of AIDS 

vaccines for rapid global delivery. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"When America became frightened by the bio-terror threat, 

Congress and the Administration moved swiftly to put funding and 

incentives in place," said Chris Collins, AVAC's executive 

director. "That same kind of decisive action is needed to 

accelerate research and ensure an AIDS vaccine is available to all 

who need it." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Collins criticized a recent decision by the Bush administration 

directing cuts in research grants for AIDS and other infectious 

diseases in order to buy 25 million doses of anthrax vaccine. "We 

simply can't afford to pit one global health threat against 

another," Collins said. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Results of the AVAC survey were released as part of the group's 

annual report on the status of AIDS vaccine research. Titled How 

Do You Fight a Disease of Mass Destruction?, the report includes 

in-depth articles on delays in getting AIDS vaccines into clinical 

trials, concerns about whether there are too many "me too" (or 

similar) products in the pipeline, and the work of the federal 

government's Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center. This 

year's report also includes an in-depth look at why the world's 

first vaccine tailored to combat HIV in South Africa, which has 

more AIDS cases than any other country, has been stalled for more 

than a year in entering human trials. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AVAC report recommends increased funding for the National 

Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, stepped 

up assistance to product developers, and expanded clinical trials 

capacity internationally. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AVAC will host a reception to release the new report from 

5 to 7 p.m. tonight (May 15) at the Marlborough Gallery at 

211 West 19th St., New York City.
