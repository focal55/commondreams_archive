Co-author of the book <i>Raise The Floor: Wages and Policies

That Work For All Of Us</i>, Sklar said today: &quot;If you want to stimulate

unemployment, deficits and inequality, keep cutting taxes. More than 2 million

jobs have been lost on President Bush's watch. Like the 2001 tax swindle, the

2003 tax cuts will hurt the economy, not help it. The Bush team wants to remake

the tax system for the wealthy, increasingly exempting money from investments

while taxing paychecks. They want a big deficit, as Reaganites did, to strangle

public services they don't like. In the words of Reagan budget director David

Stockman, 'Greed came to the forefront. The hogs were really feeding.'&quot;

Editor of the <i>Left Business Observer</i>, Henwood said

today: &quot;Like most big things, the trade deficit has many causes -- the

erosion of U.S. manufacturing, the growth in outsourcing, an overvalued

currency, low savings rates. But unlike many big things, a lot of people are

ignoring it. To fund this massive deficit, the U.S. needs about $2 billion

every business day of capital inflows from abroad -- and Bush's military

buildup and tax cuts will only increase the need. Is running up giant foreign

debts while telling the rest of the world what to do a sound political or

economic strategy?&quot;

Today, the FCC is meeting in Washington. Author of <i>Rich

Media, Poor Democracy</i> and research professor in the Institute of

Communications Research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,

McChesney said today: &quot;The FCC would typically delay decision-making as it

has been asked to do in this case. But that would mean more scrutiny, and the

FCC is avoiding that. The public has spoken: it is diametrically opposed to

letting fewer media companies own more and more. Around 99.9 percent of the

9,000 public comments to the FCC has opposed relaxing the media ownership

rules. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that there are more Americans

who would like to see Osama bin Laden's bust on Mount Rushmore as there are who

want the monopoly media the FCC is rushing to permit. The stakes are so high

that we need to do the exact opposite of what the FCC is trying to do: we need

wide open public debate and deliberation on what media ownership policies make

the most sense to promote a democratic society.&quot;
