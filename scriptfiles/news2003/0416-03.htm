                - April 16 - In an alarming trend, the United States military 

                continues to discharge lesbian, gay and bisexual linguists, despite 

                a critical need for language specialists. As originally reported 

                by Nathaniel Frank in the November 18, 2002 issue of New Republic, 

                Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN) provided legal assistance 

                to nine linguists, trained in Arabic and Korean, during the fall 

                of last year. Today, the Washington Post reported that SLDN has 

                now assisted twenty-four linguists targeted under &quot;Don't 

                Ask, Don't Tell.&quot; </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nine of 

                  those assisted have been trained in Arabic. Eight were Korean 

                  language specialists, and three were trained to speak Farsi. 

                  SLDN has also provided assistance to two Chinese and two Russian 

                  linguists. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our 

                  nation faces a serious shortfall in the number of trained professionals 

                  who can speak and decipher the languages critical to our national 

                  security,&quot; said SLDN Executive Director C. Dixon Osburn. 

                  &quot;The continued firing of lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans 

                  who are trained in those languages underscores the detriment 

                  of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' on our nation.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According 

                  to a Government Accounting Office (GAO) study released in January 

                  2002, the Army faces a critical shortfall in linguists needed 

                  to translate intercepts and interrogate suspected terrorists. 

                  The report concluded that staff shortfalls &quot;have adversely 

                  affected agency operations and compromised U.S. military, law 

                  enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism and diplomatic efforts.&quot; 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The majority 

                  of language specialists are being discharged from the Defense 

                  Language Institute (DLI), the military's premiere language training 

                  facility in Monterey, California. SLDN also reported in 1999 

                  a series of significant &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; violations 

                  at DLI, including a witch-hunt which resulted in the discharge 

                  of 14 service members. In a February 12 letter to Army Inspector 

                  General Paul Mikoleshek, SLDN offered to visit DLI and provide 

                  assistance to the Army in reducing the base's gay discharges. 

                  To date, LTG Mikoleshek has not responded to SLDN's offer. </font></p>

                  Glover, a recently discharged Arabic linguist, wrote in the 

                  Monterey Herald newspaper that, &quot;The fear that we all feel 

                  in these hostile environments is a constant presence. It drives 

                  some of us into severe depressions and others of us to seek 

                  discharge in order to protect ourselves. This is the only way 

                  we can ensure our safety, since the upper ranks of the military 

                  refuse to do so.&quot; </font></p>

                  Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) recently remarked on the Senate floor 

                  that &quot;Not only does the &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; 

                  policy waste time, money and linguistic skill, it also initiates 

                  discrimination against those who simply want to serve their 

                  country.&quot; Representative Barney Frank (D-Mass.) called 

                  the discharges &quot;a new height of stupidity.&quot; </font></p>
