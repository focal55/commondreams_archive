                - March 20 - President Bush's unprovoked attack on Iraq has stimulated 

                an increase in pro-peace activity throughout the U.S. and around 

                the world. The increase in activity is a rebuke of the Bush administration's 

                position that unilateral aggression against Iraq is the way to 

                peace and disarmament. There are over 500 pro-peace events that 

                are scheduled, across this country, for today and there are hundreds 

                more scheduled for this weekend. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are dispelling 

                any delusions on the part of the Bush administration or the right-wing 

                pundits, that this well-developed, broad based peace movement 

                is going to dry up and blow away in the face of war and their 

                nationalistic propaganda blitz. There are Americans turning out 

                in streets of this country in nearly ever state and country of 

                the Union. We are united! We stand united, for peace, for America 

                and for our troops," said Kevin Martin, Executive Director of 

                Peace Action. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peace Action 

                activists across the country are organizing emergency anti-war 

                demonstrations from Maine to Oregon. Interviews with local organizers 

                are available through the Peace Action national office. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the 

                Bush Administration acts as if the only victim of this war will 

                be Saddam Hussein, it is a fact that war means the death of innocent 

                people: women, men, children. Peace Action joins with its partners 

                in the United for Peace and Justice coalition in encouraging individuals 

                to express anti-war sentiments by wearing black and yellow armbands 

                or lapel ribbons. The black in the armbands will symbolize mourning 

                for the thousands of innocent Iraqi people and U.S. service men 

                and women who will be killed in this unjust and unnecessary war. 

                The yellow in the armband will symbolize our support for the American 

                troops and our desire to see them return home safely. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In a break 

                with the basic tenets of our democracy and against the wishes 

                of the community of nations, world religious leaders and citizens 

                around the globe, the Bush administration has chosen to attack, 

                without provocation, the country of Iraq. In committing our troops 

                to fight a war of aggression, outside the rule of law, Bush has, 

                in an act of malfeasance, put U.S. troops at risk unnecessarily. 

                We believe the best way to support our troops is to bring them 

                home now and pursue the alternatives to war that other nations 

                and world leaders still believe are possible. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our commitment 

                to peace is redoubled in the face of the terrible violence that 

                Bush and Blair are in the process of visiting upon the people 

                of Iraq. To that end we will, in the best traditions of our democracy, 

                continue to non-violently act for peace," concluded Martin. </font>
