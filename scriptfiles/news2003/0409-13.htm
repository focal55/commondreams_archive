                - April 9 - NARAL Pro-Choice America turned up the heat today 

                in the fight to stop President Bush&#146;s re-nomination of controversial 

                judicial activist Priscilla Owen. The nation&#146;s premier abortion 

                rights advocacy group launched a new website today &#150; <a href="http://www.stopowen.org/" target="_new">www.StopOwen.org</a> 

                aimed at defeating the re-nomination of Priscilla Owen to the 

                Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and mobilizing its powerful network 

                of grassroots supporters. </font>

                  America will not stand idly by while President Bush pushes controversial 

                  candidates who want to take away our constitutional rights and 

                  freedoms,&#148; said NARAL Pro-Choice America President Kate 

                  Michelman. &#147;We are working closely with our allies to ensure 

                  that Priscilla Owen is not going to make it through the Senate 

                  after being rejected last year. We have stopped Owen before 

                  and we&#146;ll do it again.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Americans 

                  are mobilizing against the roll back of their reproductive rights

                  gives them the tools they need to make their voices heard,&#148; 

                  added Michelman. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The website,

                  provides information on Owen&#146;s staunchly anti-choice record 

                  and urges pro-choice Americans to call their Senators demanding 

                  a &#147;no&#148; vote or, if necessary, a filibuster. Visitors 

                  can also send letters and sign a petition &#150; all with the 

                  goal of stopping Owen&#146;s re-nomination. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Michelman 

                  also announced that NARAL Pro-Choice America will score Senators 

                  votes on the motion to proceed to Priscilla Owen in the 2003 

                  Congressional Record on Choice. Owen will be the first lower 

                  court nominee to be scored in nearly 20 years by the nation&#146;s 

                  leading pro-choice advocacy group. </font></p>

                  and the anti-choice leadership are defying historical precedent 

                  and the Senate&#146;s traditional advise and consent role by 

                  pushing through a nominee who has been rejected by the Senate 

                  Judiciary Committee. NARAL Pro-Choice America will make history 

                  and score this vote on an appellate candidate for the first 

                  time in nearly twenty years,&#148; said Michelman. &#147;Senators 

                  must remain united in opposing conservative judicial activists 

                  like Priscilla Owen.&quot; </font></p>
