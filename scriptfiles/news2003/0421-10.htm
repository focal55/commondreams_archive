                VA - April 21 - Hemp enthusiasts gave away hemp food products 

                at Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) offices in 65 cities 

                today to protest attempts by the federal government to ban the 

                increasingly popular food. VoteHemp organized the &quot;DEA Hemp 

                Food Taste Tests&quot; on the day a new &quot;Final Rule&quot; 

                was supposed to take effect. </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rule 

                  would have banned human consumption of hemp foods sold in thousands 

                  of stores. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the rule 

                  last week when they granted a stay of the ban at the request 

                  of about 250 U.S and Canadian hemp companies who have filed 

                  suit against the DEA. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Initial 

                  reports from Taste Tests around the country confirm that skeptical 

                  DEA employees tried samples of hemp pretzels served with hemp 

                  mustard, along with hemp energy bars, hemp butter, toasted hemp 

                  seed -- to name a few items. One employee at DEA headquarters 

                  in Arlington, VA commented, &quot;mmm -- that's good stuff.&quot; 

                  Eric Steenstra, president of VoteHemp says, &quot;We gave DEA 

                  employees a chance to taste what they would have been missing 

                  if their ban succeeded. They need to know there is nothing dangerous 

                  or deceptive about hemp food. Trying to ban hemp foods is as 

                  ridiculous as a ban on poppy seeds because they contain trace 

                  amounts of opiates or banning orange juice because it contains 

                  alcohol.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hemp seed 

                  has a well-balanced protein content and the highest amount of 

                  essential fatty acids (EFAs) of any oil in nature: EFAs are 

                  the &quot;good fats&quot; that, like vitamins, the body does 

                  not produce and requires for good health. Dr. Udo Erasmus, an 

                  internationally recognized nutritional authority on fats and 

                  oils, writes in Fats that Heal -- Fats that Kill: &quot;Hemp 

                  seed oil may be nature's most perfectly balanced oil.&quot; 

                  Not surprisingly, shelled hemp seed and oil are increasingly 

                  used in natural food products, such as corn chips, frozen waffles, 

                  nutrition bars, hummus, nondairy milks, breads and cereals. 

                  In the last few years, the hemp foods industry has grown from 

                  less than $1 million to over $6 million in annual retail sales. 

                  </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new 

                  &quot;Final Rule,&quot; issued on March 21, 2003, is virtually 

                  identical to an &quot;Interpretive Rule&quot; issued on October 

                  9, 2001 that never went into effect because of a Ninth Circuit 

                  Stay issued on March 7, 2002. On March 28, 2003 the Hemp Industries 

                  Association (HIA), as well as the Organic Consumers Association 

                  petitioned the Ninth Circuit to once again prevent the DEA from 

                  ending the legal sale of hemp seed and oil products in the U.S. 

                  Hemp advocates say that the public and Congress need to hear 

                  from outraged citizens. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The DEA's 

                  previous attempts to ban hemp foods prompted a major public 

                  outcry. Over 115,000 public comments were submitted to the DEA 

                  against their new rules. In 2002, 25 members of Congress wrote 

                  the DEA telling the agency that their &quot;Interpretive Rule&quot; 

                  that attempts to ban edible hemp seed or oil products containing 

                  &quot;any THC&quot; is &quot;overly restrictive.&quot; </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">North American 

                  hemp food companies voluntarily observe reasonable THC limits 

                  similar to those adopted by European nations as well as Canada 

                  and Australia. These limits protect consumers with a wide margin 

                  of safety from any psychoactive effects or workplace drug-testing 

                  interference (see hemp industry standards regarding trace THC 

                  at <a href="http://www.testpledge.com" target="_new">http://www.testpledge.com</a>). 

                  The DEA has hypocritically not targeted food manufacturers for 

                  using poppy seeds (in bagels and muffins, for example) even 

                  though they contain far higher levels of trace opiates. The 

                  recently-revived global hemp market, with retail sales of over 

                  $250 million worldwide, is a thriving commercial success. Unfortunately, 

                  because the DEA's Drug War paranoia has confused non-psychoactive 

                  industrial hemp varieties of cannabis with psychoactive &quot;marihuana&quot; 

                  varieties, the U.S. is the only major industrialized nation 

                  to prohibit the growing of industrial hemp. </font></p>
