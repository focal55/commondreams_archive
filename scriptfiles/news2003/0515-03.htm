Poisonous Spray on a Course Towards Drinking Water

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Af Anders Legarth Schmidt

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Denmark's most popular herbicide Roundup is polluting the underground

water far more than previously thought. Agriculture uses yearly 800 tons

of active glyphosate in herbicide. The Environment Minister is looking

at taking steps to address this.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Danish drinking water resources are under attack from an unexpected

quarter. The chemical glyphosate that is in the popular herbicides

Roundup and Touchdown is against all expectations sieving down through

the soil and polluting the ground water at a rate of five times more

than the allowed level for drinking water.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This has been shown from tests done by the Denmark and Greenland

Geological Research Institution (DGGRI) in an as yet unpublished

article.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Believed Bacteria broke down glyphosate

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"When we spray glyphosate on the fields by the rules it has been shown

that it is washed down into the upper ground water with a concentration

of 0.54 micrograms per litre. This is very surprising, because we had

previously believed that bacteria in the soil broke down the glyphosate

before it reached the ground water."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is the Environment Ministry that has given permission to use

glyphosate - based on the producers [Monsanto's] own research.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Used against Twitch and Thistles

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Farmers spray glyphosate on their fields after the harvest to keep the

soil free of twitch and thistles. It had been earlier found in wells in

Roskilde and Storstroms regions as well as the Copenhagen district

council area. Critics say glyphosate causes cancer, while its defenders

call it a wonder herbicide.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Professor Mogens Henze the head of the Institute for Environment and

Resources at Denmark's Technical University, says that the consequence

of the new knowledge is that water works in five to ten years will need

to clean the water before Danes can drink it.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The results show that glyphosate is polluting our drinking water. And

unfortunately we have only seen the tip of the iceberg, because

glyphosate and many other spray chemicals are on their way through the

soil at this point in time. Politicians need to look at agriculture in

relation to clean drinking water and decide what it is they are going to

do." says Mogens Henze, who isn't blaming the farmers who use something

that the authorities have allowed.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Use Doubled

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statistics from the Environment Ministry show that the use of glyphosate

has doubled in the last five years. In 2001 800 tons was used and that

made up a quarter of farmers total use of pesticides. This shows that

glyphosate is the most used herbicide by farmers.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a result of the new research from DGGRI the Environment Minister Hans

Christian Schmidt is currently thinking about doing something about the

use of glyphosate on Danish fields.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is simply not acceptable that this stuff is turning up in our

groundwater in such a concentration so high over the acceptable level. If

this is the case then we must react quickly" says the Environment

Minister, who is awaiting a report from the Environment Ministry.
