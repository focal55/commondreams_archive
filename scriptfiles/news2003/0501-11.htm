- May 1 - The Physicians Committee 

for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) is honoring the life and work of 

the world's most famous pediatrician, Dr. Benjamin Spock, by 

sending a relief convoy to Iraq. The doctors' group is donating 

more than $10,000 worth of medical supplies to a children's 

hospital in Baghdad and enough soymilk to feed up to 30,000 

children. The donation commemorates what would have been Dr. 

Spock's 100th birthday -- Friday, May 2.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Spock is best known for "Baby and Child Care," the 

best-selling secular book of all time. Benjamin Spock was a 

lifelong activist and member of PCRM's advisory board until his 

death in 1998. He was a pacifist and disarmament proponent in 

addition to being an advocate for a non-dairy vegetarian diet 

for children. He discusses the problems a meat and dairy-based 

diet can cause in the 7th final edition of his best-selling book 

-- a position PCRM also promotes through its many campaigns. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mary Morgan, Dr. Spock's widow, joins PCRM's commemoration. 

"My husband wanted to be remembered for his work for peace, and 

this shipment to Iraq will bring relief to children in need 

while beautifully commemorating his life's work," she says. PCRM 

president Neal Barnard, M.D., is proud to work with Ms. Morgan 

and echoes her feelings. "They don't make doctors like Ben 

anymore. He truly cared about kids, about peace, and about the 

best of health, and he practiced what he preached," he says. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PCRM is sending a convoy that will include a 20-foot 

container of soymilk provided by Vitasoy, an international soy 

beverage company. Soymilk is suitable for lactose-intolerant 

persons, withstands high desert temperatures, and requires no 

refrigeration. PCRM will distribute the soymilk and medical 

supplies to hospitals in Baghdad. The medical supplies will 

include sutures, scalpels, intravenous equipment, and 

anesthesia, among other needed emergency items. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Ms. Mary Morgan is available for interviews about this 

project and her late husband's dedication to children and peace. 

Dr. Barnard is available to talk about PCRM's donation to Iraq 

and past work with Dr. Spock on dairy alternatives and 

vegetarian diets for children. To set up an interview with Ms. 

Morgan or Dr. Barnard, please contact Colleen Young at 

202-686-2210 ext. 330 or cyoung@pcrm.org</i>. </font>
