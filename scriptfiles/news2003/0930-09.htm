- September 30 - With the number of uninsured Americans jumping by 5.7% to over 43.5 million Americans, Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) co-sponsor of legislation to provide universal health care for all Americans issued the following statement:</font>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The recent release of census data showing that over 43.5 million Americans do not have health care insurance must serve as a wake up call for this nation. It is time to make health care a top domestic priority and it is time for Congress to pass legislation that I have co-sponsored to provide Medicare for All. </font></p>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What the data shows is clear. Private, employer based, health care has failed to provide adequate coverage for the needs of Americans. We now know that the best and only way to provide full and guaranteed health care for all Americans is through universal health care. </font></p>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Under the plan proposed by myself, and Congressman Conyers, all Americans would be provided with guaranteed high quality health care regardless of their employment status or income level. It is only through a plan like ours that America can insure the over 43.5 million Americans who do not have health insurance and begin the path towards expanded economic growth. </font></p>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Now is the time for Congress to act. Lack of access to health care is a growing burden on our already sagging economy. Our country has great wealth, yet we trail behind dozens of countries in our ability to provide health care to our citizens. This is simply unacceptable.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no longer any doubt. The current system has failed. It is time to fix this great injustice in our society. We must not wait, and we must not be timid.&quot;</font></p>
