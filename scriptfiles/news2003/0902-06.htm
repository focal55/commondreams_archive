- August 31 -  Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, today, issued the following statement on President Bush's Labor Day trip to Ohio:</font>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ohio's economy, like most of the nation, is hurting due to the failed economic policies of this Administration. </font></p>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ohio's economy needs more than a political stump speech. The President's visit, and reckless economic policies, will do nothing to help the more than 369,500 Ohioans who are out of work. Ohio has lost 195,200 private sector jobs since this President has taken office. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ohio, like many industrial states, is suffering under a President who has presided over the worse job creation record in over 50 years. Our nation is averaging a loss of 68,000 jobs a month, and the nation has lost 2.5 million manufacturing jobs since this President has taken office. This record is unacceptable. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President's 'leave-no-billionaire-behind' tax cut to the wealth will do nothing to help the average Ohioan. The recently passed tax cut will continue a trend advocated by this Administration of accelerating wealth upwards. The first 60% of Ohio taxpayers will only see a tax cut of only $380 in total over the next four years. But, the richest 1% of Ohioans will be rewarded with tax cuts worth $52,240 on average over the next four years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President's economic strategy of tax cuts to the wealthiest one percent combined with an aggressive foreign policy will make it impossible for our economy to recover and will lead to continued cuts in important domestic needs.  Already, this Administration's policies has led to cuts in spending on important domestic needs such as education, health care, veterans benefits, child care and led to sky high state budget deficits. Ohio, alone, is facing a projected state budget deficit of $2 billion in FY '04.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Of all days to use Ohio as a political backdrop the President, no friend of working people, has chosen Labor Day. I hope that his tour of the state will include the empty factories and bankrupt corporations that are the legacy of our nation's misguided trade policies. Ohio's manufacturing base, like many states, has been decimated by NAFTA. Yet, with record job losses and a failing economy this Administration wants to expand NAFTA. It is clear that such a policy would only further harm Ohio's economy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ohio, and our nation, deserve better. To stimulate our economy takes more than tax cuts to the wealthy. It requires federal spending, progressive tax cuts to people who need the money now, and real efforts to create new high paying jobs. Turning our economy around must be the top priority of this Administration and Congress this fall.&quot;</font></p>
