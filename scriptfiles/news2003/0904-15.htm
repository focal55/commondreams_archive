Established in 1989 to pay tribute to community leaders and allies who help pave the way for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people by advancing the cause of freedom, justice and equality, the evening will include an awards ceremony, a silent auction, and cocktail and dessert receptions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are proud to be honoring such stellar individuals,&quot; said Task Force Executive Director Matt Foreman. &quot;Their commitment to promoting LGBT equality and educating the public about issues of vital importance to our community is to be commended, and we can't thank them enough.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rosie O'Donnell and her partner Kelli O'Donnell, who will be on hand to accept the 2003 Leadership Award, are a devoted couple dedicated to fighting for family adoption and same-sex parenting issues. They are the proud parents of four children. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L.A. City Councilmember Antonio Villaraigosa is a tireless ally of the LGBT community who, as a legislator and former Speaker of the California State Assembly, authored laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joining the list of honorees is Calpernia Addams, a leading advocate in the transgender community whose real-life story inspired the making of Showtime's Soldier's Girl, which recounts her loving relationship with murdered soldier Barry Winchell.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And, nine-time Emmy winner David Lee, one of the first openly gay writer/producers in television, is also being honored. Lee is co-creator and executive producer of the critically-acclaimed Frasier, and was instrumental in challenging his employer, Paramount, for their decision to launch Dr. Laura's television show.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All honorees are expected to be on hand to accept their awards.</font></p>
