<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OAKLAND, CA - September 2 - <i>Before our politicians sign one more disastrous deal, they should all be tied down and forced to read this extraordinary and important book.</i></font><br>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-Naomi Klein, author, 'No Logo'
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Shafted is a first-person dissection of America's trade policies. A trade policy crafted by the rich for the rich has incalculable effects on all. The poor, forgotten, and dislocated are not being heard.  It is imperative that we listen well, for the cost of indifference will never stop growing until these inequities are addressed and justice trumps cash as the motivating factor for economic development.</i></font><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-Paul Hawken, author, 'The Ecology of Commerce' </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rattling at the gilded gates of free trade's myths, '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=commondreams-20&path=tg/detail/-/0935028927/qid%3D1062611487/sr%3D8-1" target="_new">Shafted: Free Trade and America's Working Poor</a>', the latest book from Food First/Institute for Food and Development Policy, is already creating a buzz among activists and academics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As we head towards the 10th anniversary of NAFTA, 'Shafted' begs the question &quot;who will celebrate?&quot; Trade agreements have cost the United States over 3 million jobs and countless amounts of misery. And now, at the WTO ministerial in Cancun, the Bush administration is poised to expand free trade agreements.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'Shafted' is the unspoken truth of free trade's devastation on worker's lives told by those who know first-hand: small family farmers, farm workers, fisherfolk, industrial and textile workers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The women and men whose stories are woven into this book come from incredibly diverse ethnic backgrounds, geographic locations, and vocations,&quot; said Christine Ahn, editor of 'Shafted'. &quot;But all have experienced the destructive power of free trade policies: broken communities; withering wages and evaporating jobs; farms, houses, and livelihoods-and even lives-lost.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These personal stories are supplemented with expert testimony from researchers and policy makers who have studied free trade's economic and social impacts. For example, since NAFTA, more than half of all employers, and 71 percent of all manufacturers, threatened to close operations when faced with a union organizing drive. Typically, union workers who lose manufacturing jobs find new work that pays only 70 percent of their former salary.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Proponents of trade agreements boast cheaper consumer products and greater access to out-of-season fruits and vegetables, but these benefits cannot justify human rights violations wrought by free trade,&quot; said Ahn. &quot;The right to feed oneself, the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to organize and form unions, and the right to be free from slavery cannot be trumped by the corporate right to profit.&quot; </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
