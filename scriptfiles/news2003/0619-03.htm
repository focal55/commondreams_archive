The bill, sponsored by Representative Ric Keller (R-FL), is the subject of a hearing today in the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Frivolous lawsuits deserve to be thrown out of court, and frivolous legislation should be thrown out of Congress&#151;and the Keller bill is nothing but frivolous,&#148; said CSPI executive director Michael F. Jacobson. &#147;Representative Keller simply wants to preemptively take an entire industry off the hook, and make restaurants and food companies a special, protected class&#151;immune from the scrutiny of judges or juries.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The legislation, the Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act, would bar any civil lawsuit unless the company at issue is not in compliance with a specific law or regulation. Food-safety and nutrition experts point out that no regulatory agency could possibly foresee every instance of injurious behavior. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It&#146;s ironic to see so-called conservatives so eager to wield the power of big government. But it&#146;s entirely predictable for them to do so to protect big business,&#148; said Jacobson, who noted that Representative Keller&#146;s district is home to Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden and Red Lobster. &#147;This bill has nothing to do with encouraging personal responsibility, and everything to do with encouraging corporate irresponsibility.&#148; </font></p>
