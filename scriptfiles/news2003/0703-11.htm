<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New York City is rich in immigrant communities, and it's also the U.S.'s news media capital. So why isn't there more reporting on the anti-immigrant backlash since September 11? Special registration, secret detentions and racial violence should be major stories both locally and nationally, yet there are few mainstream reporters investigating these issues in-depth.  Please join FAIR to hear some of the stories that haven't made it into mainstream media, and to learn how New York's immigrant communities are organizing to protect their rights, and how you can get involved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chandra Bhatnagar is an attorney with the<a href="http://www.aaldef.org" target="_new"> Asian American Legal Defense &amp; Education Fund</a>, where he directs the South Asian Workers' Project for Human Rights, a community-based direct legal services project serving low wage workers from the South Asian diaspora. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monami Maulik is co-founder of <a href="http://www.drumnation.org/drum.html" target="_new">DRUM </a>(Desis Rising Up &amp; Moving), a community-based social justice group organizing low-income South Asian immigrants. Since 9/11, DRUM has campaigned to stop the disappearances of immigrants and anti-immigrant racial violence. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rehan Ansari is editor of the <a href="http://www.indypressny.org/" target="_new">Independent Press Association</a>'s &quot;Voices That Must Be Heard,&quot; which translates articles from New York's immigrant and ethnic press to help connect immigrant communities, communities of color, and American society at large. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is the latest in FAIR&#146;s series of media talks, now held at Judson Memorial Church. Past topics have included media coverage of AIDS drugs and Africa, the &#147;drug war&#148; in Colombia, the Zapatistas, reproductive freedom, civil liberties after September 11, and more. All talks are free and open to the public. To stay informed about upcoming events, sign up for free email updates at: <a href="http://www.fair.org" target="_new">www.fair.org</a>.</font></p>
