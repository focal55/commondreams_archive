-  

June 11 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), the leader of the opposition to the war in Iraq in the House, again took to the House floor today to continue his pressure to demand the truth about the Administration's lead-up to the war in Iraq.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kucinich stated today on the House floor:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Over the past year, the Bush Administration has made specific and unequivocal statements about the imminent threat posed by Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Repeatedly claiming they has intelligence showing Iraq had 25,000 liters of anthrax, 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin, 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent, and over 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;So where are those vast stockpiles? Where was the imminent threat?</font></p>

<p> 	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At the State of the Union Address, the President said '&#133;Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent.'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Where are those vast stockpiles? Where was the imminent threat?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This Administration repeatedly claimed Iraq's WMD represented an imminent threat to this country. They claimed specific evidence of vast stockpiles. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Where are the vast stockpiles? Where was the imminent threat?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Did this Administration deliberately mislead this nation into war telling us that there was imminent threat, when there was not?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The resolution of inquiry now signed by 36 Members of Congress aims to find out the truth.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last Thursday, Kucinich introduced a Resolution of Inquiry in the House of Representatives to force the Administration to turn over the intelligence to back its yet unproven claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resolution, now signed by 36 Members of Congress, seeks to force the Administration to turn over the intelligence to substantiate claims by the President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, and the White House Press Secretary that Iraq has chemical and biological weapons and therefore posed a threat to the United States. The resolution is a privileged resolution and must be voted on in Committee within 14 legislative days of being introduced.</font></p>
