- November 12 - Ocean conservation, legal and science leaders today released information identifying conflicts of interest within the U.S. fisheries management system that have played a major role in the devastation of many ocean fish stocks. Critics of the U.S. fisheries management system disclose this controversial information as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the federal agency legally responsible for managing America's ocean fish, launches its national fisheries management conference from Nov. 13-15 in Washington, DC where many expect NOAA to laud its recent successes.
    </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Additionally, Stanford University's Fisheries Policy Project is issuing a new report, Taking Stock of the Regional Fishery Management Councils, which is expected to highlight how industry conflicts of interest are primarily responsible for depleted U.S. fish populations.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eight regional councils develop management plans and regulations for fish and other living marine resources within the country's three to 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Opponents to the current system say that although America's marine fisheries are a public trust owned by all Americans, management of U.S. ocean fisheries essentially consists of self-regulation by the fishing industry, and therefore is inherently flawed. They say that too often these managers deny that fishery problems exist or offer delay tactics instead of finding workable solutions. Consequently, their decisions also fail to support the long-term sustainability of vibrant marine ecosystems.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The US ocean management system is flawed and riddled with managers that have direct financial interest in the fisheries they manage.&quot; said Gerald Leape, Vice President, Marine Conservation Program, National Environmental Trust. &quot;These conflicts of interest have lead to poor decisions that have caused precipitous declines in U.S. fish populations.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;After 25 years in the hands of the councils, most of our major fisheries are in an unhealthy condition,&quot; said Dr. Michael Hirshfield, Chief Scientist, Oceana. &quot;So called 'success stories' are few and far between, and most of those result from lawsuits and public pressure, not leadership by industry or the councils.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Currently, many of our nation's fisheries remain in peril. Sixty-five percent (65 percent) of fish populations that are already severely depleted continue to be overfished. Unsustainable fishing practices that result in overfishing, wasteful bycatch (the catching and killing of non-target ocean wildlife) and habitat destruction continue to go unchecked.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The collapse of the once dominant West Coast rockfish and New England cod populations are just two examples of industry dominated poor management. The cod fishery off the coast of New England was once the most valuable fishery in the world, but decades of overfishing finally drove these populations to the point of collapse. Rather than taking difficult but decisive action in the early 90s, the New England Council failed to place restrictions on fishing that would ensure the recovery of the cod. These populations remain severely depleted today. On the west coast, wasteful fishing practices and excessive catch rates led to the collapse of several rockfish populations in less than two decades, resulting in tremendous economic hardship for Pacific coast fishing communities and depleted fishing populations that could take over 100 years to recover.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Lately, the councils have been receiving intense amounts of criticism for their management policies,&quot; said Mark Powell, Director, Marine Fish Program, The Ocean Conservancy. &quot;Our country must ensure that we have the most effective system in place so that we can effectively evaluate and manage our fisheries. Necessary steps must be taken to improve decision making within our eight fishery management councils.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Critics highlight the following critical problems with the current fishery management system:</font></p>
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Conflict of Interest Exemption: Council members are exempt from general federal conflict of interest standards - laws that apply to all other federal bodies.</font></font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Industry Domination: More than eighty percent (80 percent) of the citizens appointed to the councils by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce are members of the fishing industry.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Industry Control: The National Marine Fisheries Service allows the councils to deplete fisheries, threaten ocean wildlife and delay recovery, abdicating the agency's responsibility to overrule illegal decisions.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lack of Conservation Incentives: The councils have no incentives for conservation efforts. The federal government offers no penalties when councils permit overfishing or when they delay rebuilding or habitat protection plans.</font></li>
    </ul>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Lee Crockett, executive director, Marine Fish Conservation Network, &quot;Any meaningful reform of the regional fishery management councils would require that Congress and the Department of Commerce eliminate conflicts of interest, broaden representation on the councils and separate decisions about how many fish should be caught from decisions about who should be allowed to catch them.&quot;</font></p>
