- December 10 - Following is a statement of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence United with the Million Mom March:</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Who can blame Bradley Buckles for leaving the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives? Buckles, Director of the ATF since 1999, announced Monday he's leaving the agency, and Mr. Buckles certainly deserves a break. He's been at the helm of a government law enforcement agency that has been under almost relentless attack by both the Bush Administration and the Congress for three years.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The attacks have been orchestrated by the extreme gun lobby and are evidence of one of that lobby's most profound hypocrisies: &quot;They say they want tough enforcement of gun laws, but do everything they can to undermine that enforcement,&quot; said Mike Barnes, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence United with the Million Mom March.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Just this week, the House of Representatives passed an omnibus appropriations bill with a rider that would stifle the ATF's enforcement abilities. It would prevent the government from ordering that gun dealers conduct inventories - exactly the opposite of a rule that Buckles proposed during the last Administration. If the rule had been adopted, it would have made it more difficult for Bulls Eye Shooter Supply to &quot;lose&quot; more than 200 guns, including the assault rifle used by the DC snipers in their October 2002 rampage. The so-called Tiahrt amendment would also stop the ATF from releasing data showing gun dealers that sell high numbers of guns that are used in crimes.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Under Director Buckles, published reports say the ATF recommended to the Justice Department more than six months ago that criminal charges be brought against Bulls Eye, the Tacoma, Washington gun dealer that &quot;lost&quot; the Bushmaster rifle. No criminal charges have been filed. And now the NRA's friends in Congress are pushing a bill that would immunize Bulls Eye from civil liability.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Director Buckles is reportedly heading for a new job dealing with the controversial issues surrounding downloadable online music. Compared to the noise level at his current job policing guns in America, the new job must sound like a symphony.</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
