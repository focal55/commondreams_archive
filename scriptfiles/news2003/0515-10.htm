- May 15 - The following is a 

statement by the American Cancer Society, American Heart 

Association, American Lung Association, Action on Smoking and 

Health (ASH) and Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids on U.S. adoption of 

historic tobacco treaty: 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next week, at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, 

the world's nations are scheduled to adopt the Framework Convention 

on Tobacco Control, an historic treaty to address the global 

tobacco epidemic. The United States faces a clear choice: Our 

government can join the vast majority of nations in acting to 

improve health and save lives around the world, or it can join with 

a small minority and continue to protect the interests of the 

tobacco industry. As organizations committed to reducing the 

terrible toll of tobacco in the United States and around the world, 

we urge our government to sign the strong treaty that has been 

negotiated. But if our government chooses not to, it should step 

aside and let other nations get on with the important work of 

protecting the health of their citizens. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most destructive course would be for the U.S. government to 

persist with its efforts to reopen the negotiations and seriously 

undermine the treaty. Further negotiations would only delay 

adoption and implementation of the treaty, costing lives around the 

world. That's why so many countries have rejected the U.S. effort 

to reopen negotiations. The United States should accept the fact 

that this treaty has been debated, negotiated, and agreed to by the 

vast majority of nations from every region. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The treaty will have its greatest impact in empowering 

developing nations -- where the tobacco industry believes its 

economic future lies -- to resist the industry's powerful political 

influence and enact scientifically proven measures to reduce 

tobacco use, improve health and save lives. As they have done in 

industrialized nations, multinational tobacco companies such as 

Philip Morris are seeking to penetrate the new markets of the 

developing world with seductive advertising and deceptions about 

the health risks of smoking. If nations properly implement the 

treaty, they can stop these harmful industry practices. The treaty 

commits nations to banning all tobacco advertising, promotion and 

sponsorship (with an exception for nations with constitutional 

constraints). It also commits them to requiring large warning 

labels covering at least 30 percent of the principal display areas 

of the cigarette pack. The treaty also provides nations with a 

roadmap for enacting strong, science-based policies in other areas 

such as secondhand smoke protections, tobacco taxation, tobacco 

product regulation, combating cigarette smuggling, public 

education, and tobacco cessation treatment. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The importance of the global market to Big Tobacco is clear. 

While profits for Philip Morris USA have stagnated in the past 

decade, Philip Morris International has more than doubled its 

revenue and profits and expects another 10 percent increase in 

earnings this year. The World Health Organization (WHO), which 

sponsored the tobacco treaty negotiations, calls the developing 

world and women around the world the industry's biggest potential 

growth markets. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The toll of the tobacco industry's assault on the world is also 

clear. The WHO estimates that there are 1.1 billion smokers in the 

world today, a number expected to rise to 1.64 billion by the year 

2025. The WHO estimates that tobacco use killed about 4.9 million 

people worldwide last year. If current trends continue, this 

figure will more than double by the early 2030s, with about 70 

percent of those deaths occurring in developing nations. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 1, 171 member nations of the WHO concluded four years 

of negotiations and reached agreement on a strong treaty text, 

overriding repeated U.S. attempts to weaken the treaty. Nations 

are scheduled to adopt the treaty at the World Health Assembly, 

which begins May 19. The United States last month launched a 

last-ditch effort to reopen the negotiations and serious undermine 

the treaty by allowing nations to opt out of any of its substantive 

provisions. Many nations have taken positions against reopening 

the negotiations. The U.S. government has not indicated what 

position it will take at the World Health Assembly.
