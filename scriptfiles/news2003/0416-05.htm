                - April 16 - Patriot missiles have been &#147;shooting down&#148; 

                friendly aircraft in testing as far back as 1993, sources have 

                told the Project On Government Oversight (POGO). Yet, a decade 

                later even the updated PAC-2 and PAC-3 patriot missile radar apparently 

                continue to experience problems discriminating the difference 

                between friendly and enemy aircraft, and Iraqi missiles and aircraft.</font> 

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. officials 

                  now believe that during Operation Iraqi Freedom two friendly 

                  aircraft, a British Tornado GR4 fighter-bomber on May 22 and 

                  a U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet on April 2, were shot down by U.S. 

                  Patriot missiles, killing three pilots. In another incident, 

                  a U.S. F-16 fighter pilot on May 24 fired on a Patriot missile 

                  battery after the aircraft&#146;s radar revealed the missile 

                  battery was &#147;locked&#148; on the aircraft.</font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The 

                  Pentagon has known for a decade that the Patriot cannot distinguish 

                  its targets from our own aircraft,&#148; said Danielle Brian, 

                  POGO&#146;s Executive Director. &#147;It is an outrage that 

                  they have not fixed this fundamental flaw, yet continue to buy 

                  it and sell it to our allies, and have the gall to promote this 

                  weapon in both Gulf Wars as a star when they&#146;ve known it 

                  is a dud.&#148;</font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several 

                  sources have told POGO the Air Force and Army have been aware 

                  of the serious target discrimination problem since it first 

                  was revealed in testing at Nellis Air Force Base in 1993. During 

                  that test, sources say, a U.S. aircraft simulating a return 

                  home from a mission was flying in a corridor reserved for friendly 

                  aircraft but still would have been &#147;shot down&#148; by 

                  the Patriot were it an actual combat situation. </font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subsequent 

                  exercises and tests have revealed that the Patriot radar discrimination 

                  problems were not fixed, according to Philip Coyle, former Director, 

                  Operational Test and Evaluation, the Pentagon&#146;s independent 

                  testing office. The problems were identified in so-called Joint 

                  Air Defense Operations/Joint Engagement Zones exercises during 

                  the mid-1990s, Coyle said.</font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because 

                  of the density of U.S. aircraft and out of concern for fratricide, 

                  the rules of engagement for the first Gulf War did not allow 

                  Patriot missile units to fire on aircraft, also known as air 

                  breathing targets. Some critics have said the same rules of 

                  engagement should have been in place during Operation Iraqi 

                  Freedom since there really were no enemy aircraft operating.</font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So far, 

                  Pentagon officials have not revealed whether the Patriot firings 

                  during Operation Iraqi Freedom were done automatically or manually, 

                  or whether the Patriot system mistakenly identified the aircraft 

                  as enemy aircraft or enemy missiles. </font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The newest 

                  version of the Patriot missile, the PAC-3 (Patriot Advanced 

                  Capability-3) experienced some difficulties during operational 

                  testing. However, late last year, Air Force Lt. Gen. Ronald 

                  Kadish, director of the Missile Defense Agency, told the media 

                  that any glitches on the PAC-3 missiles were &#147;minor&#148; 

                  and &#147;annoying.&#148;</font></p>

                <p> </p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other than 

                  the friendly fire incidents, officials say the performance of 

                  the Patriot missiles has been &#147;very good&#148; during Operation 

                  Iraqi Freedom. That&#146;s also what the Army claimed during 

                  the first Gulf War. Despite Pentagon estimates of up to 80 percent 

                  effectiveness during the 1991 conflict, a General Accounting 

                  Office study later revealed that the proclaimed Scud killer 

                  actually performed very poorly. In fact, the GAO concluded that 

                  the Patriot only hit 9 percent of the Iraqi Scud missiles that 

                  were launched during the first Gulf conflict. </font></p>
