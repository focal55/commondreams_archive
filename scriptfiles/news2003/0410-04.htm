                - April 10 - Justice for Gun Victims today praised former Vermont 

                Governor Howard Dean for opposing attempts to immunize the gun 

                industry from legal action. Dean's announcement came during a 

                Children's Defense Fund forum featuring all nine Democratic presidential 

                candidates, and just hours after the full U.S. House of Representatives 

                passed H.R. 1036, a bill that shields gun makers and dealers from 

                legal action even if they act irresponsibly. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response 

                to a question by journalist Mark Shields, Dean said, as president, 

                he would veto H.R. 1036 and any legislation that singles out the 

                gun industry for special protection. Dean also voiced support 

                for renewing the federal assault weapons ban, which expires in 

                2004, and for closing the gun show loophole. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Justice for 

                Gun Victims urged the other eight presidential candidates to strongly 

                oppose H.R. 1036 and S. 659, its Senate companion. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Governor Dean's 

                opposition to granting the gun industry special legal protections 

                shows how extreme and unwise this measure is," said Joshua Horwitz, 

                executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, the 

                organization spearheading the Justice for Gun Victims campaign. 

                "We urge the rest of the Democratic presidential field to join 

                Governor Dean in standing up for the rights of gun violence victims."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">H.R. 1036 was 

                rushed through the House in an effort to throw out a case filed 

                against several gun makers and dealers by the NAACP. The trial, 

                currently being held in a Brooklyn federal court, seeks no monetary 

                damages -- only the reform of gun industry practices that aid 

                criminal access to guns. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Monday, 

                Robert Ricker, a former high-ranking gun industry insider, testified 

                in the NAACP trial that some gun makers and dealers have known 

                for years that their business practices aid criminal gun access, 

                but have chosen to do nothing about it. </font>
