- July 30 - Under intense pressure from environmental and human rights groups and members of Congress, today the Board of Executive Directors of the Inter-American Development  Bank (IDB) delayed a scheduled vote on the controversial $2.6 billion Camisea Gas Project in Peru for one week.  IDB officials indicated a &quot;lack of consensus&quot; among directors prevented approval of the project. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Camisea natural gas project--with reserves of 13,000 billion cubic feet of gas--has already scared off two major investors, Citigroup and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to an internal report by the US Export Import Bank, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, proposals to mitigate the environmental impactS of the project are &quot;woefully inadequate&quot; and the project will likely lead to landslides, destroy critical natural habitats, and spread diseases among indigenous peoples. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday a letter was sent from nine U.S. Senators to the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the head of a the U.S. Export-Import Bank, another public institution that is also considering the project.  The letter opposes public support for Camisea at this time, and echoes the concerns of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) who also sent a letter.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reacting to today's delay, environmental and human rights groups issued this statement:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Camisea in its current form is risky business and should not receive public financing.  The Inter-American Development Bank will need more than a week  to solve the fundamental problems of drilling inside an indigenous reserve, massive damage to tropical forests, and threats from an export terminal to the internationally recognized Paracas Marine Reserve.  An indefinite delay is necessary to resolve the project's serious problems and requires leadership from the United States, Japan, European members of the Bank and from Peru's President Toledo. Delaying the decision by a week will only be window dressing if the Bank approves Camisea  without major modifications. One week from now Camisea will

still be a disaster.   We urge IDB Executive Directors to delay decision

as long as it takes to implement modifications sought by Peruvian civil society. We also urge the U.S. Export-Import Bank to reject the $200 million loan to Camisea given the project is in violation of its environmental and social safeguards.&quot; </font></p>
