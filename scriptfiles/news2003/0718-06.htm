-July 18 - The House of Representatives voted today for deep cuts in conservation spending, slashing funding for additions to National Parks, Forests and Wildlife Refuges, state parks and recreational facilities, and forest conservation on private land. In a rebuke to the Bush Administration, however, over 180 members of the House repeatedly backed leaders who brought up a series of attempts to overturn Administration policy on National Forests, Wildlife Refuges and Parks.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By failing to uphold the conservation funding promise of the Conservation Trust Fund, this bill shortchanges the American people and turns away from our country's traditional commitment to conservation,&quot; said Bonnie Galvin, Director of Appropriations and Budget programs at The Wilderness Society. &quot;Only by continuing to invest in America's natural heritage can we hope to pass that legacy on to future generations undamaged. We were delighted, however, to see such broad recognition that the extreme land policies of this Administration must be confronted.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite an amendment by Representatives Obey and Dicks, and efforts by Representative Boehlert, the House bill failed to reinstate funding for the Conservation Trust Fund, a bipartisan financing mechanism designed to provide dedicated funding for, and only for, conservation, recreation, wildlife and preservation. The Conservation Trust Fund, if upheld, would have provided over $500 million in additional funds to address our nation's most pressing conservation needs, enough to sustain hundreds of additional time-sensitive local, state, and federal open space, wildlife, and wild lands projects across the country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conservation Trust Fund cuts affect a suite of popular, bipartisan programs including the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), the federal program that funds land purchases for National Parks, National Wildlife Refuges and National Forests. Within LWCF, federal land acquisition is down over 75 percent from recent years, reduced from over $450 million in 2001 to $100 million in this bill. LWCF federal land acquisition funds have been used in the past to preserve such crown jewels as Everglades National Park, Rocky Mountain National Park, and the Appalachian Trail.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the bill cuts support for the Forest Legacy public-private forest conservation effort by over 25 percent, threatening planned activities to sustain working forests from Maine to California.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These cuts didn't have to happen,&quot; said Galvin. &quot;Just three years ago, in 2000, Congress created a groundbreaking new funding mechanism called the Conservation Trust Fund to make sure that America would always reserve enough money to address its most pressing conservation, wildlife and recreation needs.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One decisive pro-environment vote came on an amendment by Representative Shadegg that would have further cut LWCF land acquisition funding; that amendment was defeated by a bipartisan majority.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress also pushed to address a number of the country's most pressing environmental concerns, stewardship on our national forests, Yellowstone Park and its bison, the Klamath Basin Wildlife Refuges in Oregon and California, and concerns over public land grabs throughout the Western U.S.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In good times and in bad, in war and in peace, Americans have steadfastly protected the unequaled places that make this country special,&quot; said William H. Meadows, President of The Wilderness Society. &quot;America's investment has paid extraordinary dividends: we have nurtured National Parks, Forests and Wildlife Refuges and other public lands that are the envy of the world. Now is the time to be building on that investment, not walking away from it.&quot;</font></p>
