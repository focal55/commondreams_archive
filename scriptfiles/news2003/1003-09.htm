- October 3 - Members of the Green Party of the

United States are joining the call for the appointment

of an independent prosecutor to investigate which

senior Bush Administration officials illegally

disclosed the identify of a CIA employee to newspaper

columnist Robert Novak.  The illegal disclosure came a

week after the employee's husband, former Iraq

Ambassador Joseph Wilson, publicly challenged the

claim by President Bush that Iraq had tried to obtain

uranium from Niger, a claim now known to have been

false.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Only an independent prosecutor can investigate this

case, because of the conflict of interest involving

Attorney General John Ashcroft,&quot; said Mark Dunlea,

chair of the Green Party of New York State. &quot;Ambassador Wilson says that he believes that Bush

advisor Karl Rove was involved in the leak.  Mr. Rove

has previously been employed by Ashcroft in his

political campaigns for Governor and for U.S.

Senator.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens have also called for an independent prosecutor

to investigate the White House's role in ordering the

EPA to issue false statements about air quality near

World Trade Center site in New York City shortly after

the 9/11 attacks, and whether President Bush,

Vice-President Cheney and other administration

officials lied to Congress, the American people, and

the United Nations about the reasons for invading

Iraq. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens noted that the two major parties have been

inconsistent in their support for the appointment of independent special prosecutors in times of scandal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have a crisis of democracy in America,&quot; said Jake Schneider, treasurer of the Green Party of the United States.  &quot;The allegations of deceit and illegal behavior by leading members of the Bush administration are so numerous, from 9/11 to insider trading by Bush and Cheney to false information about weapons of mass destruction, that we need an independent prosecutor to hold these officials accountable and help restore trust in our government.  Americans deserve to see wider probe of Iraq deceit, not just the name leak.&quot;</font></p>
