Clashes between forest defenders and Forest Service

law enforcement stepped up Thursday morning in the

Willamette National Forest, following  the beginning

of old-growth logging and one arrest on Wednesday. The altercation is ongoing at this hour and expected to continue, as activists engage a variety of direct action tactics and Forest Service personnel make their first ever attempt to remove a tree-sit on National Forest land.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to manning a number of tree-sits and

dozens of traverses (maneuverable climb lines crossing

between trees), forest defenders are now engaging in&quot;cat and mouse&quot;, a tactic by which activists on the

ground attempt to disrupt logging operations by

putting themselves in the path of loggers and falling

trees. This tactic, while often successful in stalling

logging, led to the death of activist David Chain in

California during the 1990's when a Chain was struck

by a falling redwood when a logger willfully directed

the felled tree toward him.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Cascadia Forest Defenders have had a large

encampment in the Straw Devil timber sale for several

months. Despite well-documented populations of red

tree voles and other species listed as threatened

under Forest Service guidelines the entire sale is

designated for clear-cutting. Also of serious concern

is the fact that logging is commencing during a level

III fire danger conditions, with a very real

possibility that sparks from machinery could ignite

wildfires.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In hope of stopping further logging operations, which

are being conducted by Engels Investors, forest

defenders will be continuing their campaign of

grassroots outreach and non-violent direct action in

the coming days and weeks. Forest defenders remain

entrenched in many parts of the timber sale at this

hour.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These actions come as the Bush administration prepares

a number of sweeping assaults on existing

environmental law, including the elimination of

surveys for threatened &quot;survey and manage&quot; species

under the Northwest Forest Plan. In response, forest

defenders have initiated a regionally coordinated

direct action campaign called &quot;Cascadia Summer&quot;, which

includes the operations at Straw Devil. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Help is desperately needed from the progressive

community in the form of fiscal donations, legal

support, and individuals in the region interested in

taking part in or actively supporting those engaged in non-violent civil disobedience. </font></p>
