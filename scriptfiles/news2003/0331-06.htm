                - March 31 - A new report from the U.S. Department of Health and 

                Human Services&#146; (HHS) Inspector General confirms that the 

                federal government&#146;s current drug review process does not 

                adequately protect consumers from harmful prescription medications, 

                Public Citizen said today. Seven drugs approved since 1996, including 

                Rezulin and Redux (used to treat diabetes and obesity) have been 

                removed from the market because they were deemed unsafe.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> According 

                  to the report, 40 percent of U.S. Food and Drug Administration 

                  (FDA) long-term reviewers responding to a survey conducted by 

                  the Inspector General said that the review process has worsened 

                  since they were first employed at the agency. The report recommends 

                  that in most circumstances, the permitted review period for 

                  new drugs, which ranges between six and 12 months, be extended 

                  by one to two months.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All new 

                  drugs must be reviewed for safety and efficacy before being 

                  put on the market. Under legislation that took effect in 1992, 

                  drug companies pay &quot;user fees,&quot; essentially paying 

                  the salaries of the people reviewing the drugs.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 

                  FDA is supposed to rigorously screen all new drugs and ensure 

                  that they are safe and effective before they are sold to millions 

                  of people,&quot; said Peter Lurie, M.D., MPH, deputy director 

                  of Public Citizen&#146;s Health Research Group. &quot;Unless 

                  the agency gets out of the snug bed it is currently sharing 

                  with industry, unsafe drugs will continue to slip through the 

                  safety net.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The centerpiece 

                  of the Inspector General&#146;s report is a survey of 401 new 

                  drug reviewers in the FDA&#146;s Center for Drug Evaluation 

                  and Research. Fifty-eight percent said that the six months allotted 

                  for review of priority New Drug Applications was inadequate; 

                  25 percent felt similarly about the target of 10 months provided 

                  for review of most standard applications. A priority drug is 

                  a breakthrough drug or one designed to treat an unusual condition; 

                  a minority of drugs fall into this category.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eighteen 

                  percent of these physicians and scientists felt pressure to 

                  recommend that drugs be approved for sale despite their reservations 

                  about the drug&#146;s safety, efficacy or quality. (The report 

                  does not say who exerted the pressure.) The report concludes: 

                  &quot;Overall, these findings present a significant warning 

                  signal.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These findings 

                  are consistent with prior research conducted by Public Citizen 

                  and the FDA itself. In December 1998, Public Citizen conducted 

                  a study (<a href="http://www.citizen.org/publications/release.cfm?ID=7104" target="_new">click 

                  here to view</a>) showing that 19 FDA medical officers identified 

                  27 new drugs that they had reviewed in the past three years 

                  that they thought should not be approved but the agency approved 

                  anyway. Seventeen medical officers described the current standards 

                  of FDA review for safety and efficacy as &quot;lower&quot; or 

                  &quot;much lower&quot; compared to those in existence prior 

                  to 1995. And several medical officers said they had been instructed 

                  by their superiors to censor their reports or presentations.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A subsequent 

                  FDA survey in 2001 precipitated by high turnover rates among 

                  employees in the agency showed that about one-third of medical 

                  officers did not feel comfortable expressing differing scientific 

                  opinions, and a similar number felt that decisions adverse to 

                  a drug were stigmatized within the agency. A number of reviewers 

                  said that decisions should be based more on science and less 

                  on corporate wishes.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This anti-scientific 

                  climate was confirmed in the new Inspector General&#146;s report. 

                  Twenty-one percent of those polled indicated that the work environment 

                  at the FDA allowed for scientific disagreement to only a small 

                  or no extent. The report also indicates that, over time, a lower 

                  percentage of drugs, particularly priority drugs, is being presented 

                  to the FDA&#146;s external advisory committees, reflecting the 

                  speed-up at the FDA and minimizing the opportunity for valuable 

                  external peer review.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;FDA&#146;s 

                  reliance on user fees from the industry has skewed the drug 

                  approval process toward the industry&#146;s financial interests 

                  and away from consumer protection,&quot; Lurie said. &quot;Only 

                  a purely government-funded agency, as the FDA had been from 

                  its origins in 1906 to 1992, can have the independence necessary 

                  to keep unsafe and/or ineffective drugs off the market.&quot;</font></p>
