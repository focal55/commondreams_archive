- October 15 - While many presidential campaigns declined in fundraising, the 
insurgent Kucinich campaign today is filing its financial statement 
showing an increase. This quarter's total, much of it raised on the 
Internet, was $1.65 million -- beating last quarter's $1.54 million.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kucinich fundraising is grass roots fundraising with the average 
donation this quarter $72. Nearly $1 million was raised in September 
alone. The campaign ended the quarter with roughly $800,000 cash on 
hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In less than 8 months since launching, the campaign has raised more 
than $3.5 million, the vast majority of which will be federally 
matched.  As a grass roots campaign with a huge volunteer base, 
Kucinich for President doesn't need to equal other campaigns dollar 
for dollar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While some pundits wish the Kucinich campaign would just go away, it 
has surged in recent weeks. Small-donor house parties across the 
country on Sept. 21 raised nearly $300,000 and many more are planned 
for the next months. The announcement kick-off tour to a dozen cities 
in the last 3 days has been a smash success, with large enthusiastic 
crowds (Minnesota Public Radio estimated last night's Minneapolis 
crowd at 2,000) -- and appearances by well-known figures such as Ani 
DiFranco, Studs Terkel, Mimi Kennedy and Dr. Patch Adams.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Endorsements keep rolling in -- from Democratic leaders (including 
Minnesota State Senate Majority leader John Hottinger and New Mexico 
Public Regulation Commissioner E. Shirley Baca), as well as Green 
Party allies like recent VP candidate Winona LaDuke</font></p>
