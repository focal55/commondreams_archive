                - March 20 - The following is a statement by NOW President Kim 

                Gandy on the war in Iraq: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the Bush 

                Administration wages war against Saddam Hussein, our hearts and 

                thoughts go out to all those who will suffer as a result of this 

                attack. Bush's tunnel vision is jeopardizing the women and men 

                serving in the U.S. military and millions of lives in Iraq, where 

                more than half of the population is children. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush wants 

                us to believe that the U.S. is united for war, but many millions 

                are united for peace here and around the world. In defiance of 

                the U.N., Bush is acting as a renegade, arm-twisting our allies 

                and disregarding international law. How can we aspire to advance 

                democracy around the world if we can't practice it here at home? 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may never 

                know the true devastation of Bush's war on Iraq due to the Administration's 

                stranglehold on the U.S. media. Television news is helping the 

                Bush Administration obscure the carnage with bloodless video game-like 

                simulations of military strikes. The most horrific consequences 

                of this war will not be covered on the nightly news. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reality 

                is that many lives will be lost, and an already-ravaged country 

                will be further destroyed. Bush's reckless mission has also endangered 

                the safety and stability of the U.S. and the world. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOW calls for 

                the Bush Administration to end this unprovoked attack immediately 

                and to help restore the democratic principles he has undermined. 

                We also call on international leaders to join in working toward 

                peace and human rights around the world. As the drumbeat to stand 

                behind Bush in a time of war grows louder every day, it is more 

                important than ever to raise our voices for peace. </font> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
