                - April 7 - The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) today 

                called on the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) to reject 

                the nomination of a 'Muslim-basher' to its board of directors. 

                (SEE: <a href="http://www.usip.org" target="_new">http://www.usip.org</a>) 

                The Washington-based Islamic civil rights and advocacy group faxed 

                a letter to USIP President Dr. Richard Solomon explaining why, 

                in its view, pro-Israel commentator Daniel Pipes would be an inappropriate 

                choice for the institute's board. </font>

                PROTEST BUSH NOMINEE" <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42881-2003Apr6.html%20" target="_new">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42881-2003Apr6.html

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his letter, 

                CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad wrote: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Unfortunately, 

                no credible Muslim leader in the United States or around the world 

                could cooperate with an organization in which Pipes has a decision-making 

                role. For example, it would be extremely difficult for Muslim 

                representatives to take part in USIP's Special Initiative on the 

                Muslim World if Pipes joined the board. Instead of 'increasing 

                the prospects for long-term understanding between the Western 

                and Islamic worlds,' Pipes' bigoted views have been instrumental 

                in widening the divide between faiths and cultures." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Awad also noted 

                that because the institute's board already has a representative 

                from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), it 

                does not need another member with "extremist pro-Israel views." 

                Pipes has been quoted as saying: "The Palestinians are a miserable 

                people...and they deserve to be." His personal web site was built 

                and is maintained by an Israeli settler. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week, 

                CAIR urged President Bush to rescind Pipes' nomination because 

                of his "long history of advocating the political disenfranchisement 

                and marginalization of America's Islamic community." (The institute's 

                board of directors is appointed by the president and confirmed 

                by the Senate.) CAIR cited an October 21, 2001, speech before 

                the convention of the American Jewish Congress, in which Pipes 

                stated: "I worry very much from the Jewish point of view that 

                the presence, and increased stature, and affluence, and enfranchisement 

                of American Muslims...will present true dangers to American Jews." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pipes has 

                  called for increased surveillance of ordinary American Muslims 

                  and claims 10 to 15 percent of Muslims are "potential killers." 

                  He has also decried any positive portrayal of Islamic history 

                  and beliefs in public schools and termed the PBS documentary 

                  "Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet" an "outrage." Last year, Pipes 

                  faced a storm of criticism when he launched Campus Watch, a 

                  web site that included "dossiers" on professors and academic 

                  institutions thought to be too critical of Israel or too sympathetic 

                  to Islam and Muslims. </font></p>
