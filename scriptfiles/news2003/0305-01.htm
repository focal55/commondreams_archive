                YORK - March 5 - Mark Crispin Miller, author of "The Bush Dyslexicon" 

                will be performing his hit one-man show, "Bush Are 'Us,'" at the 

                Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, in NYC, on select Sunday 

                evenings, March 9, 23 and 30 at 7:30pm. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A long-time 

                media critic and political commentator, Miller wrote "Bush Are 

                'Us'" out of frustration with the US press, which, he claims, 

                has shirked its constitutional obligation to protect American 

                democracy. Far from keeping a suspicious eye on federal power-the 

                journalistic task envisioned by the Founding Fathers-the mainstream 

                press has, in the name of "patriotism" and the "war on terrorism," 

                let the Bush administration strip away our basic freedoms. Miller 

                uses dazzling comic riffs and startling journalistic revelation 

                to encourage the audience to play an active role "in this all-important 

                struggle to protect free speech and realize this nation's democratic 

                promise." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Miller's 

                view, "American journalism" is threatening to become an oxymoron. 

                The networks' reporters "are all down on their knees before the 

                powerful," he says, and, in his view, the print press too has 

                dropped the ball. Major scandals don't get any coverage whatsoever, 

                political and corporate malefactors get off easy, while the president 

                is readily compared to Winston Churchill. Meanwhile, America's 

                economy is in collapse, the threat of global terrorism is as grave 

                as ever, and our nation is detested the world over. "If you feel 

                as if you've lost your mind," says Miller, "you are not alone." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is, in fact, 

                specifically for those who feel as if the world has gone insane 

                that Miller first conceived of "Bush Are 'Us.'" His show is both 

                hilarious and shocking, terrifying and comforting. Miller, writes 

                Ari Berman of Editor & Publisher has "returned with a vengeance, 

                unveiling a provocative, funny, and deeply disturbing one-man 

                show. While the mainstream press still wants nothing to do with 

                it, the first four shows have sold out, with three more planned 

                for March. Can Miller do for political standup what Michael Moore 

                did for Flint, Mich.?" </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Bush Are 'Us'" 

                has been garnering tremendous praise and excellent word-of-mouth 

                as it plays to sold-out audiences in New York City. </font>
