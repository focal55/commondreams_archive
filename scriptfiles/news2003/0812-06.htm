- August 12 - Increased industry concentration and anti-competitive practices by cable providers since cable industry deregulation in 1996 have prevented competitors from gaining enough market share to give consumers real choices, lower cable rates or improve cable service quality, according to a new report released by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report compares industry and deregulation proponent promises in 1996 to cable consumer realities in 2003: cable rates have skyrocketed; service levels have declined; industry consolidation has increased enormously; cable continues to deny competitors access to critical programming; wireline competition is virtually non-existent; and the industry now dominates the broadband Internet market, giving it enormous and unregulated influence over America's digital future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Since deregulation seven years ago, the cable industry has price-gouged consumers by raising its prices more than 50%,&quot; said Ed Mierzwinski, U.S. PIRG Consumer Program Director,  &quot;Congress promised that deregulation would bring competition and lower prices.  Instead, the industry has raised prices and used anti-competitive practices to prevent consumers in nearly every market from having a choice of cable providers, a choice that would lower their rates and improve their terrible service.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study, The Failure of Cable Deregulation: A Blueprint For Creating a Competitive, Pro-Consumer Cable Television Marketplace, was endorsed today by Consumer Federation of America, Center For Digital Democracy, Media Access Project and Consumers Union.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The solution to cable's unfettered abuse is for Congress to move decision making out of Washington, return authority to local communities, and give more consumers real choices. In Washington, the FCC has simply lost touch with reality,&quot; said Mark Cooper, Research Director of Consumer Federation of America, and the author of the 2002 book Cable Mergers and Monopolies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the key recommendations of the report were the following</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;	Congress must empower state public utility commissions (PUC) to

regulate

all cable rates and charges for video services until meaningful competition emerges and also return largely-diminished authority to local communities and their franchising authorities to protect consumers from the industry's worst abuses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;	Introduce an &agrave; la carte programming requirement to expand consumer

choices. Consumers should be able to choose their own suite of programming, rather than being force-fed the programming tiers that cable operators want them to purchase.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;	Ensure access to vital programming by preventing the cable companies

from

their anti-competitive practices of locking up must-have programming, such as sports and other regional channels. Modify the existing federal program-access law to eliminate loopholes that have allowed the cable industry to continue these anti-competitive practices and undermine the emergence of would-be wireline competitors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;	Empower viewers by putting a citizen board member on every large

(greater

than 4% of cable households) cable company's board and by requiring as a condition of franchise renewal that cable operators include billing inserts that invite consumers to join a local Cable Action Group that would operate a local Audience Channel, well-funded and equipped by the cable company.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also documented that the deregulated cable industry's growing dominance over the emerging broadband Internet poses real threats to diversity and democracy on the Internet.  Unlike DSL broadband, which is owned by regulated phone companies required to share their networks, cable Internet service providers can lock out their competition. As cable companies dominate the user interface they could limit consumer access to Internet content from online competitors, from streaming video to movie channels.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If Congress and the American public pay attention to this report, it may be early enough to forestall the cable monopoly from hijacking the Internet,&quot; added Andrew Jay Schwartzman, President of the Media Access Project. &quot;The Internet as we know it is in jeopardy. If the cable television model is extended to the Internet, the open and interactive system which characterizes the dial up Internet will be lost. Those who read this report will see how important it is not to let that happen.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Cable's powerful stranglehold threatens consumers, competitors and communities. With the impending new FCC give-away on cable ownership policy, the public must take immediate action to restrain this media monopoly.  Both the future of TV and the broadband Internet are at stake,&quot; said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. &quot;Cable's threat to democracy and diversity on the Internet, our virtual town square, cannot be over-stated.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups called on Congress to turn the report's recommendations into actions to protect cable consumers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The American public has little idea how the cable industry has flouted the intent of Congress, co-opted the FCC, and reaped tremendous profits at the public's expense,&quot; said report author Jay R. Halfon. &quot;This report details the overwhelming evidence of the cable industry's abuses, particularly its success at quashing wireline competitors, who have had the only success impacting cable rates.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The proposals outlined today provide a roadmap for action to protect consumers from the cable monopoly,&quot; Halfon concluded.</font></p>
