                - March 17 - The Social Security Administration today is releasing 

                the annual report from its trustees on the status of the nation's 

                retirement and health programs for seniors. Even though this year's 

                report shows slightly better short-term news, experts from the 

                National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA) say "the long-term 

                prospects for both programs are deteriorating rapidly." NCPA experts 

                are available to discuss the report and the long-term implications 

                of maintaining the status quo. Contact the NCPA Public Affairs 

                office at 800-859-1154 for more information. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Just like 

                anyone planning for retirement, policy makers should think long-term 

                when discussing the health of Social Security," said Matt Moore, 

                Social Security policy analyst with the NCPA. "This year's trustees 

                report shows that attempting to maintain the status quo is going 

                to be difficult at best, disastrous at worst." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 

                the NCPA's analysis of the trustees' report, revenues from the 

                payroll tax that currently support Social Security and Medicare 

                will no longer be sufficient to pay benefits within the next ten 

                years. At that time, the obligations denoted by the programs' 

                Trust Funds will require a shift in tax dollars from other areas 

                of the budget at an accelerating rate. The NCPA pointed to a few 

                key dates: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Today: Funds 

                collected for Social Security and Medicare Part A and B are in 

                excess to what is needed to provide benefits. This surplus is 

                equal 2 percent of all federal income tax collections. -- 2008: 

                The date when the funds will no longer be sufficient and general 

                revenue transfers will be needed to meet the programs' obligations. 

                -- 2013: 5 percent of all federal income tax receipts will be 

                needed to maintain promised benefits. -- 2020: 17 percent of all 

                federal income tax receipts will be needed to maintain promised 

                benefits. -- 2030: 36 percent of all federal income tax receipts 

                will be needed to maintain the status quo. -- 2040: Two years 

                before the "Social Security Trust Fund" is exhausted under current 

                estimates, these programs will require 47 percent, or nearly half, 

                of all federal income tax receipts. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NCPA will 

                host a Capitol Hill briefing on the report Tuesday, featuring 

                Social Security and Medicare Trustee Thomas R. Saving. For details,
