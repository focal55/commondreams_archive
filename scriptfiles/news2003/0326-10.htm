                - March 26 - &quot;Today's House action shows that legislation 

                banning safe abortion procedures for women is on the fast track. 

                It is amazing that even at a time of war anti-choice advocates 

                are able to move their anti-Roe agenda through Congress and to 

                the White House with such speed. In fact, this bill contains the 

                very same constitutional flaws as the laws struck down by the 

                Supreme Court: it fails to protect women's health and it bans 

                more than one procedure, these flaws appear insignificant and 

                unimportant to these anti-choice elected officials. What kind 

                of message does it send to the world that our government is moving 

                restrict constitutional rights and liberties back home the women 

                who live in this country? </font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President 

                  Bush says he will sign this bill into law. If it were to go 

                  into effect, women would no longer be able to count on receiving 

                  the safest, best care from their doctors without the fear of 

                  criminal penalties. Physicians no longer would be able to decide 

                  what is best for the health of their patients. I shudder to 

                  think what right, what freedom and what liberty is next on their 

                  anti-choice agenda. We must be vigilant in our efforts to protect 

                  the right to choose because it is patently clear that Washington 

                  politicians want to take it away.&quot; </font></p>
