- May 23 - Thousands are expected to 

assemble in the nation's capital on Saturday, May 24, to protest 

what is viewed by many in the Muslim and civil rights community as 

the erosion of civil rights and civil liberties under the 

Bush-Ashcroft administration. The march and rally, called Muslim 

Solidarity Day for Justice and Peace, sponsored by Muslim American 

Society Freedom Foundation, America's largest Muslim grassroots 

organization, will commence at 12 noon at Freedom Plaza (14th St 

and Pennsylvania Ave., NW). 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group will be joined by several peace, justice, religious 

and civil rights organizations and will include speakers such as 

Imam Siraj Wahaj, former Congressman Rev. Walter Fauntroy, Ron 

Daniels (Center for Constitutional Rights), Congressman John 

Conyers, a representative from Congressman Dennis Kucinich's 

office, Rev. Al Sharpton, Mara Verheyden-Hillard (Partnership for 

Civil Justice), Dr. Jamal Badawi, Brian Becker (International 

Action Center), Hillary Shelton (NAACP), and Mahdi Bray, executive 

director of MAS Freedom, and representatives from the following 

organizations: Muslim American Society, MANA, SEIU, AFL-CIO, 

ADC-Boston, Rainbow PUSH Coalition, American For a Fair Chance, 

Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, People for the American Way, 

NAACP, Islamic Circle of North America, American Muslim Council, 

AFL-CIO, Peace Action Network, Center for Constitutional Rights, 

members of the national interfaith community and many more. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group will address such issues as INS detainment, racial and 

religious profiling, the Patriot Act, and the government's 

targeting of places of worship. In addition to civil rights and 

civil liberties issues, the rally will also address the Bush 

administration's affirmative action, detention through secret 

evidence and what many activists consider to be a fundamental 

disregard for the Bill of Rights and due process under the guise of 

fighting terrorism and national security. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Bray, "Our nation can never be safer from the 

scourge of terrorism by targeting Muslims and immigrants and 

ignoring the basic principles of due process and constitutional 

rights. Since 9/11, under this administration, the American Muslim 

community has been unjustly targeted at the expense of democratic 

values and fundamental rights cherished by all Americans. Simply 

put, our community feels betrayed by the President's flowery 

rhetoric about Islam and sees itself as a target for political 

opportunism and blatant discrimination." 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MAS Freedom is the Public Affairs branch of the Muslim American 

Society. Our mission is to build an integrated empowerment process 

for the American Muslim community through civic education, 

participation, community outreach, and coalition building; to forge 

positive relationships with other institutions outside of our 

community, that will ensure and facilitate the protection of civil 

rights and liberties for American Muslims and all Americans and 

fair treatment of all immigrants.
