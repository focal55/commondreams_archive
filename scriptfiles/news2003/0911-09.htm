<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN FRANCISCO - September 11 - The Inter-American Development Bank or IDB Wednesday approved 135 million dollars in financing for Peru's enviromental risky Camisea natural gas pipeline and terminal joint venture project, despite the objections of environment community, a press released from the bank announced.

Camisea's critics argue that support to the project is opening the way for the destruction of one of the world's most pristine rainforests and of isolated indigenous populations.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;IDB member governments made a critical mistake today,&quot; said Aaron Goldzimer of Environmental Defense. &quot;The project is out of step with international standards and now the IDB has demonstrated it is at the bottom of the international financial community in its environmental and social safeguards.&quot; a press release from the Firends of the earth points out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bank's board approved a $ 75 million loan from the banks books and a $ 60 million loan pooled from other institutions, the IDB said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Environmental and indigenous peoples' advocates, said the project would harm Peru's Amazon rainforest and native communities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Camisea violates international environmental standards,&quot; said Jon Sohn, lead campaigner at Friends of the Earth. &quot;We're very disappointed.&quot; he added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The US Export-Import Bank, rejected last month a 214-million-dollar loan guarantee for the project, on the grounds of environmental concerns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The IDB said in its press release, &quot;The project, which has been declared a national interest priority by Peru, is expected to bring the country major economic benefits, lower the cost of energy and reduce air pollution by replacing other fuels with natural gas, the cleanest of the fossil fuels.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Peruvian government also has been supporting the project. &quot;This project is vital to Peru,&quot; Roberto Danino, Peru's ambassador to the United States, told reporters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But according to to enviromentalists &quot;The IDB just committed American taxpayers' money to a project that threatens the natural and cultural environment in Peru,&quot; said Environmental

Defense social scientist Aaron Goldzimer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A real political debate on the project was finally underway in Peru, and the IDB has closed the door. The Ex-Im Bank and Citigroup, both of which severed their relationships with the project, demonstrated much higher environmental and social standards

than the IDB,&quot; he added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The IDB delayed the loan decision for the project twice in consideration to outstanding concerns, the same concerns that led the U.S. Export Import Bank to reject its financing, on the grounds that Camisea did not meet the bank's environmental standards. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But on Wednesday, the bank gave to the presures &quot;The Bank shut the door on negotiations that could have made a difference

in whether or not Camisea brings social and ecological ruin to the Urubamba Valley over the life of the project,&quot; Atossa Soltani of Amazon

Watch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By scrutinizing Camisea, many influential people have learned about the IDB's non-existent standards. The IDB is very vulnerable to what on-going monitoring of this project will reveal,&quot; said Amy Gray of the Bank Information Center.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This shows the Bush administration failed to demonstrate moral courage and send a clear signal by voting no on this project,&quot; said Nadia Martinez of the Institute for Policy Studies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Camisea join venture is led by Argentina's Pluspetrol, Techint and US-based Hunt Oil Co., aims to bring gas from deposits in southern Peru to a marine terminal near Lima for export.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

According to the Peruvian government the venture would boost Peru's economic growth by one percentage point per year over its 30-year lifespan starting in August 2004, when gas exports are slated to commence, Danino said, adding that a portion of the proceeds would be set aside to aid indigenous communities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The project, which has been declared a national interest priority by Peru, is expected to bring the country major economic benefits, lower the cost of energy and reduce air pollution by replacing other fuels with natural gas, the cleanest of the fossil fuels.&quot;the IDB said in the release.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If there are any violations of the IDB's conditions, we'll be pressing hard and fast for the loan to be revoked,&quot; said Sohn, at Friends of the Earth.</font></p>
