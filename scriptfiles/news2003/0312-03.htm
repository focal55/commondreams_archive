                - March 12 - "A lack of health insurance is not just an inconvenience, 

                but a serious health risk," said Sara Walker, MD, MACP, president 

                of the American College of Physicians - American Society of Internal 

                Medicine, during a health fair at Temple University Children's 

                Medical Center in Philadelphia, PA. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ACP-ASIM 

                has produced a series of reports confirming the relationship between 

                a lack of insurance and poorer medical outcomes. The evidence 

                collected by the College confirms that the uninsured are more 

                likely to delay seeking care and more likely to experience poorer 

                medical outcomes. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a result, 

                uninsured Americans are more likely to: require avoidable hospitalizations 

                and emergency care, suffer adverse health outcomes, and experience 

                a generally higher mortality rate. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The latest 

                available data from the U.S. Census Bureau indicates that 41.2 

                million people are without health insurance protection," said 

                Dr. Walker. "Another recent study shows that 75 million Americans 

                were without health insurance sometime during the past year-many 

                for months at a time. The plight of the uninsured persists despite 

                the fact that nearly 80 percent are part of a working family." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We know what 

                the problem is-too many working Americans and their families have 

                no health insurance and they live sicker and die younger as a 

                result," said Dr. Walker. "We need solutions-practical approaches 

                that build upon what works with our current health insurance system, 

                while fixing what does not." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Walker 

                presented a plan developed by the ACP-ASIM to ensure all Americans 

                have health insurance. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Instead of 

                using the heavy-hand of government to dictate how people will 

                get coverage, the College's plan relies instead on economic incentives 

                for states and small employers to offer coverage," said Dr. Walker. 

                "Instead of trying out some untested scheme on the American people, 

                our plan builds upon existing programs that we know will work." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Legislation 

                based on the College's plan will soon be introduced in Congress 

                by Senator Jeff Bingaman. Under the plan, all Americans will be 

                covered by an affordable health insurance plan by the end of this 

                decade. The highlights of the proposal are as follows: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Coverage 

                will be expanded in steps, starting with the poor- and near-poor 

                and then later to all uninsured Americans. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. States will 

                be given strong financial incentives to cover more people through 

                existing public programs -without imposing a new economic burden 

                or unfunded mandates on economically strapped states. They would 

                also be given more flexibility to establish their own new programs 

                for the uninsured, backed up with dedicated federal funds. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Those who 

                are not eligible for coverage under state programs will receive 

                tax credits to help them buy coverage. They may buy coverage from 

                a new group purchasing program modeled after the highly successful 

                Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Or, they could use 

                their credits to buy individual insurance coverage or to help 

                pay for the costs of employer-sponsored coverage. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. The group 

                purchasing program, based on the Federal Employees Health Benefits 

                Program, will give eligible tax credit recipients the same choices 

                of health plans, providers, and benefits that are now available 

                to members of Congress, White House employees, and their families. 

                At least two of the plans offered to them will have to include 

                essential benefits as recommended by an expert Commission and 

                approved by Congress. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Small employers 

                will also be permitted to buy their health insurance from the 

                same group purchasing program. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Walker 

                urged Congress to enact legislation to assure that all Americans 

                have access to affordable and sensible health insurance system 

                by the end of this decade. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As Americans, 

                we should expect no less," she said. </font>
