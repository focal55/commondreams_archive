- August 26 - Following is a statement of NOW/PAC Chair Kim Gandy:</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today, Women's Equality Day, the National Organization for Women's Political Action Committee is proud to announce our endorsement of former Ambassador and Senator Carol Moseley Braun for president of the United States. Both the National Women's Political Caucus and the National Congress of Black Women join us in endorsing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With our endorsement comes access to NOW's hundreds of thousands of contributing members and over 500 chapters across the country -- and the support of thousands of volunteer activists who are dedicated to supporting feminist candidates with their contributions and volunteer time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;To receive NOW/PAC's endorsement, a candidate must demonstrate an uncompromising commitment to the entire range of women's rights issues. After considering the positions and past records of all the candidates lined up to challenge George W. Bush, one candidate stood above the rest for her lifetime commitment to feminist ideals and her 25-year record fighting for the rights of women at the local, state, national and international levels. We are particularly excited when out of a field of strong progressive candidates, the strongest feminist candidate is also a woman.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Carol Moseley Braun has never wavered nor bowed to political pressure in her commitment to social and economic justice for all. As the first African American woman in the U.S. Senate, and the only African American senator during her tenure, she stood up for civil rights and women's equity time and time again.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;NOW/PAC's top political priority is sending Bush back to Texas, and NOW's Drive for Equality -- a campaign to identify, inform, register and mobilize women to participate in the political process -- will help by increasing the women's vote. We look forward to working with Carol Moseley Braun to advance that goal, because she speaks to a large portion of the U.S. population, particularly women, who were not inspired to get out and vote in 2000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For over 25 years, NOW/PAC has worked tirelessly for women to gain equal representation in our government. Moseley Braun's candidacy is a prime example of what feminists strive for -- women moving up through all levels of political office. We are proud to have this strong and accomplished woman running for the highest office in the land -- and serving as an inspiration to women and girls of all ages who believe that a woman truly can become president of the United States.&quot;</font></p>
