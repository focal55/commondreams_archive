- December 10 - Who's the genius whose idea it was to cut overtime pay for approximately 8 million working Americans?  Did he get a bonus for his efforts? Who thought it was a terrific idea to prevent airport screeners from enjoying worker protections by forming a union?  Did  she receive a bonus for her work?  And what about the guy who gave us  those paralyzing Code Orange and Code Yellow alerts that now, mysteriously, have disappeared? These are among the questions that Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), the nation's oldest independent liberal political organization, would like to have answered.  </font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President Clinton had stopped the practice of awarding political  appointees with cash bonuses.  The Bush Administration has quietly reinstated them.  ADA wants to know why and who has benefited from the largess. ADA filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request this week with the Departments of Justice, Labor, and Homeland Security and the Office of Personnel Management. </font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The requests were signed by ADA President and Congressman Jim McDermott (D-WA) and seek the details about those Bush Administration political appointees who have been granted bonuses during the past three years.&quot;The American people deserve to know if patronage public employees are being rewarded for carrying out the Bush Administration's regressive and reprehensible agenda,&quot; says ADA National Director Amy Isaacs. &quot;Are appointees in the Justice Department being rewarded for undermining civil liberties? Is the Administration official who  concocted the idea of taking away overtime pay benefits having his or her pockets padded? Did a Homeland Security employee receive a bonus for stripping workers' rights from airport screeners? These are the questions that need to be answered.&quot;</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Bush Administration has mastered the art of political pork. The  Medicare and Energy legislation is rife with monetary and regulatory  handouts for companies friendly with the Administration. Is the same type of cronyism being practiced for federal personnel?&quot; 	</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The FOIA request asks for the identity of each appointee - SES or Schedule C - who received a bonus in 2001, 2002, or 2003. Also  requested are the amounts of each bonus, percentage of salary  represented, and the justification for the bonus for each such  appointee.  We eagerly await the Administration's response.</font></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center">###</p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
