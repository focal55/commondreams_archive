<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- April 29 - Following is a statement 

by the Clean Air Trust: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Usually we present our &quot;Clean Air Villain of the Month&quot; award to 

some miscreant in our nation's capital. For there is usually no 

dearth of dirty-air skullduggery in Washington, D.C. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This month, however, we are casting our net wider. In an era 

when much power and many decisions are being delegated to those 

outside Washington, the potential for mischief also follows. We 

want to highlight two such instances, by awarding this dubious 

distinction as &quot;villains&quot; to Texas State Representative Dennis 

Bonnen and North Carolina State Representative Roger West. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bonnen, a Republican from Angleton (south of Houston) is the 

influential chairman of the Texas House of Representatives 

Committee on Environmental Regulation. He caught our eye by 

introducing a resolution calling on the Texas Commission on 

Environmental Quality to adopt industry-backed Bush Administration 

changes that would weaken new source review requirements and allow 

smokestack polluters to emit more dangerous pollution. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In other words, Bonnen is siding with polluters against groups 

such as the American Lung Association. The lung association, 

numerous state attorneys general and environmental groups 

(including the Clean Air Trust) have gone to court to oppose this 

rollback of the Clean Air Act. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bonnen's actions stand in sharp contrast to those of lawmakers 

in California (led by State Senator Byron Sher) who are seeking to 

enact a state law to ratify that state's ability to enforce the 

tougher (pre-rollback) clean air safeguards. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And even though he supports the federal government when it 

weakens clean air protections, Bonnen has shown he's ready to bash 

the feds if they dare do anything that would threaten polluters. 

For example, EPA's Dallas regional office recently wrote a letter 

objecting to proposed state legislation that would bar the state 

from using evidence from citizens in enforcement actions against 

polluters. Bonnen's reaction to what sounds like a reasonable 

communication? &quot;I think this letter is just a glowing example of 

the overbearing EPA trying to dictate environmental policy in the 

state of Texas,&quot; Bonnen said, in comments published last week in 

the Brazosport Facts newspaper. &quot;This letter in a way is very 

stupid, although they're arrogant and they don't care.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our other villain, North Carolina State Representative Roger 

West, a Republican from Marble, N.C. (in the southwestern part of 

the state) is carrying water for industry in a different way. He 

has actually introduced legislation that would specifically 

eliminate the job of a state air quality enforcer. (He is also 

sponsoring legislation that would eliminate the jobs of state 

officials who enforce wetlands requirements.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even if the state legislature rejects this attempt to fire 

someone simply for doing his job, &quot;This action is a pretty blatant 

act of intimidation,&quot; as a spokesman for the North Carolina 

Department of Environment and Natural Resources put it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This apparently isn't the first time West has tried the 

bully-boy approach. The Raleigh News &amp; Observer reported that 

West, a contractor, had previously contacted the state environment 

department in an apparent attempt to reduce dirty-air fines against 

a company run by friends of his. </font></p>
