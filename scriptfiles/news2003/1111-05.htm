  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - November 11 - In a letter to Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Consumer Advocate Ralph Nader wrote:
  </font></p>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Senator Ted Stevens <br>
        U.S. Senate <br>
        Washington, D.C. 20510 
      </font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">November 10, 2003 
      </font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Senator Stevens: 
      </font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As President Pro Tempore of the Senate, you know as well as anyone in 
          the Senate, and better than most, the value and importance of adherence 
          to Senate procedures and process. Also, as one of the primary authors 
          of the Sustainable Fisheries Act in 1996 and outspoken advocate for the 
          use of the Fishery Management Council process for managing Americaís fish 
          resources, you know the importance of public participation in the fishery 
          management process. I was surprised, therefore, to hear at a meeting in 
          Washington this past week that you are attempting to circumvent the established 
          rules of the Senate and provisions of the Sustainable Fisheries Act with 
          a stealth rider on the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill. Such 
          an action seems unworthy of the Senator whose name carries the very Magnuson 
          Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act that you helped to amend 
          with the Sustainable Fisheries Act barely half a dozen years ago. 
      </font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are serious problems with your proposal that is designated as Title 
        IX of the CJS Appropriations Bill, problems that I would have assumed 
        that you would have recognized and avoided. Since these problems still 
        have not been addressed, even after very broad coalitions of fishermen, 
        conservationists, scientists and your fellow members of Congress pointed 
        them out, I must assume that your busy schedule has not allowed you to 
        fully consider them. In summary fashion then, these are the problems with 
        Title IX that can only be addressed by removing the entire title and allowing 
        the processes that you so frequently endorse to be followed in the North 
        Pacific as they are in the rest of the United States:      </font></font>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. The limitation on funding for implementation of the Essential Fish 
          Habitat requirements is a denial of the public process that is currently 
      underway in the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. That same limitation denies even the possibility for the very scientific 
          research that you insist is necessary for the Council to do its work 
      fairly and appropriately. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. That same limitation virtually guarantees the continued destruction 
          of deep sea coral gardens that the head of Fisheries for the National 
          Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration has determined to be Habitat 
      Areas of Particular Concern warranting special protection. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. The provision that creates a cabal of processors which are granted 
          exclusive rights to receive and process North Pacific crab resources 
          was found to be anti-competitive by the Justice Department and to be 
      potentially in violation of Anti-trust laws. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. That provision for "Processor Quotas" or PQs would create the very 
          kind of combination in restraint of free trade that the National Research 
          Council, in the report "Sharing the Fish", said was unnecessary even 
      if an IFQ system for fishermen were to be established. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. The inclusion of a section of the rider favoring a corporation that 
          your son lobbies for and on whose board of directors your son sits presents 
          an unfortunate but undeniable perception of a very raw and disturbing 
      conflict of interest. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. The provision to institutionalize a destructive bottom trawling 
          fishery for Aleutian Rockfish at the very time that the National Research 
          Council findings on the damaging impacts of trawling on habitat are 
          being considered by the councils and the courts is counterproductive 
      and unnecessarily violates reasonable conservation principles. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8. The provision that opens thousands of acres of ocean floor, that 
          have been closed to fishing for the past several years in order to protect 
          endangered Steller sea lions, flies in the face of the caution that 
          you have so frequently praised as a conservative approach to fisheries 
      management in the North Pacific. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any reasonable reading of the clear language of your proposal leads inexorably 
        to the conclusion that these are not incidental or coincidental problems 
        with your Title IX rider but the clear and intended results of it. 
      </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please rethink and reconsider your position on this matter and allow 
        the Senate process and the public process to proceed by withdrawing the 
        Title IX and proceeding with the CJS Appropriations bill. 
      </font>
