                An independent journalist and analyst who has covered the Mideast 

                for over two decades, Andoni is also monitoring the Arabic-language 

                media. She knew Tareq Ayub, the Al Jazeera correspondent who was 

                killed yesterday by the U.S. military. [The web page <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net" target="_new">http://english.aljazeera.net</a> 

                is back up after being hacked.] Andoni said today: "As much as 

                Arab people want dictators to go, they don't want more U.S.-installed 

                regimes or more occupations. The U.N. should not allow the U.S. 

                to be installing regimes." </font>

                Executive director of the Center for Economic and Social Rights, 

                Normand said today: "Scenes of Iraqi jubilation at the end of 

                Saddam Hussein's oppressive rule come as no surprise to human 

                rights groups that have documented the Iraqi government's crimes 

                for over two decades. But this reaction should not be manipulated 

                by U.S. war planners to justify replacing an indigenous dictatorship 

                with a foreign military occupation designed to channel Iraq's 

                oil wealth to western companies like Halliburton. As an occupying 

                power under the Geneva Conventions, the U.S. now assumes two primary 

                legal obligations: first, to end the occupation as soon as possible 

                without installing either U.S. military rule or a U.S. puppet 

                over the country; and second, to allow independent humanitarian 

                relief agencies unimpeded access (not subject to Pentagon command) 

                to address the grave humanitarian crisis caused by war and sanctions."

                Co-author of Target Iraq, Solomon visited Baghdad three times 

                last fall and winter. He said today: "The killing of journalists 

                at the Palestine Hotel is a reflection of Pentagon priorities 

                -- civilians are readily expendable if they get in the way. And 

                the U.S. attack that killed a journalist at the Al Jazeera office 

                reflects a 'might makes right' approach. We should condemn any 

                regime that endeavors to kill journalists because of their reporting. 

                Clearly the Bush administration falls into that category." Solomon 

                is executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy. </font>

                is a focus on some images -- like Hussein's statue going down 

                -- others, like Iraqi civilian deaths, are downplayed. [The new
