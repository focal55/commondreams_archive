                FRANCISCO - April 9 - A federal judge has ruled that U.S. Secretary 

                of Interior Gale Norton acted illegally by ignoring a petition 

                to list the Pacific fisher as "endangered" under the federal Endangered 

                Species Act and ordered the Secretary to decide within 90 days 

                whether listing the fisher may be warranted. The decision, issued 

                last Friday by the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, comes 

                some 28 months after the Center for Biological Diversity, Sierra 

                Nevada Forest Protection Campaign, and Natural Resources Defense 

                Council submitted the listing petition. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Pending proposals 

                by the U.S. Forest Service to weaken forest protection throughout 

                the Sierra Nevada and to open up the Giant Sequoia National Monument 

                to increased logging would seriously threaten this imperiled furbearer," 

                said Craig Thomas, Director of the Sierra Nevada Forest Protection 

                Campaign. "Given the court's ruling and the fisher's imperiled 

                status, the Forest Service should reconsider its aggressive rollback 

                of environmental protection in the Sierra Nevada's national forests."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Logging old 

                growth forests, in combination with historic trapping, have decimated 

                fisher populations," said Noah Greenwald, a conservation biologist 

                with the Center for Biological Diversity and primary author of 

                the petition to list the species. "The fisher requires immediate 

                protection under the Endangered Species Act to avoid extinction."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Represented 

                by the public-interest law firm Earthjustice, the environmental 

                groups sued Secretary Norton in July 2001 in an attempt to force 

                action on their petition. By law, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, 

                a division of the Department of Interior, must decide whether 

                a listing petition has merit within 90 days of receiving it. If 

                the Service determines, based on the information presented in 

                the petition, that listing may be warranted, the agency has a 

                year to decide whether to actually list the species. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Fish & 

                Wildlife Service eventually admitted that their decision for the 

                fisher was long past due, but they wanted permission to put things 

                off for another year," said Greg Loarie, an attorney with Earthjustice. 

                "At that rate, it's doubtful that the fisher would survive to 

                see the end of the listing process. Fortunately, the Court saw 

                through the Service's excuses and ordered the agency to make its 

                decision within 90 days." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fisher 

                (Martes pennanti) is a member of the weasel family and a close 

                relative of the marten. In the Pacific coast states, the fisher 

                formerly inhabited old growth forests throughout the Sierra Nevada, 

                northern California, and western Oregon and Washington. However, 

                as a result of logging, trapping and development, the fisher's 

                range has been greatly reduced. Native populations of Pacific 

                fisher have been completely extirpated from Washington and Oregon, 

                and they remain in only 50% of their historical range in California. 

                Of particular concern, U.S. Forest Service researchers have concluded 

                that the southern Sierra fisher population, which is critical 

                to the survival of the entire species, "may face imminent extinction" 

                in the absence of increased protection. </font>
