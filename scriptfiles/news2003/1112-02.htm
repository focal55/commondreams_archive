- November 12 - New power plants will have to meet stricter clean air standards, thanks to a court decree filed today that settles a lawsuit filed by two environmental groups against the Bush administration. According to the decree, the Bush administration must develop and enforce stronger pollution control standards for new power plants within two years. This will have important consequences for the flood of new power plants expected to be constructed over the next decade. At the same time, the groups vowed to continue fighting the Bush Administration over its recent weakening of clean air standards that protect communities from the oldest and dirtiest power plants and factories across the country.
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our Children's Earth Foundation (OCE) and Sierra Club sued EPA in February of 2003 because EPA has failed to update pollution standards for new power plants as required by the federal Clean Air Act. EPA has not updated the standards, allowing new power plants to use 20-year old technology. This lapse has allowed new power plants to spew hundreds of thousands of tons of additional pollutants into the air that new technology could have prevented.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is an important decree,&quot; said Tiffany Schauer, Executive Director of Our Children's Earth. &quot;Until EPA reviews and updates these standards, new power plants across the country are being built without modern pollution controls. Some of these rules haven't been reviewed for more than 20 years.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We have forced the Bush administration to start reducing pollution from new power plants,&quot; said Pat Gallagher, Director of Environmental Law for the Sierra Club. &quot;However, at the same time, the Bush Administration is bending over backwards to let the oldest and dirtiest power plants continue spewing pollution unchecked. The Bush administration cannot pick and choose which parts of the Clean Air Act it wants to enforce. Communities deserve strong clean air protections for all power plants, not just new ones,&quot; said Gallagher</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the consent decree, EPA must immediately evaluate and establish more stringent limits on pollutants like particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide in light of technological advances in pollution control technology. EPA's delay also has meant that emissions standards for other harmful pollutants like mercury have not been updated, despite considerable advances in pollution technology, and in scientific research showing a clear link between air pollution and human health.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Multiple studies show that air pollution causes premature deaths and increases the frequency and severity of asthma attacks. See for example &quot;Asthma in exercising children exposed to ozone: a cohort study,&quot; Lancet, 359:386-91 (2002) and &quot;Effects of Air Pollutants on Acute Stroke Mortality,&quot; Environmental Health Perspectives, 110:187-91 (2002). In Chicago, a 2002 Harvard study found that the area's nine grandfathered coal plants cause 21,500 asthma attacks and 315 premature deaths every year. Another recent study published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, entitled &quot;The Impact of Air Pollution on Infant Mortality: Evidence from Geographic Variation in Pollution Shocks Induced by a Recession,&quot; indicates that air pollution has inflicted a heavy toll on infant health.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EPA now must propose new emission limits for power plants within one year, and issue final regulations within two years.</font></p>
