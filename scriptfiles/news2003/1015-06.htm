- October 15 -  
As the House of Representatives debates the Administration's request for an $87 billion blank check to continue its failed Iraq policy, U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) said the following:</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This vote has nothing to do about supplying kevlar vests to our troops, it is about providing &quot;political kevlar&quot; to the defenders of a failed policy.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This Administration has promised much and delivered little.  It cannot find Osama bin Laden, it cannot find Saddam Hussein, it cannot find weapons of mass destruction, it cannot even find whoever at the White House was responsible for illegally revealing a woman who put her life on the line working for the CIA.  The only thing this Administration can find is the taxpayers' wallet, again and again.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The entire text of Rep. Lloyd Doggett's speech is below: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Providing the Administration with &quot;Political Kevlar&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Rep. Lloyd Doggett 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 15, 2003 </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With more than 2000 young Americans dead and injured in Iraq, we have a constitutional obligation to hold this Administration accountable.  We here in Congress need to demonstrate a little more of the type of courage that our young people have shown in Iraq.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are having this vote now because the Administration has been unwilling to build a genuine international coalition.  The price of going it mostly alone is that American taxpayers continue to do most all the paying and our young men and women do most all the dying.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans now must &quot;pay it all&quot; because of the &quot;know-it-all&quot; ideologues who rejected the advice of our leading military experts, of our strongest allies, and the experienced weapons inspectors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is not a problem of too little money, it is a problem of too little thinking and planning. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throwing more taxpayer money at the problem has nothing to do with standing by our troops.  As the data in this chart demonstrates, if this supplemental is rejected entirely, at its current rate of spending the Army will still have plenty of funding for half a year.  But the choice need not be limited to zero and $87 billion.  If you really want to stand by our troops, then supplement some now and force the Administration to come back no later than January with a plan to protect our troops and ensure Iraq's security; don't give it a pass on accountability and a blank check through the next election.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This vote has nothing to do about supplying kevlar vests to our troops; it is about providing &quot;political kevlar&quot; to the defenders of a failed policy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Don't allow the failure of the Administration ideologues in business suits to continue endangering those who so bravely serve us in uniform.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is an Administration that cannot find Osama bin Laden, it cannot find Saddam Hussein, it cannot find weapons of mass destruction, it cannot even find whoever at the White House was responsible for illegally revealing a woman who put her life on the line working for the CIA.  The only thing this Administration can find is the taxpayers' wallet, again and again.&quot;</font></p>
