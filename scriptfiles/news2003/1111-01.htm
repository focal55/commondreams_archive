<td valign="top" align="left" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - November 11 - In a letter delivered today to President Bush, U.S. war veterans declare their belief that U.S. Iraq policy is &#8220;headed in the wrong direction.&#8221;    </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The veterans observe: &quot;At present, U.S. soldiers are falling under attack an average of 35 times each day. To date, 394 U.S. soldiers have been killed in the war. Their lives are being lost for a policy that is unclear and an exit strategy that remains unknown.&quot;
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Posted at <a href="http://www.VeteransforCommonSense.org" target="_new">www.VeteransforCommonSense.org</a> the letter was initiated by the Washington-based Veterans for Common Sense, a veterans&#8217; group that has been critical of the President&#8217;s handling of Iraq. The letter was e-mailed to veterans over the weekend and quickly gathered over 750 signatories, including high-ranking retired officers. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To safeguard U.S. service members and win the peace in Iraq, the letter urges President Bush to undertake &#8220;strong diplomacy to better involve our allies&#8221; and the United Nations; &#8220;create a different kind of force in Iraq&#8221; with the help of U.S. allies; and &#8220;announce a timeline for the phased withdrawal of U.S. and other foreign military forces from Iraq and the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty.&#8221;
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Expressing regret with the White House decision to eliminate $275 per month in combat pay for soldiers getting shot at in Iraq and block $1.3 billion in desperately needed funds for veterans' health programs, the letter calls on President Bush to better honor our troops by ensuring &#8220;adequate compensation and benefits for all who serve our country&#8221; and full funding for veterans&#8217; healthcare. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The signers of the letter describe themselves as patriotic veterans who respect the high office of the President and &#8220;the values that make our nation great.&#8221; The following signatories to the veterans&#8217; letter are available now for media interviews: </font>
