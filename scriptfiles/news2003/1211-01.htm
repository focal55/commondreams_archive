- December 11 - Environmental and public interest groups gathered today near the site of an exclusive Virginia fundraiser to protest President Bush&#146;s practice of paying back his biggest contributors with weakened environmental regulations, pork-barrel projects and plum presidential appointments.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The $2,000-a-plate luncheon in McLean is the 43rd and final fundraiser headlined by Bush this year. After Thursday&#146;s event, the Bush-Cheney campaign is expected pass the $111 million mark for a primary contest in which the president is running unopposed. Averaging nearly $5 million a week in contributions, the campaign has held 91 events headlined by Bush, Vice President Cheney or First Lady Laura Bush since June, according to WhiteHouseForSale.org, a Web site created by Public Citizen.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;In exchange for millions in campaign cash, the Bush administration has rewarded its rainmakers with environmentally destructive policies that include a radical alteration of clean air laws and a pork-laden energy bill filled with billions in handouts to polluters,&quot; said Frank Clemente, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Congress Watch.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Leaders from the electric utility industry, for example, were regularly consulted by Cheney&#146;s secretive energy task force and received key appointments within the administration. Ultimately, they helped rewrite a key Clean Air Act rule that had required polluters like Virginia&#146;s Dominion Power to retrofit their plants with pollution controls when making plant modifications. Future legal actions against such polluters are blocked under the new rule. Bush&#146;s Environmental Protection Agency recently announced it is considering weakening regulations governing mercury emissions as well.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Bush administration&#146;s mercury plan is just another example of their catering to big polluters who make big campaign contributions,&quot; said Pamela Irwin of the Sierra Club&#146;s Virginia chapter. &quot;Instead of supporting weak standards, the administration should require existing technology that reduces emissions of toxic mercury by 90 percent.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Public Citizen, a national consumer group with more than 3,000 Virginia members, launched WhiteHouseForSale.org to track contributors to Bush&#146;s 2004 re-election fund, particularly those dubbed &quot;Rangers&quot; and &quot;Pioneers&quot; for steering $200,000 or $100,000, respectively, to the campaign. The Web site features an updated, searchable database of all 309 individuals named Rangers or Pioneers by the Bush campaign.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">So far, 15 Virginians have been identified as Rangers or Pioneers (this includes two married couples who raised money together). Two-thirds of these top fundraisers work as Washington lobbyists, representing a wide range of corporations seeking special favors from the Bush administration. They include:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Former U.S. Rep. Bill Paxon (R-N.Y.) of Akin Gump, who has become an influential lobbyist. Corporations such as Bechtel, Boeing and Pfizer pay big money to take advantage of Paxon&#146;s close ties to Bush. Not only was Paxon named a Pioneer in 2000 and 2004, but he served as chairman of the Bush-Cheney transition team. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Lobbyists Leslie J. Brorsen, a Pioneer from the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, and Richard F. Hohlt, a Ranger whose clients include Altria, Cinergy and J.P. Morgan. Both served on Bush&#146;s transition team at the Treasury Department. Pioneer David A. Metzner of American Continental Group, a member of Bush&#146;s Commerce Department transition team, represents Exelon, PepsiCo and Siemens. Metzner&#146;s partner, 2000 Pioneer Peter Terpeluk, was appointed as ambassador to Luxembourg by Bush last year. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Husband-and-wife Pioneers Charlie and Judy Black, both lobbyists. Charlie Black is a former senior adviser to former President Reagan and spokesman for the first President Bush. Charlie Black now works on behalf of companies like AT&amp;T, GM and NBC. Judy Black is a former Reagan aide who represents Comcast, Merrill Lynch and Ticketmaster. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Pioneer Mark Holman, who left his position as the top aide to Tom Ridge at the White House Office of Homeland Security last year to become a lobbyist for Blank Rome. His clients include Boeing, BearingPoint, the Homeland Security Corporation, and DestiNY USA, a project aiming to build the country&#146;s largest shopping mall in upstate New York. Buried in the massive energy bill is a $2 billion tax break earmarked for DestiNY, the brainchild of fellow Bush Pioneer Robert J. Congel. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Other Rangers from Virginia are developer Dwight C. Schar, a part owner of the Washington Redskins, and Marvin P. Bush, the president&#146;s brother. Thursday&#146;s event is expected to add more names to the list of top fundraisers when the campaign releases an update in mid-January. In the 2000 election, 15 Virginians pledged to raise at least $100,000, although campaign officials did not confirm if they all raised the full amount.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;This elite group of super-lobbyists understands the value of having special status with the administration,&quot; Clemente said. &quot;These influence-peddlers buy insider access with generous campaign contributions. Then they turn around and sell that access to their clients. This system is destroying our democracy.&quot;</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
