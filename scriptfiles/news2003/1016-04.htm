<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHIANG MAI, THAILAND - October 16 -  On the same day as a U.S. Senate vote on an amendment to a spending bill that would determine whether or not the U.S. would 
contribute $1 billion in authorized spending to the Global Fund in 2004, the U.S. delegation to the Global Fund Board originally opposed the on-time launch 
of the next Global Fund grant cycle in order to justify its own neglect of the 
Global Fund, according to activists. The final decision of the Global Fund 
Board was not to delay the launch of the fourth round of requests for 
proposals, now scheduled for January 10, 2004. Unanswered questions still face the Board over how the next funding round will attract larger, quality 
applications for HIV treatment. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S. was working to delay the release of the request for proposals. Downsizing the scope and speed of the Global Fund makes sense if delegations want to shield themselves from criticism about their own stingy 
contributions,&quot; said Asia Russell of Health GAP. &quot;But if you are one of the 
3.2 million people living with HIV who will die without access to treatment 
next year, it makes no sense.&quot; 
The well-publicized goal promoted by the WHO to provide therapy to 3 million people by 2005 faced a setback with the results of the latest round of grants 
announced at the board meeting. Unless the Global Fund raises additional funds 
from the U.S. and other donors enabling two rounds of disbursements in 2004, while facilitating technical guidance on HIV treatment scale-up for 
applicants, its contributions toward the &quot;3 by 5&quot; initiative will remain be 
negligible: only 240,000 on ARV treatment by 2005, or 8% of the total, 
according to Global Fund officials. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Global Fund estimates $3 billion dollars is needed to cover the costs of proposals in 2004. Because of the shortfall of funding to cover the latest round, its third, the Board authorized &quot;borrowing&quot; against future pledges made 
for 2004. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Launched in January 2001 as a new multilateral emergency response to the 
growing pandemics of AIDS, TB, and malaria, the number and size of Global Fund 
grants have reduced over time, particularly for HIV/AIDS treatment programs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the developing world the number of people dying daily because of untreated 
HIV/AIDS has risen to 8,500, causing the WHO to declare the lack of access to 
antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in developing countries a &quot;Global Health 
Emergency.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of consistent underfunding and lack of technical assistance for 
recipient countries submitting proposals for HIV treatment programs, the Fund's third round of grants announced yesterday constituted a 38% drop in the 
number of new people on ARV treatment from the previous round of grant 
disbursements. 283,000 people are expected to be receiving HIV therapy due to 
Global Fund financing in the second round. For Africa the amount of people 
expected to be on treatment in the first year of grant disbursement, 93,000,will be less than half than were covered in the previous round.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This round should be a wake-up call for the Global Fund,&quot; said Sharonann 
Lynch of Health GAP. &quot;Unless billions are committed for 2004, along with 
aggressive and competent technical assistance to applicants, we will not seean improvement in the size of proposals towards scaling up treatment.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
White House is obstructing efforts to commit $1 billion next year to the 
Global Fund, despite a previous spending promise by President Bush. &quot;Bush 
wants his bilateral AIDS program to be the only game in town, even if it means 
undermining multilateral programs that are already up and running and proving 
effective, and that should be complementary with the Global Fund,&quot; said Amanda 
Lugg of Health GAP. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The delegations of people living with HIV/AIDS and activist groups lost an 
earlier debate at the board meeting, requesting the Global Fund adopt a 
funding framework requiring countries commit to annual financing to the GFATM 
based on the size of their economies. </font></p>
