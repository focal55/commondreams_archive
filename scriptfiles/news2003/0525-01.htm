-  

May 25  - On Sunday, May 25, at about 4 pm, four Catholic Workers, calling themselves 

the Riverside Ploughshares, went aboard the USS Philippine Sea during the 

16th Annual Fleet Week hosted by the Intrepid Museum in New York City.  

During a tour of the USS Philippine Sea, Sr. Susan Clarkson, Mark Colville, 

Brian Buckley, and Joan Gregory poured their blood and hammered on the 

missile hatches that hold Tomahawk Cruise Missiles.  Kneeling on top of the 

missile hatches, Mark Colville held up pictures of Iraqi children who had 

been injured and maimed by US weapons. Mark read the statement the group had 

written, and read from the scriptures.  Brian unfurled their banner which 

read, "Riverside Ploughshares: Disarm and Choose Life."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Catholic Workers said that they came to the Fleet Week event to enflesh the words of the prophet Isaiah to "hammer swords into plowshares."  They believe that nonviolence will lead to peace, and that



violence will only lead to more violence.   They were arrested and

escorted 

off the ship into an awaiting  unmarked blue van.  The tour that the 

Catholic Workers were on was cut

short.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tomahawk cruise missiles are long range missiles that fly at a low altitude 

and therefore are difficult to detect.  The USS Philippine Sea has launched 

Tomahawk cruise missiles against the people of Iraq, Afghanistan, and 

Yugoslavia.   The ship has also been used to enforce the sanctions

against 

Iraq.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mark Colville, who lives at the Amistad Catholic Worker community in 

Connecticut, father of 6 children, said that "We cannot love neighbor or



enemy without disarming ourselves.  We cannot serve the poor without 

defending them against the violence of the state." We cannot affirm life



without standing directly, nonviolently in confrontation with all that deals 

death."

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Catholic Worker Movement, founded by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in



1933, is grounded in a firm belief in the God-given dignity of every human 

person.  Today over 185 Catholic Worker communities remain committed to 

nonviolence, voluntary poverty, prayer, and hospitality for the homeless, 

exiled, hungry, and foresaken. Catholic Workers continue to protest 

injustice, war, racism, and violence of all forms.

Fleet Week, New York City, May 2003

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We come here today to enflesh the prophecy from Isaiah, "They shall beat



their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks" (2:4).  

With hammers we have initiated the process of disarming this battle ship, of 

transforming this carrier of mass destruction into a vessel for peace. The 

USS Philippine Sea uses Tomahawk cruise missiles, depleted uranium munitions 

and the Aegis radar system to enforce the US Empire's will on other nations 

and regions. We pour our blood on this ship to reveal the blood of the 

innocent already shed by the use of this weaponry.  We also pour our blood 

to repent for our complicity in the pervasive violence of our world.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are trying to follow Jesus Christ's commandments to love our enemies and 

neighbors, to forgive those who do us harm and to repent. We seek to stop 

the injury of war on the human family and heal our communities by living

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">nonviolently and seeking justice for all. The peace and security that comes 

from an empire wielding weapons of war and intimidation are false and 

illusory. With hammers we disarm this weapon of mass destruction and with 

blood we reveal its purpose.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the spirit of Dorothy Day, who co-founded with Peter Maurin, the Catholic 

Worker in New York City seventy years ago, we try in our daily lives to 

practice the Works of Mercy, set out in Matthew, Chapter 25.  We feel that 

to follow God's will we must do more than serve the broken of our society. 

It is also our duty to challenge, as Christ did, that which causes poverty. 

Until we convert weapons that end life into tools that enhance life, poverty 

will continue to cripple our society.  For this we pray and for this we act. We are Susan Clarkson, Mark Colville, Joan Gregory and Brian Buckley from 

urban and rural Catholic Worker communities.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"I feel urged to act today because of the exposure I've had over the past 

three years to the charism of the Catholic Worker.  The recent horrors of 

the massacres in Afghanistan and Iraq, the iniquitous sanctions imposed on 

Iraq since the first Gulf War, and my own Government's shameful alliance



with the US, against the wishes of the majority of the British public, 

compels me to take this step of symbolic and practical disarmament, united 

with my American brothers and sisters."                    </i>Sr. Susan

has been in her religious congregation for thirty-seven years and has been a 

member of the Dorothy Day Catholic Worker community in Washington DC since 

May 2002.  She sees her part in this ploughshares action as a coming 

together of many strands in her life: her religious vocation; peace activism 

in Britain; long time membership of the British Campaign for Nuclear 

Disarmament; an M.A in Peace Studies; work with young people in the 

industrial North of England and with homeless people in London.

disarming ourselves.  We cannot serve the poor without defending them 

against the violence of the state.  We cannot affirm life without standing 

directly, nonviolently in confrontation with all that deals death.  War is 

the worship of death.  Preparation for war is the denial of God. Therefore 

I join the Riverside Ploughshares in an act of faith, offered to God as a 

plea for the lives of my children, and all children.  Disarm.  Choose Life.  

AMEN."</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
