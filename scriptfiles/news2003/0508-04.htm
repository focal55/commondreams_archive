<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN FRANCISCO - May 8 - Two top environmental and human rights groups today called on Ford CEO Bill Ford Jr. to dramatically increase fuel efficiency &#151; and speed the transition to hydrogen cars &#151; or face disruptive, nation-wide protests leading up to Ford&#146;s 100th Anniversary and annual shareholder meeting.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Right now, a patriotic American seeking to embrace energy independence by purchasing a high efficiency hybrid must turn to Japanese automakers,&quot; Rainforest Action Network (RAN) and Global Exchange (GX) wrote in a letter to CEO Bill Ford Jr. &quot;Ford is years behind the curve. Sadly, your recent announcement that you would break your promises on SUV fuel efficiency has only weakened Ford&#146;s position.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RAN and GX are known for their &quot;market campaigns,&quot; which caused industry-wide changes to be led by Nike, Burger King, Home Depot, Citigroup, and Starbucks many other Fortune 500 companies. Both RAN and GX were lead organizers of the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, and GX has played a leadership role in the anti-war movement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GX and RAN argue that Ford has tried to position itself as an environmental leader while repeatedly breaking its commitments to produce cleaner and more efficient cars. The National Academy of Sciences concluded that current off-the-shelf technology could significantly boost fuel efficiency. Other studies have found that a jump to 40mpg is possible immediately, and that a jump to 60 mpg is achievable with full hybrid engines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We&#146;re fed up with Bill Ford&#146;s broken promises,&quot; said RAN Executive Director Michael Brune. &quot;Time and again Ford says it will do the right thing and then, when the rubber hits the road, it doesn&#146;t perform. In the 1970s and &#145;80s we lost market share &#151; and good union jobs &#151; to Japanese automakers because Ford executives refused to innovate. Ford is once again on the verge of losing its leadership position. Bill Ford&#146;s broken promises are bad for American workers, bad for the environment, and bad for national security.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ford Motor Co. is sponsoring a five-day Centennial blow-out in Dearborn, Michigan, June 12&#150;16 officially titled &quot;The Road is Ours.&quot; Ford has hired celebrities Beyonc&eacute;, Earth Wind and Fire, and Toby Keith. &quot;We have always said we want the centennial to focus on the future,&quot; Ford spokeswoman Karen Hampton told Associated press on May 6.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ford says it wants to focus on the future, but most of its vehicles get fewer miles per gallon than its Model-T did 80 years ago,&quot; said Jason Mark, Clean Car Campaigner for Global Exchange. &quot;Rather than looking to the future Ford is stuck in the past. If America is to have good jobs, a cleaner planet and a safer country, Bill Ford Jr. needs to take bold measures to kick the oil habit.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rainforest Action Network and Global Exchange announced the following nation-wide protests:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">May 31: &quot;Ford Protest Sneak Preview&quot; in San Francisco.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">June 7: &quot;National Day of Action Against Ford&quot; which will include demonstrations at Ford dealerships in cities across the country. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">June 14 - 15: Protests at Ford&#146;s Centennial Celebration</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">June 16: Ford Shareholder Meeting Protests </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In their letter to Bill Ford Jr., the two organizations called on Ford to help break America&#146;s &quot;oil addiction&quot; by using existing technology to achieving a 50 miles per gallon fleet fuel efficiency average by 2010 and to speed the transition to hydrogen fuel cells so that it completely eliminates greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mark says GX intends to reach out to hundreds of thousands of peace activists to join the campaign against Ford. Said Mark: &quot;If Bill Ford Jr. fails to commit to an oil-free future, we intend to target his investors, his customers and even his celebrities-for-hire with a muscular, grassroots campaign.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The nation-wide, grassroots campaign comes at a time when pressure is increasing on Detroit to do more to break the United States&#146; dependence on oil. The Detroit Project and the Natural Resources Defense Council on May 7 launched a series of TV ads demanding better fuel efficiency. Groups from the Sierra Club to the Environmental Evangelical Network have also called for Detroit to make better vehicles.</font></p>
