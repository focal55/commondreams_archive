- June 2 - Hundreds of grassroots and 

immigrant rights' leaders representing National People's Action 

(NPA) are descending on the offices of the Federation for American 

Immigration Reform (FAIR), a Washington D.C.-based policy group, at 

1666 Connecticut Ave., suite 400, today (June 2), NPA said. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NPA leaders around the country are protesting the current 

anti-immigrant policy agenda of FAIR which takes advantage of the 

atrocities of Sep. 11, 2001 by pushing an anti-immigrant agenda 

that has little to do with promoting national security yet speaks 

volumes about the organization's racist policies. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FAIR currently opposes the Student Adjustment 

and DREAM Act, bi-partisan legislation that would grant access 

to in-state tuition for children of immigrants whose families 

have been in the country at least five years and paid taxes 

for three. According to NPA, the organization further charges 

the U.S.-housed Mexican Embassy and its Matricula Consular ID 

cards as a threat to national security, along with any state 

that does not fully restrict access to drivers' licenses to 

full citizens. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FAIR attacks the Department of Justice and the former INS, now 

housed within the Department of Homeland Security, with failing to 

force local law enforcement to perform the functions of federal 

immigration enforcement, a practice a growing number of advocates 

view as a form of racial profiling and which many local police 

departments argue discourages the reporting of crime and undermines 

their ability to effectively serve and protect. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Community organizations, secondary and post-secondary education 

advocates, organized labor, the business community, and many local 

police departments are all coming forth in support of access to 

citizenship, education and banking for undocumented immigrants and 

against further racial profiling and targeting of hard-working, 

honest Americans. We need to move forward for our country to grow 

stronger and not resort to the views of groups like FAIR that put 

us right back in the middle of the 20th Century," said Emira 

Palacios, co-chairperson of National People's Action. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FAIR receives funding from the Pioneer Fund, which funded the 

mid-20th centuries' widely racist "Bell-Curve" theory, which sought 

to establish the "biological inferiority of African-Americans." 

Ignoring its own proximity to this unfortunate past, FAIR goes on 

to argue on its Web site (http://www.fairus.org/html/04128611.htm) 

that immigrants are responsible for economic adversities faced by 

U.S. blacks. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National People's Action is a coalition of hundreds of community 

organizations from across the country that work on issues effecting 

their communities such as predatory lending, community 

reinvestment, neighborhood safety, education, youth development and 

immigration.
