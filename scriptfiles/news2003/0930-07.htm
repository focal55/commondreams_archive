- September 30 - America's federal Superfund toxic waste cleanup program, aptly named for the polluter-funded trust, runs out of polluter contributed funds this Wednesday, October 1, according to a recent General Accounting Office report, leaving taxpayers to shoulder the financial burden and leaving communities across the country at risk. President Bush has refused to push for the renewal of polluter-pays tax that expired in 1995, the first president not to support the principle that polluters should pay to clean up the messes they create since President Reagan signed the Superfund reauthorization into law in 1986.  With more than 1,000 toxic waste sites still in need of cleanup, the ramifications of a dwindling Superfund trust fund to cleanup toxic waste places our communities and environment at risk. Already, 1 in 4 Americans lives within a short bicycle ride of a toxic waste site that is considered a Superfund cleanup priority.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We teach our children that they are responsible for cleaning up the messes that they make; the Bush administration should demand no less of corporate polluters,&quot; said Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director. &quot;They are letting polluters off the hook while strapping taxpayers with the burden of cleanups.&quot;</font></p>

   Silver, lead and zinc mines in Idaho and Washington have left a legacy

   of pollution and health problems. Toxic pollution from mining in

   northern Idaho has spread far to the west to Spokane, Washington,

   contaminating lakes and rivers in the Coeur d'Alene River basin. The

   Bunker Hill Superfund Site inadequately addresses the widespread effects

   of the toxic waste. Expanding the cleanup to the entire 1,500

   square-mile Basin will require commitment to a cleanup plan with

   integrity, funding and monitoring to ensure accountability. The EPA

   estimates that $359 million will be required to implement an interim

   cleanup plan for the watershed. For more information, visit:

   It's been 19 years since the EPA placed Tar Creek on the Superfund

   priority cleanup list, but lack of funding will mean continued delays in

   protecting these communities. The Tar Creek Superfund site covers the

   entire northeast corner of Oklahoma, the southeast corner of Kansas and the southwest corner of Missouri where an estimated 50 percent of the

   lead and zinc ore used in World War I was mined. Children in Ottawa

   Country are at least the third generation to grow up with lead, cadmium,

   arsenic and a cocktail of other poisons contaminating their lungs,

   hindering their development, and shortening their lives. Although the

   EPA regional office requested $5 million dollars in 2002, no money was

   allocated .</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information, visit:

   The 30-acre tract on which the leather tannery once stood is now a

   proposed Superfund site, and the EPA has alerted residents not to come

   into contact with the contaminated soil. Though the tannery has been

   inactive for nearly 20 years, the site still poses a significant threat

   to the health of the community due to the accumulation of toxins such as

   chromium, zinc and phenol. The EPA projects that it would take a year toclean up the site, but exactly when the cleanup would start and where

   the money will come from is unknown. For more information, visit: <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/communities/new_hampshire/" target="_new">http://www.sierraclub.org/communities/new_hampshire/</a></font></p>
