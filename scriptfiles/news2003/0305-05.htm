                - March 5 - The Committee for Economic Development (CED) and the 

                Concord Coalition today held a press conference and released a 

                joint statement on the federal budget and the nation's economic 

                future. The statement says, in part: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Concord 

                Coalition and CED have come together today to warn the nation 

                that a fiscal crisis threatens our future standard of living, 

                and to challenge Washington policymakers to make the hard choices 

                that are necessary to prevent this crisis. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Deficits are 

                back for "as far as the eye can see." This, alone, is a serious 

                development. Of more concern, however, is that support for the 

                long-term balanced budget goal appears to be weakening. There 

                are substantial long-term risks to this development. Temporary 

                deficits do not pose a threat to the economy. Permanent deficits 

                do -- particularly with the enormous cost of the baby boomers' 

                retirement benefits beginning in 2008, at the end of the 5-year 

                budget window. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Official baseline 

                projections of the federal budget deficit provide a deceptive 

                picture of the future. They fail to incorporate pending decisions, 

                such as making tax cuts permanent or providing prescription drugs. 

                They do not anticipate an imminent war and subsequent reconstruction 

                in Iraq. They almost certainly understate the costs of improving 

                homeland security. They ignore the inevitable reform of the alternative 

                minimum tax, which will apply to some 40 million households within 

                10 years - up from 2 million today. Perhaps most importantly, 

                they fail to account for the aging of the baby boom generation, 

                and the extraordinary demands this will place on our budget, our 

                health care system, and our society. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Deficits do 

                matter. They lower future economic growth by reducing the level 

                of national savings that can be devoted to productive investments. 

                They raise interest rates. They raise interest payments on the 

                national debt. They reduce the fiscal flexibility to deal with 

                unexpected developments. If we do not take action now to bring 

                burgeoning deficits under control, we will create the first generation 

                of Americans less well off than their predecessors. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Bringing the 

                deficit back under control will not be easy. But the longer we 

                wait to take action, the more difficult our choices become. Priorities 

                must be set and trade-offs must be made. This should be done within 

                the context of a long-term framework. Moreover, we can only bring 

                about long-term fiscal sustainability by taking action on every 

                front - including Social Security and Medicare reform; controlling 

                the growth of appropriations; making investments in future economic 

                growth our highest priority; pursuing the most efficient means 

                to raise added revenue - and by avoiding policies that make the 

                long-term outlook even worse. In that regard, any action we may 

                take now to stimulate growth in the short term must be balanced 

                by a credible commitment to future actions that bring us back 

                to balance budget." (the full joint statement is available online:
