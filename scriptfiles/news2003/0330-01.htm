                - March 30 - After 11PM on Tuesday, March 25 what may have been 

                an anti-personnel fragmentation bomb exploded in a Baghdad residential 

                neighborhood adjacent to a secondary school. The blast primarily 

                hit a private home at #74, Street # 3, District 317, in Al Tujjaar, 

                in the Al Shaab area of North Baghdad. The house is next door 

                to the Balquis Secondary School for Girls.</font>

                  members sleeping on a mattress in a second-floor bedroom were 

                  wounded. They were admitted to the Al Numaan Hospital. Muneed

                  March 27, members of the IRAQ PEACE TEAM, visited the bombed 

                  house. IPT observed hundreds of small holes in the walls of 

                  the upstairs roof patio. Probing a sample of these holes the 

                  IPT team extracted uniform cubed metal pellets with sharp edges. 

                  The pellets were three to five millimeters thick.</font></p>

                  Beres, a French surgeon working with the French NGO, AMI, and

                  who has extensive experience in war zones, confirmed to IPT 

                  that the pellets were from a fragmentation bomb.</font></p>

                  Conventions. We urge the US military to discontinue any further 

                  use of anti-personnel weapons. Such weapons directly and lethally 

                  discriminate against civilians.&quot;</font></p>
