- July 15 - Congressman John Conyers, Jr. said: </font>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While the absence of Congressman Dennis Kucinich at the 94th Annual NAACP Convention in Miami, Florida was regrettable, he should still be given an opportunity to present his presidential views to the delegates of the NAACP, and not be counted out of the race. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        Congressman Kucinich, Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in the Congress, and one of the most exciting candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, was missing because at the exact same time a critical vote concerning prescription drugs for seniors took place. Had the Congressman made the panel, he would have missed the vote. I can understand the frustration felt by the NAACP, not being able to question and hear Congressman Kucinich, but let us not forget that he has an exemplary record when dealing with issues facing the African American community. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        As a life member of the NAACP myself, I respectfully request of  President Mfume that Congressman Kucinich be interviewed to determine whether he merits the continued support of the NAACP, the oldest civil rights organization in this country.&quot;</font></p>
