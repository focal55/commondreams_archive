                - April 16 - Public Citizen hailed today&#8217;s House committee 

                passage of campaign finance and ethics legislation as a major 

                step toward reducing conflicts of interest and curbing the influence 

                of money in the state Legislature and local governments. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This bill 

                  eliminates several chronic ethics loopholes and gives the Ethics 

                  Commission some teeth," said Tom "Smitty" Smith, director of 

                  Public Citizen&#8217;s Texas office. "It&#8217;s a big step 

                  forward, and we call on the House to take the next step and 

                  pass these key reforms."</font></p>

                <p></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The blue-ribbon 

                  House Ethics Committee approved CSHB 1606 early Wednesday morning. 

                  The bill combines HB 795, the sunset bill for the Texas Ethics 

                  Commission authored by Rep. Burt Solomons, and HB 1606, authored 

                  by Rep. Steve Wolens.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is 

                  major piece of reform legislation," Smith said. "It reforms 

                  statutes the Ethics Commission, the House speaker&#8217;s race, 

                  standards of conduct for state officials, lobbyist activity 

                  and personal financial disclosure for municipal officials."</font></p>

                <p></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill 

                  addresses:</font></p>

                <p></p>

                <ul>

                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Texas 

                    Ethics Commission. The legislation adds bite to what has been 

                    a toothless watchdog. It strengthens and streamlines investigations 

                    into possible violations of elections and ethics laws; strips 

                    the requirement that at least six members vote to initiate 

                    an investigation; clarifies laws that keep the staff from 

                    conducting meaningful investigations; requires the commission 

                    to perform random facial audits of campaign finance reports; 

                    and improves the personal financial disclosure forms that 

                    candidates and officeholders must file.</font></li>

                </ul>

                <p></p>

                <ul>

                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign 

                    finances. The bill extends the legislative-session fundraising 

                    ban through the period allowed for a gubernatorial veto; and 

                    ends the computer use exemption, which allows campaigns that 

                    raise more than $50,000 to claim that they do not use computers 

                    to keep track of their finances and thus avoid filing electronic 

                    campaign finance reports. This "Luddite loophole" has allowed 

                    dozens of campaigns that raised more than $100,000 each election 

                    to keep their reports off the Internet and out of the public 

                    eye. The bill also requires candidates for county chairs of 

                    political parties in counties with more than 400,000 people 

                    to file campaign finance reports with the Ethics Commission 

                    and requires district judges and district attorneys to file 

                    electronic campaign finance reports.</font></li>

                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Municipal 

                    government ethics. In response to ethics scandals that have 

                    plagued local government in recent months, the bill requires 

                    personal financial disclosures by municipal officials, which 

                    will better reveal conflicts of interest before they occur.</font></li>

                </ul>

                <ul>

                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speaker&#8217;s 

                    race. The bill requires an official declaration of candidacy 

                    and limits fundraising to the speaker&#8217;s race-specific 

                    funds raised during the period of candidacy.</font></li>

                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lobbyist 

                    activities. Lobbyists, under the bill, must file their activity 

                    reports in easily viewed electronic form and must pay an increased 

                    registration fee.</font></li>

                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Financial 

                    disclosures. These changes to ethical standards and personal 

                    financial disclosures represent some of the most needed reforms. 

                    The bill improves the personal financial disclosures filed 

                    by state officials to include mutual funds, blind trusts and 

                    the addresses of real property. It also requires disclosure 

                    of partnerships and other businesses relationships &#8211; 

                    key to discovering conflicts of interest.</font></li>

                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conflicts 

                    of interest. One of the central reforms in this bill is the 

                    strengthening of the conflict-of-interest provision for legislators 

                    by restricting them from sponsoring or voting on bills affecting 

                    their personal financial interests. It also provides, for 

                    the first time, a penalty for violating the Standard of Conduct 

                    for state officials in the form of discipline of legislators 

                    by their respective house and removal of non-elected officials 

                    from office. It also prohibits sponsoring or voting on a matter 

                    on which a family member is lobbying.</font></li>

                <ul>

                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lawyer-legislators. 

                    The bill makes significant inroads toward ending the oft-abused 

                    legislative continuance that allowed just-hired lawyer-legislators 

                    to obtain trial delays for clients. It also bans the practice 

                    of legislators lobbying state agencies for pay.</font></li>

                <p></p>

                  is the biggest step we've seen in over a decade toward cleaning 

                  up the Capitol," Smith said.</font></p>
