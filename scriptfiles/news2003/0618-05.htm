- June 18 - 	Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), the leader of the opposition to the war in Iraq in the House, again took to the House floor today to continue his pressure to demand the truth about the Administration's lead-up to the war in Iraq.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Today, Kucinich stated:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Protection of the truth and the Constitutional role of Congress as a co-equal branch should not be a partisan matter. Yet, yesterday Republicans in the House International Relations Committee stonewalled an investigation of the Bush Administration's false claims that sent America to war against Iraq. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Resolution of Inquiry backed by 40 members of the House sought to protect Congress' role in asking the Administration where is the proof that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction? Where was proof of an imminent threat?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Unfortunately, as panic sets in over the realization that the Administration misled the American people in the cause of war. Republicans are refusing to hold public hearings. Republicans are refusing serious oversight. Republicans are refusing open oversight. Republicans just won't make Republicans accountably. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;That is the problem with one party rule. Our democracy is endanger if we do not make this Administration accountable. They sent this country into war based on lies and in doing so have damaged the legitimacy of their own government. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Where are the weapons of mass destruction? Where was the imminent threat? Why did America go to war?&quot;</font></p>
