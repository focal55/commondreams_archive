                - April 2 - Departing from Iraq has now become increasingly unsafe 

                and costly. Communication within and beyond Iraq has been effectively 

                silenced. Facing these conditions, the Iraq Peace Team has elected 

                to send half of our members outside of Iraq to give eye-witness 

                accounts of the calamity that now afflicts the Iraqi people. </font>
