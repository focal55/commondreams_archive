- October 21 - A new political action committee called the Committee to ReDefeat the President will hold its first public event from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday October 26th at the Valencia Hotel in San Jose. The Committee to ReDefeat the President is an independent expenditure committee not affiliated with any candidate. To be headquartered on the Internet at <a href="http://www.redefeatbush.com" target="_new">http://www.redefeatbush.com</a>, its will channel volunteer activities into effective political action to defeat President Bush. Its goal is to harness tens of thousands of volunteer hours to register one million new Democratic voters in key states and get them to vote on election day 2004.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event at the Valencia (located at 355 Santana Row) will be followed by an event on Tuesday November 4th at the Spy Lounge in Washington, DC (located at 2406 18th Street, NW). Both events are timed to coincide with televised debates between the Democratic presidential candidates. On 10/26 attendees will watch the debate sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus and on 11/4 attendees will watch the debate sponsored by Rock the Vote. Tickets for these events range from $100 to $10,000 depending on net worth and may be purchased online at <a href="http://www.redefeatbush.com/ca-launch" target="_new">http://www.redefeatbush.com/ca-launch</a>. Food and drink will be available, and a discussion of redefeating Bush will follow the televised debates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In cooperation with other organizations the Committee will sponsor nationwide Tuesday Night Democratic Clubs. These gatherings at WiFi-enabled hotspots will enable activists with laptops and cell phones to make phone calls to households that are likely to register as Democrats but are not currently registered to vote. To raise the money necessary to underwrite its activities the Committee will seek online contributions, sponsor events and sell branded merchandise, which will be available at the events.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The host committee for the San Jose event includes Harry Saal, the founding CEO of Smart Valley, Inc. and president of Cultural Initiatives Silicon Valley; Tara Lemmey, former president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, founder of several start-ups and current CEO of LENS Ventures; and David Scott Carlick, Managing Director, Internet 3.0 Group, VantagePoint Venture Partners.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We can have a major impact on the outcome by helping to channel volunteer enthusiasm into politically effective activities,&quot; said founder David Lytel. Lytel is a former Internet adviser in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in the first Clinton Administration, where he oversaw the construction and operation of the award-winning White House Web site. Subsequently, he was co-founder of Democrats.com, the largest independent community of Democrats, which is not affiliated with the Committee to ReDefeat the President.</font></p>
