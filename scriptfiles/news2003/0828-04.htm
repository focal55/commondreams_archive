- August 28 - The Fair and Balanced PAC (Political Action Committee), www.BushRecall.org, announced today that &#150; the number of supporters shot past the 20,000 mark since its launch one week ago, and continues to gain thousands each day.  At the center of the PAC&#146;s effort is the website, www.BushRecall.org, where a petition is collecting the names of those wanting a new chief executive in 2004.  </font>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Fair and Balanced PAC was founded by Mike Lux, a Democratic political strategist, with the help of the Progressive Majority and Bushwhackers.  Based on the Republican Party&#146;s efforts to remove Governor Gray Davis from his post in California, the PAC&#146;s goal is to hold the President to the same standards being placed on the California Governor.  Since taking office, Bush squandered the national surplus of $127 billion and plunged America into a deficit of more than $500 billion.  In addition, almost three million jobs were lost and the economy continues to be in bad shape.  </font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;What we intend to do is remind people that President Bush needs to be recalled because our economy is weak, we&#146;ve lost almost three million jobs and our budget situation is a disaster.  The chief executive needs to be held accountable.  His own budget officers say the deficit is skyrocketing,&#148; said Lux.  &#147;Our PAC&#146;s website is an activist&#146;s tool to defeat George Bush in 2004.&#148;</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PAC is actively raising money from visitors to the site and other endorsing organizations.  These funds will be used for advertising, PR and internet communications.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About BushRecall.org</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BushRecall.Org was established to highlight the need for a change in our nation's leadership. Since Bush took office, the country has shifted from a substantial surplus to a debilitating deficit. America&#146;s educational system is under-funded and ill-equipped, and millions of jobs have been lost due to a weakening economy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BushRecall.Org is a special project of the Fair and Balanced PAC, established so that like-minded, concerned citizens can influence the outcome of the national election, and in turn, the balance of power in Washington, D.C. BushRecall.Org's intention is to provide individuals, who normally have little political power, to aggregate their contributions with others to gain a greater voice in the political process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the laws of the Federal Election Commission rules, the Fair and Balanced PAC may accept contributions from individuals up to $5,000 in one calendar year to support its on-going efforts. </font></p>
