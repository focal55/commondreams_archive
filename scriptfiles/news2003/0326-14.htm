                YORK - March 26 - With citizens expressing their opinions on the 

                war through marches and rallies across the country, many news 

                outlets rely on the Associated Press news service to help them 

                cover these important manifestations of democracy. Unfortunately, 

                AP has frequently used the terms &quot;pro-war&quot; and &quot;pro-troops&quot; 

                interchangeably-- a practice that distorts the views of anti-war 

                demonstrators and contributes to the media marginalization of 

                the peace movement.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's likely 

                  that the overwhelming majority of participants at peace events 

                  would describe themselves as &quot;supporting the troops,&quot; 

                  in the sense of being concerned for their well-being and hoping 

                  for their safe return. &quot;Support Our Troops: Bring Them 

                  Home&quot; is a popular slogan at peace marches, which tend 

                  to criticize George W. Bush and other administration officials, 

                  not rank-and-file U.S. military personnel.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, 

                  AP and some other news outlets often use &quot;supporting the 

                  troops&quot; as a synonym for &quot;supporting the war&quot;-- 

                  and use &quot;pro-troops&quot; as a shorthand to describe rallies 

                  and demonstrations that are, in many cases, explicitly pro-war 

                  events. &quot;Pro-troops&quot; is frequently used as the opposite 

                  of &quot;anti-war,&quot; as if the only way to be supportive 

                  of soldiers is to advocate their involvement in war on Iraq.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, 

                  the day after bombing of Baghdad began, the AP ran a story (3/20/03) 

                  under the headline &quot;Anti-War, Pro-Troops Rallies Take to 

                  Streets as War Rages.&quot; Another story (3/22/03), about pro- 

                  and anti-war activities, was labeled &quot;Weekend Brings More 

                  Demonstrations-- Opposing War, Supporting Troops.&quot; The 

                  clear implication is that those who call for an end to the invasion 

                  of Iraq are opposed to U.S. troops, as in the story &quot;Protesters 

                  Rally Against War; Others Support Troops&quot; (3/24/03).</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This tendentious 

                  usage shows up in the body of stories as well. &quot;In San 

                  Francisco, at least three pro-troop demonstrators who attended 

                  the rally were alternately yelled at and debated with by peace 

                  demonstrators,&quot; the AP reported on March 23. Another AP 

                  story (3/24/03) referred to &quot;about 100 people-- half anti-war 

                  and half pro-troops-- [who] demonstrated on the Sagadahoc Bridge 

                  over the Kennebec River near Bath.&quot;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other news 

                  outlets use the misleading formulation as well. &quot;Perhaps 

                  you see police arrayed in riot gear keeping apart the pro-troop 

                  rally and the anti-war rally,&quot; CNN's Jeff Flock stated 

                  on March 22. A Sacramento Bee story (3/22/03) reported that 

                  while pro-war activists &quot;said those who support the Bush 

                  administration have been less likely to stage large demonstrations 

                  because they are busy with the concerns of daily life, there 

                  have been large pro-troop rallies held across the country&quot;-- 

                  as if only those who back the Bush administration are friendly 

                  toward those in the military.</font></p>

                  ACTION: Please write to the Associated Press and insist that 

                  they stop implying that the anti-war movement is hostile to 

                  U.S. military personnel by referring to pro-war rallies as &quot;pro-troop.&quot;</font></p>
