- October 17 - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld should fire a top-ranking Pentagon official who has repeatedly told evangelical Christian audiences that the U.S. struggle against terrorism is a religious conflict against Satan, according to Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gen. William G. Boykin, who recently was named deputy undersecretary of defense for intelligence, said the United States is being attacked because we are a Christian nation, insisted that Muslims worship idols and said the real enemy of America is not Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein but Satan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive director, said, &#147;Boykin literally believes that the United States government is engaged in a holy war. That&#146;s totally unacceptable for someone in a top government post.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;A man who sees the conduct of U.S. foreign policy as some sort of Christian religious crusade should not be making policy. I urge Secretary Rumsfeld to remove Lt. Gen. Boykin from his post and distance the Bush administration from Boykin&#146;s extreme views.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to NBC News and other sources, Boykin has repeatedly appeared before evangelical Christian groups, often in uniform, and characterized the U.S. war with terrorism in stark religious terms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a June appearance in Oregon, Boykin reportedly said that Islamic extremists hate the U.S. &#147;because we&#146;re a Christian nation, because our foundations and our roots are Judeo-Christian.&#148; Boykin said the real enemy is not Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden. &#147;The enemy,&#148; he said, &#147;is a guy called Satan.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a January speech in Daytona, Fla., Boykin recalled his efforts to capture an Islamic militant in Somalia who had said he would be protected by Allah.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Said Boykin, &#147;Well, you know what I knew, that my God was bigger than his. I knew that my God was a real God, and his was an idol.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the militant was captured, Boykin told him, &#147;Mr. Atto, you underestimated our God.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is not Boykin&#146;s only venture into inappropriate religious activity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this year, Americans United protested strongly when Boykin tried to bring a Baptist pastors&#146; evangelism group to Ft. Bragg for special training and overnight accommodations. After the AU protest, military officials scaled back the visit to the same level given other civilian groups.</font></p>
