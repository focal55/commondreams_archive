                - April 1 - On April Fool’s Day, Earthday Resources for Living 

                Green released the tenth annual “Don’t Be Fooled” report. The 

                “Don’t Be Fooled” report documents misleading advertising by companies 

                polluting the planet. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This year’s 

                report names 10 companies, ranging from oil to food companies, 

                which are attempting to create the image of environmental friendliness 

                while diverting attention from their poor environmental track 

                records. “Don’t Be Fooled” also contains a brief explanation and 

                history of greenwashing, a look at how organizations like the 

                Federal Trade Commission are combating misleading claims, and 

                easy-to-follow tips for consumers to use when making everyday 

                purchases. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“These companies 

                are trying to make fools out of the public,” stated Rachel Heller, 

                Coordinator for Earthday Resources. “Ad campaigns like the ones 

                named in the ‘Don’t Be Fooled’ report take advantage of the concern 

                consumers have for the environment by attempting to trick them 

                into thinking polluting companies are protecting the planet.” 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Greenwash” 

                is defined in the 10th edition of the Concise Oxford English Dictionary 

                as the “disinformation disseminated by an organization so as to 

                present an environmentally responsible public image.” Its inclusion 

                in the dictionary indicates the significance and permanence of 

                a growing trend among corporations to take advantage of the many 

                consumers who look for products with no environmental impact. 

                Increasingly, Americans are basing their purchasing decisions 

                on the environmental and social impacts of products and manufacturers. 

                According to the Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability (LOHAS) 

                Journal, in 2000, this growing market represented $546 billion 

                globally and $226.8 billion in the U.S. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kraft, named 

                for the second year in a row, is one of the companies featured 

                in this report. Last year, Kraft was exposed for labeling genetically 

                engineered foods as ‘natural’. This year, the company is hiding 

                its irresponsible use of genetically engineered ingredients behind 

                its new parent company, Altria Group, Inc. Altria attempts to 

                cover for Kraft and its other company Philip Morris, by declaring 

                its commitment to the environment. Kraft Foods contains genetically 

                engineered ingredients despite demonstrated risks, including unforeseen 

                allergic reactions, increased antibiotic resistance, increased 

                herbicide use, and harm to insects and wildlife. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“If Kraft and 

                its parent company want to convince the public that they are truly 

                responsible, they must stop using genetically engineered ingredients. 

                Kraft can’t hide their environmental impact behind glossy nature 

                ads. As the saying goes, the proof is in the pudding,” stated 

                Kate Madigan, state PIRGs Safe Foods Advocate. </font>
