                - March 25 - A second hearing on March 13 on the nomination of 

                Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen to the U.S. Court of 

                Appeals for the Fifth Circuit provided no new information contradicting 

                the clear record of her right-wing judicial activism, which led 

                the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject her confirmation last 

                year after an in-depth hearing. President Bush's renomination 

                of Owen to the same appeals court for which she had already been 

                rejected by the Judiciary Committee was unprecedented. A new report 

                by People For the American Way reviews and refutes the recent 

                attempts by Owen and Sen. Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch 

                to explain away her disturbing record as a state court judge.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Priscilla 

                Owen's record won't change, no matter how many hearings Sen. Hatch 

                holds, or how many softball questions he lobs in her direction," 

                said People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas. "Even 

                before this most recent hearing, the record was clear that Owen 

                is a far-right judicial activist who tries to remake the law to 

                reach an outcome that is often hostile to the rights and interests 

                of individuals. The hearing did nothing to change that record. 

                Senators should reject this unprecedented effort to force Owen 

                onto the appeals court." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The People 

                For the American Way report examines efforts by Sen. Hatch and 

                his colleagues to help Owen dismiss the frequent and vigorous 

                criticism of her attempted judicial activism by other Texas Supreme 

                Court justices, including conservatives appointed by then-Gov. 

                George W. Bush. In particular, the report cites the written opinions 

                of then-Justice Alberto Gonzales, as well as more recent public 

                statements by and on behalf of Gonzales, to debunk claims by Owen 

                and Hatch that Gonzales had never criticized her as an activist. 

                The People For the American Way report also refutes claims by 

                Owen that some of her judicial activism was grounded in decisions 

                by the Supreme Court or other federal courts. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If Sen. Hatch 

                and Justice Owen want to rewrite history, they might want to pick 

                a topic where the historical record is not so clear," said Neas. 

                "Even Justice Owen's conservative colleagues have repeatedly criticized 

                her attempted judicial activism on reproductive rights as well 

                as civil rights and consumer protection. The efforts by Sen. Hatch 

                and his colleagues to downplay such criticisms have no support 

                in the record." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Owen's confirmation 

                is opposed by a broad range of state and national organizations, 

                including more than two dozen Texas groups that had called on 

                President Bush not to renominate Owen, explaining that her opinions 

                have been "extreme and often directly at odds with established 

                rights and protections enjoyed by all Texans." </font>
