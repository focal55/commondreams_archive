<td valign="top" align="left" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LONDON, UK - November 6 - The Burma Campaign UK and Federation of Trade Unions (Burma) are celebrating today's news that British American Tobacco (BAT) is to pull out of Burma. The two organisations launched a global campaign to get BAT out of Burma in November last year. BAT announced today that they have sold their share of the factory in Burma to a Singapore based company. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is a huge victory,&quot; said John Jackson, Director of the Burma Campaign UK. &quot;They had to be dragged out kicking and screaming but at least they are out. If a company like BAT can be forced out of Burma, any company can be.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BAT have been facing mounting pressure since the Burma Campaign UK drew attention to BATs business partnership with Burma's brutal military dictatorship. In July 2003 the British government backed the campaign and asked BAT to leave Burma. The company has been deluged with thousands of campaign postcards and emails from campaigners in over 50 countries. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This will deter any British companies thinking of doing business in Burma,&quot; says Jackson. &quot;British boardrooms know investing in Burma is a PR disaster.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BAT is just the latest in a long line of companies that have pulled out of Burma following campaigns by the Burma Campaign UK. Earlier this year Kuoni announced it was ending tourist trips to Burma. The Burma Campaign has also succeeded in getting Premier Oil, Triumph International, and almost every major high street retailer out of Burma. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;BAT were one of the last major British companies operating in Burma,&quot; said John Jackson. &quot;We will now shift our focus to campaigning for a ban on imports of Burmese gems and timber into the UK and EU. They are an increasingly important source of income for the regime.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The campaign against British American Tobacco has been supported by UNISON, Friends of the Earth, All-Party Parliamentary Group on Burma, European Burma Network, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, International Union of Foodworkers (IUF), Burma Centre Netherlands, Norwegian Church Aid, AMICUS MSF, and Australian trade union APHEDA. </font></p>
