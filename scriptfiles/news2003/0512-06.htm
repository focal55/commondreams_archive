FRANCISCO - May 12 - The StopJayGarner.com campaign today declared victory on word that President Bush has fired Jay Garner for failing to establish order in Iraq, where violence and looting still plague. The campaign is calling for Garner¹s replacement, L. Paul &quot;Jerry&quot; Bremer, to be replaced by the United Nations.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Only the United Nations has the credibility and ability to establish order and oversee the transition to democracy in Iraq,&quot; Global Exchange¹s Medea Benjamin said. 

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A former senior State Department official who has worked with Bremer told Newsday that Bremer is a "voracious opportunist with voracious ambitions. What he knows about Iraq could not quite fill a thimble. What he knows about any part of the world would not fill a thimble. But what he knows about Washington infighting could fill three or four bushel baskets."

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The good news is that President Bush finally acknowledged that Jay Garner is the wrong man for the job of rebuilding Iraq. The bad news is that Garner¹s replacement ­ L. Paul &quot;Jerry&quot; Bremer III ­ is as bad if not worse.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bremer has never before been involved in reconstruction and development, much less &quot;democratization.&quot; Like Garner, Bremer is completely unqualified. Bremer's tenure at the State Department was marked by his vociferous support for liberalizing CIA guidelines so that the agency could more easily hire and work with known thugs in other countries.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bremer reinforces the message Bush sent to the people of the Middle East when he appointed Garner: we will dominate you by any means necessary.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Meanwhile, on the ground in Iraq, things continue to get worse. The week before last, American troops, who are trained to be warriors, not peacekeepers, shot and killed 16 Iraqi protesters and wounded scores more.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It doesn't have to be this way. The role of peacekeeping and reconstruction in Iraq should rest with the United Nations, not with the U.S. alone and certainly not with Jerry or Jay.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The American people are overwhelmingly with us on this issue. A poll conducted on April 12 and 13 by the New York Times found that that two-thirds of all Americans believe that the UN should be in charge of rebuilding Iraq.

</font>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In just one month, 67,000 people have visited StopJayGarner.com, and 6,300 people have signed the on-line petition and called Congress.&quot;
