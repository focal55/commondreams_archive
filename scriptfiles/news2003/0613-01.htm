- June 13 - Following is a statement released today by the National Hydrogen Association in reaction to the new CalTech study on the potential environmental impact of a hydrogen economy on the stratosphere:</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Hydrogen Association (NHA) has been asked by several media contacts for our reaction to the study by the California Institute of Technology, &quot;Potential Environmental Impact of a Hydrogen Economy on the Stratosphere&quot; published today in Science Magazine. Some think the study provides results, which would cause us to question the current U.S. emphasis on hydrogen and fuel cell cars. Although we have not had the opportunity to analyze the study and report in detail, we do have some comments, which we hope will help shape the public use and reaction to this report.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, the transition to hydrogen has the potential to dramatically improve our environment by reducing the release of harmful greenhouse gases like CO2 and other pollutants into our atmosphere. As we move forward, questions will inevitably continue to develop regarding the positive and negative impacts of a hydrogen economy on our environment. The National Hydrogen Association supports the investigation of these questions as they develop so that we can fully understand all of the impacts of a clean hydrogen future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NHA has over 80 members, including energy companies, automotive manufacturers, industrial gas suppliers, fuel cell developers, and other businesses, large and small, as well as government, and academia. Although membership is diverse, all are interested in exploring the future of hydrogen as an energy carrier, and dedicated to commercializing hydrogen-related energy systems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mission of the National Hydrogen Association is to foster the development of hydrogen technologies and their utilization in industrial and commercial applications and promote the role of hydrogen in the energy field.</font></p>
