-  

July 8 - &quot;With the leaders we have in

Washington, Americans have to practice 'defensive citizenship,'&quot; said Robert Gabrielsky, Green Party candidate for the New Jersey Senate, District 2.  &quot;You always have to be on guard against deceptive rhetoric. On working people's concerns, Washington's record is pretty bad.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens note that June 2003 unemployment figures

reached 6.4%, the highest in more than nine

years.  Nearly three million U.S. jobs have been

lost in the aftermath of the Clinton/Gore

administration; almost a million in the last

three months.  The Labor Department and

Republicans in Congress recently introduced the&quot;Family-Time Flexibility Act,&quot; deceptively titled

legislation that would eliminate overtime pay for

about 8 million Americans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans are learning that President Bush's

obsession with tax giveaways for the wealthy is

hurting working people and their families,&quot; said

Gloria Mattera, Green-No To War! candidate for

New York City Council.  &quot;But our economic

hardships are the product of both Democrats and

Republicans.  NAFTA and other antidemocratic

international trade deals were signed by Clinton,

over the protests of unions, environmentalists, and many others, including Greens.  These trade

cabals have enabled corporations to move

good-paying jobs out of the U.S. and into

countries without worker and environmental

protections.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Unelected and unaccountable corporate CEOs have

hijacked our government and our social

institutions, but there is a rising resistance to

this illegitimate usurpation of our authority to

govern ourselves,&quot; said David Cobb, General

Counsel for the Green Party of the United States.&quot;The Green Party is the electoral arm of the

growing citizen's movement demanding our country

back.  We categorically reject the absurd notion

that corporations are 'persons' with

constitutional rights.  Corporations must be made

subordinate to the democratic will of the

citizens if the hallowed phrase 'We the People'

is to have any meaning at all.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens demand that employee rights and benefits

such as overtime pay, Social Security, and

pensions be maintained.  The party has called for

the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, which

restricts union organizing, and insists that all

international trade agreements must respect local

and national sovereignty, especially

environmental laws, labor protections, and full

democratic participation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens also support national health insurance,

democratic unions and workplaces, progressive

taxation that closes loopholes for corporations

and the wealthy, and living wage legislation. 

Elected Green officials like Santa Monica,

California Mayor pro tem Kevin McKeown have led

efforts to enact living wages.  &quot;The federal

minimum wage was meant to provide workers with an

income floor,&quot; said McKeown, &quot;but it has become a

pathetic sub-basement.  Working full-time should

afford the dignity of being able to support your

loved ones.  Taxpayers shouldn't be subsidizing

employers by paying for working families' food

stamps and health care.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Working people need more than a break -- we need

our own party, and a complete turn-around in the

current direction of labor policy,&quot; said Kirstin

Marr, media director for the Colorado Green

Party.  &quot;Otherwise, the gains of decades of labor

battles, to which Americans owe their prosperity,

will be destroyed.  The Green Party has emerged

as the party of working people.  That's why the

party is growing and we're getting elected.&quot;</font></p>
