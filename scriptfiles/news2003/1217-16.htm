- December 17 - In a much-touted Dec. 15 cover story entitled &quot;Lawsuit Hell,&quot; Newsweek  published a one-sided diatribe masquerading as journalism. In what purported to be an in-depth look at what business interests have erroneously labeled a &quot;litigation crisis,&quot; the magazine went well beyond advocacy journalism to launch an unprecedented crusade against consumers' access to the courts, according to an 11-page critique Public Citizen released today. Not content to simply run a highly questionable article, Newsweek partnered with NBC for a week of broadcast tie-ins and online chats.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Newsweek fell for myths and distortions spread by a well-organized campaign funded by big business to strip consumers - but not businesses - of their legal rights. Because of the article's glaring deficiencies, Public Citizen today sent a letter to the magazine calling on the editors to review journalistic standards. The article includes:</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Many false and exaggerated examples to present an unbalanced and negative caricature of the legal system; </font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Major factual inaccuracies about the legal system and lawsuits; and</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Proposed solutions that have no basis in experience.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many of the examples Newsweek used were wild exaggerations or anecdotes that never involved lawsuits to begin with, and Public Citizen provides a detailed critique of them. Many of the &quot;facts&quot; cited in the article have been debunked by independent sources such as the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The article's lead author, Stuart Taylor Jr., is a former corporate attorney who admitted to Newsday that his writings are primarily commentary. Further, when writing the Newsweek piece, Taylor relied heavily on a book by corporate defense lawyer Philip K. Howard, adopting many of Howard's faulty arguments. A copy of Public Citizen's critique and letter to Newsweek are available at <A HREF="http://www.citizen.org/congress/civjus/tort/media/" TARGET="_new">http://www.citizen.org/congress/civjus/tort/media/</A>.
