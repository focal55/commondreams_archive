</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Rosenthal was convicted in January on federal marijuana cultivation charges that could have earned him 40 years in prison. Rosenthal grew marijuana for seriously ill people who are allowed to use it under California's medical marijuana law, Proposition 215, and did so with the express authorization of the city of Oakland. But he was not allowed to present to the jury any evidence involving medical use or Proposition 215. When the jury learned that this critical information had been withheld from them, a majority of jurors publicly repudiated their verdict and apologized to Rosenthal.</font></p>

<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today marks the beginning of the end of the federal war on medical marijuana patients,&quot; said Robert Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington, D.C. &quot;The judge's ruling today completely rejects the bad federal law, which demonstrates better than we ever could that the federal system of persecuting medical marijuana patients and providers is broken. This case will be seen as the tipping point, the moment when it became obvious the law had to change. The judge's ruling today could be the final crack in the wall that brings down the whole federal war on medical marijuana patients.</font></p>

<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As important as Judge Breyer's action is, patients and caregivers shouldn't have to depend on the goodwill of one judge,&quot; Kampia continued. &quot;Congress must act immediately to pass the Truth in Trials Act, which will allow federal medical marijuana defendants to tell the whole truth in court -- a basic right that Ed Rosenthal was denied.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Medical marijuana patients and supporters marked Rosenthal's sentencing by protesting in front of the district offices of 25 members of the U.S. House of Representatives who represent states with medical marijuana laws but who have not cosponsored the Truth in Trials Act, officially known as H.R. 1717. The bipartisan bill was introduced on April 10 by U.S. Reps. Sam Farr (D-CA) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) as a direct response to the Rosenthal trial.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   With 12,000 members nationwide, the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States. MPP works to minimize the harm associated with marijuana -- both the consumption of marijuana and the laws that are intended to prohibit such use. MPP believes that the greatest harm associated with marijuana is imprisonment. To this end, MPP focuses on removing criminal penalties for marijuana use, with a particular emphasis on making marijuana medically available to seriously ill people who have the approval of their doctors.</font></p>
