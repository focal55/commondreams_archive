                - March 17 - As war with Iraq looms – and fears of possible new 

                terrorist attacks grow -- a right-left coalition said today that 

                follow-up legislation to the USA PATRIOT Act would do little to 

                bolster security in the United States while inevitably infringing 

                on fundamental American freedoms. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A previous 

                anti-terrorism law, the USA PATRIOT Act, was rushed through Congress 

                in October 2001 in a crisis atmosphere. “Some in the Administration 

                might be tempted to use this national crisis to try to intimidate 

                Congress into passing another PATRIOT-style bill,” said Timothy 

                Edgar, an ACLU Legislative Counsel. “They should think twice,” 

                Edgar added. “Americans agree that our safety need not come at 

                the expense of our freedom.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coalition 

                expressed its concerns in a letter sent today to every Member 

                of Congress. Its strange-bedfellows signatories represented groups 

                as far apart on the political spectrum as the American Conservative 

                Union, Americans for Tax Reform, the Gun Owners of America, the 

                ACLU, the NAACP and the National Council of La Raza. People of 

                faith also expressed opposition to the Justice Department plans, 

                including the American Baptist Churches USA, Presbyterian Church 

                USA and the Commission on Social Action of Reform Judaism. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Department 

                of Justice has been drafting the new legislation -- called the 

                Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003 (DSEA), but nicknamed 

                PATRIOT II -- in secret over the past several months. The draft 

                language, which was leaked to the media last month, contains a 

                multitude of new and sweeping law enforcement and intelligence 

                gathering powers and expands on many provisions in the USA PATRIOT 

                Act. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The big picture 

                implications of the bill, the ACLU said, include a severe reduction 

                of basic checks and balances on the power of the executive branch. 

                “If this proposal becomes law,” Edgar said, “it will encourage 

                police spying on political and religious activities, allow the 

                government to wiretap without going to court and expand wiretapping 

                and asset forfeiture laws under an overbroad definition of domestic 

                terrorism.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reaction to 

                the leaked proposal has been quick and unfavorable. Conservative 

                New York Times columnist William Safire called the draft legislation 

                an “abomination” and Fox News Channel personality Bill O’Reilly 

                – who recently declared “I’m not the ACLU poster boy” – is up 

                in arms about several provisions in the proposal, including one 

                that would greatly expand the ability of authorities to collect 

                and keep DNA samples of law-abiding Americans. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Department 

                  of Justice has been tight-lipped about the proposed bill. At 

                  a hearing earlier this month, Sen. Russell Feingold (D-WI) quizzed 

                  Attorney General Ashcroft about the proposal. In response, the 

                  Attorney General, oddly, denied that a final bill existed. “The 

                  Attorney General should know that if he goes forward with PATRIOT 

                  II as written, he’ll be facing opposition from every point on 

                  the political spectrum,” Edgar said.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
