-  
December 23 - Statement by Daniel Seligman, Sr. Trade Fellow, Sierra Club.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The realization of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) ten years ago transferred enormous power from democratic governments to multi-national corporations and faceless global market forces. As a result, communities across North America are at a higher risk to dirtier air, unsafe drinking water, and food-borne illnesses. Rather than learn from this historic mistake, the Bush administration is pursuing new trade agreements based on the flawed NAFTA model.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We can do better. New trade deals should strengthen, not weaken, environmental safeguards, workers' rights, and democratic values. Let's mark NAFTA's tenth anniversary by moving toward trade policies that are safe, clean and fair.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>NAFTA's Polluted Legacy </B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">NAFTA has given global industries the power to challenge public interest laws that might interfere with profits. Under NAFTA's &quot;investor&quot; provisions, a Canadian gold mining company recently sued the United States to escape the clean up and reclamation of a mine site in California. Additionally, a US toxic waste handler successfully sued the Mexican government for $16 million after a community blocked corporate plans that would dump industrial waste on a site that would threaten local drinking water supplies. If NAFTA-style corporate laws increase, government action that protects the public interest could become too expensive, crippling efforts to safeguard our communities.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">New rules on &quot;trade in services&quot; could force governments to weaken environmental standards for risky industries, such as trucking, logging, mining, water supply, real estate development, factory farming, and more. For example: To comply with NAFTA's rules on trade in services, the Bush administration recently waived US clean air standards in order to allow trucks based in Mexico to haul freight on US highways. This could increase air pollution in border states, as the aging Mexican truck fleet pollutes more than similar US trucks, and do not use the cleaner fuels required in the United States.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Food-borne illnesses linked to imported fruits and vegetables have soared since NAFTA took affect. Scallions imported from Mexico recently caused an outbreak of hepatitis A that killed three people and sickened hundreds more in Pennsylvania. Poor sanitation in Mexico's farm fields is probably to blame. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data show that imported fresh produce is four times more likely to carry harmful bacteria than domestic produce. Yet NAFTA rules require food importing nations to accept the safety certifications of food exporting countries while discouraging border inspections. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Bush Trade Agenda Increases Risks</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Rather than learn from the mistakes of the past, the Bush administration recently struck a deal on the expansion of NAFTA to four Central American countries called the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). The administration views CAFTA as a stepping stone to an expansion of NAFTA across the rest of the Western Hemisphere called the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">CAFTA and the proposed FTAA would not only give foreign investors new powers to challenge community and environmental safeguards; they could force governments to weaken environmental standards covering a wide-range of risky service industries. Like NAFTA, under CAFTA's provisions governments could be barred from setting limits on mining and logging activities in ecologically sensitive areas, and from requiring agribusinesses to use pesticides safely. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">CAFTA and the FTAA would also give new meaning to Bush's &quot;faith based initiative,&quot; essentially requiring food-importing countries to accept, on faith, the safety of fruit, vegetables, and meat crossing their borders. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>We Can Do Better</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A responsible trade policy would open up markets and protect the environment, not expose our communities to new risks:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Investor rules should ensure that global corporations have no greater rights than US citizens have under US law. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">New rights for global businesses should be matched with enforceable responsibilities on workers rights and environmental protection. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Rules on trade in services should include meaningful exceptions for public interest laws and should exclude such vital public services as water supply. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Food trade agreements should include provisions requiring the adoption of the highest safety standards on farms and in processing plants. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The American people want their leaders to learn from, and not repeat, the mistakes of the past. Rather than expand NAFTA, we need new trade policies that are safe, clean, and fair.</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
