- May 14 - The Illinois Council Against 

Handgun Violence (ICHV) today announced its strong support for the &quot;Assault Weapons Ban and Law Enforcement Protection Act of 2003,&quot; 

legislation introduced last Thursday by U.S. Representatives 

Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.) and John Conyers (D-Mich.). The 

legislation would renew a 1994 federal law banning certain assault 

weapons. More importantly, the bill would significantly strengthen 

current law to address limitations in the ban that have allowed the 

gun industry to circumvent the law. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Gun manufacturers have found ways to skirt the law and continue 

making these deadly products that are attractive to criminals,&quot; 

stated Elizabeth Coolidge, ICHV Board Chair. &quot;The Conyers-McCarthy 

bill will strengthen the existing ban so that gun makers can't get 

away with breaking the law.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the past decade, the gun industry has successfully 

circumvented the existing law by designing and marketing assault 

weapons that incorporate slight modifications in order to evade the 

ban. The gun industry markets a wide variety of such &quot;post-ban&quot; 

assault weapons that incorporate features that are the essence of 

an assault weapon-design characteristics that make it easy for a 

shooter to simply point, as opposed to carefully aim, a weapon to 

quickly spray a wide area with a lethal hail of bullets. Today, 

post-ban versions of AK-47s and AR-15s, guns banned by name in the 

1994 law, are flooding the civilian market. A post-ban AR-15 

clone, manufactured by the Bushmaster corporation, was used by the 

Washington, DC-area snipers to kill 10 and injure three in October 

2002. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The McCarthy-Conyers bill would keep gun makers from modifying 

weapons in order to evade the law. But House Republican leaders 

have stated that they will do everything in their power to prevent 

a vote from taking place on this bill. Recent statements by House 

Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) clearly show that the 

GOP-controlled House would allow the current ban to expire, and 

that &quot;(w)e have no intention of bringing it up&quot; for a vote. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are urging House Speaker Dennis Hastert to address this 

issue and allow a vote on this critical measure,&quot; said Coolidge. &quot;We all know how much influence the pro-gun lobby has in 

Washington, D.C. But if Speaker Hastert does not allow a vote on 

this bill, he will be showing the American public in no uncertain 

terms that he and the House Republicans are puppets of the gun 

lobby and the NRA.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current assault weapons ban will end on September 13, 2004, 

unless Congress and the president act to pass new legislation. 

Contrary to House Republicans, both President Bush and Attorney 

General John Ashcroft have voiced support for renewal of this 

measure. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We believe that assault weapons have no place in our 

communities, and the American public agrees with us,&quot; stated 

Coolidge. &quot;The public needs to know that the House Republican 

leadership does not have our best interests in mind when they want 

to legalize deadly weapons.&quot; </font></p>
