</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thought whales were saved? Guess again. More than 20,000 whales have been commercially hunted since the International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned whale hunting in 1986. Japan and Norway are the culprits, hunting more than 1,300 whales a year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Results of a new nationwide poll being released today for the first time, show that an overwhelming 80 percent of U.S. voters are opposed to commercial whaling by Japan and Norway. A team led by noted Republican pollster Fred Steeper of Market Strategies, Inc. carried out the poll in May 2003 on behalf of the <a href="http://www.ifaw.org" target="_new">International Fund for Animal Welfare</a> (IFAW). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll also showed that a strong 80 percent of U.S. voters also want the Bush Administration to take political action against these nations until they end their commercial whaling -- with 66 percent stating this action should include measured trade sanctions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to this strong stand by Americans, the U.S. government joined other leading nations yesterday to vote in support of whale conservation. On opening day the 55th meeting of the IWC, being held this week in Berlin, member nations voted in support of a landmark resolution - known as the 'Berlin Initiative' -- that set a new standard in the campaign to protect whales -- one of conservation not consumption. Not since the establishment of the Southern Ocean Sanctuary in 1994 has such a success been seen in the global campaign to protect whales. </font></p>
