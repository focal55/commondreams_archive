<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- May 2 - The United States-led 

coalition has failed to meet its responsibility under international 

humanitarian law to ensure that the health and well being of the 

Iraqi people is being provided for, stated the international 

medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders/Medecins 

Sans Frontieres (MSF) today. Urgent medical needs are not being 

addressed and disorganization in hospitals is posing a threat to 

the health of people in the country. MSF again demands that the 

US-led coalition, as the occupying power, immediately fulfill its 

obligation to provide for the medical needs of the Iraqi people 

which it has thus far not done. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Despite three weeks of the US occupation and many months of 

planning for this war, Baghdad, a city the size of Houston and 

Chicago combined, still does not have any fully functioning 

hospitals,&quot; said Morten Rostrup, MD, MSF International Council 

president, who has just returned from 6 weeks in Baghdad. &quot;Disorder 

and political struggles in Baghdad and elsewhere have left the 

health system in disarray at a time when the recent bombings, that 

included the use of cluster bombs, and ongoing hostilities, 

including injuries to civilians, make access to health care all the 

more critical.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. gave priority to efforts and concerns in building 

administration, forgetting to organize immediate assistance to the 

wounded. It also failed to provide timely security for hospitals 

and medical staff. In Baghdad, hospitals are filthy, many were 

looted, and no proper emergency transport system is in place. 

People wounded in the war who fled or were discharged from 

hospitals during the anarchy of the first days of US occupation had 

little idea where to go to receive follow-up treatments for their 

often serious injuries, including amputations. And since hospitals 

are still not fully functioning patients continue to be discharged 

early. Sufferers of chronic conditions such as diabetes, kidney 

disease, and epilepsy have nowhere to refill their medications. 

Iraqi doctors and nurses have still not been paid. In the hospitals 

that MSF has visited in Baghdad and other parts of the country, 

including Amarah, Basrah, Karbala, Nasariya, and elsewhere, there 

are life-threatening illnesses, such as tuberculosis and kala azar, 

that are going untreated due to lack of medicines. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MSF has tried to fill the gaps in medical assistance in Baghdad 

and elsewhere by providing medicines, supplies, and assistance 

where necessary, but a lack of plans to attend to the immediate 

health needs and power struggles and the absence clear lines of 

authority in Iraqi hospitals and the health system as a whole is 

posing the greatest challenge to health in the country. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Fortunately, MSF teams in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq have 

not yet detected signs of epidemics, large displacements of people, 

or acute malnutrition that would constitute a major catastrophe on 

the scale of what we are witnessing elsewhere in the world today,&quot; 

stated Dr. Rostrup. &quot;Nevertheless, there are important, unaddressed 

health needs, and any further delay by the US in reestablishing 

essential medical services is costing lives and heightening the 

risk that epidemics and other health problems may arise.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>MSF currently has 30 international aid workers in Iraq and 

surrounding countries and is carrying out assessments in all major 

cities, including Baghdad, Basra, Karbala, Tikrit, Nasariya, and 

Mossul, to determine the needs and provide medical assistance where 

necessary. </i></font></p>
