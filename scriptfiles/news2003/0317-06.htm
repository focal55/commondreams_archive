                17 - DENIS HALLIDAY, djhalliday@msn.com Former head of the UN 

                oil-for-food program, Halliday warns of "the catastrophic humanitarian 

                impact of war and the imminent collapse of the oil-for-food program." 

                Halliday, who was also former U.N. Assistant Secretary General, 

                said today: "The Secretary General should be prohibited from recalling 

                the inspectors without the permission of the five permanent members 

                of the Security Council." </font>

                Yesterday Vice President Dick Cheney claimed that Iraq has "reconstituted 

                nuclear weapons." Khadduri worked with the Iraqi Atomic Energy 

                Commission from 1968 until 1998. Now in Canada, he was recently 

                interviewed by UNMOVIC. Khadduri asserts that Iraq has not had 

                a nuclear weapons program since 1991 and accuses the administration 

                of a pattern of deceit. </font>

                U.N. documents, including minutes of closed meetings of the Security 

                Council committee charged with overseeing the sanctions. While 

                Bush and Blair cited Iraqi suffering as a reason for war yesterday, 

                she documents that it is U.S. policy which has ensured the devastation 

                in Iraq for the last decade. </font>
