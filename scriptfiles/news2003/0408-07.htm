                - April 8 - Today, Ralph Nader and the sports industry watchdog 

                League of Fans sent a letter to high school basketball star LeBron 

                James asking him to advocate for sweatshop eradication measures 

                in his anticipated endorsement contract with either Nike or Adidas. 

                The letter follows: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mr. James: 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congratulations 

                on your outstanding accomplishments as both a student and an athlete 

                at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is widely 

                assumed that you will be declaring for the NBA draft in the coming 

                months and are projected by most commentators to be the number 

                one pick. With all of your potential both on and off the court, 

                some have even labeled you as the "next Michael Jordan." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While any basketball 

                player would revel in having their playing ability compared to 

                Michael Jordan's, we would like to take this opportunity to request 

                that you separate yourself from Michael Jordan in an area where 

                he has fallen markedly short. Mr. Jordan has always had the chance 

                to use his influence to do something wonderful for the well-being 

                of human beings in Nike's sweatshops (overseas factories where 

                workers are subject to extreme exploitation) whose work has helped 

                make him a multi-millionaire. He chooses not to support justice 

                for those people. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With your anticipated 

                endorsement contract with either Nike or Adidas, you have the 

                chance to do what Michael Jordan should have done and use your 

                cultural status to help make the world a better place by helping 

                to stop the use of sweatshop labor in the sports shoe and sports 

                apparel industry. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nike and Adidas 

                (along with Reebok) are synonymous with sweatshops in Third-World 

                countries. Their products, typically manufactured by subcontracted 

                companies, have become symbols of labor rights violations, paltry 

                wages, forced overtime and abuse for hundreds of thousands of 

                workers. And despite pressure from around the world, Nike and 

                Adidas still choose to maximize profits by undermining human rights 

                standards. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It does not 

                matter which of these companies you ultimately choose to endorse, 

                but we ask that you stand up for the people who will be manufacturing 

                the products that will make you a wealthy man. If you demand in 

                your contract, whether it is with Nike or Adidas, that they improve 

                the conditions of the contracted factories that manufacture their 

                products and that you have power to influence and review the working 

                conditions for those who make the products you endorse, it will 

                pressure the entire sports shoe and apparel industry to change. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some refer 

                to Michael Jordan as the "king of sweatshops" for being the world's 

                most successful salesman of sweatshop-made shoes. As New York 

                Times columnist Harvey Araton wrote in September 2001, "No one 

                has ever confused you, Michael, with Muhammed Ali or Martina Navratilova 

                or Arthur Ashe. With your icon leverage you might have helped 

                convert Nike, the notorious third-world workplace abuser, but 

                you didn't do causes that were not commercials." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the coming 

                weeks and months, you will find yourself in a strong position 

                with the ability to help diminish or even eliminate some sweatshops. 

                As Nike and Adidas compete for your services, we urge you to push 

                for inclusion of as many of the following contract conditions 

                as possible. In their global operations, including those of contractors 

                and subcontractors, Nike/Adidas must: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) Ensure the 

                enforcement of workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively 

                (unionize) without intimidation. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) Signal to 

                factory owners and governments in supplier countries that enforcement 

                of labor standards, including increased wages, will not lead to 

                relocation in search of even cheaper labor. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3) Ensure that 

                workers are paid living wages which are at least adequate to meet 

                the basic needs of family and allow a small amount of discretionary 

                income. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4) Ensure that 

                workplaces are safe and healthy, eliminating exposure to toxic 

                chemicals, providing adequate personal protective equipment and 

                protecting workers from dangerous machinery. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5) Ensure that 

                workers are not forced or coerced into working unreasonably long 

                hours and that workers can obtain sick leave. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6) Ensure that 

                workers are free from physical and verbal abuse, intimidation 

                and sexual harassment. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7) Secure the 

                protection of workers who speak out or blow-the-whistle on poor 

                factory conditions. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8) Make public 

                the names and locations of all overseas contractors. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9) Work with 

                international unions and human rights organizations to establish 

                a transparent factory monitoring program that is verified by credible 

                organizations which are completely independent of the companies 

                themselves and involve unannounced factory visits. (Such a program 

                was created by United Students Against Sweatshops, an organization 

                of college students and community members at over 200 college 

                campuses across the country. They developed the Worker Rights 

                Consortium (WRC) in 2000 to verify and inspect conditions in factories 

                producing apparel for colleges and universities and to ensure 

                that the apparel of WRC member schools (112 and growing) are not 

                made in sweatshops.) </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10) Guarantee, 

                with confirmation from an independent organization through a transparent 

                factory monitoring program, that any product that uses the "LeBron 

                James" name or likeness meets the conditions negotiated initially. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If Nike or 

                Adidas were to meet these demands, the lives of hundreds of thousands 

                of people would be improved immediately. You will have your greatest 

                leverage to push the companies to meet as many of these conditions 

                as possible during your contract negotiations with them. It is 

                then that you can best seek legally binding, written commitments. 

                If you proceed to advocate for as much of this sweatshop eradication 

                agenda as possible, you would be respected throughout the world 

                for not just your ability to play basketball, but for your generosity 

                as a human being in doing your part to make the world a better 

                place. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is of 

                course a lot to ask of a young man. But you are on the verge of 

                choosing to immerse yourself in the world of international commerce, 

                which inevitably brings with it a wide array of complicated and 

                difficult challenges and decisions. Moreover, in choosing to leverage 

                your power to diminish the evils of sweatshops, you can call not 

                just on the talents of your agent and legal representatives, but 

                a vast array of experts and activists who have visited sweatshops 

                around the world, carefully documented conditions in these facilities, 

                lobbied tirelessly for the major athletic shoe, clothing and equipment 

                makers to respect basic working conditions, and who have established 

                bona fide and independent mechanisms to monitor workplace conditions. 

                These experts and activists, many little older than yourself, 

                would be thrilled to assist you in the effort to ensure respect 

                for the basic rights of workers in athletic shoe, clothing and 

                equipment factories around the world. </font>
