                - April 14 - Supporters of President Bush’s tax cut plan that 

                would give massive tax breaks to millionaires were forced to take 

                extraordinary measures in the Senate today to stave off total 

                defeat. To secure passage of the budget resolution, the Senate 

                leadership had to bring in Vice President Cheney to break a 50-50 

                tie vote, and Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa 

                had to pledge on the Senate floor that the reconciliation conference 

                report would not contain a tax cut greater than $350 billion. 

                In a completely unprecedented move, the budget resolution has 

                two different tax cut figures, with the House voting on a tax 

                cut of $550 billion, down from $726 billion, while the Senate 

                effectively established a tax cut cap of $350 billion. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moderate Senators 

                who voted for the resolution continued to voice their opposition 

                to tax cuts that exceed $350 billion. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leaders of 

                the Fair Taxes for All Coalition called the gimmick Budget Resolution 

                “absurd,” and cited the commitment to bring back a tax cut of 

                no greater than $350 billion as further evidence that the Bush 

                Administration does not have the votes to pass its gigantic tax 

                cuts for the wealthiest Americans. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“The plan they 

                barely got through the House in the dead of night yesterday only 

                got out of the Senate on life support this afternoon,” said Nancy 

                Duff Campbell, Co-President of the National Women’s Law Center, 

                a Fair Taxes for All Coalition co-chair. “Support for the Administration’s 

                tax cut plan continues to erode and the commitment to bring back 

                a tax cut that doesn’t exceed $350 billion demonstrates the President’s 

                plan to give enormous tax breaks to millionaires is unraveling.”

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today’s vote 

                in the Senate is another in a growing list of setbacks for the 

                Administration's reckless fiscal policies. Yesterday, the International 

                Monetary Fund delivered a sharp rebuke of Bush’s tax plan, calling 

                it “poorly timed and probably unnecessary…while failing to confront 

                the looming costs of Medicare and Social Security.” [Wall Street 

                Journal, 04/10/03] Earlier in the week, former Federal Reserve 

                Chairman Paul Volcker, former Senators Warren Rudman, Sam Nunn, 

                Bob Kerrey, and former Cabinet Secretaries Peter Peterson and 

                Robert Rubin all came out and called the Bush tax cuts “ill-logical” 

                and “not useful for short-term fiscal stimulus…nor would (the 

                tax cuts) spur long-term economic growth.” [New York Times, 04/09/03]

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The battle 

                now moves on to the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees, 

                where Fair Taxes For All Coalition will fight to reduce the size 

                of the tax cut, ensure that any tax changes are equitable and 

                not skewed to the richest Americans, and that any growth package 

                includes adequate state fiscal relief. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“With our nation 

                at war, our economy lagging, and many states in fiscal crisis, 

                we will fight any effort by Congress or the President to push 

                tax breaks for millionaires that will explode the deficit and 

                offer no stimulus to the economy,” said Roger Hickey of Campaign 

                for America’s Future. </font>
