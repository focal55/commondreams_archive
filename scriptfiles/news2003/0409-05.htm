                - April 9 - The federal government would turn a blind eye to ripoffs 

                by defense and technology contractors under legislation to be 

                proposed by Representative Tom Davis, who is chairman of the House 

                Government Reform Committee and the most recent head Republican 

                fundraiser in the House of Representatives. The Associated Press 

                reported on the provisions which are part of Representative Davis’ 

                Services Acquisition Reform Act (see h<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20030408/ap_on_go_co/defense_contracts_2" target="_new">ttp://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20030408/ap_on_go_co/defense_contracts_2</a>).

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Davis legislation 

                is part of a larger industry-driven effort to unravel statutes 

                that protect the federal government and taxpayers from being cheated 

                by contractors. The Project On Government Oversight (POGO) has 

                documented this effort in its report “Pickpocketing the Taxpayer: 

                The Insidious Effects of Acquisition Reform” (see h<a href="http://www.pogo.org/p/contracts/consubmain.html" target="_new">ttp://www.pogo.org/p/contracts/consubmain.html</a>).

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“This goody 

                bag for contractors is an insult to the taxpayers,” said Danielle 

                Brian, Executive Director of POGO. Three major provisions are 

                of concern in the Davis legislation: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) Time and 

                Material and Labor Hour Contracts. The bill encourages use of 

                time and material and labor hour contracts which allow contractors 

                to engage in almost unlimited billing of the government without 

                producing a product. These contracts require the government to 

                pay for time and expenses rather than for milestones reached or 

                work completed. “This is tantamount to hiring a house painter, 

                telling him no mater how long he takes or how much he spends on 

                paint, his bill will be paid,” said Danielle Brian, Executive 

                Director of POGO. The proposed legislation would even prohibit 

                government auditors from reviewing contractors’ costs. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) Share-in-Savings 

                Contracts. The bill also would expand use of speculative and unproven 

                financing schemes known as share-in-savings contracts. According 

                to law professor and acquisition expert Charles Tiefer, share-in-savings 

                contracts “could propagate problems similar to those that accompanied 

                deregulation of government-insured savings-and-loans institutions 

                or procurement of defense spare parts in the 1980s by sole-source 

                contracts.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under share-in-saving 

                contracts, contractors provide upfront capital financing for projects 

                such as computer system upgrades in exchange for receiving funds 

                down the line that are saved as a result of the upgrade. However, 

                developing baselines to estimate savings is virtually impossible 

                in the technology arena. Contractors frequently claim share-in-savings 

                programs save money. However, White House procurement chief Angela 

                Styles testified last year in hearings overseen by Representative 

                Davis: “we have seen no savings.” </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3) Truth in 

                Negotiations Act (TINA) & Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). The 

                legislation would also exempt a dramatically larger number of 

                government contracts from TINA and CAS requirements. Contractors 

                have been seeking the weakening of these requirements for years. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CAS are the 

                accounting principles that defense contractors must follow when 

                pricing their products and seeking government payment of their 

                costs. Establishment of uniform cost accounting standards and 

                the Board that sets them were initiated by Admiral Hyman Rickover 

                and Senator William Proxmire in the 1960s. Then, it was regarded 

                simply as good business practice for the government. If Davis 

                succeeds in weakening the standards, taxpayers are likely to be 

                paying billions of dollars more every year for the goods the Defense 

                Department and other agencies buy. The contractor accounting games 

                that led to the need for the CAS Board in the 1970s added an estimated 

                5% to government contract costs. The equivalent today would now 

                amount to well over $6 billion a year. To learn more about POGO’s 

                work defending the CAS Board, go to archive at: h<a href="http://www.pogo.org/p/x/archive.html#cas" target="_new">ttp://www.pogo.org/p/x/archive.html#cas</a> 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TINA requires 

                contractors (mostly companies selling defense goods) to disclose 

                their cost or pricing data -- the basis upon which government 

                auditors and negotiators use to determine that prices for weapons 

                and specialized government products are fair and reasonable. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed 

                legislation would raise the requirements for TINA and CAS application 

                from the current $550,000 and $7.5 million, respectively, to $200 

                million in the case of fixed-price contracts award to certain 

                “commercial companies.” Restricting TINA and CAS application when 

                is negotiating contract prices in a sole-source environment would 

                be like asking the government to put blinders on, and would lead 

                to outrageous contract overpricing and wasteful spending. </font>
