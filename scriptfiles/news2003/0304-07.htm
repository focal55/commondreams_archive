                - March 4 - The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) today 

                called on state and national Republican leaders to condemn a walkout 

                by two members of that party during a Muslim prayer opening Monday's 

                session of the Washington State House of Representatives. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Washington, 

                D.C.-based Islamic civil rights and advocacy group said Republicans 

                Louis McMahan and Cary Condotta went to the back of the chamber 

                during the invocation by Imam Mohamad Joban of the Islamic Center 

                of Olympia. Condotta said he "wasn't particularly interested" 

                in the prayer. McMahan said she did not remain in the chamber 

                because: "It's an issue of patriotism...The Islamic religion is 

                so...part and parcel with the attack on America. I just didn't 

                want to be there, be a part of that...My god is not Mohammed."

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"How many times 

                must American Muslims ask Republican leaders to repudiate Islamophobic 

                hate within their own ranks? Americans must not allow the actions 

                of a few, whatever their positions of authority, to divide our 

                nation along religious and ethnic lines. Such divisive actions 

                by elected leaders can only serve to increase discrimination against 

                ordinary American Muslims and harm our nation's image and interests 

                worldwide," said CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Awad urged 

                state and national Republican leaders to repudiate the lawmakers' 

                walkout and to apologize to Washington's Muslim community. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his prayer, 

                Imam Joban stated: "We open this session of the House of Representatives 

                in the name of Allah, the one God of Abraham, God of Moses, God 

                of Jesus, and God of Mohammed, peace be upon them all...We ask 

                Allah or God to bless the state of Washington so it may continue 

                to prosper and become a symbol of peace and tranquility for people 

                of all ethnic and religious backgrounds. We pray that Allah may 

                guide this House in making good decisions for the people of Washington...At 

                this time, we also pray that America may succeed in the war against 

                terrorism. We pray to God that the war may end with world peace 

                and tranquility." </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response 

                to the walkout, Imam Joban said: "As a Muslim we have to respect 

                what people believe and...we have to forgive something because 

                of ignorance The Holy Quran says that (one should) always respond 

                to bad action with good and those who used to be enemies become 

                friends." </font>
