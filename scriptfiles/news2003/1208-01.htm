- December 8 - The results of yesterday's elections to the Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, show that Russian ratification is still on track and that final ratification could take place after the Presidential elections in March 2004, said WWF today.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&quot;The Presidential Party's victory in these elections puts even more responsibility on President Putin's shoulders to ensure a fast ratification process,&quot; said Alexey Kokorin, head of WWF-Russia's Climate Change Programme. &quot;Overall opposition to Kyoto in the Duma has been reduced and all eyes are on the President now.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Below is a brief history of the Russian government's recent statements on ratification of Kyoto:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">June 2003: The working group of the Presidium of the State Council of the Russian Federation - personally chaired by President Vladimir Putin - recommended ratification of the Kyoto protocol.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">August 2003: The Deputy Minister of Economic Development and Trade and Co-Chairman of the Russian Interagency Committee on Climate Change, Mukhamed Tsikanov, expressed his opinion that Russia could ratify before the end of this year.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">19 September 2003: The Russian Interagency Committee on Climate Change approved a draft concept of the legal basis for implementing the Kyoto Protocol in the national legislation, prepared by the Ministry of the Economy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">30 September 2003: President Vladimir Putin announced at the Climate Conference in Moscow that Russia would take its time to evaluate the consequences of ratification and set the national policy around Russia's interests.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">19 October 2003: President Putin confirmed once more at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Bangkok that the Russian Federation was in favour of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">28 October 2003: Efforts continue to develop the national &quot;Kyoto&quot; policy.

According to Mukhamed Tsikanov, the Government is evaluating the benefits of international cooperation under the Kyoto Protocol and the decision on its ratification will depend on clear signals from the European Union and Japan to buy carbon emission permits.</FONT></P><P></P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">###</FONT></p></font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
