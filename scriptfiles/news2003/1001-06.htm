- September 30 - Just days before the California Recall election, women across the state will participate in the &#147;WOMEN CAN STOP SCHWARZENEGGER Statewide Day of Protest&#148; on Friday, October 3, at 5 pm. CODEPINK activists will be joined by California NOW members and their supporters in over five California cities, including Santa Monica and Sacramento outside both of Schwarzenegger&#146;s Volunteer Campaign Headquarters.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Demonstrations will also be held in San Francisco as well as in San Rafael and Santa Rosa. More locations will be added to the growing list of participating cities. CODEPINK has protested at a half dozen of the candidate's campaign stops. Polls have indicated that there is a 'Gender Gap' regarding women&#146;s willingness to vote for a candidate often portrayed as boorish, crude and reportedly inappropriate in his actions towards women.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger's rude and disgraceful comments about women are just the tip of an iceberg for us,&quot; said Jodie Evans, co-founder of CODEPINK Women for Peace. &quot;They expose his willingness to say and do anything to get what he wants. He lacks common decency and any real self respect.  He is power hungry and it shows.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 

Helen Grieco, executive director of CA NOW, said California &quot;is in serious trouble and it needs an intelligence and maturity Arnold sorely lacks. Arnold Schwarzenegger is not pro-choice, he is not pro-woman and he is not qualified to be governor of California. California NOW urges its members and supporters who care about women&#146;s rights and freedom not to vote for him and to vote &quot;No&#148; on the recall on October 7.&#148;</font></p>
