<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SILVER SPRING, MD - September 17 - Peace Action, the nation's largest peace and disarmament organization with over 91,000 members nationwide, expressed disappointment over today's votes on funding for new, &quot;usable&quot; nuclear weapons in the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Bill.  The Senate voted this afternoon 53 to 41 to table (kill) the Feinstein amendment to prohibit the use of funds for Department of Energy activities relating to the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, Advanced Weapons Concepts (so-called &quot;mini-nukes&quot;), modification of the readiness posture of the Nevada Test Site, and the Modern Pit Facility (to prodeuce plutonium pits for new nuclear warheads), and to make the amount of funds made available by the prohibition for debt reduction.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the House of Representatives voted last July to cut most of the money for these programs, a House-Senate conference committee will need to reconcile the differences in the spending bills.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We will mobilize grassroots pressure on the House-Senate conferees to delete the funding for these dangerous, hypocritical, &quot;usable&quot; nuclear weapons programs,&quot; said Kevin Martin, Executive Director of Peace Action, &quot;but the Senate missed a golden opportunity today to provide leadership on nuclear non-proliferation.  Clearly, the Bush Administration and its Senate allies think they can preach non-proliferation to the rest of the world while we seek to develop new, more &quot;usable&quot; nuclear weapons on top of the 10,000 warheads we already possess.  This hypocritical &quot;do as we say, not as we do&quot; non-proliferation policy is doomed to fail.  Having uncovered no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, our credibility is already low enough. Now, we are risking nothing short of a new nuclear arms race.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peace Action thanked Senators Diane Feinstein and Edward Kennedy for their leadership, and also the other senators who voted against usable nukes. Martin noted that Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island was the only Republican to break rank and vote against the motion to table the Feinstein Amendment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peace Action spokespeople are available for comment the rest of this week on the Senate vote and future prospects for Congressional action on these issues.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peace Action was founded in 1957 as the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (SANE). In 1987, SANE merged with the Nuclear Weapons Freeze Campaign to form SANE/FREEZE.  The organization changed its name to Peace Action in 1992.</font></p>
