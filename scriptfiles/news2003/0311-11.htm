                HAGUE - March 11 - The inauguration of the first eighteen judges 

                at the new International Criminal Court (ICC) will help to thwart 

                U.S. efforts to undermine the court, Human Rights Watch said today. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The judges 

                are the first officers of the court to take up their duties. The 

                court's 89 members, known as States Parties, will select a prosecutor 

                at the end of April. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The judges' 

                inauguration makes this court more unstoppable than ever," said 

                Richard Dicker, director of Human Rights Watch's international 

                justice program. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. State 

                Department is increasing pressure on many governments to obtain 

                what are known as "bilateral immunity agreements," exempting all 

                U.S. citizens from the authority of the court. The fifteen member 

                states of the European Union and the overwhelming majority of 

                other States Parties have refused to sign agreements invalidating 

                their obligations to the court. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than twenty 

                states have signed immunity agreements with Washington, but only 

                eight of them are parties to the treaty. Many of these agreements 

                have not yet been enacted into law. A number of states that initially 

                signed are now considering whether the agreements unlawfully amend 

                the jurisdiction of the ICC and are hesitant to formally ratify 

                them. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We urge all 

                States Parties to resist pressure to enter into these illegal 

                contracts," said Dicker. "The U.S. government should not be allowed 

                to undermine the legitimacy of the court." </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. officials 

                are claiming the American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) 

                will cut off military assistance to states that have not signed 

                an agreement by July 1, 2003. The same law, however, allows the 

                Bush Administration to waive this prohibition on grounds of "national 

                interest," said Dicker. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"U.S. officials 

                are double dealing," said Dicker. "They are pointing to the part 

                of the ASPA that makes withdrawal of military assistance look 

                threatening and real. But they conveniently ignore the law's provisions 

                empowering the administration to continue giving assistance." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dicker said 

                the United States was unlikely to want to alienate allies at a 

                time when it was seeking to build international alliances against 

                al-Qaeda: "States should ask: How likely is it that the United 

                States will discontinue military aid at a time when it is looking 

                to buttress allies in the fight against terrorism? None too likely." 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1998, 120 

                states approved the treaty to establish the ICC. The treaty came 

                into force on July 1, 2002, after 60 countries had ratified it. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As of March 

                11, 2003, 89 countries have joined the ICC. Once a prosecutor 

                is selected, the court will be able to investigate and prosecute 

                those individuals accused of crimes against humanity, genocide, 

                and war crimes. The ICC complements existing national judicial 

                systems and will step in only if national courts are unwilling 

                or unable to investigate or prosecute such crimes. The ICC provides 

                a remedy to those victimized by these crimes, very often women 

                and children. </font>
