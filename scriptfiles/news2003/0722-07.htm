- July 22 -  The full U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote today on the issue of medical marijuana for the first time in five years. Medical marijuana patients and advocates will be watching closely to see whether Republicans from states that allow the medical use of marijuana will vote to protect their states' patients from federal attacks.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   U.S. Reps. Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), with the support of Reps. Ron Paul (R-TX), Sam Farr (D-CA), and many other House members, are planning to propose a medical marijuana amendment to the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. The amendment would bar the Justice Department, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, from spending any money to raid or arrest medical marijuana patients and providers in the states that have eliminated or reduced penalties for medical use of marijuana: Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. A floor vote on the amendment is expected later today.</font></p>

<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The last time the House voted on medical marijuana was on a 1998 resolution opposing state medical marijuana laws,&quot; said Steve Fox, director of government relations for the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington, D.C. &quot;That resolution passed, 310-93. But given the growing outrage over the DEA's raids on patients and caregivers in California, we expect it to be much closer this time.</font></p>

<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We will be watching to see whether Republicans from states that allow medical use of marijuana will vote to defend their most vulnerable citizens from these cruel federal attacks,&quot; Fox added. &quot;We will also be keeping an eye on Dick Gephardt, who -- while campaigning in New Hampshire on Sunday -- promised a seriously ill patient that he would support `states' rights' on medical marijuana.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Gephardt and fellow presidential contender Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH),voted for the 1998 resolution. In May, however, Kucinich said in an interview that he now supports medical marijuana &quot;without reservation.&quot; He has since cosponsored both medical marijuana bills in Congress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   With nearly 13,000 members nationwide, the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States. MPP works to minimize the harm associated with marijuana -- both the consumption of marijuana and the laws that are intended to prohibit such use. MPP believes that the greatest harm associated with marijuana is imprisonment. To this end, MPP focuses on removing criminal penalties for marijuana use, with a particular emphasis on making marijuana medically available to seriously ill people who have the approval of their doctors.
