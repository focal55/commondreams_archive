                - April 17 - Corporate accountability activists are denouncing 

                the decision by the Commonwealth of Virginia to incorporate a 

                new company, Licensed to Kill, Inc. (<a href="http://www.licensedtokill.biz" target="_new">www.licensedtokill.biz</a>). 

                As stated in its articles of incorporation, the company&#146;s 

                purpose is &#147;the manufacture and marketing of tobacco products 

                in a way that kills over 400,000 Americans and 4.5 million other 

                persons worldwide.&#148; According to the national corporate accountability 

                organization Infact, Licensed to Kill&#146;s stated purpose mirrors 

                the reality behind the massive public relations of Philip Morris 

                (now Altria). Since 1994, Infact has been challenging Philip Morris/Altria 

                to stop tobacco promotion that appeals to children and young people 

                around the world and to stop interfering in public health policy.</font> 

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The 

                  incorporation of a company with the stated intent to kill millions 

                  of people worldwide is a clear demonstration of the need for 

                  major change in how corporations are established and allowed 

                  to operate in our society. Our state governments are giving 

                  their seal of approval to corporations that profit at the expense 

                  of health, human rights and the environment globally. The tobacco 

                  industry, led by Philip Morris/Altria, is one of the most egregious 

                  examples of this kind of behavior,&#148; says Infact Executive 

                  Director Kathryn Mulvey.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Corporate 

                  charters are granted by state governments as a license to operate 

                  for a particular purpose. Today, giant corporations like Philip 

                  Morris/Altria have amassed enormous power and influence over 

                  every branch and level of our government. Through legislation 

                  and court interpretations, since the late 19th century they 

                  have chipped away at democratic controls over corporations&#151;such 

                  as the ability to revoke charters if the privileges are abused. 

                  Activists from a wide range of perspectives and movements are 

                  calling for a major shift in the balance of power between corporations 

                  and ordinary people.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The launch 

                  of the Licensed to Kill website draws attention to the tobacco 

                  industry&#146;s intention to derail the Framework Convention 

                  on Tobacco Control (FCTC)&#151;the world&#146;s first public 

                  health treaty&#151;scheduled to be adopted in Geneva next month. 

                  The FCTC will change the way transnational tobacco corporations 

                  like Philip Morris/Altria operate around the world. One of the 

                  most important provisions in the treaty is a ban on tobacco 

                  advertising, promotion and sponsorship, allowing for constitutional 

                  conflicts. An editorial in this month&#146;s issue of Tobacco 

                  International, an industry trade journal, calls on giant tobacco 

                  corporations and their allies to mobilize to block the adoption 

                  of the current treaty text.</font></p>
