                - March 26 - A recent Center for Immigration Studies report claims 

                that, despite restrictions Congress placed on legal immigrants' 

                eligibility for certain public benefit programs in 1996, "welfare 

                use rates for immigrants and natives are essentially back to where 

                they were in 1996 when welfare reform was passed." This claim 

                is striking, but misleading. A more careful, forthcoming analysis 

                conducted by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, as well 

                as a number of other pieces of research conducted by scholars 

                at the Urban Institute and other research institutions, shows 

                that the share of noncitizens participating in each of the major 

                means-tested federal programs - Medicaid, Food Stamps, TANF, and 

                SSI - has declined significantly since 1996. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The CIS report, 

                which examines participation trends among what it calls "immigrant 

                households," similarly finds that receipt of TANF, SSI, and food 

                stamps by these households declined substantially between 1996 

                and 2001. Nevertheless, because it finds a modest increase in 

                the share of such households with at least one member who receives 

                Medicaid or health insurance provided through the State Children's 

                Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), CIS asserts that the share of 

                immigrant households using "at least one major welfare program" 

                has not declined since 1996. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CIS fails to 

                mention, however, that this modest increase in Medicaid participation 

                by so-called "immigrant" households is entirely due to an increase 

                in the number of U.S.-citizen children participating in Medicaid 

                or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) who live 

                in households that also contain immigrants. The 1996 welfare law 

                maintained Medicaid coverage for these children since they are 

                citizens of the United States. As a result, data showing that 

                participation by U.S.-citizen children in Medicaid or SCHIP rose 

                modestly says little about the impact of the restrictions the 

                law placed on noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"CIS uses a 

                methodology that obscures the substantial declines in participation 

                by noncitizens in all of the major benefit programs, including 

                Medicaid, that have occurred since 1996. As a result, the report 

                paints a misleading picture of the impact of these restrictions," 

                said Leighton Ku, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy 

                Priorities. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Trends in participation 

                by non-citizen children and non-citizen adults provide a more 

                accurate yardstick by which to measure the impact on the 1996 

                restrictions. New analysis of Census data (the same database used 

                by CIS) shows that among both of these groups, Medicaid participation 

                declined between 1997 and 2001, a fact CIS fails to mention in 

                its report. For example, the share of noncitizen children of low-income 

                parents participating in Medicaid or SCHIP fell from 28.6 percent 

                in 1996 to 24.8 percent in 2001; during the same time period, 

                the share of U.S.-citizen children participating in these programs 

                increased from 42.8 percent to 47.6 percent. (The increase in 

                coverage for citizen children is primarily due to the creation 

                of the SCHIP program by Congress in 1997 and subsequent actions 

                by all states to expand coverage for children.) As a result, by 

                2001, noncitizen children were nearly half as likely to participate 

                in Medicaid or SCHIP as citizen children living in households 

                with similar income levels. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The 1996 welfare 

                law substantially reduced the receipt of Medicaid, food stamps, 

                TANF and SSI by noncitizens who were lawfully admitted to the 

                United States. As a result, it led to increased levels of hardship 

                - such as being uninsured or running out of food - among many 

                low-income legal immigrants. Even CIS acknowledges that it is 

                'unfair' to restrict public benefits for noncitizens who, after 

                all, pay taxes, serve in the military and have the same social 

                obligations as U.S. citizens. The 1996 welfare law shows that 

                it is possible to reduce public benefit use by non-citizens who 

                are lawfully admitted to the United States; it is also the case, 

                however, that these reductions have led to increased hardships 

                for many of these Americans, who, of course, are no more immune 

                to crises such as unemployment and economic insecurity than other 

                American families," Ku said.
