- May 14 - A week before the scheduled adoption of the Framework

Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), public interest organizations from across the globe

are urging President Bush to halt all US efforts to derail the treaty. Recent attempts by

the Bush Administration to weaken the text of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control

(FCTC) have sparked sharp criticism. In a <a href="http://www.infact.org/bushltr.html" target="_new">letter</a> released

today, 67 corporate accountability, public health, environmental, medical, consumer and

faith-based organizations from every region of the world urge President Bush to instruct

his administration not to interfere with the adoption of the final FCTC text at the World

Health Assembly next week. Organizations that have signed onto the letter include: Infact,

Center for International Environmental Law, Zambia Consumers Association, ASH UK,

Consumers International Asia Pacific Office, the Turkish Medical Association and the

Canadian Environmental Law Association.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration is working down to the wire to derail

the world&#146;s first public health treaty. Pressing to re-open debate on a text that is

supported by more than 170 countries is cowboy diplomacy at its worst. Across the globe

people are urging President Bush to stop doing Philip Morris/Altria&#146;s dirty work, and

to instruct the US representatives to the World Health Assembly to join with the rest of

the world in prioritizing global public health,&quot; says Kathryn Mulvey, Executive

Director of the corporate accountability organization Infact.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush Administration recently indicated to the World Health

Organization that the United States will not sign the treaty unless governments re-open

negotiations and allow each country to pick and choose which parts of the treaty will

apply to them. There is concern among public health and corporate accountability

organizations that the US tactic could undermine the near-consensus that has been reached

and threaten the future of the FCTC process. A March editorial in the tobacco industry

trade journal, Tobacco International, expressed optimism that the US would push to re-open

the debate on reservations, and &quot;unravel the whole process.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With these outrageous attempts to weaken or derail the FCTC,

President Bush would force other countries to smoke the transnationals&#146; coffin nails.

He is exchanging the world citizens&#146; health for the tobacco companies&#146; license

to continue killing in the future,&quot; says Dr. Hatai Chitanondh, President of the

Thailand Health Promotion Institute and a member of the Thai delegation to the FCTC

negotiations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Signatories to today&#146;s letter to President Bush point out that

the implications of US efforts to subvert the FCTC extend beyond tobacco control. The

letter states: &quot;As public interest organizations across the United States and the

globe, we are concerned that the United States has developed a pattern in recent history

of negotiating environmental, human rights and other important multilateral treaties down

to the lowest common denominator, and then failing to support them when they are

completed. The Kyoto Protocol, Basel Convention on Hazardous Wastes, Convention on

Biological Diversity, Convention on the Rights of the Child, Rome Statute on the

International Criminal Court, and Landmine Ban Treaty provide a few examples of how the

U.S. government has isolated itself from the global community on issues of enormous

humanitarian and environmental consequence.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration&#146;s behavior in the FCTC

negotiations has been disingenuous at best and, at worst, simply lawless,&quot; says Glenn

Wiser, Staff Attorney for the Center for International Environmental Law. &quot;The

Administration has justified its advocacy for Big Tobacco with bogus legal arguments that

would make a first-year law student blush. It&#146;s time for this government to

demonstrate that it cares more about the health, welfare, and security of people than

about the profits of an industry that deals in addictive substances that kill.&quot;</font></p>
