                YORK - March 19 - An advertisement produced in conjunction with 

                the anti-war group Not In Our Name will begin airing on MTV and 

                BET in New York City during programs such as Total Request Live, 

                Direct Effect and 106 & Park, some of the network’s most popular 

                shows among 18-34 year olds. The ad will begin airing on Thursday 

                March 20th and Friday March 21sth and will run through the week.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Filmed in Times 

                Square, the spot features young New Yorkers and youth activists 

                expressing opposition to the war and urging their peers to become 

                involved in the anti-war movement. One youth states, “We don’t 

                want this war, it’s not in our name,” and others say that people 

                “must act like the future depends on it, because it does.” The 

                spot contains footage of worldwide protests against the war. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The series 

                is a collaboration between Not In Our Name and two-time Academy 

                Award winning filmmaker Barbara Kopple, screenwriter Jeremy Pikser 

                (Bulworth), Not In Our Name spokesperson Miles Solay and filmmakers 

                William Davis, David Becker, Kristi Jacobson, Molly Snyder-Fink, 

                and Craig Hymson. Spoken word artist Saul Williams contributed 

                his song “September 12th” to the first commercial. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“We want young 

                people to know they have a voice,” said Ms. Kopple. “That they 

                can’t be silenced in this debate.” Barbara Kopple won Academy 

                Awards for her films Harlan County USA and American Dream. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the national 

                level, MTV has joined CNN and other networks in refusing to air 

                anti-war ads produced by organizations like Not in Our Name and 

                Win Without War, citing a company policy. Both CNN and MTV air 

                recruiting ads for the Army, Navy, and Marines regularly, raising 

                issues of fairness. The Not in Our Name ad is instead airing through 

                regional cable networks, starting in New York and Los Angeles 

                and then expanding to other cities, such as Cleveland, Chicago, 

                and San Francisco. </font>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Individual 

                contributions paid for the production of the ads and the purchase 

                of airspace. Not In Our Name has pledged to take their message 

                to dozens of cities around the country. The ad is also viewable 

                on the NION website at <a href="http://www.notinourname.net" target="_new">www.notinourname.net</a>
