<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- October 31 - The next three scheduled executions in the

United States - one in Georgia and two in North Carolina - involve

men whose severe mental illness should make them ineligible for the death 

penalty, the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty said today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

The scheduled executions come on the heels of a report by a national

organization that found that prison systems increasingly are

masquerading as mental health facilities - except that many more

people in prison do not receive treatment. The group, Human Rights Watch,

found that one in every six people in prison in the United States is

mentally ill, with many suffering from such illnesses as schizophrenia, 

bipolar disorder and major depression. The report found that there are

three times as many men and women with mental illness in prisons in

the United States as there are in mental health hospitals.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Another organization, the National Mental Health Association, the nation's

oldest and largest organization that conducts research on mental illness,

estimates that some 370 people with severe mental illness are warehoused

on death rows in the United States - just more than one in every ten

people on death row.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

Brian Roberts, NCADP executive director, said executing people who

are not fully culpable for their actions constitutes a gross human

rights violation. &quot;Personal culpability must be taken into consideration 

when holding people accountable for their actions,&quot; Roberts said.&quot;People with severe mental illness, just like people with mental

retardation and juvenile offenders, cannot be regarded as culpable

as fully functioning adults. It is important to recognize that those

chosen for execution in this country tend to reside on the very edge

of society's margins - and that includes people with severe mental

illness.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

During the next two and a half weeks, three people with severe mental

illness are scheduled for execution. They are:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

***James Willie Brown, Nov. 4, Georgia. Brown is scheduled to be

executed for the 1975 rape and murder of Brenda Sue Watson in Gwinnet

County. Brown, who has been diagnosed no fewer than 17 times as having

severe paranoid schizophrenia, originally was found incompetent to 

stand trial for Watson's murder. In 1981, he was found competent to

stand trial and was convicted and sentenced to death. In 1988, that

conviction was overturned due to Brown's mental illness. In 1991, Brown

was retried and again sentenced to death, largely on the perjured 

testimony of a witness who said Brown was &quot;faking&quot; his mental illness.

That witness since has recanted her sworn testimony.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

***Joseph Keel, Nov. 7, North Carolina. Keel was sentenced to death for

the 1990 murder of John Simmons, his father-in-law in Edgecombe County.

Keel suffers from borderline personality disorder, suicidal tendencies

and organic personality disorder, which is caused by traumatic brain 

injuries and is characterized by extreme mood swings, aggression,

impaired judgment, apathy or paranoia and depression. Under North Carolina

law, a person cannot be convicted of capital murder if he or she does not

have the mental capacity to form intent, to premeditate or to 

deliberate. Despite the requirements set out by North Carolina law,

Joseph Keel's lawyers did not present to the jury any evidence regarding

his mental illness or mental capacity to the jury during the guilt/innocence

phase of the trial. Keel has been barred from pursuing ineffective 

assistance of counsel claims in his appeals because, ironically, a

post-conviction lawyer missed the deadline for filing such appeals.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

***John Dennis Daniels, Nov. 14, North Carolina. Daniels was sentenced

to death for the 1990 murder of Isabelle Daniels Crawford of Mecklenburg

County. Psychiatrists found that Daniels possessed &quot;the emotional and

social development of an eleven or twelve-year-old child...his 

ability to think or evaluate his behavior would have been compromised

to the point of being inconsequential.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The North Carolina scheduled executions come at a time when the state

Senate has approved a moratorium on executions, with similar legislation

expected to come up in the House next year. In addition, according

to a recent scientific survey, support for the death penalty in North

Carolina is at an all-time low, with a plurality of North Carolina

residents favoring a moratorium. Nonetheless, North Carolina ranks

third in the United States in executions this year, behind Texas

and Oklahoma.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

 

NCADP is urging its members and allies to contact Georgia and

North Carolina officials to protest the scheduled executions. To take action,
