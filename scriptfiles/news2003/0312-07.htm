                March 12 - As part of the Bush administration's ongoing campaign 

                to roll back the nation's environmental protections, the Pentagon 

                is exploiting the impending war with Iraq and ongoing war on terrorism 

                to take aim at an array of public health and environmental laws. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although defeated 

                in the last Congress, the Department of Defense (DoD) has unveiled 

                its latest legislative proposal, the "Readiness and Range Preservation 

                Initiative," which seeks immunity from five fundamental federal 

                laws: the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act; Comprehensive 

                Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund 

                law); Clean Air Act; Marine Mammal Protection Act; and Endangered 

                Species Act. Despite contrary evidence, the Pentagon claims that 

                the laws regulating hazardous waste, toxic cleanup and air quality 

                -- as well as those protecting wildlife habitat, migratory birds, 

                whales and other marine mammals -- hinder military readiness. 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That certainly 

                wasn't the case under the first Bush administration during the 

                Persian Gulf War. Shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait, then-Secretary 

                of Defense Dick Cheney told an assembly of military planners and 

                environmentalists, "Defense and the environment is not an either-or 

                proposition. To choose between them is impossible in this real 

                world of serious defense threats and genuine environmental concerns. 

                The real choice is whether we are going to build a new environmental 

                ethic into the daily business of defense."1 </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A decade later, 

                the Pentagon's proposed legislation begs the question: Should 

                national defense come at the expense of what the military is supposed 

                to be defending? And if so, wouldn't other federal agencies -- 

                not to mention industries -- argue for their own exemptions too? 

                Our answer: No government agency should be above the law -- especially 

                the laws that protect America's air and water, public health, 

                and endangered wildlife. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why We Fight 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We do not question 

                the importance of training and readiness for our fighting forces, 

                but sweeping exemptions from environmental laws are not necessary 

                to ensure America's military might. Success stories abound to 

                show how the military has found reasonable solutions and pursued 

                training in compliance with environmental laws. Moreover, the 

                statutes now under fire already provide the flexibility needed 

                to balance environmental protection and military readiness by 

                allowing exemptions on a case-by-case basis in the interest of 

                national security. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to 

                a briefing presented to the deputy secretary of defense by the 

                department's Senior Readiness Oversight Council last December: 

                "National security clauses exist in many of this nation's environmental 

                statutes that would allow senior officials…to exclude DoD from 

                certain provisions…under certain conditions. To date DoD has not 

                used such exemptions to any extent to address encroachment concerns...."2 

                </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Pentagon 

                now wants to abandon its commitment to environmental stewardship 

                even though it has yet to show that environmental laws hamper 

                military readiness. Last June, the General Accounting Office (GAO) 

                said the DoD has failed to produce any evidence showing that environmental 

                laws or other "encroachments" have significantly affected military 

                readiness.3 And Christie Todd Whitman, head of the U.S. Environmental 

                Protection Agency, recently testified before the Senate that she 

                has "been working very closely with the Department of Defense 

                and I don't believe that there is a training mission anywhere 

                in the county that is being held up or not taking place because 

                of environmental protection regulation."4 </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The National 

                Park Service recently warned that the changes being sought "would 

                cause substantial degradation of natural resources."5 It's also 

                worth noting that the Pentagon's proposal contradicts the principle 

                of the Federal Facilities Compliance Act -- passed nearly unanimously 

                in 1992 -- by unnecessarily exempting the DoD from federal laws 

                at the expense of public health, public lands, air, water and 

                wildlife. Moreover, if the exemptions were granted, taxpayers 

                and state governments would bear the burden of cleanup costs and 

                face public health risks from toxic contamination resulting from 

                military operations. It's no wonder that state-level opposition 

                was fierce when DoD proposed similar legislation in Congress last 

                year.
