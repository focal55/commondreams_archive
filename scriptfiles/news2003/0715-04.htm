- July 15 - Call, fax or e-mail your Senators this week&#151;especially if they are on the Finance Committee&#151;and ask them to work for and endorse a welfare policy that addresses the real needs of poor families as they struggle to avoid or escape poverty. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Millions of poor women and children are depending on you to convince your Senators to:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">reject additional expansion of work requirements;</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">broaden education and training opportunities</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">substantially increase child care funds to ensure that children are properly cared for</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">help recipients transitioning to work to do so successfully;</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">extend assistance to legal immigrants</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">discourage mandatory, arbitrary and expensive marriage promotion programs and give states the flexibility to address domestic and sexual violence and other employment barriers. </font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Take action and please pass this on to your colleagues as well. </font></p>

<b>Background: </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the days leading up to the July 23 &quot;mark up&quot; and probable vote, key members of the Senate Finance Committee will be meeting to craft a bipartisan Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) reauthorization bill. Other Senators on the Finance Committee, as well as Members who are not part of the Committee but care about the issue of TANF reauthorization, will need to share their concerns and priorities with the Committee leadership as soon as possible. Committee staff are already circulating a draft proposal and plan to have an almost-agreed-to document ready for Senate Finance Committee consideration at the July 23 meeting. Unless our concerns are addressed in that draft document, it will be very difficult to pass a Senate welfare bill that really helps poverty-level families. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is absolutely crucial that Senators, especially those on the Finance Committee, hear from all of us at this time. Pass this message along to your colleagues and take action now! </font></p>
