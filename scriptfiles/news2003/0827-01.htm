- August 27 -  Long-term unemployment among parents surged more than 50 percent in a 12-month period, according to an analysis released today by the Children's Defense Fund. One out of every 100 American parents was jobless and suffering long-term unemployment (more than 26 weeks) in June 2003, the highest percentage in years. The rapid rise indicates that the economy continues to worsen for many families with children.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's analysis shows that 655,000 parents experienced long-term unemployment - more than three times the number two years ago. The figure marks a one-month jump of 20 percent and a 51 percent one-year increase. These parents were among 2.8 million parents unemployed and actively seeking work.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Children's Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman noted that we must do what it takes to meet the needs of children and their parents no matter the political or economic climate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We can build a nation where all families have the support they need to make it at work and at home,&quot; said Edelman, &quot;Rising numbers of jobless workers and their children have nothing to celebrate this Labor Day weekend. While they wonder how they are going to put food on the table, the average millionaire is looking forward to a $93,500 tax break.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis uses data from the federal government's monthly Current Population Survey. The long-term unemployment trends for parents parallel figures for Americans overall released by the U.S. Department of Labor.</font></p>
