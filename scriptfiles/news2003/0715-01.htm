- July 15 - The Kucinich campaign has just filed its quarterly financial figures 

with the FEC, showing the campaign on a steep curve upward in 

fundraising, poised for expansion and new hiring, with money in the 

bank.  It represents the biggest percentage jump in fundraising of any 

presidential campaign.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The campaign started in February and raised $180,000 in that quarter.  

In the campaign's first full quarter, ending June 30, fundraising 

climbed to more than $1.5 million ($1,539,000).  With quarterly 

expenditures of $527,000, the campaign ended the quarter with over $1 

million cash on hand ($1,064,000).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our goal was to raise a million dollars in our first full quarter,&quot; 

said Congressman Kucinich. &quot;We far exceeded our expectations.  A 

grassroots campaign like ours, with thousands of volunteers, doesn't 

need to match the other campaigns in fundraising -- we will invest our 

cash on hand in expanded field operations.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kucinich continued: &quot;With the power of the Internet to organize 

volunteers and raise money -- and thanks in part to our strong campaign 

in the MoveOn Primary -- we are showing that a campaign based on a 

progressive issues agenda can resonate with voters and gain 

momentum...despite those in the media who want to write us out of the race.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the $1.54 million raised in the quarter, roughly half was raised in 

the last two weeks, reflecting the campaign's growing momentum and a 

topnotch Internet operation that will keep raising money in small 

donations from Kucinich's growing number of passionate supporters.  More than a million dollars or 2/3 of the total raised this quarter were from credit card donations through the Internet; the average donation for the quarter was $77.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Kucinich campaign has gained momentum thanks to a growing list of endorsements from well known activists and artists -- including Willie Nelson, who will be doing benefit concerts to raise money for the campaign.</font></p>
