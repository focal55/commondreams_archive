                - March 3 - Following is a statement by the leaders of the Fair 

                Taxes For All Coalition: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Treasury Secretary 

                John Snow's attempts to promote the latest Bush tax cut plan before 

                the House Ways and Means Committee today are undermined by the 

                record of the company he used to lead, said leaders of the Fair 

                Taxes For All Coalition. Moreover, the Bush Administration is 

                being irresponsible by pushing for the tax cut when it has not 

                told the American people how much a war with Iraq may cost. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Secretary Snow's 

                argument that Congress must eliminate the income tax on dividends 

                because it represents "double taxation" doesn't add up. Here's 

                why: </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- CSX, the 

                company that used to be headed by Secretary Snow made $974 million 

                in profits over the last 4 years. During that period the company 

                paid no corporate taxes at all. Instead it received a $164 million 

                rebate. There is no way to double tax that. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- CSX is just 

                one example. The fact is that profits aren't taxed heavily at 

                the corporate level. Last year only one-half of corporate profits 

                were subject to the corporate income tax, and only a small portion 

                of those are paid out as dividends. -- Corporate income tax revenue 

                as a share of all federal tax revenues has been falling for decades 

                -- from almost 14 percent in 1972 to less than 9 percent in 2001. 

                By 2000, U.S. corporations paid some of the lowest corporate taxes 

                in the developed world. Corporate taxes paid on profits generated 

                in the U.S. are now 22nd lowest out of 29 industrial countries 

                in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 

                -- The whole concept of double taxation is specious. We pay taxes 

                on income, and then we pay sales tax on purchases when we use 

                that income. Is that double taxation? Is it double taxation when 

                we pay our property taxes, utility taxes, gas taxes or any other 

                tax with the same income on which we have already paid income 

                taxes? We do get a deduction for some of these taxes on our income 

                taxes, but Bush is not proposing a deduction -- he's proposing 

                to eliminate taxation on dividend income altogether. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And the Bush 

                tax cuts won't do anything to stimulate the economy. Over 450 

                economists -- including 10 Nobel Prize winners -- have signed 

                a letter saying that the Bush tax cut plan will not provide a 

                short-term economic stimulus. In addition, it will worsen the 

                long-term budget outlook, reducing the government's ability to 

                finance Social Security, Medicare, investments in schools, health, 

                infrastructure and basic research. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans don't 

                want to take billions from the Social Security Trust Fund and 

                other critical priorities and use them for tax breaks for millionaires. 

                Yet, tax filers with an adjusted gross income of over $1,000,000 

                would get an average tax cut of $90,000 from the Bush "growth" 

                package -- while the middle 20 percent of the population would 

                get a tax cut of only $256. (Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center). 

                Thirty-one percent of the nation's taxpayers would get no benefit 

                from the Bush tax cuts; almost half (48 percent) would receive 

                less than $100. </font> 

                <p></p>

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The time has 

                come to say enough is enough. Congress must stand up and stop 

                this irresponsible Bush tax cut. For more information, please
