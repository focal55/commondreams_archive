- May 28 - Attempts by the United States 

administration to force Europe to accept Genetically Modified (GM) food 

and crops received a serious blow after Egypt announced that it would 

not be part of a World Trade Organisation challenge to the European 

Union's de facto moratorium on approving new GM licenses. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Egyptian Government says that it has taken its decision because it 

recognizes &quot;the need to preserve adequate and effective consumer and 

environmental protection.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 13 May the United States said that it would be joined by Argentina, Canada and Egypt in filing a World Trade Organisation (WTO) case against Europe over &quot;its illegal five-year moratorium on approving agricultural biotech products&quot; [1]. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the Egyptian Government says that it has decided &quot;not to become a 

party&quot; to the WTO complaint. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter [2] dated May 27 the Egyptian ambassador to the European 

Union wrote that &quot;The Government of Egypt took this decision in 

conscious emulation of the need to preserve adequate and effective 

consumer and environmental protection, and with the desire to reduce 

further distortions and impediments to international trade that may 

result due to the further pursuit of this matter within the WTO&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Europeans are concerned about the threat that GM crops pose to food, 

farming and the environment. There are also fears about the long-term health impacts from eating GM food. Opinion polls show that 70% of 

the European public don't want GM food and 94% want to be able to 

choose whether or not they eat it (Eurobarometer 2001).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth Europe's GM campaigner Geert Ritsema said:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're delighted that Egypt has withdrawn from this US attempt to force GM food and crops into Europe. Countries should be allowed to choose what they eat and what they grow in their fields. The United States should withdraw its WTO challenge, and stop trying to bully Europe over GMOs.&quot;</font></p>
